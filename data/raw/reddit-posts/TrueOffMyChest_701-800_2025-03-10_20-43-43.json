    "selftext": "I'm not sure where to post this, but I really need advice, that's why I made an account just fot this, because I'm starting to question my sanity. \n\nI recently started living alone in my first apartment. I'm extremely careful, I always lock the doors and windows at night, and I don't have any pets. I used to have occasional bouts of sleep paralysis during a stressful phase, but they were relatively \"harmless\" dark figures just staring at me, hearing weird noises etc.. But since I've lived here, it's different. \n\nNow I wake up several times a week in the middle of the night, completely paralyzed. I can only move my eyes, hear and feel. And every time I see this big, dark shadowy figure in my room. But it doesn't just stand in the corner. It slowly comes towards me. It pulls my blanket away, then my pants - and then it starts touching me in a way that feels far too real. \n\nIt starts touching me with its mouth.  It licks me, sucks me, as if it is completely obsessed with my vagina. And the most disturbing thing is: I feel EVERYTHING. Every detail. Much more intensely than any real, human contact I have ever had. It brings me to orgasm over and over until the sensations are so overwhelming that I pass out. And when I wake up in the morning, my blanket is actually at the foot of the bed or on the floor, my pants exactly where \"it\" threw them. \n\nFor the ones who wants to imagine it, the figure is black, shadowy, with glowing white eyes but sometimes they look red, and it is very large. It has a somewhat human shape, but also somehow not. There is a dark aura around it, like black smoke. The hands are very large, and the fingers are extremely long. The only thing I remember is that in one of my earlier sleep paralyses, years ago, I saw these hands or very similar looking hands, trying to grab me. But I was able to free myself from the paralysis in time, bec my sister suddenly came in my room and turned the lights on. Its mouth is not visible, but when it begins with the act, I can make out the outline of the mouth, and it has a very long tongue. You can then imagine where the tongue goes. It doesnt say anything or even talk to me.\n\nI know it might feel like a particularly realistic sleep paralysis, but how can things be moving in my room? I'm scared. It happens almost every night, and although it doesn't hurt, the thought that \"it\" might do more at some point scares me. What if it's not just a hallucination? \n\nAnd before anyone asks: No, I'm not desperate or lonely. I'm single right now, but I'm happy with it.  I don't miss anyone, feel \"untouched\" or crave closeness. I've had relationships in the past, but right now I'm enjoying my own life, so I understand even less why this is happening. But my biggest concern is that, deep down, I'm starting to enjoy it. There are moments when I catch myself thinking: Don't stop. Keep going. And that terrifies me even more. \n\nI have a disturbing theory: What if it isn't just a sleep paralysis? I know its not a dream, bec I'm fully awake, I'm just unable to move or make a sound. What if it is some kind of entity or demon that possessed me? I know how crazy this sounds, but if you were in my shoes\u2026 would you really rule it out? \n\nI feel like I can't talk to anyone about this. It's so humiliating, and the worst part is\u2026 what if it keeps coming to me every night until the day I die, bec I don\u2019t do anything about it? I'm desperate and conflicted because, as terrifying as it is, it also feels good. And I'm starting to crave it.  I don\u2019t think a real man could ever satisfy me again like this. \n\nI've tried to relax before sleep and I don't have any stress in life at the moment, but it still visits me almost every night. And like i said, I'm extremely embarrassed to talk to other people in real life because I've started to enjoy it and I don't have any money for fancy therapies. What if this continues for years? I feel everything and when I wake up in the morning my intimate area feels a bit numb and tingly as if someone had been fiddling with it, so it's not fake, it's really happening to me. I almost always pass out from all the orgasms. Being satisfied so intensely every night can be dangerous, right? Idk.\n\nHave any of you ever experienced something like this? Am I just crazy or is something going on here that I can\u2019t explain?",

    "selftext": "I (19M) hate women approaching me. Throughout my life, I was considered to be \u201cugly\u201d. I was told by multiple people and girls would treat me like dirt and constantly remind me I\u2019m ugly throughout my life. Over the past 2 years, I made a decision after being insulted brutally on a \u201cfriend\u201d app called Wizz (more like a dating app). I was really skinny and hence I decided to eat more and bulk up to gain some muscle mass as well as starting skincare and hopping on minoxidil for better hair quality for my facial hair, scalp hair and eyebrows too along with multiple other changes. Anyway, these 2 years increased my looks considerably to the point where I almost looked like a different human being. During this however my self esteem was still incredibly low. For the past few months, I noticed a girl that was constantly staring at me and I first thought oh she must think I\u2019m ugly hence she\u2019s staring. Later on she started laughing with her friend group while looking at me so I thought wow she must think I\u2019m extremely ugly. This was not new to me. More recently, she added me over Snapchat which she got from a friend of mine as I\u2019ve found out recently and she had a little conversation with me (I\u2019ll call her J). J sent a snap of herself and told me she had seen me around and that she really liked me. This however triggered me and I remembered the treatment I had received up until now, especially the treatment on Wizz. In that moment, I snapped and insulted the mole on her cheek as well as her forehead and told her I\u2019d have to be blind or in a coma for her to ever have a chance with me. This was quite recent. More recently, I\u2019ve had a female cashier give me a discount on some shopping I was doing to make a milk cake because I\u2019m \u201chandsome\u201d. It honestly disgusted me and I genuinely just left the shop without any of the ingredients. It hasn\u2019t been long since I\u2019ve become apparently \u201cattractive\u201d and I\u2019m getting a whole lot more attention from girls and I hate it. Fuck these girls. They treated me like shit for all these years when I was ugly and now they think they have a chance when I\u2019m \u201cattractive\u201d. Makes me want to punch them all in the face. I notice a lot of little changes in my daily interactions even with my family. It\u2019s revolting. ",

    "selftext": "For complete transparency I wrote this out first on wordpad (can post the original if requested) but since my grammar and wording is never great (learning disability) I ran it thru a AI grammar editor. The message and feelings are still mine as I re-read it to be 100% sure. Just thought you all should no.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI\u2019m writing this because it\u2019s been weighing on my mind for a long time. It keeps happening, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019m the common factor.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve wanted to make a difference in someone\u2019s life. In high school, I dreamed of becoming a teacher to help kids. At one point, I even considered becoming a doctor or a nurse to be there for people in their worst moments. But over the years, those dreams faded\u2014because every time I\u2019ve tried to help, things have ended the same way.\n\nIt seems like whenever someone needs emergency medical care and I step in to help, they don\u2019t make it.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# The Moments That Haunt Me\n\nOne of the first times this happened, I was around 18-20 years old. I was walking home from Walmart when I heard a crash. Looking over, I saw a motorcycle had been t-boned by a car, and the driver was on the ground. Without thinking, I ran toward him, weaving through traffic. I took his hand and spoke to him, trying to keep him calm while others applied pressure to his wounds. He handed me his phone and asked me to call a family member to let them know he was going to the hospital. I did exactly that, then gave the phone back to him. Soon after, paramedics arrived and took him away. Later, I read that he had died from his injuries. At the time, I didn\u2019t think much of it beyond the tragedy of the accident.\n\nA few years later, I was at home when my stepfather suddenly jumped up and said, \u201cCall an ambulance.\u201d We did, and while waiting, I ran upstairs to grab him a shirt as asked. I helped him put it on, talking to him, reassuring him that everything would be okay. The paramedics arrived and took him away. Shortly after, he went into heart failure and died.\n\nThen, a few years after that, I was living in an apartment building. One day, I glanced out the window out of boredom and saw my neighbors unloading groceries. Out of nowhere, the wife collapsed, and her husband barely caught her in time. I didn\u2019t hesitate\u2014I bolted out of my apartment without even locking the door, ran down the hallway, hit the elevator button, and after a few seconds of waiting, said, \u201cFuck it,\u201d and took the stairs. I got to them as fast as I could. Her husband was on the phone with paramedics while I held her, trying to comfort her as he gathered her meds and health cards. The building superintendent came out, just standing there, saying, \u201cShe\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d Just being completely useless . It took the paramedics over 30 minutes to arrive. The moment I stepped back to let them work, they had to use a defibrillator\u2014 there heart had stopped. She didn\u2019t make it.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# The Fear That Lingers\n\nThese are just a few of the moments that have left me feeling this way. I may add more as I remember them. But because of them, I feel like I can\u2019t help people\u2014because when I do, it only seems to end badly. I honestly have never had someone survive going to the hospital after I 'help'.\n\nIt\u2019s been about three years since I last experienced something like this, and I hope I never do again. But I\u2019m scared that if it happens again, I\u2019ll freeze up. That fear eats at me\u2014the fear that I won\u2019t be able to help, that I\u2019ll hesitate, that I\u2019ll fail someone when they need me most.\n\nI\u2019m shaking as I write this, scared of being judged, of being called a coward. But I needed to get this off my chest because it\u2019s been haunting me for far too long. I am shaking trying to hit the post button",

I'll probably delete this at some point after. \n\nI'm 27M and I'm a \"rent man\". Another term for what I do, is \"male escort\". But I live in a small, sleepy town, and we just don't call ourselves escorts.\n\nI decided to get into this because I needed some money to help me finish my degree. I'm also in good shape so I thought it would be an easy side hustle. I didn't/ don't have a partner and I haven't been interested in dating.\n\nBusiness is generally very slow. When I first started, I only had 1 client who I would visit every week. After that, she moved away and I had two more clients that I would see periodically. It was always a very clinical and mechanical experience (Get in, do what needs to be done, get out). \n\nThings were quiet for about a year and a half. I wasn't really providing services anymore. But a few months ago, I got a message on my profile from a lady who was interested in my services. She was just reaching out, asking how it works.\n\nWe spoke for a bit and we decided to meet up. My services are customisable and she selected a variation of the \"boyfriend experience\". \n\nI went to her house and I was... Surprised? She had a really nice place. In a rich neighbourhood. I'm sure this might not be out of the ordinary for other male escorts but my previous clients weren't situated in rich neighbourhoods. I didn't grow up rich. \n\nShe was very welcoming. She was a few years older than me. She seemed to have a successful career. We sat in the living room and just talked. She told me that she's had sex for her whole adult life, and she's enjoyed it for the most part. But she's had some kind of sexual awakening recently and she's looking for someone to explore this with. She said she doesn't even care if we didn't have sex that night. She wanted to talk to make sure that we would be a good fit for what she had in mind, and if I was okay with it. That was also a first for me. My previous clients didn't really care what I was okay with. \n\nAnyway. Lots has happened since then. I see her maybe once every two weeks. And it's always an incredible experience. I can't explain it. Sometimes we have sex. Sometimes we dont. Sometimes we eat pizza and watch movies, sometimes we drink and have sex. It's so passionate. Sometimes it's primal. Sometimes it's lazy and intense. It's not the mechanical sex that I'm used to. She truly turns me on. She likes it when I'm satisfied. \n\nSometimes we just talk and nothing else. I've opened up to her about my life. She pays me every time. I've even started insisting that she doesn't need to. But she believes in me and my future and wants to support me in finishing my degree. \n\nThe problem is, I no longer see this as a professional relationship. I really like her. And she seems to really care about me, as a person.  We know so much about each other but I feel so weird to say that we're friends... She pays me for my time so are we really friends? \n\nAnd sometimes I let my mind wander... What if we were more?\n\nShe's quite an incredible woman. And we've had many deep conversations. She's been through a lot. \n\nOne of the topics that came up was her previous relationships. Because I was wondering why she would approach a service, instead of exploring this with perhaps, a romantic partner? And I guess, long story short, she was in a relationship with a man who absolutely destroyed her. She no longer trusts people enough to share her life with. \n\nShe wants to be alone. Forever. But she desperately wants to explore her sexual side. I guess that's where I come in. \n\nBy the way. I know who this man is. It's a small town. F*ck you for what you did. You had such a great woman. What's wrong with you?\n\nI haven't heard from her in a while. And I desperately want to reach out to her. I'm trying not to lose myself in this situation. I keep telling myself, she's just my client and nothing more. This is just me doing my job. But I know that I feel a certain way. Unfortunately, I don't think she'll ever see me as anything more. ",

We don't talk for ages since I don't speak much with others in lessons and they kept wandering off with my other friend. Meanwhile another one of my friends who organised the hangout trip is slowly losing patience with friend A and B because they keep ditching her when leaving to buy lunch which also kinda ticks me off because Its getting hard not to see a pattern forming\n\n Distance grows, I dont do much about it since I attributed it to something else entirely and wanted to give them space (this is around 2 months back). We still don't talk properly. They ghost me starting from around a month ago and don't talk to me in person or respond to my texts. \n\nEventually I ask to meet up and talk about it and they agree. When asking them, they say the reason why is that I don't really talk to them, kept moving away whenever they sat near, compared their skills to another person's even though they're the same grade, made snide comments, people who're friends with me aren't nice to them etc.\n\nI don't remember a ton of this and while some of it is probably coincidence (moving away from them), there's a solid chance that some of it IS stuff I've done. I can be pretty horrible sometimes, especially when I'm not doing so well mentally and I'm so angry with myself that I crashed a friendship with someone I cared about over crap communication and my own assholery. I wish I could say that I atleast know where I went wrong, but I *can't* since I don't remember the whole bloody thing happening. Another of my friends has distanced themselves from my current group to join another group with this person and I can't tell whether they actually want to remain friends with me, or if it's just because they can't bring themselves to stop talking with me entirely. There's also the chance that their negative impression of me is creating a negative impression of everyone associated with me AND that I'm 90% sure their new friends keep talking shit about me since they all go quiet whenever I get too close (although there could be any random thing they're talking about). To top this all off, I'm not even sure if my own friends enjoy my presence and I feel myself drifting from them (although this part is probably in my head and a reflection of current circumstances)\n\nTLDR: I hate myself, my friend hates me, their new friends hate me, I can't tell if another friend hates me and my current friends might hate me. It's been a long week. I'm sick. And tired. ",

Most of it was due to having undiagnosed disorders and the rest was due to family issues. The symptoms flared towards the end of 2019 when I moved in with my sister while in university.\n\nI don't want to get into so many details but I have had thoughts of su**ide since high school and they came strong during that period. My parents were arguing a lot during lockdown which worsened my DP/DR because I had to shield my younger siblings from being caught up in the mess.\n\nI ended up thinking of death so frequently that I couldn't sleep at night. Some days I would stay up until midnight just to celebrate seeing the next day. I tried to get my parents to help but mom refused saying that I would get over it. I had yo write several suicide letters for them to agree.\n\nThe second therapist paid attention and had me sign No Suicide contracts and one psychiatrist attempted to talk to me telling me to think of how other people would feel after a final diagnosis of MDD. I tried to keep busy with extra courses after graduating and looking for jobs. I even tried spirituality and manifesting to get my mind to a better position.\n\nI have no interest in anything. I don't want to do anything. I have no job, no money, no friends, no one to talk to. I was a foodie and now I eat because it has been a routine. Music is just filling a void when it gave dopamine.

    "selftext": "Yup you read the title.\n\nSo my birthday was a little while ago, it was my 20th and honestly I was pretty damn depressed for it. Didn't have a lot of friends to celebrate with and was basically alone, and it felt(still feels) really weird not being a 'kid' anymore. \n\nI decided to treat myself to a beach day, both to go romp around and also cause I needed some driftwood for an aquarium I was setting up. I have no car though, so had to take the bus to get up which had a very inconvenient schedule. \n\nSo I got to the beach, found some sticks and got so distracted that I unfortunately missed the bus pick up. \n\nNow there was another bus coming in a couple hours, and I could always call a ride too if needed. So I decided that, now that I was here for at least a couple hours, I might as well do some more exploring. This particular beach stretched for 3 miles north up to another beach, where on the other side there was a small resturant. I was pretty hungry at this point, so thought it'd be fun to walk up there and catch  bus later that evening at that spot instead. \n\nSo I cruised up the beach, and got some really great views of the clouds and sinking sun along the way. I eventually got to the cutoff to where the other beach started; however, while the map only portrayed a small stream separating them, by now the ride had come in and that tiny stream was basically a river. \n\nAfter scouring the area for a bridge or easier way across, I stupidly chose to wade through a shallower point, which worked and I made it to the other side of the beach, soggy but triumphant. I had no change of clothes in my pack. \n\nSo after drying off a tiny bit I walked up to the resturant, and when I got inside I realized this wasn't just some little beach shack, it was a full on fancy ass resturant. My belly was roaring though, so I decided to give it a try. \n\n I asked for outdoor seating for obvious reasons, and was really surprised to see them setting the table with fancy cloths and a bunch of different forks and silverware and shit. I ordered crabcakes and some jumbo shrimp which were the cheapest things there, but combined still cost a whopping $70. They eventually bring out two tiny, barely palm sized, pencil-thin crab patties and 5 individual finger length shrimp, both elaborately decorated in the middle of these giant white plates. For the cost of it all I was half convinced I'd be able to keep the plates too. \n\nI kept getting odd looks from the other diners, who were almost all either in pairs or groups. I was the only lone person there. Not to mention still pretty soggy, dressed like a casual vagabond and with my backpack as my only companion in the opposite chair. Yeah, I stuck out like a giddamned giraffe in a horse ranch. \n\nEventually I finished up and caught the bus back home, where I promptly went to sleep. \n\nHappy 20th birthday bud, there's $70 bucks you ain't getting back and an experience you'll cherish for all the wrong reasons. \n\n",

    "selftext": "I\u2019m 23 years old and I work in Mental Health. My life is mental health. I don\u2019t leave the house often, I am on anti-depressants and I work way too much. Life has actually gotten way better recently. From not knowing what I want to do with my life to being so close to going to a world renowned university to train in to become a Nurse in two specialities. I\u2019m finally getting where I need to be. I\u2019m finally getting sleep, I leave the house a little bit more and I am well liked at work and seen as an asset. My anti depressants have solved a life long period of uncontrollable lows and self-neglect yet I am not fully there where I can begin improving myself.\n\nI\u2019m still obese, I\u2019m still balding and I\u2019m still ugly objectively. But I\u2019m proud of myself I am on cusp of greatness and yet at night I still question what I\u2019m even doing this for, yeah my ego is now bloated but my family are no longer In this swirl of poverty, I will not be able to lift them out of it. My brother and sister are in good places in life and my mother is no longer struggling. There are times I find myself truly at peace. \n\nBut there is this deep loneliness within me. It\u2019s a weakness, I can\u2019t help it and it\u2019s selfish but I want someone to love, and to love me. I can\u2019t help it I thought losing weight might help which it didn\u2019t, neither didn\u2019t overwhelming myself with hobbies and spending time with friends and family. I think truly after so many years I can\u2019t ignore my minds call to want someone to not just see me as a good friend. I want to be more than just needed. I\u2019m needed at work I\u2019m great at what I do but that is. I thing on the feeling of truly being wanted, laying upon eyes of someone who sees you for who you really are. I want someone to share little secrets with, to spend time with and devote myself to.\n\nI want to leave work one day knowing that I\u2019m not just coming to an empty house. It\u2019s so selfish to think I\u2019m entitled this but why not me? Is my personality screwed, it\u2019s my looks, my mannerisms? I get along fine with everyone I\u2019m really social at work and even outside of work barring my current situation but that for another reason.\n\nDo I just reek desperation? Am I unlovable? The answer is no I was loved once maybe even two more times but those relationships could not hold it bring questions to my head once more.\n\nI\u2019m going work my ass off it\u2019s just what I do. I\u2019ll spend my life helping others and caring for the vulnerable, being the person I wish I had in my life when I struggled. But at the end of the day I just don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing this for? The further my career goes forward I am scared that I\u2019ll become the guy who says I\u2019m married to work when I damn well know I want a family. \n\nEitherway I wish something changes soon. I don\u2019t want to be alone forever. \n\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Good morning yall! A couple days ago I made a post at 3 in the morning to confess to doing my roommates dishes because I secretly love to watch her do a happy dance when she sees her favorite mug is clean for her to use again. That post changed our lives and I'm only being a little dramatic by saying that.\n\nI gotta say thanks to everyone who upvoted and commented on my original post, I'm still shook at just how many people read about me and my mug happy best friend. The amount of people saying my post made them smile or reminded them of their own friendships or significant others has kept me smiling for days. I'm kind of into making people happy, if that wasnt already obvious, so the fact that so many people had even a moment of positivity because of me has been awesome.\n\nWhen I made that original post it was because I just wanted to tell someone about the mug dancing but I knew Gwen wouldn't like it if I told anyone we knew so I came to reddit to shout to the void and oh boy, did the void shout back. There were so many comments asking if I really thought we were just friends, and I'll be honest when I made that post we absolutely were just friends. We had never talked about being more than friends and I was happy being friends because we have an amazing friendship. I hadn't really thought about there being a possibility for more because dating was always something I planned to do when I had my life together or when I had more money. I never let myself consider what I was missing out on by waiting for the \"right time.\" Her finding my post opened up the chance for Gwen and I to talk about things that we hadn't before and over breakfast that morning we found where we stood with each other and what we thought things could look like moving forward depending on what we both agreed was the best course. We didn't make any solid plans or decisions and didn't want to rush into something that would ruin the good we already had going for us, but I'll admit I was hoping for a specific outcome.\n\nThere was one comment on that first post that had really caught my attention. To paraphrase, they told me to think about how I would feel if someone else got to see Gwen do her happy mug dance instead of me and it hit me so hard. I didn't mind the idea of someone else seeing her so happy. I just dont know if anyone she dates would notice what I did and decide to do what I did. What if they didn't care or didn't think it was that important or any of the other things I do to make her laugh or smile. I really didn't like the thought of not being there to make sure she has that extra reason to smile in the morning. (Gwen wants me to admit that I'm a sappy moron because I teared up writing this. Im a sensitive man in touch with my emotions and you know you love it so shut it you \ud83d\ude1d.)\n\nTo all the people saying it's possible for platonic relationships to be like ours you are absolutely correct. Our friend group is very open with physical and verbal affection and we help each other all time with big and small things. We all say I love you to each other, it's just normal communication for us as a group, not just between Gwen and I. Honestly, if I hadn't made my original post I'm not sure when or if we would have gotten to the point we are now. Maybe we would have continued as we were and that would have been just as happy of an outcome, just a different one, like a choose your own adventure with multiple options for a good resolution.\n\nWhich brings me to the actual update. Gwen and I agreed we want to try dating. We aren't putting a new label on our relationship yet, but our first date is next week. I'm making it all a surprise. Gwen helped write this post and will be reading the comments so I can't give any details, but it's going to be the best first date she has ever been on, or I'll eat my candy corn patterned socks. I think she might be the one for me and I'm going to take every chance I can to make sure she thinks the same about me.\n\nYall are the best and we love you. Do something kind for your loved ones for us and everyone can and should find something to happy dance about, it makes life more fun.\n\nLove Gwen and Peter \ud83e\ude77\ud83d\udd78",

I felt we had a positive and productive conversation, but it all started because she got mad that I washed the rice for a certain dish.\n\nShe's also recently got upset with me over a project she asked me to tackle, just assembling a lamp we bought at the store. I made the mistake of trying to screw in a screw that had a defect and got stuck. She wasn't screaming or anything, but she was upset that I tried to use it anyway. I got it out and replaced it and the lamp turned out well.\n\nShe has childhood trauma to do with strict parents who would severely punish her if she didn't do things the exact way they wanted and so I think she gets stressed when something isn't going to plan.\n\nI feel like an idiot when these sort of things happen. They're such simple mistakes, easily avoided and yet I make them.\n\nShe's also been stressed with her kitten that still needs to get spayed, she's been in heat alot and she yells at the cat when she won't be quiet. I think this isn't right and have tried gently mentioning that her cat is just doing what cats do and she needs to try and ignore her.\n\nI made a larger mistake the other day when I asked to try her THC vape. She said that beginners should always be in a safe place and try to relax. I asked in jest \"do I feel safe here?\" And she asked the same. I thought about it a bit and promptly got distracted by other thoughts. I have ADHD and sometimes this sort of thing happens. I'm still ashamed of it because when I realized I trailed off and said \"I do feel safe here\" She made a a comment stating \"That took a long time for you to figure out\" I didn't respond, I knew I got distracted and I started silently panicking thinking, \"I do feel safe here but nothing I say now will convince her. I wouldn't have tried the THC if I didn't, I wouldn't leave my knife at home if I didn't, I wouldn't be with her if I didn't\" but I gave some lame excuse about thinking too deeply about it and tried to laugh it off.\n\nI feel like an idiot. She makes me happy. She's important to me. I'm worried that her trauma will drive us apart. I don't know what to do to work through this.",

I dont know why anyone believed that since I did get missgendered quite often and literally only corrected the people with a hey sorry it is actually him or sth.   \nOne kid in particular seemed to have it out for and said some homphobic stuff though he only did it when I wasnt present (others snithed) or he thought I wouldnt hear him. He actually once ran up to me while carrying a knife. A joke. surrrreeee My class loved jokes. They would act as if they were jerking off in the back of the room or say something rather loudly etc when I held presentations. I always went to the teachers and asked for help. No one ever helped me. Some wanted to but had to catch them in the act which wasnt that easy and the other teachers didnt seem to care enough. Though every adult always reassured me that I would be fine and nothing would happen to me.   \nI wasnt the easiest kid to be around since I literally learned how to be nice in 10th grade and sucked a great deal before and during that learning. But I was always willing to reflect and talk about my misstakes. \n\nI am now in a much better place. Everyone respects me and I feel comfortable learning again. Though I am starting to feel angry that this extreme behaviuor was ever permitted and given space at that school. I love some of my teachers they were the kindest people I ever met and helped me greatly. Others not so much. Bullying really sucks and I needed to get this off my chest",

    "selftext": "I (25M) got this gorgeous girl\u2019s number at a bar last Saturday; she and I had this amazing and absolutely fluid conversation before I invited her and her friend to join my table, where my friends sat. It was extremely enjoyable, and she and I were flirting back-and-forth (mind you I\u2019ve hardly flirted with anyone since my ex cheated on me sometime ago). \n\nBefore she and her friend left for another bar, I asked for her number, but I quickly told her: \u201cIf you\u2019re not comfortable with it, you really don\u2019t have to. I just think you\u2019re cute and witty and I\u2019d love to talk to you more.\u201d She replies with, and this made my smile like an idiot, \u201cI\u2019m not uncomfortable at all. I was waiting for you to ask.\u201d\n\nGot her number, wish her a great rest of her night, and we separate to our respective friend groups. Then, I text her the following afternoon, and since then we\u2019ve had these fantastic, flirty, and personal conversations. \n\nHere\u2019s the issue: She doesn\u2019t text back too often. Let me preface this by saying, I know people get busy or preoccupied or even forget to text others back, but I\u2019m talking hours on hours without a response from her. When she does, she immediately reciprocates my energy and the conversation returns to being wonderful.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an attempt of mine to gripe, all things considered. I just find myself feeling like a high school with a crush again, she genuinely makes me grin like a fool and fills my stomach with butterflies. More than anything, I want to talk to her. \n\nOf course I busy myself while she isn\u2019t responding and try not to think too hard on it while I\u2019m occupying myself, but I really pray she texts back soon. I\u2019m tempted to ask her to FaceTime, if she\u2019s cool with it, because of how greatly I want to keep talking to her.",

    "selftext": "I still wish he would come back, don't get me wrong... That hasn't disappeared just yet and I suspect it won't for a little bit.\n\n\nI started doing dance classes again and my first couple of classes were hard. I hadn't danced in awhile, and the emotions were still heavy. In fact, I went home and bawled in my roommates arms because I was just hit with memories of my favorite routine of chatting with you after class, and looking forward to being with you online when I got home. But the drive was hard, and not quiet since I had a comfort song blasting and me just yelling into the car how much I loved you and what an idiot you are to walk away.\n\n\nI had another class just yesterday and I felt incredibly good doing it since it was a familiar choreo. I smiled. I was proud of myself. I laughed with my friends. And when I got out, I felt angry...\n\n\nI was angry because I disliked how you made me feel hurt, unseen, invalidated,  and frightened during our breakup. Angry that you decided to give up. I'm not going to try to convince you to stay, so okay, I'll go. Especially since you'd do that explosive reaction again with the justification being you had no choice to in order to be heard. Ya know, my counselor said that's what people who do the abuse in abusive relationships say. \n\"If only she didn't do [trigger], then I wouldn't of [hit/screamed/throw/etc.] her.\" I know you're not abusive though. I know you're flawed and that response is something you can work on if you recognize it to be. I wanted to do that with you. I wanted to work me. On us. But no, you gave up and walked away.\n\n\nAnd although I know we had good times, I now notice a lot more things in our relationship that weren't that great. Things I wish a partner would do for me. The slow roll into complacency. How I feel fooled being charmed by you. That I tell you how I feel when I'm in some mood is not your responsibility to fix, and to please let me figure out how to make myself feel better and I'll tell you. But no, you make yourself take responsibility anyways and feel bad about yourself and frustrated at me when you can't \"solve it\" right away. What the hell?! Don't you listen?! And I tell you my love language is words of affirmation and I barely hear any compliments from you. I don't remember the last time you called me beautiful or cute. I don't ever remember you telling me you appreciate me unless I ASK or do it first by giving you all my words of praise. If you're proud of me or happy I'm yours. I said those things to you all the time! The random \"I Love You\"'s because I feel it in that moment. Things I brought up I'd like to do but it gets overlooked and forgotten, and then you get mad at me when I try to remind you, and more angry when I'm sad you don't remember. And how I see you were also not telling me things that made you irritated and let build up, but fault me for being the only one who does it.\n\n\nI also told you I'm scared you'd talk to me like you talk to your parents. You gave me that \"wtf\" face like you'd never. And yet there you were screaming at me, assaulting me with words trying to blame me and all your \"what about you?!\" arguments. Also how we agreed to disagree early on in a convo before our fight that giving someone the same energy they give you is a choice and can be potentially hazardous in a relationship. Especially during an argument. Communication is important, but what's the point when you assume your partner is intentionally attacking you when it's anything but?! I should've known better. I should've known when I saw those signs. \n\n\nYou're so frustrating. How did I deal with all that?!\nAnd you know what's more frustrating?! IT'S ALL SOLVABLE. They were things we could work on. Things we could put out onto the table, talk about our grievances, and set out a plan to address them. I think at one time I said maybe we should see a Couple's counselor to better understand  each other, but that was swept aside. \n\n\n\nI know I can be frustrating too. I know it do things that make you mad. But no one deserves to be treated the way you treat me during arguments. You once brought out something in me that made me hate myself in an argument. All because it was so heightened and just not healthy because I was trying to match your energy. I hated it. I dont like being so angry I'd say things I regret and would hate myself for later, along with the fact I'm sure it hurts you! Why would you want that dynamic?! Why are you okay with that?! It's unhealthy! How did it feel when I said I felt hurt, attacked, and frustrated like you but didn't want to scream or escalate things so I cried instead?! You probably thought I was pathetic...\n\n\nAnd so fine... Go find someone else who can match your energy without feeling shitty about themselves and about hurting you. Find someone who argues the same way you do and see how disrespectful, exhausting, and hurtful it is. Because that's not what I want. ",

    "selftext": "I\u2019m not sure if this is the right sub, but i need an outlet to post this anonymously \n\n\n\nwhen i was 14, my brother passed away suddenly. he was born with HLHS -Hypoplastic left heart syndrome which is a rare congenital heart defect in which the left side of the heart is severely underdeveloped. He had many surgeries as a child, which i won\u2019t get in to, but the important thing to note is that from the ages of 7-18 he was physically fine. sure, he sweat a lot, and slept more the most teens,  but nothing extreme. \n\nin February 2020 he got sick, his livers started failing, he would faint randomly, and when they got it checked out it turn out he was in heart failure. \nhowever, he started taking new meds and was seemingly improving.\n\none night at the beginning of March, he and my sister had a baking contest, and both made desserts. we tasted them and ranked them, his chocolate mousse won by a landslide. \ni had the grand idea of putting whipped cream on the back of my hand and hitting it into the air and the trying to catch it in my mouth. me and my siblings all tried it and my brother laughed so hard his face turned blue. it was a night filled of laughter and jokes. that\u2019s the last time i saw him\u2026alive. \n\nthe next morning both of my parents went out to work, which was unusual because my mother works from home and was my brothers primary caregiver, i stayed home from school for a reason i can\u2019t remember now. \n\nat around 10am my father called me to check on my brother who wasn\u2019t answering his phone, and to make sure he takes his meds. while still on the phone with my dad, i go to my brothers room, when i walk the smell hits me like a ton of bricks, but my father was rushing me, so I tiptoe over to his bed and i see him with his eyes rolled back and mouth slightly agape, i tried to shake him but his skin was cold and that\u2019s what i noticed his arms were a deep shade bluish purple- i told my dad to call the EMTs because my brother was not waking up. i remember drinking water, unlocking the door, and waiting in the living room. \nemts burst through the door, professional looking people running in and out of our small apartment. and then the rush slowed down i wasn\u2019t informed on much and i was nervous to interfere. now there are more professional people running in and out with my small apartment , although now some were patiently waiting for my father to arrive , and since my mum wasn\u2019t answering her phone, oblivious to her only sons passing, all i could do is wait.\ni remember feeling awkward and unsure of what to do with all these personnel in my home, so i just kept offering everyone water and snacks- but they would just look at me with sad eyes and politely decline. \n\nI was only 14 so there were some issues of them telling me things but after about an hour, while My Father was on his way, a kind  man with a thick southern drawl sat me down. he informed me that my brother had passed away by the looks of it he had already been gone for quite some time.\n\nI responded with an understanding nod. \ni didn\u2019t cry.\nI remember when My Father came home, hearing the news and holding back tears, I let the professionals do the talking while I sat in my room, my Father joined me, and I held his hands while the police questioned us. \n \nI\u2019ll never forget the whale of agony my sister let out when she got home and heard the news. \n\nthe rest of the day is a blur. his funeral was the next day and rained and hailed so hard, my shoes were soaked through to my socks.\n\nI had a complicated relationship with my brother, but at the very least, I\u2019m glad that he died at home in the comfort of his own bed and not in a hospital bed hooked up to machines and wires - he hated the hospital.\n\nit\u2019s so incredibly hard and painful especially \nsince five years ago was a different world. He passed away right before Covid lockdown started happening. it feels like i knew him a lifetime ago.\n sometimes I forget his face and struggle remember what he looks like and it scares me because it\u2019s only been five years and ,statistically speaking, I have around 70 more years to go . \nevery family event is painful, all days of celebration and holidays are surrounded with this dark cloud -that feeling that there\u2019s someone that isn\u2019t here ,that should be here. \n\n\nI hope this post is coherent -i\u2019m after a long day at work.\nfeel free to ask anything in the comment if anything needs clarification.",

    "selftext": "Throwaway account because my brother follows my main account and I don't want him finding this. Sorta long post, so beware. And English isn't my first language - I hope it's not too bad.\n\nSo recently, my parents passed away, both my mom and dad. it's still kinda hard to believe that they are really gone. I'm 17 years old, so it's been a bit rough for me.\n\nMy parent's relationship had never been good. My dad was a serial cheater, I don't know the full details but I know he had a bunch of mistresses and constantly slept with other younger women, he might even have other children... My mom always knew this apparently, but never left because she was only a high-school graduate with no prospects for a job to provide for us. \n\nI had told her to leave, but I knew it was fruitless.\n\nRecently, they'd been fighting so much, to the point where it was unbearable. In the entirety last year and even this year there was constant arguments in my home. They would have screaming matches and fights, I would always hear banging and yelling, I could barely sleep at night because of their fights. They've broken so much stuff in the house, doors, the TV, I've stepped on glass shattered glass before after a bad fight.\n\nThere was not much I could do but to just endure it and try to focus on my studies, i couldn't intervene, and i was forbidden from telling anyone. We also had a bunch of financial problems. I'm at a point in my life where I need to focus heavily on my education and make sure to get good grades, but the stress of it all was making it impossible. My mom would constantly pressure me to get good grades and I really tried to get good grades but I just can't, i really tried my best.\n\nI was mentally and physically exhausted. I was under alot of stress because of all of this, I literally just wanted to die so i didn't have to deal with it anymore. it felt like my own home wasn't home anymore and that I couldn't find peace anywhere. They would try to rope me into their fights and it just stressed me out more, I really couldn't do a thing about it. My physical health was depleting rapidly, I was gaining weight, I was always sick, always tired, I wasn't getting enough sleep.\n\nAlso my brother lives abroad, he has a job and a house and everything, and my mum for some reason doesn't wanna tell him ALL the details (he knew some stuff, but not to the extent that I did) so I was all alone in this. \n\nAnyway, almost 2 months ago I remember my parents had a huge fight, they broke the TV again, and it literally lasted all night, I couldn't sleep AT ALL. After that my dad went to work in the morning and didn't come home till like 12am. that same night my mom had come to my room and talked to me and told me that she knows how much I suffer, and she told me to study hard so that I can get out of here, and she gave me a hug, she hasn't hugged me or touched me since idk so I was just sorta stiff and didn't say anything.\n\nIn the morning I had school, so I went, I was really tired and slept through my entire econ class... at some point, during another class, the supervisor called me to her office, and when I went there, my homeroom teacher, the principal, and my aunt (my dad's sister) were there.. I knew what happened immediately.\n\nMy parents had gotten into a car accident and died in the hospital during surgery. The police think it was a suicide, but I don't really wanna know.\n\nSince I'm a minor, and still in school (I still have a year left, I'll be in 12th grade soon), my dad's sister took me in but his other siblings also visit me often, I don't have any contact with my mum's side. Living with my aunt and uncle has been okay, though I don't feel much at home. After I'm done with school and my A-levels (no i am not from the UK), I'll be moving to the US, where my brother lives. I already have a visa and scholarship.\n \nI recently went to a psychiatrist where I was told that I have severe depression and anxiety and BPD.\n\nI didn't see their dead bodies because I didn't have the courage, and I couldn't cry at the funeral, because I felt so... numb? after all that happened, I didn't know how to feel at all. I cried after I came home, all of it felt like overwhelming. I feel like a horrible person for not grieving enough, but idk what else to feel, I don't want to tell my brother yet.\n\nI've just been trying to study for my final exams soon, it's this year and I need to finish revising. I try to play games too, but I don't really have much energy. My friends from school have been very supportive and kind.\n\nAnyway, that's all I guess, I know it's really long, but I just wanted to ramble, because other than my really close online friend, I haven't told anyone.

I know it's not my fault but I blame myself. I'm scared she might become or is suicidal like my sister was. My sister was in the hospital for mental health a few times and this first started when I was younger. She threatened to cut her hand off the night I was supposed to sleep in hee room. (BTW she is 5 years older than me). I blame myself for that too. I am not suicidal or do self harm or depressed. I don't have a therapist but I used to due to bullying which I no longer deal with. I Don t have many friends that's something I've always had in life. I have I tight group of friends but I feel like I'm a bad friend. I feel like my classmates don't like me because I smell bad due to me not showing enough even tho I try too or am weird and I consider English as my first language but I've lived in a French speaking countrie my entire life and I feel like my speaking in French isn't good but they don't know that so they just think I'm a weirdo who can't speak or even read properly ( I'm dyslexic).

I feel like I live day to day trying to repese these feelings and live life and tell myself everything is going to be fine but I m scared for the future.

I'm very self conscious of my athleticism, I'm not at all flexible or strong or fast and my stamina is horrible.

I know that the person reading this will probably see this feel bad for a bit or just don't care at all and forget about it. I know this is probably just a scream in to the void but I just want to be heard and loved. My family loves me but I feel like it's not enough.\n\nPlease just tell me I'm not a bad person. And if I am, just tell me.\n\n This is just something I needed to get off my chest.

    "selftext": "tldr: My mom's friend helped me through a tough time and get into college. We got really close and we've been hooking up since. No one knows.\n\nShe worked with my mom. They grew close over the years and became even closer the summer before I left for college because my parents were going through a nasty divorce. She threw me a birthday party when my parents were too busy fighting in court to remember. She made a big effort to be there for my mom and by proxy she was also there for me. We grew close because she would bring over dinner (and eat with me), drive me places, pick me up and bring me home, and even helped me with school. My mom picked up another job to help pay for the divorce lawyer so she was gone a lot. She helped me prepare for my college interviews, wrote me references, and connected me with people she knew. Most nights she'd feed me dinner, clean up, and make sure I was home instead of out partying, then lock up our house and sometimes sleep there on the couch or my moms bed until my mom got home.\n\nI always was attracted to her since she was younger than my mom, but still had that fit work out milf type of look. I would check her out often and even use her as the focal point of my masturbation. It got to the point where I snuck into her laundry basket a few times to check out her used lingerie.\n\nWe grew closer and talked about sex. It started from her giving me advice on navigating the dating world and a \"girls\" perspective. I felt comfortable with her helping me figure out these social situations since she is young and attractive, I just figured she understood. I complained about girls, friends, anxiety. She was a great listener and I would love receiving comforting hugs from. her. I would always get aroused from talking with her about things. One night when we hugged she felt my hard arousal accidentally press up against her, but nothing happened.\n\nMy fantasy was just that, a fantasy until I went to college. My parents were still dragging the divorce out so she graciously helped me shop, pack, and even dropped me off. It was only 45 mins away from home, I wanted to go further away, but I'm just lucky to even get into college with all the stress. Her texts were often and short, so it wasn't unusual for us to be casual with each other. One night I got really drunk and texted her pretty late thinking she wouldn't get it until later in the morning. I mentioned how I thought about her during random hook ups or masturbation. Well to my surprise she replied and we engaged in a little back and forth. This happened a few times over the course of my first semester and I did try to push the flirting boundaries when we talked about intimate things. It usually started with reminders for me to practice safe sex and then lead to talking about sex in general. I could tell she was really careful about being intimate with me. A few times it slipped into flirty territory.\n\nThere was a blizzard as everyone was leaving for winter break. I could have taken the train, but I texted her that I didn't have a ride home because I wanted to spend time with her.\u00a0It was late and the storm was pretty bad by the time she dropped me off. She insisted that she'd come in and make me dinner. At some point a bottle of wine was consumed. She mentioned that my mom was working until 10pm that night so she stayed up with me to watch a movie. We ended up talking about all the things that happened that semester and I admitted to her her my lack of confidence with girls. I joked that if only I could get some practice in real life instead of watching porn I could find the clit.\n\nWell one thing led to another and we spent a lot of break together. Since coming back to school, she's been driving here and getting a hotel for us once a week. I'm afraid that I won't like girls my age anymore after this and that she's making it so fun and easy that I'm not making an effort to meet girls my age. Not really sure what to do, but needed to get this off my chest. It's just nice having someone to have sex with so easily instead of putting in effort to flirt, play games, go out drinking and risking being with a random girl.",

    "selftext": "I\u2019ve worked with this woman for about 4 years. We\u2019ve traveled together on business several times. I\u2019ve always been a pretty shy guy, but am especially cautious when socializing with women I work with. I try to be myself but not act in a manner such that they could feel uncomfortable (basically I\u2019m afraid of flirting because I want to be a good human being and also keep my job). \n\nWhen I\u2019m with this woman it\u2019s pretty chill. We chat about our travels and places we want to go. She occasionally tells me very personal things, one time she randomly told me she had an IUD after we were just sitting in silence for a few seconds. \n\nAnyway I think she\u2019s great. She\u2019s very smart and successful. We both make 140k+ at basically the same job. She owns her own house but I\u2019m not quite there yet. She\u2019s funny, cute, and very fashionable. The little things like the way she paints her nails (neat like a professional does them for her on the daily) and wears her hair are so unique and attractive. \n\nSometimes things feel fantasy like when we\u2019re traveling together. We might both reach for the temperature controls in the car at the same time because the AC is too cold and touch hands. We say the same things at the same time and have the same thoughts when a random event happens in front of us. \n\nSometimes she would say interesting things like \u201cif it was appropriate I\u2019d invite you to stay at my house\u201d because the office is far for me and close to her. Or if I talked about moving she\u2019d get excited and joke that I could be her neighbor. I always wondered if she was attracted to me, but she shows mixed signals. She\u2019s a very smart woman so it\u2019s possible she thinks the same way I do and doesn\u2019t want to jeopardize her career. She\u2019s had boyfriends on and off and I\u2019m not even sure what her current status is. \n\nI feel like in an alternate reality we would be the perfect couple. But in this reality we\u2019ll just be coworkers who live a couple hours apart. It\u2019s frustrating. I\u2019ve never been sexually active before because I\u2019m waiting for someone who electrifies me as much as she does to truly desire me, and to be in the right situation for it. That\u2019s hard to find. \n\nTLDR; just a dumb man crushing on a coworker \n\nUpdate: I don\u2019t think I can ask her out. Messaged her at work today to ask how things have been and the conversation felt one sided. I can\u2019t deal with the humiliation, embarrassment, and fear of her getting freaked out by me doing so ",

    "selftext": "Over the past few months, I've had talking stages and situationships with six guys. After a while, they all asked for nudes, and some even threatened to leave me if I didn\u2019t send them. I knew it wasn\u2019t right, but I kept sending them anyway, without really thinking about the consequences. I kept convincing myself that maybe it would be different this time, that maybe they would care about me, but deep down I knew I was making a mistake. Once I sent them, I immediately felt disgusted with myself. The shame hit me hard, and I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what I\u2019d done. I felt like I had given away something of myself, something I couldn\u2019t get back, and it made me feel empty and worthless. I just wanted to feel wanted and loved, but now it feels like I\u2019ve only been used. Long story short, they all left me\u2014some blocked me, others ghosted me without a word. I know I should have stopped after the first guy, but I was so desperate for affection that I ignored my own worth and let myself get caught up in it. I feel so small and discarded now. Looking back, I\u2019m filled with regret, and I can't shake the feeling that I was taken advantage of. The shame eats me alive, and I\u2019m constantly terrified that my pictures are out there somewhere, being shared without my consent. It haunts me. I sent nudes to all six guys, and each time, I convinced myself it would lead to something real, but in the end, they all left, and I feel like I've only given pieces of myself away for nothing.

I won't go over the details of why we split or our reconciliation since I'm sure the average redditor can click buttons and most likely read. He was the one taking me out, and promised that it would, in his words, \"knock my socks off\" to make up for his neglect of me. He sure as hell delivered.\n\nA little backstory, we've been together since we were 15 and 16 respectively, and have never moved out of our hometown. This year would have been our 20th anniversary (of getting together, not marriage). We were dating secretly for about five years before our parents caught us one day during summer break. The fallout from finding out their son was gay actually made his parents split. His dad wanted to send him away to conversion therapy. He's seen his father maybe once per year on average, and every time he's incredibly cold towards me. Would never refer to me as his son-in-law, only my husband's \"pal.\" I wonder why. Anyway, not what you're here to read. I'll get on with the lore.\n\nHe picked me up from the house and wouldn't tell me where we were going, but told me to dress warmly. He ended up taking me to the place where we met: a run down ice skating rink in our town. He used to do hockey, and I spent some time trying to learn figure skating until people started beating me up for it. Both sports would practice at the same time and I remember barely being able to keep my eyes off him. We went skating, I tried to pull off a few of the moves I remembered (he only had to catch me from falling on my ass once or twice, and I won't complain about an attractive man that I love hooking his arm around my waist), and we spent an hour or so there until our feet hurt. At one point I said that my face was getting cold, so he skated around in front of me and placed his gloved hands on my cheeks to warm me up. I just about burned a hole in the ice from how hard I was blushing, I swear to God.\n\nHe wasn't done then. We left and went to dinner, specifically the restaurant where we had our first date. It's a cheap hole-in-the-wall place, seeing as we were poor teenagers when we first met. We chatted and ate food that probably took 5 years off our lives, he was an incorrigible flirt, and even held my hand underneath the table like he did all those years ago. I know I said I never stopped loving him, and I stand by that, but I think I somehow fell in love with him a thousand times over again during that meal.\n\nAt the end of dinner, he asked if I had energy for one more simple thing, to which I agreed. He took me a while out of town to a dark sky zone park, specifically the one where he proposed to me ten years ago. He set out a blanket to sit on and another to cuddle under, and we went stargazing all bundled up together. You never know how much you miss the sound of someone's heartbeat until you haven't heard it for so long. We shared a bottle of sparkling grape juice in plastic champagne flutes and dumb, giggly kisses. It felt so similar yet so different. He told me in a moment of quiet that he loved me, and oh, God. It took everything I had not to cry. I barely hesitated before asking if he wanted to change venues. He seemed surprised, but eagerly accepted.\n\nI ended up at his place, as some of you may have seen from my edit on my second post yesterday. I wanted to take it slower than this, but it was so hard to. I was so starved of affection and hadn't been intimate with anyone for just about six years. I'm gonna keep what happened at his between us, but all I'll say is that his medication was no issue and all of you should be jealous. I woke up in his bed this morning, reached over for him, and pulled him close just like I used to do. I haven't been this happy in a long time. We had a sleepy discussion and decided to get back together, but we're not using the term boyfriends. It just feels weird after all this time. So he's my partner, or my lover. He's mine.\n\nThank you, reddit. Wouldn't have done it without a little push from the internet. Let's see where all this goes.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone I (20m) miss my (19f) exgf so much. When we first met eachother 2 years ago everything was perfect. We were in love and having good times no matter what. We were long distance (about an hour and 30 minutes from each other) and we hated it, but it never mattered. The more days that went by the more in love we were. \n\nAt the time I was struggling with really bad paranoia and I quit my job and ran away to go live with her. I left my family and most importantly my grandmother behind. I wanted to show her everything I wanted was with her and her only, but I think that was one of the worst decisions we made during our relationship. We were only together for 2-3 months at the time and I stayed with her brother while she lived with her mom and step dad. \n\nWe started spending every second together and it was just getting even better, but we started getting aggravated with eachother more. I eventually got a job 1-2 months after moving in with her brother. Then things started to pick up again, probably because of the motivation of going to work and getting money to spend on her. She never cared about the money. I did, it\u2019s the only way I knew how to prove my love. \n\nHer mom and step dad were both alcoholics and abused eachother quite often and they really weren\u2019t a fan of me for some reason. They got in a fight one night and started treating my ex wrong so I stepped in and pulled her out of that situation before she got hurt and I took her to taco bell at 3am. \n\nAfter that we started fighting a whole lot more because money was getting tight and it was the only thing that made me feel stable. I wasn\u2019t comfortable living with her brother at all and was starting to wish I never moved in. We started getting more and more distant until the day she got me a cat. A beautiful baby and I named her Honey. She was the sweetest thing ever and it brought me and my ex closer than ever. \n\nThen I got kicked out of her brothers for unknown reasons. I just had to be out by the weekend, so I called up my family for some help and me and my ex moved into a camper with some of my distant relatives. We were still arguing and growing more distant but we worked out some of the problems but it just wasn\u2019t enough. We ended up moving back in with our families separately and only seeing eachother on the weekends, but going from living with eachother for over a year and then all of a sudden splitting apart again brought some issues. My trust issues got very very bad and I started with my outbursts and starting arguments for no reason. We both did and we would blame eachother for everything. \n\nI broke up with her and got back with her multiple times. I started running from our problems and coming back expecting it to be the way it was when we first got together, but it never turned out that way. I started focusing on myself and what I could do to be better for her. I tried so many things and so many ways but I could never find a way that worked and made us both happy. I wanted it to work out so much but she got fed up with me and blocked me on everything. I broke her heart so many times and lied to her because I didn\u2019t wanna admit I was wrong. I miss her so god damn much and wish I could go back in time to fix things. I want to hold her one more time. I want to give her all the affection she deserves. I wish I payed a little bit more attention to her and put myself to the side for once. \n\nMy only regret so far in life I wish I treated you a little bit better Peyton. If by any chance you find this and read it, just know I\u2019m still trying my best and not giving up just for the chance I get to love you like I should have. Honey was the best thing we ever had and you\u2019re the only other person that I share those memories with. You have her kitten and I miss getting to see her. You\u2019re my fucking soulmate Peyton and I will never love anyone else like I love you. If my life ends with you not by my side then it was all a waste. My life will have no meaning. \n ",

If you did, I'm sorry, and I'm glad you're still here.\n\nI'll get to the point. I prepared to commit suicide, something that has been on my mind every day for the past year and a half. Approximately. I decided to finally do it in January, I think. Ghosted all my friends, ruined every relationship within my family, completely neglected my schoolwork to the point that it's not salvageable anymore and that I'd have to drop out if I didn't die (though, honestly, I gave up on that much earlier).\n\nI wrote the letters. I bought the rope. I chose the place.\n\nBut I am *scared.* I'm fucking terrified. I don't want to die anymore, but now it feels like I don't have a choice. That I already made this decision, and I have to follow through. It's not that I want to live... I don't. At least not the life I have now. It's not even something worth being called a life. I do realize that it is only myself who can save me, that it is in my hands to turn my life around, that I am the only one responsible for my own happiness. I know things can change, theoretically, but I know myself, and I know that I am too weak to try and face the consequences of my own actions in an attempt to fix this. To rebuild the last bridge I burned. I'm not sure I want to.\n\nI don't know what I want. The idea of living is dreadful. The idea of death, although once so comforting, is terrifying. I want nothing, but I *don't* want to die.\n\nI have tried to kill myself before, when I was a teenager. Multiple times. Never before have I experienced this crippling horror at the idea of dying, not even when I thought I succeeded. The thought now makes me nauseous with fear, and I don't know what to do, because I *have to* die.\n\nThank you for reading.

He\u2019s never liked drinking, but after so much time, he feels completely trapped in a cycle of addiction. On top of that, he has significant mental health issues, and he lost his mother a while ago, dad left him, which has only deepened his struggles.\n\nToday, his behavior was really concerning. He was talking constantly, repeating words over and over, and even making a song out of them. He was jumping around in the bathroom, laughing uncontrollably\u2014though it was forced, almost like a nervous laughter. He was narrating random, nonsensical stories, smiling in a way that didn\u2019t feel normal. This isn\u2019t the way he usually behaves. He\u2019s normally very calm and thoughtful, even shy but today he was completely out of character.\n\nHe\u2019s been becoming more antisocial lately, and despite me being the only one visiting him, he still feels incredibly lonely. He\u2019s tried therapy, but it hasn\u2019t helped much, and he often feels like he\u2019s beyond saving. He has also mentioned feeling like he might end it all, though not directly. I\u2019m really scared for him, but I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\n\nI love him deeply, and I\u2019m doing everything I can to support him, but I can\u2019t fix this alone. I\u2019m looking for any advice, support, or resources\u2014whether it\u2019s therapy recommendations, strategies to help him when he spirals, or even just emotional support from people who understand what this is like.\n\nI\u2019m open to any suggestions, even if they\u2019re hard to hear. Please, if anyone has experience with something similar or knows of any supportive communities, I\u2019d really appreciate your input.",

    "selftext": "This is going to be a long one\u2014sorry in advance.\n\nI (29F) got divorced three years ago from my manipulative ex-husband after being with him for 6.5 years. We had no kids because he didn\u2019t want any responsibility. I\u2019ve moved on from him in the sense that I don\u2019t want him back, but I feel like the emotional and psychological abuse I went through changed me in ways I can\u2019t undo.\n\nWhenever a potential new partner comes into my life, I can\u2019t seem to accept them. The moment I see something I don\u2019t agree with, even if it\u2019s small, I start emotionally distancing myself to avoid getting hurt. I don\u2019t even know what a healthy relationship looks like.\n\nOn top of that, I live in a Middle Eastern country where everyone constantly pressures me to get married before I become \u201ctoo old.\u201d It just makes me feel worse\u2014like the manipulation and mistreatment I faced really broke something in me, and I don\u2019t know how to fix it.\n\nWhat my ex did to me\n\nTo summarize: he cheated on me multiple times, and I only found out about all of them at once. He never got me gifts\u2014only things he wanted me to have so he could show off his status. He never initiated intimacy; it was always up to me. He didn\u2019t want kids, but the moment he felt like I was pulling away, he suddenly wanted them\u2014basically trying to baby trap me even though it was obvious our relationship was already over.\n\nWhen I needed help\u2014like when my car wouldn\u2019t start or the faucets were bursting\u2014he never answered my calls. I had to handle everything myself. He claimed he had OCD about cleanliness but would leave trash and dirty clothes everywhere, expecting me to clean up after him just because I was a stay-at-home wife at the time.\n\nFinancially, he cut me off (except for food and clothes) when I got a part-time job and started making more than him for like three months. In my culture, the husband is supposed to provide for his wife, but as soon as I had my own income (which was around 4k a year, yes a year), he refused to spend a single cent on me unless it was food or clothes (had to pay my own cell-service, gas, etc\u2026 which he previously paid for).\n\nWhen we traveled, it was never about me\u2014it was just because he wanted to see the world, and his friends couldn\u2019t afford to go with him. When I put effort into our relationship\u2014planning picnics, buying games so we could play together, setting up dates, booking hotels\u2014he ignored it all, (yes I slept in a hotel by myself which is a huge NO-NO in my culture because he wanted to hang out with his boys instead). I tried everything to make it work, and the only complaint he had about me was that I \u201cdidn\u2019t clean enough.\u201d He would literally swipe his finger over a light switch, show me the dust, and act like that was a real issue.\n\nOur last conversation? He told me I was perfect, that he was sorry he cheated, and that was it. Only when he realized that I was really leaving him, that he started crying in the corner of the apartment we had like a 3-year-old toddler. 2 days later he was like I did everything for you and it\u2019s all your fault I cheated\u2026 :)\n\nWhere I\u2019m at now\n\nThe cheating destroyed me. I never even checked his phone because I respected his privacy, and in return, I got blindsided. I lost myself completely. People see me as this cheerful, bubbly person, but it\u2019s just a facade so my parents don\u2019t worry about me.\n\nAfter the divorce, I moved back in with them (which is normal in my culture). My dad even built me a small studio flat upstairs, so I have my own space. But I stopped working, so I have no income. Even if I got a full-time job, the salaries here are terrible\u2014around $15,500 USD a year, even though I have nine years of experience in marketing and content. Realistically, I should be making $20K\u2013$30K, but that\u2019s a whole other issue.\n\nI just feel like I have nothing to live for. My biggest dream in life is to have a family and kids, but the dating scene is discouraging. I do have hobbies\u2014I love reading, drawing, playing video games, watching anime/TV/movies, taking walks, and doing at-home pilates. So it\u2019s not like I do nothing with my life, but inside, I feel completely empty.\n\nMy struggle with marriage \n\nI\u2019m very traditional\u2014not because of my family, but because I truly believe a husband should take care of his wife. That doesn\u2019t mean I expect to be spoiled and contribute nothing, but I don\u2019t think it should be my responsibility to cook, clean, and do everything 24/7.\n\nMost men here, though, want a wife to take care of them. I keep getting set up with men through my family, and it\u2019s always the same story\u2014they expect a woman to be a maid, not a partner. I feel like I\u2019m running out of time to get married, and it\u2019s making me anxious because I really want to build a family.\n\nMy thoughts are all over the place, and I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nPS: This is the first time I\u2019ve ever shared something this personal. I don\u2019t even know if this makes sense. English isn\u2019t my first language, so sorry if it\u2019s messy.\n",

    "selftext": "This also gon be long (i cant help it, i am literally crying as i typed this)...\n\nTLDR: I\u2019m leaving for college soon, and while I\u2019m excited, I\u2019m struggling with the thought of leaving my mom behind. We\u2019ve always been close since my dad works overseas, but lately, I\u2019ve been unintentionally pulling away, getting irritable, and saying things I regret. I thought distancing myself would make leaving easier, but it only hurts more. Seeing how much my mom will miss me\u2014made me realize I don\u2019t want to leave things on a sour note. I keep having vivid dreams about my departure, and the guilt of how I\u2019ve treated her is overwhelming. I want to fix things before I go, but I don\u2019t know how.\n\nI\u2019m moving away for college in a few months, and as excited as I am for this new chapter, I can\u2019t stop thinking about how much I\u2019m going to miss my mom. She\u2019s been my biggest source of comfort my whole life, and since my dad works overseas, we\u2019ve always had a strong bond. But now that I\u2019m getting closer to leaving, I feel this huge mix of emotions that I don\u2019t know how to deal with.\n\nLately, I\u2019ve noticed myself pulling away a little\u2014not intentionally, but I think it\u2019s my way of trying to make leaving easier. Instead, it\u2019s just making me feel worse. I\u2019ve been more irritable, and I hate that I\u2019ve raised my voice at times when I never used to, I always used to listen to her life stories even if I had heard them countless times, her rants too, whenever she shouted for reasons I wasn't even wrong... But now I am talking back to her, get angry on her and say awful things, when she tells her stories I say they are boring and please shut up, I don't know why I am doing this... I still want to listen to her rants and yapping but I am not able to, I am going into that angry zone and I have done many mistakes. I haven\u2019t even apologized properly, and that weighs on me. It\u2019s like I\u2019m watching myself act this way but can\u2019t stop.\n\nI know this is all part of growing up, but the thought of leaving her behind, even temporarily, is really hard. I don\u2019t have many close friends, so my mom has always been the one I could talk to. But over time, I started keeping things to myself, thinking I shouldn\u2019t burden her with my problems. I used to be able to just rest my head in her lap and cry when things got hard\u2014when I got bullied, when I felt alone\u2014but I haven\u2019t done that in years. It makes me sad because I feel like I\u2019ve lost that connection a bit, and I don\u2019t want to leave things this way And now, when I probably need it the most, I feel like I can\u2019t show her the weak side of me that I have long pretended to have erased.\n\nThe other day, something happened that really got to me. My mom was taking a nap, and before sleeping, she had asked me to grab some groceries. While she was resting, my little sister was joking around and said, \"He left for college,\" and my mom suddenly started crying in sleep. She thought I had already gone. I was still at home, but seeing that broke me. I rushed to get the groceries, but I was tearing up the whole time. It made me realize just how hard this is going to be\u2014for both of us, and precisely the reason I was trying to distance myself from her that she doesn't grieve much but no, now I feel that she will cry more that I left and our relation were sour and not mended, I genuinely want to say sorry right now but I am stuck and I am going crazy.\n\nAt night, I keep having vivid dreams about the day I leave, and they feel so real (I do have genetic hyperphantasia (from my mom that too)) that I wake up feeling broken. Every time, it\u2019s like I\u2019m reliving the moment before it even happens (I know mom must be having those dreams too). It makes me feel so helpless because no matter what I do, that day is still coming. I was going to leave this January, but postponed it to August, because in January we were close to ripping each other off, that level of arguments... But now things are settling down, but still it isn't back to what it was last year...\n\nI know I have to go, and I know my mom wants the best for me. She always encourages me, and I\u2019m so grateful for everything she\u2019s done\u2014raising me, taking care of me, making sure I don't feel alone (I do feel, but I pretend I don't to not hurt her, I do have suicidal thoughts sometimes, but I hold back that it will all fall into place soon, however indefinite the \"soon\" is). I just want to spend these last few months showing her how much she means to me and making good memories before I leave. I just want to do the right thing, but I feel so lost. I thought distancing myself would help, but it only hurts more... Idk how to leave without hurting my mom... How do I say goodbye without breaking her heart... All of these are constantly revolving in my mind and I'm going crazy... I still have a few months but I don't know how I'll manage... I want to mend things... But I am thrown into my guilt...\n\nFor those who\u2019ve gone through something similar, how did you make the transition easier? How did you make sure your mom knew how much you appreciated her before you left? I don\u2019t want to take this time for granted, and I\u2019d love to hear any advice on how to make these last few months meaningful for both of us. I know now that pushing my mom away won\u2019t make leaving any easier\u2014if anything, it\u2019ll only make it worse. I tried to make her love me less so she wouldn't hurt when I leave, but all I did was create more pain for both of us. I don\u2019t want her to remember our last months together with regret. I just want to fix things before it\u2019s too late\n\nAnd lastly, Just to clarify, this is about my bond with my mom as a parent, nothing else. We\u2019re Asian\u2014if I ever even thought otherwise, she\u2019d personally set me straight with a slipper and more ultimate weapons. My dad works overseas but is always present, calling daily morning and night and supporting her even more than I do, listening to her rants and all. I love my mom because she\u2019s always been there for me, and I\u2019ve supported her in return. She doesn\u2019t rely on me for happiness\u2014I rely on her. I know I have to leave one day, but I just want to make things right before I go.",

    "selftext": "Guys, I am sorry, but this is a bit long, but I dont know who else to tell this to... (dont tell me about diaries, i suck at writing) and\n\nTLDR: Before COVID, I was social and talkative, but after the pandemic, I lost that ability. My friendships faded, and now I barely talk at all. Conversations feel forced, and I overthink everything. I keep things to myself because I have no one to truly open up to. Even online, my attempts to connect go unanswered. I miss the version of me that could talk freely, without hesitation. I don\u2019t know how to fix it, and I just wish someone understood.  \n  \nBefore COVID, I was a completely different person. I wasn\u2019t exactly an extrovert, but I talked a lot\u2014so much that teachers had to tell me to quiet down in class. I had a normal social life, and conversations came naturally. But after the pandemic, something changed. I used to have a few friends, and talking felt effortless. But when everything went online, I realized something: those connections were weaker than I thought. Conversations faded, and soon, I was just... alone.\n\nNow, I barely talk at all. I don\u2019t have close friends, and I find myself avoiding conversations altogether. It\u2019s not that I hate people\u2014I just don\u2019t know how to talk anymore. It feels like I lost the ability somewhere along the way. Even when I try, it feels forced, like I don\u2019t belong in the conversation. I started keeping things to myself\u2014not because I wanted to, but because I had to. There was no one to talk to. If I spoke up in online classes, I\u2019d either get ignored, get shut down by teachers, or feel like I was saying something dumb. Friends who I thought were there just\u2026 weren\u2019t. And slowly, I just stopped trying.\n\nEven now, in person, I can\u2019t bring myself to talk like I used to. I hold back. I overthink. I don\u2019t have friends anymore. I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend, and honestly, I don\u2019t need one for the reasons most of my classmates seem to. I just wish I had someone to talk to\u2014someone I could open up to about things I can\u2019t even tell my mom anymore (see this post). She\u2019s been my only real friend for years, but as I grew older, I started holding back. I don\u2019t want to worry her, and I don\u2019t want to burden her with my thoughts. But that means I end up keeping everything inside, with no one to really share it with.\n\nI don\u2019t know how I ended up like this. I miss the version of me that could just talk without hesitation. I miss feeling like I had people to talk to at all. People say it's just a phase, but how long does a phase last? It\u2019s been 5-6 years, and I\u2019m still waiting to snap out of it\u2014feeling like a tether floating in space, cut off from its base, holding onto nothing but a fragile strand of hope that maybe, just maybe, something will push me back.\n\nI overthink at the silliest of times. Even now, as I type, I am overthinking. It\u2019s been two hours since I started writing this small post, but my mind is stuck in a loop\u2014how to write, what to write, how much to write, is this sentence wrong, what if I\u2019m misunderstood, what if the post gets removed, what if there\u2019s no reply? My mind just doesn\u2019t stop.\n\nI don\u2019t know if anyone else has experienced this\u2014going from talkative and social to completely silent and disconnected. I don\u2019t know how to fix it either. I miss being able to just talk without overthinking everything. I miss having someone to truly connect with. I miss the part of me that could engage in conversations without second-guessing every word. Back then, I could even talk to girls without feeling like I was just spouting nonsense. Not that I ever got much of a response, but at least I was able to talk. Now, I hesitate for so long that by the time I figure out what to say, the moment has already passed. The person has already walked away.\n\nWhenever I see friends posting on Instagram, I reach out\u2014\"What\u2019s up?\" \"Nice!\" \"Cool!\" \"How have you been?\" But most of the time, there\u2019s no reply. And if there is, it\u2019s a dry \"okay\" or \"cool,\" like they don\u2019t want to engage in a conversation no matter how hard I try. I don\u2019t have any social skills anymore. I don\u2019t have humor. I don\u2019t know how to flirt or even start a normal conversation. I have to ask ChatGPT just to figure out how to say something.\n\nHas anyone else gone through this? How did you handle it?  \nI just wish someone understood. I am tired of being alone, and reaching out isn't helping anymore",

She looked at me like I mattered, and for the first time in a long time, I felt seen. We worked in the same company but had never noticed each other before that night.\n\nFrom that moment on, my life revolved around her. We weren\u2019t officially together, but we acted like we were. She\u2019d come over almost every night, we\u2019d talk for hours, fall asleep in each other\u2019s arms. It felt real. It felt worth fighting for.\n\nBut she kept saying she wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship.\n\nI told myself to be patient, to wait until she healed from her past. But months passed, and nothing changed. Every time I tried to define what we were, she pulled away. And yet, she always came back.\n\nShe had a drinking problem. I picked her up from bars when she was too wasted to get home. I held her hair back when she was sick, tucked her into bed, made sure she was okay. I cleaned up the messes she made\u2014literally and figuratively.\n\nAnd still, I wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nShe had a kid, and I got along with her so well. I ignored the fact that she still lived with her ex-husband in the same apartment.\n\nOne night, after yet another drunken call, she told me she had kissed another guy.\nA few months later, she admitted she had slept with her ex.\n\nAnd yet, I stayed.

Throughout my life, she always seemed \"embarrassed\" or \"ashamed\" of me for one reason or another. We hadn't spoken in three years, though deep down, part of me still longed for the kind of mother-daughter relationship I never had.\n\nThen, three weeks ago, I received a message on Facebook from my cousin, saying they had \"heard\" about my mother and hoped things got better. My heart sank. No matter what had happened between us, she was still my mom. I immediately started reaching out to family\u2014her siblings, my aunts and uncles\u2014only to be told they couldn\u2019t say anything and that I needed to call my stepdad.\n\nLong story short, my mother was dying. Stage 4 cancer. ICU. When I asked if I could see her, I was told she wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted to see me. That *hurt* in a way I can't even explain. By the time I finally made it to her home, she was in hospice care and could no longer speak. Her husband made it clear that she hadn't wanted me to know she was sick\u2014she didn\u2019t think I would care. *WTF.* I got to say goodbye, but only to the shell of the woman she once was. And now, I don't know how to process any of it.\n\nThe only time I ever really stood up to her\u2014never in a disrespectful way\u2014was when I asked her to stop belittling me in front of others and to show me some respect. I am college-educated, have never been arrested, and earn four times what she did. But in her eyes, none of that mattered. I was overweight. I had a teenage pregnancy many, *many* years ago. That was all she ever saw. This drove anxiety, depression and a few failed attempts...well, you know. \n\nShe never had a relationship with her only grandson, either. He wasn\u2019t told she was sick. He never got to say goodbye.\n\nIt\u2019s just... frustrating. Heartbreaking. Infuriating.\n\nThank you for letting me vent.",

    "selftext": "I have never been the skinny girl or the pretty girl, so when I became infatuated with a boy and finally heard him say yes to my request to date him, I thought I was in a fairytale. Last summer, I (18) went to visit my boyfriend (21), who lived over 400 miles away. I was given an ultimatum: if I didn't go see him, he would dump me. So, the naive me, hopelessly in love, agreed to take two weeks off my well-paying job to meet him.\n\nAfter a 14-hour train ride, I was enveloped in his embrace, and I felt so happy, thinking, \"This is it; he\u2019s the one.\" I was exhausted from the long day and immediately fell asleep in his bed. However, I woke up to a strange feeling and found myself unable to breathe. He was having sex with me and choking me. When I opened my eyes in shock, all he said was, \u201cYou like that? you fucking slut.\u201d I felt so stupid and used, I couldn\u2019t look at him the same way again.\n\nI stayed there for the rest of the two weeks, but all we did was argue. I wanted love and to spend time with him, while he just wanted to play games, use me, and sleep. Once the two weeks were over i got the train home to encounter a 7 hour delay, I spent a total of 21 hours on a train, only to be raped by a man in an alley at 3 a.m. on my way to the hotel.\n\nI called my boyfriend, crying and upset, as my face had been bashed in. He called me a whore, saying I shouldn\u2019t dress the way I did in public and that it was my own fault. Then he dumped me. I had a mental breakdown of sorts lost my job, self harmed almost daily never allowing my skin to be clean and overdosed twice. The worst part is no one believed me accusing me of being an attention seeker and dramatic and those who did believe me played it off as no big deal. Although it has been five months, I still feel unloved. I have always craved affection, and I genuinely do not believe anyone could ever love me for who I am without wanting to use me although i hope one day im proven to be wrong :)",

    "selftext": "I have been trying to process and work through what I saw yesterday, but it has been really hard. The event itself was a lot but now I\u2019m dealing with the \u201cwhy\u2019s\u201d which make me feel guilty since what happened has nothing to do with me. I was just a witness. I tried writing through it, but it hasn\u2019t been enough so I\u2019m trying again, thinking that if I get it in front of others I can start to live past it. \n\nYesterday evening, I was sitting on this big rock while I was waiting for the bus. A little ways down the road there was a taxi van. He was either backing out or adjusting his U-turn, but obviously reversing and not moving super fast. From where I was sitting, I didn\u2019t see how fast the bike courier was going when he hit the front side of the van. And the biker immediately went under the front wheel of the van and I could hear him and his bicycle crunch under the tire. \n\nThe position the biker was on the ground was how he stayed for the whole 20 minutes that he was out there. He never moved. So, I\u2019m almost positive he died during the collision or if there was some way he survived, he could have been fully paralyzed. \n\nBut there weren\u2019t many people to see the accident head on like I did. A man in his Jeep came out and a few security from the booth around (my stop is near a campus) came out to help. They checked for signs of life and directed traffic around him and had someone call 911. Police came and did much of the same. The fire department came and started doing CPR but they didn\u2019t take off the man\u2019s helmet. The ambulance came and I didn\u2019t see any defibrillator or adrenaline unless they did those things in the back once they loaded him on the gurney and took the man away. But even after they put him in the ambulance, it didn\u2019t leave or take off. There wasn\u2019t a rush. \n\nIt felt like I was out there for two hours but it all happened in about 20 minutes. And, it\u2019s hard to think about the collision and how if the biker hasn\u2019t passed away I\u2019m sure the injuries will last a lifetime. And I think about the taxi driver who just sat in the van with his head down and how he will most likely lose almost everything because of an accident. \n\nI don\u2019t know why I had to see it but I did and I don\u2019t know what to do with it if anything at all.

However, there are times when my mom feels a bit smothered by my dad, and this has led to arguments in the past, but I would say that overall she enjoys spending most of her time with him.  I've even tried inviting her to different events but she would often turn me down to spend time with my dad. I feel like this has led me to create an unrealistic expectation that my partner and I should be spending a lot of our time together.  A few of my partners have told me that they felt smothered, or that I was never satisfied with them. Was it a matter of different needs, or was I truly doing/expecting too much? Or is it a little bit of both?  People say a relationship is supposed to feel \"easy\" or \"natural\" in the beginning, but it's never felt that way for me.  I have to be doing something wrong-whether it's not communicating well enough, expecting too much from my partner, or not setting firm enough boundaries for myself, or maybe all of the above. ",

    "selftext": "I (22F) broke up with my boyfriend (20M) of 6 months on new years of 2024. I broke up with him for a plethora of reasons including him accusing me of stealing $500, him accusing me of cheating, him proposing, how he treated me, him telling me he was going to commit suicide and it was my fault, and much more. For the record, I didn\u2019t do any of the things he accused me of. Well it didn\u2019t end at the breakup. This specific individual is in the military and most of our relationship was long distance. He sent me death threats after the initial break up which I did contact the police and his commanding officer about. I told him to leave me alone and blocked him. However for the year of 2024, he had his friends that live where I live follow me and threaten any guy I was seeing into breaking up with me, he constantly messaged me on different numbers saying words coated in honey to try to get me back and he even showed up to my house when he was on leave. One of the many reasons I broke up with him was that he was home for Christmas of 2023 and refused to see me and I got really upset because I still \u201cloved him\u201d at that time. I have now learned through therapy that it wasn\u2019t love, I was just caught in the web. Well Christmas of 2024 came around and he was back on leave and he had his mom message me telling me that he was going to commit suicide if I didn\u2019t show up. I told her to leave me alone and it was of course an empty threat (maybe even a test). He left after that and apparently, according to his mom he was deployed. Well I got a text on my birthday (February 4th) saying that he still loved me and yada yada which went ignored and then I got a call from his military base. Apparently he had went missing in action and I was his beneficiary. I haven\u2019t heard anything from him since but I feel free finally. I have a date this week and I\u2019m going to see if anyone threatens my date into ending it with me. I kinda feel bad that I was so harsh but I also think it was survival. I think that if I was any less harsh, it would\u2019ve been a lifetime of pain for me. ",

Bland, so bland that eating a meal that would take me ten minutes takes up to an hour.\n\nI swear, any dish they make is outperformed, and I do not exaggarate here, by a fucking piece of bread with some salt and pepper sprinkled over it.

    "selftext": "My, f29, boss, m late 40s, kept the camera feed of me on his computer screen at all times. Obligatory throw away account cause the details in this might be easy for some of my coworkers to find this and I don't want to give up my main account. Also I was posting this on am I over reacting but my update actually came as I was typing this on that sub so now I'm switching it to here that everything seems to be wrapped up.\n\nSo I work in a mostly male dominated field in a CNC machine shop as a brake operator. I am the only woman at my company that works on the shop floor. About a year ago there was a fist fight between 2 other operators and there were no cameras inside to show who started the fight so both operators had to be let go. To prevent this from happening again the cameras went up all over the shop. Absolutely no blind spots, crystal clear HD camers, we know this because our boss has a TV screen above his desk now where he can watch all the cameras. He can have up to 8 of the camera feeds on his screen at one time and it has the ability to cycle though all of the feeds, switching feeds every few minutes. \n\nThe problem came about a week ago when a coworker of mine came up to me and told me there was only one feed on the screen. Me at my machine. I have never been written up or even talked to about problems with my work so I was very thrown off by this. When I had the opportunity where I could think of a reason to go into his office to see for myself when I walked in his office sure enough I saw my empty station on the screen. I pretended not to notice and just asked a question about a part I was working on that could be a reasonable question and went back to my work like nothing was wrong. Over the next week or so I tried to put it out of my mind but I couldn't get past it and more coworkers approached me and said they saw me on the screen. \n\nSo late last week I went to HR and asked if I was in trouble for anything. The HR guy looked surprised and asked me what I was referring to and I told him how closely I'm being watched and it seems to be just me singled out. He said he would look into it and get back to me but as far as he knew there was nothing wrong. About an hour later I get called into the managers office with HR, screens are back to normal showing 8 different work areas. I'm happy for a second until I am asked why I'm spreading misinformation. I ask what they're talking about and I proceed to be gaslighted for the next 5 or so minutes about how the cameras have always been this way and I'm seeking attention. I say multiple coworkers have mentioned to me about seeing it and we can bring them in to ask. They threaten to write me up if I keep bringing up this \"blatant lie\" and that I'm slandering the manager to my fellow coworkers.\n\nI contact a lawyer cause at this point I'm like fuck it I'm going to quit this job anyway might as well raise a little hell but then part of me decides it's just not worth it and with everything I've been through lately its just not worth it. I decided to contact my ex who I've been broken up with for a year and fill him in. We we're together for 5 years and he's the love of my life, about a year ago he was offered his dream job across the country and asked me to go with him. My mother was dying of cancer at the time and I was the only one she had left to take care of her. He planned on turning down the job to stay with ne but I told him I'd never forgive myself if he passed on his dream job for me. About 6 months ago my mother passed and idk why I didn't contact him but it kinda felt like my whole world fell apart so I just accepted this was my life now.\n\nWhen I told him what was going on he said \"why don't you come move in with me?\" I didn't know it but he hadn't dated anyone since we broke up (and neither had i) because he had always planned on us reuniting after my mother passed and when she did he didn't want to rush me cause he wanted to wait until I was ready. I wasn't ready at all until he asked me that question but without hesitation I said yes. I put in an application that day at a CNC shop near where he lives and that was yesterday. So that's where this post was going to end on am I over reacting for picking up and moving across the country. And then the phone rang.\n\nApparently the place I was hiring was impressed with my years of experience and they're a newer shop so I actually have more experience running a brake then most of their employees. They offered my about a 25% raise of what I'm currently making and I accepted on the spot. They asked when I could start and I said next week. Immediately called my boss and told him he's a fucking creep and that I quit. HR has been calling me nonstop begging for me to reconsider but that ship has sailed. Ex bf or possibly just bf again said he's excited for me to move in but will be setting me up in a separate bedroom at first just so we can take things slow and figure things out which I think is very smart of him and I'm glad cause I think we need that time too.\n\nMy current landlady is an absolute sweetheart and knows how rough this year has been for me so she's letting me break my lease with no penalties and she already has someone lined up to take my apartment. I asked if they wanted to buy some of my furniture since I'm only taking what I can fit in my truck and they offered me a thousand buck for my living room set and all my drawers and dressers. Not having to worry about all that I can fir the rest of my stuff in my truck easily and I'm starting my cross country trek tonight. Fuck creeps and if you're thinking about putting up with that bullshit, don't. There's always another option, maybe even one youd.never thought possible.\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey guys. Throwaway account here\u2014I (20F) just want to vent after a trip to the mall recently that legitimately made me realize just how much my body has changed. I tried on a dress in the size I was last year, and after I tried to force the zipper and it didn't work, I felt so disgusted with myself. \n\nI weighed myself on my scale for the first time in a while and realized I'd gained about 50 pounds in less than a year. I'd just started college, and a healthy eating and exercise routine I'd gotten into in my senior year of high school went down the drain during my first year as I began drinking more, getting takeout and eating out at least 4+ times a week, and not exercising (trying to balance a crazy social life with academics was just not something I was cut out for). \n\nThis year, I'm getting more into home cooking, exercising, and staying away from junk foods, but whenever I feel like I'm making progress I end up relapsing for some reason. For example, I made excuses during exam season and ended up getting a lot of takeout again, ruining my progress. Whenever I go out with friends or am with family, I feel too embarrassed to mention I'm trying to diet because I'd always been the chubby kid growing up, and I wanted to continue living as the \"thinner, glowed up\" person I'd become when that isn't who I am anymore. As a result, I end up eating a lot during hangouts or just giving in to temptations. I also sometimes have the bad mentality of \"I ate something unhealthy today already, might as well just use today as a cheat day\" way too often. \n\nOverall, this isn't just about the weight gain itself: I feel like I've lost the discipline I once had and my self-confidence just keeps slipping away. It's been a week or so after a stressful life season, and I'm attempting to start this process again. I'm now 3 days into my new routine of encouraging myself to get out more as well as eating healthier and reducing portions, and I've been seeing some good calorie deficits without even feeling too worn out. I hope I can keep up the progress this time. I need to do this for myself, not only for my physical appearance, but my mindset and to re-instill discipline. I'm not trying to make excuses, just ranting about everything here to get it off my chest. If anyone sees this, thanks for reading! ",

    "selftext": "I (14M) and my friend (14F) have been friends since childhood. People say that we are both attractive for our ages and because of that we often get shipped as a couple by our other friends. It doesn't bother me that much because I am used to hearing stuff like this. My father, however, gave me some requirements for marriage and they are odd. One of the requirements is my partner can't be the same age or older than me. The thing is, when we started talking over text, things escalated. Now we call each other romantic names. And the topic of us having children came up more than once. And there is also my friend (2 years older than me. Let's call him WILLIAM) and WILLIAM has feelings for my friend (F). But the guilt is eating me out. My parents gave me freedom and I am misusing it. Though we read in different schools, our friends and mutual friends know about us. Her friends often flirt with me for being very handsome. Though my face is one of my biggest insecurities. Yesterday I was in the bathroom of our community hall. And I saw her. She said hello, I said too. We talked and she started flirting with me. I didn't find it weird since she has done it more than once, so we were in the bathroom and she suddenly asked me \"Will you kiss me?\" I paused. And when I did, she came over and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I blushed so hard that when my mom noticed she said \"what happened, why are you blushing?\" I couldn't tell her the real reason, so I made one up. Next day she messaged me to meet in the same place. I went thinking she surely couldn't do it again. When I met her we talked for a few mins and she asked if I could kiss her as well. I didn't wanna hurt her but at the same time I am afraid of my parents. So I kissed her on her hand. She was happy, I was too, but deep down, I was dying. Now I am sitting in my room thinking, should I confess my feelings for her or should i tell abt my feelings to WILLIAM. I have to make a decision quick because this secret is something I cant hide forever.",

    "selftext": "I (14f) dress in a more alternative style (I'm goth but when trying to be comfortable switch over to grunge). As we all know, A LOT of alternative music is very 'depressing' if you can call it that, I think everyone understands. A large portion of alternative teens is also.., severely depressed. \n\nI met most of my alternative friends in the psych ward, or through friends of friends. I love them, they're fun and I used to feel like they understood me. I was in said psych ward for self harm and suicide about a year and a bit ago and yes, I still have my moments but I have learnt to manage my emotions, weaned off self harm and am no longer suicidal. I have been taking meds for depression and anxiety, but I got taken off a while ago and I am doing fine. I no longer have that 'what's the point of anything' outlook on life. I look forward to graduating, getting married, becoming independent and having children. I still have my fleeting problems with anxiety but as mentioned, in the long run I'm FINE. \n\nA lot of those friends have not gotten better. But not in the sense that they haven't been able to. I have been speaking to them and they have expressed that they don't want to get better. They are content being depressed. They also consume sad media constantly, like movies and music, and they're OKAY with that. \n\nI, though, have grown not so fond of it. I love them but I feel like I can't be around people that don't want to get better. I don't think it's a good influence to hang out with severe addicts. I don't want it to seem like I am abandoning them because they're too hard to deal with, but I don't want to put myself in friendgroups with alcoholics, people who are severely depressed and people who are constantly NEGATIVE. \n\nI came to this conclusion when one of my friends reccomeneded smoking to get rid of my problem, and I think that's when I knew that this is not the enviorment I want to be in. I just can't keep listening to the same problems over and over again when they don't want or care to fix them. \n\nI'm also starting to grow out of the alternative style. I'd rather wear bright colours and make myself look as colourful, joyful and feminine as possible. The goth make up is something I'm not into either anymore, I just don't like having people stare. \n\nNow, I recently turned to God and my friends have been.. not accepting. I told my best friend I wanted to try religion again and she got mad. She said I was abandoning her in atheism and \"Who will we hate on Christians with now?\" She doesn't like the idea of me going to church or ordering a Bible. We have had multiple arguments about this. She also recently did something controversial that I won't get into. I said I was reconsidering our friendship because of it and when she asked why I stated my reasons and added that I don't think her actions align with the type of people I should be surrounding myself with according to scripture. She got mad and blocked me. \n\nI'm sick of being misreable, sick of acting like nobody understands and sick of acting like I'm some tortured poet. I'm not. They're not.",

    "selftext": "This happened two years ago and I still cry when I think about this. I had a coworker at one point who had very thin boundaries - she would consistently causally trauma dump at work without regard to how it affected others and mostly coped with her trauma through drinking. I\u2019m fairly certain she was drinking at work, but never saw her take swigs. Just saw her acting intoxicated and smelling like alcohol. I grew up with an alcoholic parent, so her behavior was fairly uncomfortable for me to be around, meaning I did not get close to her even though she shared many very private things with me. I almost wish I had invested in her more just so I would know more about her family - maybe I would have had enough information to intervene if I had befriended her. \n\nOne day, her niece came in to work with her. This little girl was probably about 5. When she walked in the door, she had her hands cupped around the sides of her face so she could only see the ground in front of her. She made no eye contact and would not verbally respond to anyone, including her aunt. \n\nThis was the angriest child I have ever seen. She glared at everyone, held her hands in fists for almost the entire time she was there, stayed completely silent, and kept her back to the wall for the majority of the time she was in the shop. I\u2019ve been through a lot of trauma therapy and it was very obvious to me that this child was hyper-vigilant if not in fight or flight. \n\nAfter the child was picked up by another family member, I stepped outside for a smoke. My coworker, the aunt of the child, was already outside smoking. \n\nI sat down next to her and she casually said to me \u201cmy niece told her friend that someone licked her hooha.\u201d It was like cold water had been dumped over my head as she told me more about it. I felt so sick for so many reasons. A FIVE YEAR OLD told their friend that someone licked their private parts, that friend told her mom, who told my coworker\u2019s niece\u2019s parents. And no one was doing anything actionable. No therapy, no intervention, no questions. Just shrugs and \u201chope that\u2019s not actually happening\u201d. \n\nAfter my shift I called child services and went to the police station by my work. I tried everything I could to get a report filed, a welfare check done, literally anything. Because I didn\u2019t have the name of the child\u2019s parents, the police AND child services told me I didn\u2019t have enough information to complete a report. I called so many times with different ideas of how I could make a legitimate report, but I simply didn\u2019t have enough information. \n\nI think about this multiple times a week, sometimes every day for the entire day. I myself am someone who survived CSA. I have complex trauma and I know what it\u2019s like to be a child in a setting where no adults are protecting you, even when they know what\u2019s going on. \n\nOur boss commit suicide that same week, so everything at that work place became even more chaotic very quickly. I left because I could not cope with the instability. Part of me wishes I had stayed just to garner more information, but that work place was so toxic that I started to experience suicidal ideation. I had to leave for my safety. Now that I\u2019m farther removed from the experience, I feel like I could have pulled myself up by my bootstraps and stayed long enough to get more info for the sake of this little girl. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m sharing this. Yesterday this popped up in my head for the millionth time and I had such a strong reaction to the memory that I vomited. I will never be able to get the image of that little child\u2019s angry face out of my head. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget her and I will always wonder if there is something I could have done to help. ",

    "selftext": "20 years ago, I was a stupid teenager in love. My boyfriend was 23 and I was 16. Things started out great, but they progressively worsened as he introduced me to drugs. By the end of it all, I was working for an escort agency, giving the boyfriend my money. I was bullied and forced into fucking old men and I was scared to leave my relationship. My parents finally found me (I had run away) and managed to get me help. I turned things around and ended up doing well in life. I never told anyone what had happened and I had planned to take it to my grave.\n\nFast forward 15 years (5 years ago), a detective knocks on my door. He wanted to know about my ex and the sex trafficking. I reluctantly spoke with him and agreed to do some recorded phone calls at the police station in order to get a confession. I also turned over my high school journals that detailed the abuse and rapes. We recorded a two-hour confession that detailed everything. It felt like a slam dunk. That was 2 years ago.\n\nGuys, it's been 5 years and I am tired. I am tired of waiting 3-6 months to hear back from the detective. I'm tired of having to tell and retell my story to different detectives. The further I get away from it, the less I remember, and the less credible I sound. I'm tired of worrying about my safety, and if people will even believe me. And I'm tired of getting my hopes up, only to hear back from the DA that they're working on more pressing matters. I get that my case is \"old news\" and not a priority. I don't begrudge the detectives for prioritizing more current, relevant cases. But I'm tired of advocating for a win that I don't think I'll ever see.\n\nSo today, I will be emailing the detective and asking them to drop the case. I wanted to hang on because I wanted to get this dude on the sex offender registry, so that other girls wouldn't have to go through what I did. But I can't be a martyr and sacrifice myself any longer for this cause.\n\nI have no one to talk to about this. And I just need to say that I'm sorry, and I tried :(",

We both know these feelings can pop up while I\u2019m going through therapy but the timing is so messed up that I would feel so much more shame and guilt about everything if I spend any time talking to professionals or someone I love about it. I understand I have to work through the grooming and I mostly don\u2019t talk about it even in therapy but why now? Why do the feelings and dreams come now at the worst time. Why do I miss him?",

Hospitals in general has always been very depressing for me and while I was stuck there, it definitely feels lonely. \n\nMy loneliness amplifies when the people I am surrounded with doesn\u2019t acknowledge me as much anymore. I am in college and I have a group of friends including me there\u2019s 5 of us. While I was not with them, the 4 of them did stuff together and went on to have sleepovers. I think what hit the most was that none of them says they wished I was there. It was simply a thing they did between them and then it was never brought up again. \n\nIt becomes more evident how used they are already without having me around. They made plans without including me. Even though, I was there. It would be nice just to get an invitation.

The problem is, whenever I get a call, my 4G+ drops to H+ and my game starts lagging, which is a huge deal in a game like MLBB where being AFK can ruin everything. So, I hung up. He called again, and I hung up again.\n\nNow, for some reason, both he and another friend are acting weird toward me\u2014like they\u2019re purposely cutting me off. They avoid me, walk ahead of me but constantly look back to check if I\u2019m gone, and just overall act distant.\n\nThe part that really got me was when I asked for a cigarette. They claimed they didn\u2019t have any, but they were literally heading to our usual smoking spot. Another friend (who isn\u2019t aware of what\u2019s going on) also asked for a cigarette, and I saw them looking back at me, almost like they were waiting for me to leave before giving him one.\n\nAt that moment, I knew they were avoiding me. So, I walked up to them quickly and made an excuse that I needed to go cook. One of them realized that I had caught on and started feeling bad. As I was leaving, he suddenly said, \u201cWait, maybe he has some.\u201d It was like he was trying to make up for it, but it just confirmed that they were avoiding me in the first place.\n\nWhat bothers me the most is that I\u2019ve always been there whenever they called or asked me to hang out. But the one time I decline, they start treating me like this? I don\u2019t get it. If they were upset that I didn\u2019t answer, why not just say something instead of acting all passive-aggressive?\n\nAm I wrong for feeling betrayed by this?\n",

One evening, we were at his best friend\u2019s place, and the two of them were smoking a bong. They wanted me to smoke as well. I asked what it was, and they said weed. Being stupid, I took a hit, but whatever it was, it definitely wasn\u2019t weed. At first, I got extremely dizzy, then I couldn\u2019t move anymore, and I started panicking inside because I couldn\u2019t speak or even breathe.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, his best friend told him to check if I was still breathing, which he did. When he confirmed that I was still breathing, the other guy left the room to go to sleep. That\u2019s when my ex started undressing me and then had sex with me.

He was diagnosed with it back in September of 2024 and has been in and out of the hospital since then. It started off with his liver failing and slowly went to his kidneys starting to fail. His feet, legs and stomach were pretty much always full of fluid that he was constantly needing to go get drained and he was always in pain. He went into to hospice about a week ago and one of his last wishes were to be at home so my grandparents had the hospital bed and all the equipment set up at there house. Once he was at home In hospice he went down hill really fast. He was confused most of the time, and the rest of the time he was sleeping. \n\nI got a call from my grandfather around 8:30am on Monday that I needed to get over there as fast as I can because they didn\u2019t think he wasn\u2019t going to make it much longer. I got over there around 10:30am and honest to god wasn\u2019t prepared for how horrible he looked. He went down hill so fast. His oxygen levels were at 30% and his heart rate was 45bpm. My grandma cranked up his oxygen and was able to get it back up to 94%. His eyes were open but you could tell he really wasn\u2019t seeing anything. He could hear us but couldn\u2019t talk, he could hardly breathe,every breath he took was a gasp and then nothing for a second and then a gasp again. All the immediate family was there, talking to him to let him know that we were there and that we loved him.

He passed away about four hours after I got there on Monday, March 3rd at 2:02pm.

    "selftext": "\nFor the context, our love felt more beautiful than anything I\u2019d read in books or seen in movies, deeper and more real in a way that\u2019s hard to explain. Part of it was because we both had real trauma growing up, which made us so similar. We bonded so purely and beautifully, expressing our truest selves to each other. It was more than I ever could\u2019ve dreamed of. Even our first kiss, after nearly a year of waiting, was unlike anything else, the world didn\u2019t just feel like it stopped, it \u201cdid\u201d. We trembled, overwhelmed, and he cried like babies as he kissed me, tears streaming down his face. That\u2019s how strong our connection was.\n\nI never wanted long distance, so he promised he\u2019d move to my city, but he never did, mentioning financial reasons. Still, he visited every few months, and we always looked forward to those moments. He even deactivated his socials on his own, though I never had any problem or concern with them. \n\nOf course, not everything was perfect. His one toxic trait: whenever things didn\u2019t go his way, or we argued, he\u2019d start disrespecting and insulting me. It was a dealbreaker, but I still tried to be understanding. He had no real human connections all his life. He never even got to talk much to his family because of it being dysfunctional, no close friends, zero experience in relationships. I told myself he just can\u2019t do any better, or could be because BPD runs in his family, or maybe because of the traumatic environment he grew up in. \n\nBut now, for the last four months, things were rough. We even broke up for a few days, ironically after our first intimate experience. I felt insecure or anxious afterward (he was my first boyfriend, and I have a bit of sexual trauma too), but he misunderstood it, assuming I didn\u2019t like it or didn\u2019t want it again. After that, he changed, became indifferent, stopped reassuring me, and didn\u2019t seem to care about the relationship at all or even if we break up. It reinforced my fear that he didn\u2019t feel the same anymore, trapping us in a cycle of blame and misunderstandings. I had spent so many nights crying during that time. \n\nHe eventually felt sorry and we fixed things, but I had already noticed a red flag: he seemed to care about physical intimacy more than anything; and shut down when he thought he wouldn\u2019t get it. So then I started noticing more. During this rough phase, he reactivated his accounts, made new ones and never mentioned even after we patched up, and tried to hide them when asked. It also started needling me for the first time that why had he never added me on his instagram and its been so long we\u2019re together, and I once saw a text from a coworker that felt off.\n\nI couldn\u2019t ignore it all anymore. So, I decided to have a sudden, intense conversation with him, hoping his reactions would reveal the truth. \n\nThen his reactions did reveal. A lot. Not just cheating or anything, but about his whole identity. \n\nI started asking, he was so confident with his grand words and said that I can have his passwords and his phone (because he knew I\u2019d never do that I don\u2019t believe in invading privacy in a relationship). He kept manipulating me into believing there was nothing, and I almost fell for it, he was that good. But then, we stumbled upon the conversation with his coworker. He initially refused to let me see it, then tried to manipulate the situation. When I finally read it, I noticed he had tampered with it. The last text had originally been 12 weeks ago, but now it showed 17 weeks ago. And then, the part that made my heart sink: them talking about how fun it would be when he will move to Germany, and how she would be waiting for him.\n\nThat explains why he was so obsessed with moving to Germany. for his remote job? just to connect and work together with \u201call\u201d his coworkers there? Those texts were from months ago, right after he started that job. Now, five months in, i believe they must have something concrete going on. It\u2019s pretty clear from the way he provided no further clarifications when I saw that and refused to show anything else (they converse usually on discord which he didn\u2019t even show). \n\n\nBut what struck me even more than the cheating was seeing in real time, how good he is at manipulation. My friends warned me, but I never believed it. He seemed too pure-hearted. But that day, I saw it: how effortlessly he lies. I\u2019ve never seen anyone lie that efficiently. Even when I was trying to ask, he turned down all of my questions with so great replies that I started feeling like \u201cWhat am I even thinking?\u201d\n\n\nHe was even at that time making a grand gift for my birthday. It included multiple handmade beautiful gifts including a giant scrapbook, different boxes each with 50+ different kinds of letters and tapes in it for different situations and a painting which he painted himself. He was even better with words, the things he said, and the way he made me feel. It\u2019s driving me insane. How can someone be that person (and) be cheating at the same time? For an example, he kept repeating that he wanted to move here to strengthen our relationship, that I was his life dream, that after being with me, he needed nothing else from life. But now, he\u2019s moving for \u201cher\u201d instead? It\u2019s giving me a complete identity crisis. If he\u2019s really this good at manipulation, like I saw yesterday, then none of his words were real. His entire personality was fake.\n\nHe was standing there so willing, so confident about giving me passwords or proving his loyalty. But the moment I \u201cactually asked\u201d, he changed completely. He stalled, started arguing and gaslighting, clearly, anything to buy time. He tried deleting chats right in front of me, thinking I wouldn\u2019t notice, thinking he could gaslight me again. Maybe he was too frantic to cover his tracks this time, but it was so obvious. This time he was maybe too much in a panic to realise how evident his manipulation is or to control what I\u2019m thinking. And I know the coworker thing is just the one thing I happened to catch. The way he deleted other chats before giving me a bit of an access, it all proves there was so much more happening, in those months. Until now. \n\nThis has traumatized me to the point where I feel like nothing is real. Like I\u2019ll wake up and everything around me will be gone, like everything is in my head. I know this is just the trauma speaking, and hopefully, I\u2019ll be okay soon. But it has shaken me to my core. If this is true, then everything\u2014he\u2014was a lie.\n\nHow can someone be so convincing, so manipulative? For the first time in my life, I\u2019ve seen deception on this scale, and it\u2019s terrifying.\n\nIn a nutshell I observed so big of a contradiction between what he is portraying so confidently and the real truth. And now I don\u2019t know who he is.",

    "selftext": "I've (17M) liked this girl for far longer I'm willing to admit. She's the most intelligent (it's actually incredible), she's sweet as pie, with a sense of humour as good as silver, and she's gorgeous. She's objectively the best. She's in a league that's hers alone. But what\u00a0*actually*\u00a0makes her special is the sense of bliss and hope her presence creates.\n\nIn June 2024, my then-best friend started talking to her\u2014intimately\u2014just two weeks after he stopped begging his ex (who he'd been super manipulative &amp; toxic to) to take him back. I trusted him when he insisted I was just being paranoid. Then, two weeks in, he became her first boyfriend. She had once hated him but dismissed his past behaviour as \u201cjust alcohol and family problems.\u201d She believes he's the only one who understands her. He lied repeatedly, told her I liked her just before asking her out, and even lied that I had slapped him. I was humiliated. Looking back, he was always a sleazy friend.\n\nIt's been 9 months since. I've become increasingly lonely as I have to avoid most hangouts because for the sakes of my mental stability I cannot bear to be around my ex friend. The rest of my friend group seems unbothered. Neutrality is king.\n\nI feel I've been unremorsefully abandoned by everyone close to me in favour of some weasel who solely acts in self-interest with no regard for morality or empathy. I feel so disposable. It feel purposeless and as if the world were mocking all which I believe in. It's killing me. Every breath is exhausting. Living like this makes life itself unbearable.\n\nThe worst part is it's all my fault. I hate myself for it. I had so much time to be the one to connect with her, or even to just admit my feelings, but I never did. I promise it wasn't a lack of will but one of wit. I would've done anything, but I didn't know anything to do. I still don't really get the whole emotional connection thing. Maybe that's why I'm disposable.\n\nI don't know what to do with myself anymore, I'd appreciate any advice.",

    "selftext": "Throwaway acc. \n\nI F29 feel stuck in my life and feel sad. I\u2019ve felt like this for a number of years. In fact it started when I started my current role in healthcare after qualifying form university. I\u2019ve thought about a career change so many times and have dabbled in a few things but haven\u2019t fully dove into anything bc as much as I dislike my job, I\u2019m good at it and earn a decent salary. It\u2019s also a safe job. \n\nLong story short, I come from a poor working class background, mum with mental health issues, parents divorced and live separately. Mum is on benefits and dad works a minimum wage job. I come from a background where we don\u2019t just abandon our parents and I love them and want to help them. I\u2019m however an only child. \n\nI\u2019ve been married to an amazing person a number of years ago and as amazing as he is, he too is burdened with family issues. We also live with the in-laws. His mother became disabled last year and a lot of her care is depended on him. He also holds responsibility for his disabled sister as well. He does a lot for everyone; he\u2019s practically had to be the dad of the family since his dad wasn\u2019t around much when they were younger. But now I see it taking a toll on him and he won\u2019t admit it, only in snippets he says \u2018I sleep so much bc I\u2019m so stressed\u2019. I try to support him as much as I can, but he\u2019s doesn\u2019t want me to get more stressed with my family stress too.\n\nI believe my stress comes from having a poor relationship with money. But let\u2019s not deny that you need money to survive in this world. However, I feel this huge financial burden that I need to provide for my parents, especially as they near to pensioning ages and I really don\u2019t want their financial stress when we have children bc no doubt it will happen. \n\nI had a plan of my job role for this year and it was going to allow me to be in a higher position and earn more money. However, this now is either not going to happen or will be delayed. Then I questioned myself, do I even want it? Or am I doing it to save my family from poverty. \n\nThe problem is that I don\u2019t want know what I want to do. I went into this career path when I was younger but I regretted it so much. Due to stress I\u2019ve developed PCOS and I\u2019m 2st heavier than my previous baseline. I\u2019m always tired, my husband is always tired and I feel that we don\u2019t enjoy life as much bc of all responsibilities and we don\u2019t even have children yet!!! Adding children onto this will just cause misery I\u2019m sure of it \n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do. We\u2019re all trying our best but before being married, even in a relationship; when I felt stuck I would change my environment and look for things to do. I can\u2019t do it as much anymore bc it\u2019s not a me decision anymore it\u2019s a we decision and although we have plans to move out, we\u2019re saving up and you know what the housing market is like, so it will take a while.\n\nAnyways thanks for reading this if you got to the end \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd",

When it was the 5 of us and I was having troubles keeping up with the older ones, we would run around each town we lived in and just have fun. We'd walk to stores and parks, we even lived in a rural hot valley area (basically a desert) and would roam around and tell each other stories. \n\nWe'd have hang out spots with other kids and play until sundown. Then we'd sprint home because Mom told us to be home by the time the street lights are on and they were already on. \n\nI miss when my brothers were into drawing so we would all sit at the table and draw together. We'd also play board games, card games  (even poker lol) all day and have a blast. When we got a console we would sit and watch my brothers play games like Skyrim, Fall Out or we would play Halo 4 together. \n\nI hold all of these moments so close to me even though i don't talk to any of my siblings anymore. I can't bring myself to, not after the trauma we all went through. My mother was terribly abusive. It was always us against her. Then it became her against me because my older siblings moved out all at once and i became the focal point for her negative emotions. I'd be lying if i said i wasn't a little resentful about that. But i understand it now.\n\nI don't have any emotional connections to my siblings anymore, last time i was around all of them they all felt like strangers. I guess im \"emotionally estranged\". \n\nMy family is just really broken. I miss how it was before we all realized it. I think it was the realization that made everyone leave. \n\nI know the abuse was happening my entire childhood, but i miss what it's like having a sibling. \n\nI crave familial connections, it's why i'm so desperate to have my own family, but not with my mother and siblings. I guess I feel as if things are too fucked up to try to start over with them. \n\nI feel bad about it tho.

Being able to do nothing except watch it unfold broke me again and gave me an even bigger reason to never talk to my mom again. \n\nBut i can't even bring myself to contact that sibling.\n\nAnytime something bad happens to one of us it makes it harder for me to reach out. I'm not sure why but i know it's not normal \n\nI just miss being a kid and having people to depend on. it used to be us against the world but now it's just me.\n\nIt just gets lonely sometimes.",

Yesterday, my friend revealed to me that he's absolutely sure that my ex had a girlfriend he has been with for a variable time span (it could be three months, but also ten, surely less than a year though). This girl was the classic friend \"I didn't have to worry about\" and she's absolutely beautiful and also a really kind person. Obviously, he didn't bother to tell me and he cheated on her with me at least two or three times. This happened more than a year ago, and now I have a boyfriend, different friends and my life got significantly better, but I can't shake the feeling that he's treated me like a fool and he has been basically using me, when I've always thought he respected me. I don't know if I should tell her (not my circus), given that they're already broken up and that me and her are not friends, just acquaintances. Moreover, I've always felt insecure about her and \"inferior\", in a certain way, so I would just like to put this all behind me and forget about it.

    "selftext": "This is gonna sound completely irrational (it most likely is), but the title pretty much says It all.\n\nMy partner and I have been talking about trying to have kids at some point in the near future. I am very much excited at the idea of being a parent. But I have this... I don't know how to explain it, feeling of dread or apprehension that my children would not get the same treatment my nephew (my older sister's son) gets. \nHe's very much the baby of the house (which, fair, he's 3 years old. And I love him very much too), but I feel like he gets spoiled. A lot. He's very very possessive and his bad behaviours rarely ever get corrected because my sister goes ahead and makes a big scene about it any time someone that's not her tries to (even calmly) discipline her son.\n\nMy mom and dad absolutely adore him and do everything they can for him. \n\nI have no idea why but I have this fear my kids would not get the same treatment and affection he does. I know I sound completely insane, but I am genuinenly really struggling with the thought.",

    "selftext": "For context I\u2019m (17M) a student who studies maths, physics and chemistry, I recently started dating someone (17F) an artist. Her subjects are all art related except for business. In spending time with her I\u2019ve started to resent my own What crushed me was that her work was something she enjoyed and that brought her success and recognition but my work is something that drains me and that I\u2019ve been unsuccessful in for a long time. I keep comparing my life to her and saying I wish I had her life to her, which puts a strain on our relationship she said she finds me less attractive when I\u2019m like that but I can\u2019t stop thinking about how much better her life is to mine. \n\nEdit: thank you for all the responses, I\u2019ve already spoken to a school counsellor and she gave me the bare bones \u201cdon\u2019t compare yourself to anyone\u201d advice which is easier said than done. Secondly by success and recognition I mean that she won an art competition on national tv at a young age and is currently working on art piece that will be displayed in a museum. In recent times I\u2019ve been feeling hopeless about my own future because I don\u2019t think I enjoy maths as much as I used to and she made me realise that life would be a lot better if I enjoyed what I did, I just feel really depressed right now about it all",

I think I did it because I didn't find it taste and just did want to eat anything because my anxiety. But still I got used to this habit and almost always did it, nobody ever noticed it though so I was kinda feeling okay.\nBut I think I did it too much , so I now don't have any eating scadual and don't really eat much especially when at home. But I still don't know how to think about it really. Never told anybody about this so decided to post this her",

I know I shouldn't worry because I'm young and \"I still have a lot of time\" because whenever I post something similar on this app people tell me this. But I'm seriously starting to get worried. No one looks my way at all and everytime someone does, they get bored and ghost me. I think maybe I should stop looking and I'll find someone who is interested in me at all. The worst part is I'm not even looking for a long term relationship, I just want to have fun and I keep getting burned.

    "selftext": "I was really good at studies until my 6th standard. I studied at a really good school near my mother\u2019s house. But then I had to move to my real home with my father, mother, and brother. I joined a new school, and everything changed. I struggled to keep up with the new environment, and my schooling started falling apart. I became depressed.\n\nSomehow, I managed to pass my 10th through NIOS open school. Then I joined a government school for my 11th, but I fell into the wrong friendships. That led to me being sent off from school.\n\nHere comes the plot twist...\n\nAfter that, I was just sitting idle at home while my brother was doing his BTech in Biomedical Engineering from a well-known government college. My father had passed away by then, and I started feeling like a burden to my mother. I wanted to help her financially, so I started looking for jobs.\n\nFor two years, I worked multiple jobs\u2014petrol pump operator, hospital attender, security guard\u2014just trying to earn something.\n\nThen, in November 2019, after quitting my exhausting job as a hospital attender at the age of 19, I joined Delhivery as a courier delivery person. The job was insanely tough\u2014at least 30 deliveries per day for a salary of \u20b98,000 per month. I lasted two weeks before quitting and joining Swiggy as a delivery rider.\n\nSwiggy was fun at first. I was earning daily, spending recklessly on food and cigarettes, just living in the moment without thinking about the future.\n\nThen, two weeks later, everything changed.\n\nOne late night, around 11 PM, on my way back home, I met with a horrific accident. A truck carrying a full load of wood logs crashed into my bike.\n\nThat moment destroyed my life and shattered my mother\u2019s hopes.\n\nI was bedridden for 4 years. My injuries were severe\u2014multiple fractures, permanent damage to my hip and leg. The hospital treatment was not good enough, and recovery was extremely difficult.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t give up.\n\nAfter years of suffering, I finally started walking again. And now, I\u2019ve joined BCA online at Manipal University Jaipur to build a better future for myself. I\u2019m learning to code, and I want to use this opportunity to change my life.\n\nI don\u2019t know where this journey will take me, but I\u2019m not giving up.\n\nThanks for reading. I just wanted to share my story.",
