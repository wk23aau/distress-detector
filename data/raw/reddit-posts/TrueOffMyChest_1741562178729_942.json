    "content": "We were close friends when I was younger,  between 20 - 25, he's 5yrs older. I trusted him. He raped me while I was drunk, unconcious. I didn't talk to him much after that, only at his fathers funeral, and my dads 70th birthday, trying to act normal. No one knows what he did 15 years ago, well I guess my dad knows now.\n\nMy dad called me on friday, letting me know he's not well and my parents and brother will visit him today,  one last time. Asking me if I wanted to join them, I said let me think about it. Yesterday I told my dad no, I will not be there because cousin did something I can't forgive. My dad's the best, I saw his face change but he didn't ask or press for info. He said he understood.\n\nIt did rip open an old wound. Honestly the guy's been dead to me for so long. I buried what happened in the back of my mind. Kind of blamed myself for being dumb enough to get so drunk and trusting someone to not take advantage. Now I realize this wasn't my fault. Today he will figure out I do not forgive him and never will. He will rot in the ground and I will spit on his grave.",

    "title": "I wouldn’t marry my husband of 17 years if given a do-over.",
    "content": "Four years ago, I felt like I had achieved all goals, happiness, and was married to my best friend. For context, I (35f) and my husband (38m) have been married for 17 years. I met him as a teenager, we dated, and married promptly after my 18th birthday. I felt like we had really worked through a lot of issues to build a good marriage and life together. I don’t have a strong support system of people in my life, so it was just him and me against the world. Well, that changed, and I’ve been beating myself up about it for a while, and trying to navigate my feelings, or just ignoring them, idk. I started to have feelings for a co-worker (I know, typical). He has been a friend at work, and is married. There has been nothing romantic between us, and I don’t get any indication from him that he is interested in more. He has just been supportive as my co-worker and a friend, and that friendship doesn’t extend outside of work at all. I have no interest in pursuing a romantic relationship with him either. I don’t want to have infidelity in my marriage or try to convince someone else to be untrue. And breaking marriages for another person just means a worse marriage.\n\nThis has really led me to contemplate my life. Why, when everything was feeling so right, did I start catching feelings for someone else. I looked back at our relationship and started seeing all the negative. I questioned if I was just looking for reasons to justify how I felt. I came to the realization that our dating relationship was abusive (and early years of our marriage). More than just bad, or two stupid kids. He was very controlling, pushed sex on me before I was ready, and even used a sexual act two different times as “punishment” (that was painful). Anytime I’m alone with my thoughts, I think that so much of how I am today in my relationship with him was shaped by the bad times. He isn’t that person any more, he isn’t controlling, and treats me better overall. But, I don’t have friends, am scared to make him mad, scared to talk about my feelings, am super agreeable to avoid any conflicts. He has been explosive and mean in the past when he gets angry, although that hasn’t been too recently. (Nothing ever physical.) I still feel like a terrible person for thinking about another guy, and feel some blame for wallowing in the past. I think if I would do it all over, and there’s no way I would stay in the relationship if given a do over. If I had a daughter, I would teach her how to avoid this and reach out for help.\n\nI feel like my eyes have been opened to the truth of our past. I tried to bring it up with him by asking what he thought about our dating relationship. He said he doesn’t really think about it, and I said that I thought it was bad. I brought up some things, and he didn’t want to talk about it. He said he had apologized and I just hadn’t forgiven him for it. He got mad, and I got upset and cried. I remember him giving an apology several years ago, we both got drunk and he said he felt bad about things and I consoled him, but I’m just now realizing it was abusive. I wanted to get confirmation from him that he agreed it wasn’t a healthy relationship, just for healing. But there was nothing productive about it.\n\nI find myself lately being depressed and bottled up. I work full time and my husband hasn’t had a job for a few years now. I really don’t care if he works, but want him to contribute to our relationship in some way. Instead he spends a lot of time sitting around the house on his phone making a mess and spending excessive amounts of time on hobbies. And no, I don’t think there is any chance he is cheating. I think he is also depressed. My guilt and frustration are overwhelming. I love him and he loves me, but I’m spending too much time in my head not dealing with my feelings, just hoping things find their place and go back, even though I know that’s not likely. I know I could use counseling to work on past trauma and learn to be a better partner myself. So maybe I’ll finally do that.",

    "title": "*FINAL UPDATE* I 21F found out my husband 33M has been having an affair with my mother, and I don’t know where to go from here?",
    "content": "Hey so this will be my final update on everything as I believe the situation has finally come to an end and I’m in a really good place.\n\nI left off where I was in a shelter and had made a lot of friends. Well the girl who I was gonna move somewhere with she ended up going back to her Mom and step Dad, and so I was back to being stuck on what to do. That was until I got a message from my grandma that her mom (my great-grandma) needs someone to care for her, she said that her brother would be happy to have me stay with him as long as I care for my great grandma. I decided I have nothing left to lose and decided this would be a good gig till I find out what I wanna do. I arrived in Miami 3 days ago and have been enjoying it greatly so far. I never really knew my dad’s side as he wasn’t that close with his family and after he passed it was hard to keep contact. My great-uncle is very nice and very accommodating and his wife is really nice, they live in quite a nice part of Miami as well near the beach.\n\nI haven’t seen my great-grandma in over 10 years and she was so happy when she saw me. She can’t speak that much English as she only really speaks Spanish. I’m aware I said my dad was white, but that’s was only because I was scared of my identity being revealed and that wasn’t a 100% lie. My father was Cuban and was born and raised in Miami, however, he was most likely a descendant of Spaniards. Anyways, my great grandma has been teaching me Spanish and as well through the help of translating of my great uncle stories about my dad. She told me that he would fall asleep on her lap at family gatherings and how he would make the whole family laugh imitating her accent. It made me tear up seeing all the photos of him as a kid with his whole family. She told me that when he got on drugs and ran away from home, it left everyone in complete distraught. She claimed my grandma would cry everyday.\n\nMy Mom never had a relationship with them, and that was her choice they wanted to meet her actually. They told me that they weren’t shocked what happened to me as my Dad told them later on my mom would cheat on him all the time with other men. This made me furious as my mom always claimed my dad was her “soulmate.”\n\nI have not heard anything from my mom, however, my cousins wedding went ahead yesterday as my aunty posted it on Facebook. My mom was there and she seemed completely fine from the photos. The wedding looked boring anyways, my cousin is marrying his first cousin from Pakistan (in-laws side) and no one is smiling. It made me laugh actually seeing my mom with all these people who are deeply religious and conservative. Seeing my mom next to my grandma and other female relatives who wear scarfs and are deeply religious, compared to my mom who sleeps with anyone that gives her an ounce of attention really cracks me up.\n\nAlso no word from my EX-husband, however, his sister sent me a text apologising on behalf of her and his parents.\n\nSo yeah that’s the end I believe I’m taking care of my great-grandma and will work out what I wanna do in the mean time. This will most likely (hopefully) be the final update as I believe I’m in a really good place.",

    "content": "When I was around 12 I touched my dad in his sleep. It happened like two more times until one time he woke up and I just pretended to sleep. So I knew what I was doing is wrong. For a little bit of background although I don’t want to justify anything my dad is a huge narcissist asshole. Abusive towards my mom and sister he hit them and they were more than often afraid for their lives. He also sexually assaulted my mother when she denied him sex and she was always very tired the next day. He watched openly pornographic content on the tv in the living room. While me and my sister as children were seeing this and when my mother confronted him I still remember him saying that he has to get his arousal somewhere. Also I vaguely remember while till I was 12 I came in the night in my parents bedroom to sleep there when I got scared and almost always he made sexual advances towards my mother and i interrupted him to sleep in between them. I also remember i kept going to sleep with them even when i was 12 and no longer scared to sleep alone just to protect my mother since my dad didn’t let her sleep in peace and continued sexually assaulting here. So I strongly feel all this played a part why i suddenly touched my dad in his sleep. I don’t know but something psychologically happened as a result but to this day i still feel bad about it and disgusted with my self and have a hard time understanding my own sex drive since i only associate it with bad things. I also don’t want to talk about it with my sister or mom since they are both already traumatized enough I don’t want burden them with another thing. So I don’t know maybe some of you guys could help me process this or give some advice. Thanks\n\nEdit: Thanks guys your comments helped me a bit. I‘m starting therapy in two weeks because I noticed my thoughts became too much to bear for myself. My sister is a bit older than me and around my age she started to attempt and it was up to me to stop her but I don’t want the same for me. But I wasn’t sure I could ever bring this topic up in therapy out of fear of judgement from the therapist since I am so disgusted with myself i only found it logical to expect the same from others.",

    "title": "My (F23) friends think my boyfriend is a predator and want me to break up with him",
    "content": "I (F23) grew up as one of the oldest in my family, so I practically raised my younger siblings. I never really had a childhood I was always the responsible one, making decisions and taking care of everything. I’ve always been independent, maybe even a little on the masculine side. My parents were either working or not really present, so I took on the role of babysitter and homemaker. Between school, work, and looking after my siblings, I never had time to just enjoy life. No boyfriends, no social life just responsibility.\n\nNow that my siblings are older and independent, I finally moved out to focus on myself. That’s when I decided to try Hinge, and I matched with this guy (M32). We hit it off right away and have been dating for almost eight months now. He’s handsome, intelligent, kind, nurturing, and, for the first time in my life, I feel like I have someone I can truly depend on. It’s a feeling I never knew I needed.\n\nBut over the past three months, I’ve noticed some changes. He started calling me his good little girl at first, it caught me off guard. I even cringed a little. But at the same time, I felt this weird, unexpected warmth from it. Like a part of me liked it, even though I didn’t understand why.\n\nHe also started buying me cute, feminine dresses and pretty heels things I would never have picked for myself. I was hesitant at first, but when I tried them on, I actually felt beautiful. Feminine. I was shocked by how much I loved it.\n\nThen there are things like he packs me lunch on his days off and drops it off before I go to work, even though I usually just eat at the cafeteria. No one has ever made me lunch before, and it makes me feel so cared for in a way I didn’t realize I was missing.\n\nHe even brushes my hair. I have really long hair, and he’ll braid it for me sometimes. I thought I would hate it, but now I love it. I crave it. There’s this part of me that never got to experience these kinds of gentle, affectionate moments, and I feel like I’m healing in ways I can’t even explain.\n\nHe pats my head, gives me so much affection, and honestly, I feel like I’m going to explode from happiness.  He’s so patient and gentle with me.\n\nEven our sex life has changed it’s filled with love and praise. I never knew how much I would love being praised. It makes me feel so happy, like I just want to be my best for him.  I do whatever I can to make him happy.\n\nI know this all sounds a little strange. In a way, he feels like a father figure, but obviously not in a weird way. I don’t see him as my dad or anything like that, but I don’t know how else to explain it. I never thought I’d have a daddy (if that makes sense).\n\nI told my two close friends about us and they said how it’s creepy and wrong and I should break up with him before it’s too late, calling him a predator. Also I am too inexperienced to know better.  They said how they don’t know me anymore because I changed a lot.\n\nYes I I have changed, I dress more feminine and I feel pretty.  I’ve always been the yes girl in our friendship but  lately I’ve been creating boundaries and more vocal about what I want sometimes and apparently it’s creating friction in our group. And due to that I’m now self centred they are icing me out unless I listen to them.\n\nThis is the happiest I’ve been in my life and I’m sad they can’t see that. I don’t know what to do.\n\nEdit: I am financially stable with out without him.\n\nTL;DR I’m dating an older guy and my friends think he’s a predator because of our age gap and how he treats me. Now they want me me to break up with him.",

    "title": "I was in an aya cult. I told his wife and she didnt believe me.",
    "content": "After returning home from an ayahuasca ceremony, I got a message from a friend of mine whom I considered a \"spiritual brother\". He wanted to meet up. I was still in that post-ceremony glow—full of energy despite the late hour—and I wanted to socialize.\n\nI live down a long dirt trail, a 15-minute walk from the nearest road. When I got there, he was waiting in his SUV. I was excited to talk with him. Right away, he offered me some hard liquor, saying, “This is what the indigenous people drink here! It’s very good for you.” But I had just returned from drinking ayahuasca, and he knew that. He wasn’t speaking clearly, but he started telling me stories about indigenous cosmology, which fascinated me—until the conversation took a turn.\n\nHe began talking about how husbands take other women and how normal it is. Then he told me he needed someone “spiritually on his level” so they could have a deeper connection than with their actual partners.\n\nI told him flat out I wasn’t interested. But I kept asking questions. Does your wife know about these ‘practices’ you do?\n\n“No, no,” he said, “but it’s better for her. Better for me too. And for our children.”\n\nHe started going on about how we don’t marry the people we are equal to—we marry the ones who are good for having kids. That real spiritual connection is with extramarital lovers. He kept inflating my ego, using spiritual talk to manipulate me. I asked if he had done this before.\n\n“I’ve done it many times,” he admitted. “With many different women.”\n\nThen he put his hand on my leg. I told him I was leaving. But I made the mistake of trying to stay friendly.\n\n“Let me just show you one thing before you go,” he said.\n\nHe stopped me behind the car and hugged me. That’s when I froze. Trauma hit me like a wave. This wasn’t the first time something like this had happened to me, and suddenly, I was simultaneously trapped in his arms and in my past.\n\nHe pulled me tightly against him, ran his hand down my back, onto my hindquarters. At the same time, he started kissing me—lightly, from my ear down to my collarbone. My stomach churned with nausea. I squirmed to get away. He let go. I was in full trauma response, barely able to hold back tears. Then he begged me not to tell his wife. I barely managed a goodbye before I ran back up the hill to my house, praying he wasn’t following me.\n\nA few days later, I saw his wife. Despite my own pain, I felt it was my duty to tell her the truth about her husband. Never mind my trauma—this was her husband. She deserved to know.\n\nAt first, she seemed to believe me. But later that day, I got a message from her. She repeated all his lies. He told her I subconsciously wanted to be with him. That based on our messages, I must have known it was going to be romantic.\n\nBut that couldn’t be further from the truth!!\n\nI was completely blindsided. Now, looking back, I understand things I didn’t back then. At the time, I was in a cult. I believed that everyone in it was a good person, incapable of this kind of thing. If it were me now, I’d know better. I’d understand that if a married man asks a woman to meet him at 2 AM, he’s not looking to talk about life. Full stop.\n\nToday, I saw both of them.\n\nSeeing him again brought everything back- how he lied, how he got away with it, how his wife believed him over me. The anger and pain hit me like a tidal wave. I wanted to punch his stupid mouth, to do something, to make him face the truth of what he did. I even had a thought of role-playing the situation in front of his wife-forcing her to see it so she would understand. But I know deep down, no matter what I do, she probably won't believe me. He has her wrapped in lies. And I'm the one left carrying all of this. I've been crying all day. I feel so much anger, hurt, and grief. I don't know how to process this.",

    "content": "My husband wanted a dog, and I had never had one before. I’ve had plenty of pets in the past: cats, rabbits, and fish, and I loved each one of them deeply. So, we decided to get a dog.\n\nHe did the work of finding the exact dog he wanted, and we drove three hours to adopt her. Even though he took on most of the feeding, exercising, playing, and training, she bonded to me. The bond feels like an obsession. When I’m around, my husband doesn’t exist to her. She never wants to be more than three feet away from me, and often, she’s touching me.\n\nWhen I need a break, I go into the bedroom and shut the door. She just sits outside, waiting. I can put her in the office with my fiancé on the other side of the house, and then go to the bedroom and shut the door. But she waits at the office door, whining and whimpering. My husband tries to interact with her, but she doesn’t care. She just wants me. And I can’t handle this level of attention. You can take her outside, but if she knows I’m inside, she won’t leave the door. If I leave, she panics. A few minutes later, she calms down and does her own thing. She never bothers my husband this much.\n\nI’ve heard mothers talk about feeling “touched out” with toddlers, and that’s exactly how I feel with my dog. The difference is, I don’t think she’ll ever grow past this stage. She’s a dog. We’ve worked with trainers to help her become more independent, but it doesn’t seem to work.\n\nI’m thankful that there’s more nuance in the “adopt, don’t shop” movement. Sometimes, it might actually be better to get a dog from an ethical breeder, as shelter dogs can come with their own set of challenges. My dog has trauma, and that trauma will stay with her for life. It shows up in our relationship, where we’re in a sort of quasi-codependence. It’s frustrating because she’s fine when I’m not around. My husband can take her places, and she’s as happy as can be. If I’m not home, she’s completely relaxed. It’s only when I’m around that she becomes obsessed with me. I don’t get to experience the playful, silly dog everyone else sees because, in my presence, she’s consumed with me.\n\nMy husband takes her to his brother’s farm, and he sends me videos of her. It breaks my heart because I want to see that happy, playful dog too. I want a dog I can sit outside with, playing with toys and rolling in the dirt, without her needing to touch my leg at all times. But I never get that dog. I love her so much, but her constant affection drowns me.\n\nI look forward to when she goes to the farm because I get to be home without her on top of me. I don’t love my job, but I dread going home because, at least at work, I get some alone time.\n\nI love my dog, but I don’t like being around her.",

We share the same room and bed, I felt his hands on me. I don't know why, but I stayed completely still. I could've stopped him, I could've yelled or pushed him away-but my brain just froze. I just lay there and took it.\n\nAfter about 5-10 minutes, I decided to \"fake waking up\" very slowly so he would stop. And he did.\n\nI felt disgusting. I wanted to tell my mom, but he's her favorite, and I was terrified she wouldn't believe me. So, I kept quiet and hoped it would never happen again.\n\ni decided not to and hopped he'd stop.

    "content": "Throwaway account because I don’t want anyone I know to see this. This is something I’ve only ever told one person and I feel deeply uncomfortable to even tell a therapist.\n\nFor context: I have never been a victim of sexual abuse physically, was raised in a super healthy home life, etc. Nothing traumatic has ever happened to me due to another person I personally knew.\n\nWhen I was younger, I purposely would go on a site called KidzChat. I knew that predators would be on that site, and would advertise myself as someone to talk to “F 12”. I was around the ages of 10-14 doing this. Older men would then message me super sexually explicit things. We would sext for a while and eventually trade Skypes to talk or videochat. The biggest instance that I remember was skyping an older man who wanted to show me his jumping jacks. He would jump for a while and then his pants would conveniently fall off.  For some reason that moment is engrained in my mind. I know I’m a victim fully, but I feel weird because I went out looking for it? I guess that’s the cost of unlimited Internet access.\n\nAnother entirely separate thing that bothers me severely, is that one day (aged 11) I had my family dog perform oral on me. The dog didn’t need any coaxing, it liked the smell and went up to it. I remember it feeling awful and I felt so intensely guilty afterward. I never did it again, but I realize that this has deeply affected me as an adult. I absolutely cannot receive oral from a man because it reminds me of what I did with my family dog. This fact genuinely haunts me as I know it was completely wrong and animal.\n\nI don’t even know how to cope with both of these facts as I was a victim and perpetrator. These things still affect me in my sexual life now manifesting as intense fear and guilt to commit certain normal sexual acts with people like being eaten out, sexting my boyfriend, etc. I know I don’t have the guts to tell a therapist either.",

    "content": "I worked for Child Protective Services in a metropolitan area of the US for 12 years. I did both long term case management and later investigations that led to the removals of children. With about a decade of time and reflection, I’ve come to realize the following:\n\nI was a young woman with lots of privilege who did not understand the lives or needs of the people over whose lives I made decisions for.  This now causes me great pain.\n\nTurns out I was dissociating through most of it due to secondary trauma and moral injury. The ability to dissociate (although we just saw it as toughing through back then) was seen as showing that you were a great worker and could “get shit done”.\n\nI wanted to do good in the world and I wanted to help children. And I did. But I also caused harm because I had too many cases, not enough supervision and no real self-awareness.\n\nIt took years of therapy to understand and grieve the harm I had caused and the harm caused to me. I don’t even remember the first few years of my children’s lives because I was so dissociated. I often have to look at a photos to remember events with them.\n\nI still get flashbacks of things I was exposed to and am swapped with pain.\n\nSometimes it all comes back. Just this week, I was contacted by a former colleague and a child who was on my caseload many years ago.\n\nThe colleague reminded me of a child death case we worked on. It was particularly searing because we both had children that were about the same age as the child who died.\n\nShe also reminded me about the death of another colleague (through an aneurism) and the suicide of a couple others. Yes, our work had a death count.\n\nThe girl, now an adult, reached out to me to say she is doing well and to thank me for helping her find an adoptive home.\n\nIt’s a mixed bag. And these memories reinforce in me the idea that nothing in life is guaranteed and I’m just trying to do the best I can each day. I screw up and I repair where I can. I put kindness and compassion into everything I do, but that isn’t always enough.\n\nI don’t really have a purpose for this post. Just wanted to get it off my chest.",

Mexicans, woman, good people. Social Security? Medicaid?\" (I assume he was expressing worry about the continued existence of both programs.)\n\nI just wish I could speak Persian so we could understand each other better.

    "content": "I(F28) and my former friend G( F30) meet during our first term in university, we both came from the same area and went to the same school at one point. We clicked and became really good friends from there. I was an insecure 19 year old at that time and she was outgoing and active in our version of sorority. I was invited to outings that I actually enjoyed and began to build up some confidence. We both had our share of mental problems understood each other, but after taking diffrent courses we stopped meeting as regularly but she always said that I was one of her closest friends.\n\nIn 2020, I became sick. Really heavy burnout, Crohn dieses and bulimia that made me unable to stay in town. I moved back home and slowly began to rebuild my life and health. Now in 2025, I am still sick, but way better and have control of my mental problems. During the last five years I wrote to G every time I went to the university city, asking to meet up and if I could, I set the dates of my travel after her schedule to make sure we could meet(it’s a 5h drive). Every time she said she would love to, and if she was available we booked a date and time. But almost always something happened or she double booked that she remembered 1 day to 1h before. During these five years, we have meet up twice and I have probably asked her around 10 times since I usually go twice a year.  She never wrote to me when she visited her parents or asked me when I was going down next time, which I realise now was a clear sign that I ignored. I once wrote and asked her if she didn’t want to meet up, it was okey and I would understand, time changes people and friendship does not always last. She denied it and said she very much wanted to meet up and I accepted the answer. Telling me how horrible of a friend she is and how sorry she is.\n\nTwo years ago I had a major breakdown when G cancelled on me again. I had been so excited and when she cancelled I was heartbroken. Walking is my coping strategy, especially with heavy emotions, even after 10km I did not stop crying. I was living with another friend  for that weekend and I fully broke down in the end and told her everything. They had never suspected anything cause I always spoke so well off her. She  apparently told my other friends who all are mad on my behalf.\n\nG sent me a snap in May 2024, with the caption ”In exactly one year we are getting married” with a picture on her fiancé. I congratulated her, but I had no idea about their engagement before that. I decided to one last try and asked her of a time during the summer we could meet up, with my vacation weeks in mind. She responded and we decided a week  were she was free, for details to be determined later. As it approached I wrote 1 week before and told her the days, no response. When I finally was at the hotell I wrote again and told her how long I was there and times when I was booked. My friends were a bit angry at me for trying again but I said that this will be the last time.\n\nOne day after I came home from the trip she responded with how sorry she was for not answering. I had enough and told her how I felt through the years, I was nice and civile even said I should have brought it up earlier and not just unload it all now, even asked my friends to read before sending. G answered and told me she understood why I felt like that, I ended it with that if she wanted to meet, she would have to text or call me now, cause I was tired of this being so one sided.\n\nGuess what - not heard from her since. Now I see pictures from the wedding preparations like the baccalaureate and dress fitting and I feel so sad. Probably I had a delusion hope deep inside that I would get an invite and that she would text me. This quenching the last hope of ever being friends again and telling me how little I meant and what friends mattered to her.\n\nMy friends supports my feelings even my boyfriend, but I just feel like I never meant anything. If they are real friends they will make time for you, I know, but in my head I go through all those memories and just wonder if I could have done anything different. Been a better friend, written more, called or if I just was the burden I always was scared of being, also wishing I not been so delusional and naive.\n\nSorry for the long post❤️",

    "content": "Recently my sister got engaged, and she asked me to be a part of her bridal party. Initially I was very excited to have a role in her wedding, kind of still am, but now I'm feeling iffy because she invited our brother, who I don’t have a positive relationship with.\n\nFor context, I’m the youngest out of the three of us and we were raised by a single mother who worked a lot. Because of this, my sister took a lot of responsibility over us when our mother couldn’t. She’s like a second mother to me and my brother even though she shouldn’t have been. My brother, on the other hand, was kind of a weirdo growing up. He dressed alternatively and had “nerdy” interests, something that younger-me at the time thought was really cool, and was all around awkward.\n\nI was maybe 8 and he was 14 when he started getting curious with his body, and that eventually led to him sexually assaulting me. It didn’t happen for long, thank god, but the experience left a disgusting stain on me. Eventually I realized that what had happened to me was wrong, and it wasn't until I was 13 that I finally had the chance and courage to talk to someone.\n\nI was removed from my home and placed in a children’s psych unit, and my case was being handled by a social worker. Of course, they informed my mother, who then told a few others, my sister included. I didn’t know this at the time, but some of the adults around her pressured her into convincing me to recant my statement. So when she visited me, she asked me to do just that. I was obviously so betrayed and angry, she was my role model and the one person I relied on the most at the time. I can’t recall the rest of our conversation, I just remember leaving the visitation area and completely losing it in my room.\n\nBut I was young, impressional, and ruminating a lot at this time, so I did end up recanting my statement. My case worker didn’t agree with my decision but respected it anyway. For the sake of procedure, my case was still investigated, but without the victim’s statement it fell through. It didn’t erase anything that happened to me, but it felt like it did with how everyone else around me went about their lives like nothing happened. It was jarring and fucked with my head, and I slowly started believing that I made the whole thing up for attention. My memory wasn’t the best, and it could’ve just been a messed up dream I had. I started feeling disgusted and I couldn’t trust myself anymore, and I began spiraling.\n\nFastward to when I was 17, I was hospitalized for almost taking my life. For some reason, this was much more serious than before. I was finally put on medication and was put into a program for other at-risk teens. It was through group therapy I started thinking about getting closure for myself, so after a lot of mental and emotional preparation, I confronted my brother. At the last minute I decided to record the conversation without him knowing, and I actually got a confession. I went to my social worker, and after a few days he was removed from the house.\n\nAfter that, I was both relieved and stressed by the events that came next. To be honest I didn’t follow too closely with the court proceedings, I couldn’t bring myself to care what happened to him, all I remember was being interviewed by SVU and getting monthly check ups by social services. But the whole ordeal was mentally and emotionally draining for me and my family. My mom couldn’t believe it at first, and briefly experienced religious psychosis, but no one took it harder than my sister. I guess she felt guilty, because 1) such a serious thing happened between two of her siblings right under her nose, and 2) she didn’t have my back when I first came forward about it. I don’t blame her, or anyone really, for not noticing what was happening. I can’t bring myself to blame anyone, no one wants to believe that someone you love is capable of something as horrible as sexual assault.\n\nA few years have passed since then, and I’ve been working on improving my mental health. My sister was my rock throughout the process, the most understanding of me and my circumstances, and after a while I thought I had made peace with the whole situation, until her wedding. My sister’s decision to invite our brother, after years of no-contact between the two of us, kind of blindsided me. Not because I didn’t expect her to, but because she didn’t tell me. Now here’s the thing, I would never ask my sister to choose between me or our brother. I understand that she loves the both of us despite what had happened, so to ask her to do that wouldn’t be fair. But I would’ve liked a heads-up. I had to ask her myself if he was coming, and I’m glad I did. The thought of walking into the venue and seeing him in the crowd without warning would’ve sent me into a panic.\n\nAnd because of this I started to rethink my relationship with her. She’s done a lot for me, and I’ll go as far as to say that she has a bigger impact on me than our mother does. I want to give her some grace for this, but I still feel so uncomfortable with his presence. He’s also still in good standing with our extended family, who don’t know of the situation, so the possibility of them joking around and having fun with him without knowing what he’s done doesn’t sit right with me.\n\nI most likely won’t do anything regarding my sister’s wedding because I don’t want to ruin her big day, but it’ll probably change the way I see her. Like I said, I won’t ask her to choose between me or him, but that doesn’t mean I can’t. It’s a scary realization that my relationship with my sister can change, I really don’t want it to, but I can’t ignore how she’s willing to look past what our brother has done to me when I haven’t. I want to start by having a proper conversation with her about this first though, after the wedding. I want to fully understand her side of the story and her perspective before making this big decision.\n\nI honestly don’t know what to expect or hope for, but I feel like if I don’t do something then all the improvement I’ve made will come undone and I don’t think I’ll recover this time.",

(bad decision imo, but whatever)\n\nmy dad and mom managed to run a very successful business. like upper class stuff. they got married and had me. (20m). ive always thought that i had a very spoiled life. being able to afford things most people would kill for and even going to an expensive private school.\n\nmy dad did not pay a single penny for child support. it was my MOM who sends his ex wife money. keep in mind, i was kept in the dark about this until my parents eventually divorced when i was 13-14 for reasons i dont feel comfortable explaining. i was eventually told that i have half siblings from my dad's previous marriage. and what's worse is learning that they are financially struggling, all because of my dad abandoning his own family just to have me. and now? he did the same with me. i havent seen my dad in months now and we are living with less money than we had.\n\ni feel guilty. the fact that i was born into a family where i was fed with a silver spoon, while not knowing the financial struggles my half siblings are in. if my dad was not an asshole, i wouldn't've existed by now.\n\nto add salt to the wound. my dad remarried and tried conceiving a baby through IVF. i was so fucking pissed hearing that. he abandoned my 2 older half siblings to have me, and now hes abandoning me for an ivf baby?\n\nmy mom says that despite all of this, i should still love my father as \"hes your father afterall\" but i just cant.  i really... really... cant....",

I'd like to seek therapy, but it isn't feasible for me at the moment. I think that some amount of it has to do with abandonment issues.

Most of my memories are filled with babysitters, while she was living it up, school bullying and therapists, while she refused to believe that any of my problems stemmed from my relationship with her.\n\nUs moving often because of school bullying and money problems also prevented me from creating lasting friendships.\n\nI've been slowly working through my own trauma with a therapist, and now live several hours away from her, and now I work a full time job as a news producer, thanks to one of my amazing former professors.\n\nMy older brother not biological is in his 40s and met my mother when he was in his late 20s. She couldn't legally adopt him but was moved by his story and took him in as a son. He spent some time with us when I was 7 and 8, but ultimately moved to begin his own life. From there, he would be someone I saw in every blue moon. My mother would talk about him a lot, but I never really knew who he was, and still don't.\n\nHe's in his late 40s now and lives in Canada with his family. He absolutely adores my mother and never challenges her on anything despite the way she talks about him and his family to me in private. They talk on a daily basis, and my mother will try to guilt trip me by bragging about how much he loves her and talks to her on a daily basis.\n\nHe use to force himself to connect with other people in my mothers biological family, but stopped when she moved to the U.S., and when my aunt who would often coax him out, passed away from cancer in 2022.\n\nHis relationship with any other family member besides my mother is more out of obligation and love for my mother, and that's how it's been with me for a long time.\n\nHe's basically been a stranger to me my entire life. He never reaches out to me, has never sent me a birthday card, and if he does reach out, it's usually because it has something to do with my mother. My mother excuses and enables his actions by blaming them for his early upbringing.\n\nAll my attempts to build a relationship with him have ended in silence, despite even my mothers own attempts to get us closer. It just won't happen.\n\nHe himself has only seen my mother a couple of times within the last 10-15 years. Whenever something has happened with my mother, medically, I have to be the one constantly giving him updates. My mother says he has money problems, but I find that hard to believe, especially when he's been getting expensive remodeling work done on his house for the last couple of years.\n\nA couple years ago to please my mother, he started doing these weekly Zoom videos with my mother and I, and it's 100% clear it's just a way for him to show my mother that he is making an effort to get closer with me, and even then he's barely engaged. Now it's my mother or I that have to start the video chats.\n\nI'm getting emotionally tired of the charades and have decided to distance myself from him, but I am in the process of not letting my mother guilt trip me when I know I've done nothing wrong.\n\nI started therapy once I found out my birth mother, who would be 47, passed away not too long ago. My biological grandmother is still alive, and I have 4 biological brothers. I hope to reconnect with them someday soon.",

    "content": "I've only told maybe 2 people for my entire life about this, but it's been weighing on me recently. I feel like I need to just shout to the void about it.\n\nI(28M) befriended one of my teachers when I was 14. At the time, he was 35. For more background, I was F at the time (now FtM). He was my middle school teacher and when I switched schools, I added him on Facebook. It wasn't until around my freshman year of high school that we really started to talk.\n\nAt first, I basically harassed him, sending him messages daily, until he started to reply and it became conversational. After about a year, we began messaging each other daily. It was never anything inappropriate; we mainly talked about games, music, art, daily life, etc. (normal friendly type conversation). We never hung out or met up or anything. The only time I saw him after he was my teacher was one time at a school event.\n\nI lived in an abusive home and was a very lonely kid. I always figured he sensed that and that I just needed/wanted someone to talk to who actually cared. He became what I still consider to be my best friend at the time. I eventually started to have feelings for him because of this. I still remember telling him how I felt, and him saying something along the lines of \"I'm very flattered, but that's not appropriate\". The conversation dwindled a bit after that, but some time passed and we picked back up our daily conversations.\n\nOne morning, I woke up to see my father on my computer, snooping through my messages with this former teacher. I freaked out and told him this. We ended up exchanging numbers and started texting because of this.\n\nA while went by (a few months, if I remember right), we continued our friendship and daily conversations. Something happened and my parents took my phone (I can't exactly remember why they took it). I went to lunch with a friend one day, and when I got home, both of my parents were there and I knew something was wrong (they divorced and hated each other). They confronted me about my teacher and I's friendship, saying they \"[knew] everything\". My father had texted him through my phone, telling him to cease contact and threatening to report him to the school board if he ever tried talking to me again. I was heartbroken hearing this and knowing I'd never speak to him again. My parents claim he was \"grooming\" me, but I never felt that way. He felt more like a dad or an uncle, and treated me almost as his kid. Plus, as mentioned before, I basically harassed this man into talking to me. I always got the feeling he just kind of felt bad for me, especially looking back on our conversations and this situation as an adult.\n\nI never spoke with him again after that. It was somewhat of a traumatic experience for me, but only because someone I really cared about just suddenly vanished from my life and I felt as though I had nearly ruined his life because I was a lonely kid. The loss I experienced changed me as a person and the way I view all relationships.\n\nI still think of him often. I want to reach out and ask him how he is, and tell him how sorry I am for putting him in such a bad situation. It's just been so long and I don't want to dredge up the past, especially when I'm sure it was also traumatic for him.\n\nI don't know how to move on when it ended so abruptly and so badly. I have dreams of running into him on the street and getting my opportunity to tell him I'm sorry and hear how he dealt with things afterward.",

The driver, a super nice guy from Pakistan, shared with me that he is fasting and he will only get to have water or something to eat after 6pm. So what do I do? I get all excited about Pakistani food and ask him to tell me what are his favorite dishes from his hometown. Then I proceed to describe in excruciating detail all my favorite dishes from my country. Recipes, mouthwatering ingredients, the whole thing. By the time I realized that he must be starving (it was 4pm after all), I was already rambling for about an hour already. I apologized immediately and he was super nice about it, but this doesn't make me less of an idiot.\n\nSo after this great success, fast forward to a few hours later - I am on the plane, seated near  the back, squeezed into the middle seat. We are about to depart, the plane is on the move and I realize that my seatbelt gets loose without me lifting the little lever thingy. I ask for assistance and the flight attendant tells me \"Don't worry, the seatbelt will work later\". So I ask him \"How is this possible...?\", thinking that I really don't do well during flights, that I used to get panic attacks, that I managed to control after a lot of therapy and <<OMG I am about to fly and if something happens I will break my neck crashing on the roof of the plane!!!>>.\n\nHe sighs, then tells me he will replace the belt and goes away. Comes back after a minute or so and he says that the plane needs to depart and that there is no time, they will need to move me. There is quickly some commotion, all the flight attendants make some signals to each other and they find me a free row at the front. So I thank them profoundly, I apologize for the last minute chaos that I caused and go to my new princess seat, but the window with extra legroom that I didn't pay for. I sit down, I put the seatbelt on.... and I realize that the new seatbelt ALSO gets loose if I push the metal thing! I test it out a little bit and then it hits me. If I just pull the belt, it stays locked. If I put my finger under the metallic thing and push slightly it gets loose. So that means that I did all this.... for no reason.\n\nI close my eyes and start thinking that it can't be that I'm so inconsiderate today. And how embarrassing. Meanwhile I'm doing my breathing exercises trying to relax. There is turbulence today and my mouth is dry, I can't handle it anymore. I open my eyes and soon as I see the flight attendant handing out chocolates, I ask for some water. She says \"I will check if we still have\", and I'm thinking \"Oh wow, how strange! It can't be that they don't have at least one bottle\". Quickly she comes back, hads me one and finally I drink some water. \"Finally I can try to relax\", I'm thinking. Then I realize must have dropped the chocolate she gave me. I start looking around and then I look to my left and I freeze. On the seat next to me there is yet another water bottle that the flight attendants must have left for me while I was trying to \"breathe iiiiin, hooooold, exhaaale, the plane is safe the plane is safe the plane is safe\".\n\nSo that's it. This is another successful day. I am sitting here patiently, writing this to distract myself and I think I will post as soon as we land.\n\nThank you for listening to my rambling dear reader <3",

He would put Asian music videos on in the living room and I would sing and dance to the songs all day long. I was 4. I was a sociable outspoken singing daddy's girl and I loved people because they would dote on me. What I'm really trying to say here is, at 4, I could recognize humans and human beings.\n\nMy dad took me over to his buddy's house. His buddy had two sons. One was about 7 and the other son was about 4 as well. While he and his buddies were hanging out downstairs, the older boy (7) showed me a book his dad had of naked people in all sorts of sexual positions, kind of like a Kama Sutra. He proceeded to usher me into a closet and took off all my clothes. My dad found me naked in the closet and helped me put all my clothes back on and we went home.\n\nAt around 5 years old, I woke up one morning and looked around. My little brother was sleeping in a separate bed in the same room as me. As you know and as I have mentioned above, I loved watching TV because of the music videos, and because of Barney and other things I would watch on TV. So this somber morning, I woke up, walked to my parents room and they were sleeping and I didn't want to wake them up. I walked back to my room where my brother was sleeping. We had a TV in our room and laying around on the floor were a VHS tapes. So I picked one up and popped it in. It was a porn tape. I remembered the naked people from the book that one kid had showed me and this porn tape had the same people. Naked and actively doing things. I somehow knew it was bad. So I turned down the volume, and I watched the whole thing instead of taking out the VHS. Let's just say, curiosity killed the cat and I was the very curious kitten.\n\nThen around the same year, at 5 years old, I was molested by my uncle. He was living in the same house as us in the basement. It happened (to my memory) one time and one time only. I knew what had happened to me the moment it happened. I knew something bad had happened to me, and I knew what sex was but I just didn't know the exact words for what everything was.\n\nThat is my 7-layor carrot cake story. Not exactly 7 layers but it just seems that bad things of a sexual nature kept making its way into my very short life and I came out on the other side too knowing, and too knowledgable way too soon. Every day I wish I had had the chance to be innocent and to be trusting of others and of people. I wish I had the chance to be a happy-go-lucky kid unburdened. But I was denied that. I grew up with no friends at all because of the amount of guilt I felt. The fact I understood sex at such a young age, and being molested, it was like an awkward secret I just kept inside. But secrets weight on you. Even if you don't think they do. It's a physical manifestation and I was not the beautiful child I always wished I was. I was dark, and small, and always was a little heavier than other girls. Because of all those reasons, I still have no friends, I have never made a friend. I still have extremely low self-esteem paired with a high body count.\n\nI'm just not normal. It feels this way at all times. I always stick to myself and I never look anyone in the eye. The shame.\n\nI also want to note, to anybody that was raised around too many males. Just don't. It's not safe for any parent with a small female child to be around that many men/males all at once and even if you \"trust\" them I would say you should always have a considerable amount of doubt and remove your child from danger or harm.",

    "title": "My partner is completely irresponsible with money and I'm considering breaking up",
    "content": "I apologize in advance for any grammar/spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.For context: me (27F) and my bf (25M) have been in a relationship for 5 years and living together in my father's house for 4 (in my country living costs are really high so it's pretty common to still stay with your parents beyond your 20's).At the end of last year my bf decided he needed a new phone for posting content (tiktok and reels) since his current phone's camera wasn't good and his career (gym instructor/ personal trainer) could use a boost from social media. While I agreed that a new phone with a better camera would help and I knew that he had saved some money, I asked him to wait a little longer (1 month or 2) before making any impulsive puchases since I was unemployed at the time and that money could be used for any emergencies.Well, he disregarded everything I said and decided to buy the phone anyway, and to make a long story short, it was a scam in wich he lost almost $800. To say I was disappointed is an understatement because i told him before, that even though the money was his and he could use it any way he wanted, the shop was really suspicious and it was better to buy from an official store if he was going to spend that much in a phone.It was really frustrating but I tried to help him contact his bank to see if there was anything we could do and to my surprise they refund almost half of the money, but my happiness was short lived because the very next day he fell for another scam and lost both the recovered money plus $300 ($250 from his account and $50 from mine). I was livid at this point, the car had broken down (another $600 expense), we had no way to pay our share of the bills plus the repair costs and he had to ask for money from his mother (bless her) to solve everything, but we survived.Well, now I'm employed and things were better until yesterday when he told me he was thinking again about buying the phone, to wich I told him: \"no way, not right now\", since we're not completely stable yet to spend that much money and I thought he would be at least a bit more mindful since we're still paying for his poor decisions from last year and we barely have money for bills, but he didn't want to listen to my reasoning, kept justifying why he needed it and I'm sure he'll buy it even though he knows that if he does that I'll have to cover his share of house expenses and I'm honestly mentally and emotionally exhausted, I feel like he isn't my partner anymore, just an oversized toddler and it's draining me.For additional context: he's been betting his money on soccer games and although he wins most of them, last week he almost lost all of the grocery money :)Our currency is not USD, so those are all approximate values.If you survived my ranting, thank you for reading everything.",

    "content": "When I was a kid, I used to stand and watch the other kids play and I remember the deep longing I had to join in but couldn't because I'm autistic. I went to school and had no idea how to make friends so I just followed people I knew around. Dropped out at 12 and stayed isolated in my empty white bedroom because I felt too undeserving to decorate it. My birthdays have been filled with screaming and crying and shouting at my mom who would insist on forcing me to celebrate and buying a birthday cake I would force myself to eat and then make myself sick afterwards. I see no point in celebrating 21 years of pure suffering every single day. What am I meant to do? Have an awkward gathering with my shitty dysfunctional chaotic family?? There is so much I want to do and so many things I want to see but I can't because I am so lonely. No one understands the agony of waking up alone and going to sleep alone. I wasted 2 years of someone elses life in a weird half abusive relationship because I forced them to date me and promised I'd be a different person when I knew that I couldn't; I just didnt want to go back to being alone again. I made them aggressive and hateful towards me which is no wonder when I behave the way I do.\n\nI mourn the years of my life that I have lot. I feel sick with grief when I see kids playing on their bikes or with their friends or teenagers just existing. I didn't even get to leave my house once. the first time i walked down my road by myself was when i was 19. I'm so pitiful I hate it so much. i am in actual agony i cant take it anymore",

    "title": "I was dumped yesterday but I had been thinking about the breakup for a year, it hurts so much",
    "content": "I (25F) was in a relationship (25M) for almost 2 years. It started off very very well, very dreamy and romantic where I told my friends that I had found the guy I had been looking for all this while etc etc. 2 months after our first date, i lost my job and i realised how emotionally unavailable he was, because all he cared about was his job and his work stress - he didnt know how to empathise with me or support me or help me out (for context the city we live and work in is his hometown) but i thought probably my expectations are a bit much because we are so early in the relationship. But i have known since aug 2023 that this isnt right for me. I am going to bulletise the problems:\n\n• spending time: despite living in the same city, he only saw me once a week, fri-sat, which i initially found weird but adjusted around it. However, because he is an insane workaholic, we didnt do anything special, just stayed in. There were no date nights. When we went out on date nights, i planned all of them, i initiated them, and i convinced him. I wanted to spend more time with him, see him more, but that he told was not possible because it messes with his routines. A lot of his habits and ideas of how we should be were straight up selfish, inconsiderate and disreputable tbh.\n\n• A twisted definition of ambition, different definitions of meaning of life: He has a well paying, reputable, steady job but he wants to start his own thing so that he is doing something “meaningful “ in life. What that means for us is insane working hours, no downtime, no quality time no matter how much i tried to adjust. When breaking up, he said the kind of relationship i want works for people who have job stability and dont want to do much outside of that - and i disagree so much. All i wanted was someone to spend my weekends with, have that quality time. Isnt that the bare minimum? Also, if he cant do this, how will he ever be in a relationship? For me, i am super ambitious and have built a career in a foreign country from the ground up, but for me ambition means being good at job and liking it enough to login every morning to do a good job. Meaning of life doesnt come from the job as i work for the paycheck, but meaning comes from travel, experiences, relationships and friendships.\n\n• His routine: he was obsessed with his routines. Wake up at 6, sleep at 10, gym at 7am, work 8-9 kinda guy. Which is ok, routines are good, but what that meant was he only saw me fridays, and called me daily 9:30-10 (he didnt call me initially at all and we foughjt a lot to get here). Anything outside of that was not possible. This didnt emotionally sit right with me because i couldnt trust, depend, rely on him. In fact, when we were breaking up, he told me he calculated (????) the amount of time he spends with me or talking to me, and thats about 12h/week, which is not possible for him right now. What this translated in my head was, i am not worth the 12h/week\n\n• his spending habits: he lives at home with his parents, earns a LOT more than me, and saves and invests all that he earns to an obsessive degree. He has enough to retire rn, and i respect that. But what that meant for us was, he was extremely stingy and calculative. We split stuff but he just wasnt happy spending - on date nights, dinners, gifts. Heck, he even calculated the transport cost from his home to mine. He even liked to lecture me about how i should spend money, when i already live below my means because i have a loan. He also said that he is saving enough for the both of us, but that never gave me confidence because i saw that as an attack on my independence - i cant live on the money he has earned or saved because it is not mine, he will always reinforce that, and i will have a lesser of a say in how we spend that money. He definitely wanted a prenup if we were to marry which i dont mind, but his general attitude towards money and being too calculative wasnt reassuring\n\nBasically, these were long-standing problems which i identified very early on in the relationship and communicated why i find them problematic. However, after each time i communicated he gave me something new to cling my hope on to, and i hoped things would get better because i genuinely wanted this to work. They never got better, we kept on arguing, until yesterday when he asked the question and i agreed - i felt a bit blindsided tbh because he never told me he is thinking about it too. I guess there are 2 lessons for me:\n\nTo be in a relationship and live in the present and not with the person’s potential and what it could be\n\nTo not be so obsessed with the idea of relationships and building a life and the feeling of home with someone that i keep putting up with shit\n\nHaving said all of this, the feeling of loss is immense and i still miss him and have been bawling my eyes out, when it was me who had been considering breaking up for the past year and i know in my heart he is not the one for me.",

    "content": "Very long and emotional story short (or as short as I can get it):\n\n0-13 - I grew up a daddy's girl. I love my father with my whole heart and cherish his presence. I am inherently anxious and suffer from undiagnosed AUDHD, anxiety disorder and depression, but it doesn't affect me as much because my family is loving and kind.\n\n13 - My mother and I caught my father cheating on her. He told us he stopped and that he was sorry.\n\n13-15 - I didn't talk to my father directly, as I felt betrayed and hurt. This was made worse when my mother kept trying to stand up for him. (I later learnt she was trying to stop the mistress from contacting my father so that she and him could work on their relationship)\n\n14 - My mother is diagnosed with cancer, but they cant tell what kind or how far along it is.  My father grows even more distant from us, and the arguments increase.\n\n15-16 - My mother is hospitalized and my father starts talking to this woman on his phone. I start to feel more anxious. My mother advocates for my father, but it just makes me more mad and hurt. They argue more now, and I find myself becoming emotionally distant from my father.\n\nLate 16 - My mother dies and I shut down, as well as shut myself off from my family, friends and peers. I am angry at my father as he does not seem as affected and was also the cause of my mother's stress before she died. My older brother tries to soothe me and we traumabond. My father tries to relate to me, as his mother died a few months before mine, but he doesn't understand that it isn't the same.\n\nMy father 'dates', moves in and then marries a woman I have never met in less than 8 months. His friends, my trusted adults, all support him, as well as his family and peers. I am hurt, but I pass it off as him just grieving differently. I was sure it was a phase and that they would break up/divorce soon enough. I later find out, its the same woman he cheated on my mother with, lied to us about, and then continued to talk to while my mother was battling cancer. I confront him about this and he says that he thought I knew who she was (despite us never being formally introduced to her. To this day, I know next to nothing about her. Only her first name, where her mother lives, and the name of one of her children.)\n\nFather's wife is emotionally and verbally abusive towards me and my brother, but I, being the younger and more emotional one, take it harder.\n\nShe tells me that I'm killing my father by arguing with him, and that he will end up dead, just like my mother. I yell back at her to defend my father, as I take it very seriously when someone wishes death upon another (even indirectly), but my father takes her side and berates me for defending him.\n\nHe does a myriad of other things; threatening to sell off my cats, locking them outside and causing one to die from the cold as punishment for me not agreeing with him, as well as pretending not to hear when his wife flat out threatens to kill me. He was right next to her when she said it, mind you.\n\nUnder the advice of my older cousin from my moms side, I report the wife to the CPS but he denies hearing her threaten me to the social workers, which makes me look like an emotional teenage girl. We get placed into family therapy, but the therapist is borderline sexist and just wants us to be a family unit, regardless of the woman's blatant disregard for my safety.\n\nI ask my father why he's choosing his wife's needs over the safety of his biological children, whom he claims to adore, and he simply says that \"the Bible says wife before children\". I'd argue that doesn't apply to 'wife that you cheated on your children's mother with and who threatens you children', but okay, dad.\n\nI sleep with a knife under my pillow, just in case she tries to harm me. My anxiety and depression levels are through the roof.\n\n17 - 19 - I cant remember much from these years, but it mostly involves me trying to bond with my father, as he's the last living parent I have. I go through 3 relationships, and have no one to talk to or seek comfort from when it goes downhill. My father thinks we're getting better because of him, and not because of the gigantic effort and emotional stuffing-down I'm doing as even being near his wife makes me anxious to the point of insomnia.As angry as I was before, I still love my father and want him in my life. I tell him that he can pick any other wife, just not her, and I would be genuinely happy with that. He doesn't care, and only treats me well when she's not there (away on vacation or at her mother's house). When she is around, though, he is more distant, and visibly more tense.\n\n20 - My father announced that he wants to split our house physically (half of it is to go to me and my brother, as it was built when my mother was alive and she paid for and designed it). I tell him that I don't want him to do it, as it will just drive us further apart, but his reasoning revolves around his wife and her comfort. My brother and I have long assumed that his wife is just with him to benefit from his money, she doesn't treat him nicely, but he doesn't seem to notice.\n\nI know its childish and naïve, but I didn't want him to distance himself from me, even though he has hurt me so much for so long. I still cry (I've actually just stopped crying as I'm typing this) whenever I think about how far we've already drifted apart.\n\nOur relationship went from one of trust, smiles, secret fast-food lunch breaks and long hugs... to me not even being able to tell him about the girl that broke my heart, and how I would love to have one genuine dad-hug from him so that he can tell me its alright. I would love to have him at my wedding one day, but I don't know if that will ever happen.\n\nI don't want to grow up, not in a world where he dies alone and regretful, but it seems that that's the only way for me to not end up living my entire life clinging to his leg, begging him to look back and maybe love me the way he used to.\n\nSo I'm done. I'm done wanting his love and I'm done waiting on him to realise he was wrong, and that I still needed him.\n\nI'm going to be something, and I'm going to love someone and let them love me in return.\n\nI deserve better.\n\nTLDR: My father has hurt me with his actions and his words for too long. I'm going to learn how to live without him, no matter how much it will hurt to let him go.",

    "title": "My (20f) dad (54m) refuses to pay for my sister (18f) tuition because he has \"no money\"",
    "content": "So when we were in highschool, my dad made us quit any extracurricular activities to make extra money and help pay bills and save for our college, and just put into saving for us. Thats what he told us. But He would take whatever we made and only give us $20 of spending money every pay period. We gave him thousands that went towards the bills and college funds and even built a house back in our home country for when our parents retire. To add to that, we have gotten many scholarships so the majority of our schools were paid for. My sister in question lost her job and has been having a hard time finding another one. My dad used her funds to pay for the first half of her tuition but refused to pay for the second half. The cost is $4k. He said he has no money but yet he JUST bought a new BMW worth 25 to 30k. Keep in mind, we have 3 EXTRA CARS that need about $500 worth if fixing for him to drive just fine! When my mom was trying to talk to him about helping pay for my sister's college tuition, he told her to ask us (the siblings) to help. Since I have money saved, I was able to help pay for her tuition but before I did, I wanted to confirm with him first that he couldn't pay for it. He said he wouldn't answer that question and brushed me away. When I tried to get more from him, he started yelling at me calling me disrespectful. This is an ongoing thing with him. Whenever we try to talk back, he calls us disrespectful. When he is with his friends, he brags about how smart, educated, and respectful his children are, but then in private, he belittles us, sends money to strangers, and constantly puts others first before his own family. I guess we are all sick of it and I want to write this out because I don't know if somebody can see his side of things and tell me what I am missing here. Yes we can move out but the economy is so bad and he knows that so whenever he gets mad, he tells us that we can just leave, knowing that we can't support ourselves. He gets about $1,500 extra in rent from us every month from 3 of us but not from 2 of us cause my sister lost her job and my other sister just started her college as well (she's 17f). She worked very hard and brought about 60k of yearly tuition down to 7k with scholarships and is staying in the dorms. My dad has now refused to pay that even though my sister has worked throughout highschool to make that money. When we argue about money, he stirs the conversation away from the main point and starts going on longggg rants about this certain bill and that certain bill and whenever we cut him off so he can get to the point, he calls us disrespectful and tells us to get out of his room. We know he purposely does this so he can get out of a conversation. And even when he says he never has the money, he is constantly sending money to random people and we feel like he is flexing it. I remember I had to stay at school while my classmates got to go on a fieldtrip cause he didnt want to oay the $5 fee. And then he bought a $20 hat for a funeral he went ONCE! He likes to be constantly looked at and it's so embarrassing when we have to go out. And my mom is constantly arguing with him on our behalf. It's tiring and I feel for my mom who has to deal with his tantrums most of the time.",

I just feel so angry and I hate it.\n\nContext -> So around a year and three ish four months ago, my father had died in hospital. All shocking and scary times for me and my mom. I was 16 at the time. So I was quite affected and so was my mom. We mourned for quite some time after his death. And we went through a rough patch for a few months before we recovered.\n\nSo this is where the story starts, my mother began chatting and dating around. To which I was fine with, as I was happy she wasn't mourning over my dad and was healing.\n\nShe dated a one or two guys before she found this guy Bill (not real name) who works as a driver. They started dating and shit. And I was quite okay with it. Despite for a few times I was annoyed and irritated at him.\n\nFor starters, my mom would never tell me if he  was coming over. And normally when I'd wake up in the morning he'd be in the kitchen with my mom drinking coffee. This kinda annoyed me. I didn't like this stranger enter my house where my father once lived. I hated sharing my private personal space with this stranger. I hated and still hate his presence in my house.\n\nHe is quite annoying as a person, his like a kid. Extremely curious and neat picking. He laughs in a weird manner not a proper laugh. He acts childish at times. He's obsessed with my pet budgie named tim (not real name) but he doesn't know how to hold him properly. He constantly stresses my bird out. Which i hate.\n\nAnyways, I always felt like my mother moved on way to quickly from my father. And I quite hate it. I'm aware it's her life and she can do whatever. And that she's healing.. but it's hurts  seeing her do things she never do with my father. My father wasn't physically the most affectionate as in ways of kissing or holding hands. But he loved me and my mom in his own ways. My mom truly loved my dad.\n\nI don't know how to describe the emotions I'm feeling. It's difficult to explan everything. I just don't like him and I hate his presence in my home. I hate him touching things inside my house. I find him irritating at times and annoying. I feel these angry feelings.\n\nI hate the fact I don't have mother daughter time with my mother. As Bill comes over to sleep over like... 3ish to 4 days a week. Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday. I quite missing going out with my mom on Saturday shopping or in town. But now as bill sleeps over in Saturday he spends his day off, Sundays with us. And I hate that.\n\nEvery time I plan something with my mom on Sunday, he always has to crash our daughter mother time. I hate him kissing my mom. Being all lovely dovey. I'm happy for her healing and being happy with someone.\n\nBut it's not the same as it was.  I miss my dad\n\nEdit - forgot to mention, my mom literally babies him. Every time he comes over, she cooks all the time. She never has a second to herself.",

On the other hand for me I don’t even want to think about who he dates next- it’ll just make me sad and jealous. Why does he bring stuff like this up so much?",

    "content": "I (27F) have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, and after that all to puzzle pieces fell into place. All the emotions, the feeling of not fitting in anywhere, the emptiness and distortion of my self image.\n\nI have repeatedly done stuff that I knew would ruin my relationships, or sabotaged my self, thinking I could prove I was unlovable or unworthy. Because my logic was if that can’t handle me at my worst, they don’t deserve me at my best. Or that I wasn’t good enough for them and couldn’t understand why they cared about me.\n\nA month before my 15th birthday, I tried to end my life, and my boyfriend at the time had an ex that had ended her life a few years earlier. A week before he had told me he didn’t love me anymore, but wouldn’t break up with me at the time, bc “maybe the feelings will come back”. I knew ending my life would make him come to a decision, but that’s not why I did it. He did not come to visit me at the hospital, but his best friend did. A few days later I kissed a new guy and a week after that I started dating that guy. And so on and so forth. I often ended it with one guy, and started dating a new one a week or two after. This pattern lasted from 13 years old to 17 years old, when I got into a relationship with a guy who was 5 years older than me. In my country you’re legal at the age of 16.\n\nOn my 18th birthday I moved in with him, and within 2 months I was pregnant with my son. We can call this guy Aaron. Arron was a drug addicted, alcoholic and violent POS. He severely beat me, raped me and cut me off from my friends and family. I was a terrified pregnant 18 year old with no one to turn to. I left him almost two years after we moved in together. I called my mom after not talking to her or my dad for almost a year. And I asked if I could come visit. I moved back to their house a week after.\n\nAt the beginning of 2018 I moved from my hometown to a little island where I met my now husband (37M) and father to my two younger sons. I admit I tried repeatedly destroying this relationship, he never gave up, just kept on loving me through all of it. Christmas 2023 I had a mental breakdown, planning how to kill myself and writing letters to my family. But making my child cry while he was playing with his new toys, made me get some help. I was in the psych ward for 8 days, didn’t get to see my children other than FaceTime, and I celebrated new years alone. I was diagnosed with CPTSD, depression, anxiety and borderline personality disorder. I had a ADHD diagnosis from the age of 15.\n\nI started therapy February 2024, and DBT group September 2024. And I have finally started getting back to my feet, learning how to feel emotions again, and not look at myself with resentment and disgust. I have not had a big emotional breakdown or reaction since October 2024, and I am so proud of myself. I started ADHD medication for the first time in 13 years, and it has helped me keep up everything in the house, and following my kids closer. I’m so grateful that I didn’t go through with my plan, and I thank my children and husband every day for being “mine” and that I love them more than anything.",

    "title": "I feel left out by my girlfriend",
    "content": "Hello guys. I really have to get this off my shoulders so i decided to make this post on here. already appreciate you guys for reading it.\n\nSo, i am M/22 and my gf is the same age, we are together since three years now and everything did go well for the most part. The thing is, i am an absolute introvert and probably suffer from social anxiety. I hate to go to places where a lot of people are, i cannot eat when a lot of people are around me and i just get exhausted and overwhelmed so fast. this makes my life really hard tbh, and its even harder because i cant understand why i feel that way. like i was grown up in a great, lovingly household, have a good job, and i am basically just a normal guy, who should not complain about his life. However my gf knows all those things and we talk about it and all, she also tells me shes there for me and just tries to help me out as much as she can.\n\nAnd then there was this situation yesterday, it was the 20th birthday of her brother (who is also a really close friend of mine) and he was throwing a party with approximately 40 people. and what can i say, i felt like absolute shit the whole week, my anxiety hit rock bottom and i felt like i couldnt handle it. the night before the party i had a fucking panic attack while falling asleep. So i was talking to my gf, talking about how i feel and how i am getting the worst anxiety ever and so on.. she then tried to make me feel less anxious, she told me she is there for me the whole evening, she wont let me be alone and stuff and idk just trying to pick me up. (thats also one thing, like i feel giga weak in those situations, why cant i handle such things, shouldnt i be the one protecting her? however i am also really insecure about myself).\n\nThe party was on saturday 19;00, in a bar. my heart was racing all day. i tried to calm myself down with playing some video games, some csgo and some league, but nothing really helped. So at around 18:30 i left home and was driving to the party. you can imagine how i felt. when i arrived, we were in a group of maybe 5 people (i really didnt know many people there, maybe like 3 or 4). then i went to the wc, to calm down a bit and when i cam back my gf was grouping with her friend, the other people i knew where also with their other friends, and suddenly i find myself standing in this bar, alone, trying to talk to some people i didnt even know, just to make it less akward. it was my personal hell. However, i couldnt just go to my gf and her friends, because i would have felt ultra weird, when being the only guy there coming out of nowhere. i would have appreciated it so much, if she would have came up the me and just would be on my site. but she didnt. she didnt the whole evening. like in 8 hours, she wasnt coming up to me once. one time she was looking at me, she wanted to ask me if everything was okay by signaling it, i was shaking my head and telling her no nothing is ok, and then she turned around and did go somewhere else. like why? i dont understand that. i feel like the biggest loser on this earth, my feelings are ultra hurt and i cant stop thinking about it. i could have never done it like this if roles were switched. maybe i am overreacting, but honestly i dont think so. like why do i even tell her how i felt like shit because of this party. should i have just came up to her and her friends? idk. i still think it would have been easier for her to come pick me up, then for me to go to them. especially when she knows how i felt.\n\nidk, this evening made me just feel like absolute shit, i feel hurt as hell, i could literally start to cry right now. Why do i have to be such an insecure and anti social person, i just dont get it. however, now i am here, sitting at my pc, listening to music and writing this down. idk if anybody will even read this, but if so, sorry if my english is not the yellow from the egg, but i tried my best.\n\nhave a nice sunday evening",

Might as well be ranting because I have found a haven in Reddit lately.\n\nI often wonder why anyone would like to be friends with me. I struggle a lot with anxiety and maintaining attention, and usually when I offer advice it is not that helpful (usually overly philosophical and impractical). Some people may like to engage in that kind of discussion I guess… I don’t have any interesting hobbies besides going to a cafe by myself and having a cigarette, browsing and looking for jobs to advance my career. I have a very niche sense of humour that can be overly sarcastic and easily offend. I try to pick up hobbies, but I end up wanting to escape my reality via watching too much TV, cleaning/decluttering and spending time with my partner, which I also don’t see why he would stay with me after the initial attraction wears off. I am probably extremely depressed as I grew up with a childhood trauma that I tried to address via therapy but it felt like the benefit wasn’t outweighing the expense and somehow it felt even more depressing as “my only only hope for getting better didn’t look that hopeful”. A few therapists seemed to make me feel like my system was in a kind of a deadlock. I find myself lately thinking often about why anyone would like to be friends with me, even though I don’t think less of myself - I am young (32F), attractive, fit and financially independent. I am well-educated and have a decent-paying job. I rarely lie, gossip and I like to support people by understanding their goals. I like to treat my friends every now and again, but I don’t like transactional relationships. I used to have creative ambitions but quit them and settled into a boring life when I saw nothing was really materializing. How can I improve this sense of isolation helplessness, with years of therapy as a last resort?",

I feel like a total loser. No physical attributes, no social skills, no confidence. Deep down, I blame my mother for it.

    "content": "My (m24) now ex(f26) girlfriend started dating in March last year. I had just come out of a toxic situationship where I take part blame. I was a bad communicator, I’m sure I still am but I gained some communication skills. I really liked her, found my now ex, 3 weeks later. I knew it would be a rebound but it helped so much. Especially considering this girl had been my crush since 8 years ago when I had first started working with her. We had so much fun early on, trips, going out, eating out. It started to feel less like a rebound and something of a real relationship. Unfortunately, it came to her moving out of her mom’s house. She needed a place to go, and me with my somewhat trust issues, was scared to let her move in with her friends which were one girl and two guys. She had been known to “get around” but I trusted her more than most people did and had hope. She was very kind, had many mental issues, but nothing I couldn’t stand, I had grown up with childhood trauma and this seemed like nothing. So me with my trust issues, and wanting to move out of my mom’s house as well, took her offer of renting a place together. It seemed fun and I had just started a career job, so it seemed like a good time. Found out very quickly, it would not be. See my ex, we’ll call Fiona, had severe insecurities and drinking issues, not to mention drug addiction. I had known to some extent, but not to this severity. The first week we moved in, I wanted to have a get together party for our first place together. Turns out, Fiona hates having people in her space. She was very quiet the whole night, and near the end, she stormed off to the room, where I’d get yelled at when I head to bed. She scream at me in bed, as I had work the next morning I told her sorry and we’d talk about it tomorrow. She got up and stormed out the room. I was just happy for the quiet, until I hear her screaming my name and yelling help! Help! I storm out, seeing her wrist covered in blood, with it spilling all over the floors. I help her best I can, she didn’t hit an artery so it soon stopped, but left a nasty scar. After this night, most nights, especially when we went out, I would get no rest, being accused of cheating, or just not giving her enough love. Over the next few months, one of our mutual friends decided a surprise birthday party for her. I honestly wasn’t thinking to hard about it, I just thought maybe it’d make her happy, forgetting she didn’t like people in her space. Same thing happened. She was upset the whole night, stayed in the bedrooms and never came out. Through out the night you could hear her screams saying “get out of my house!” In the most embarrassing way possible. Her sister was there, and tried to calm her down the whole night, which did not work. I eventually got everyone out, because the music was barely covering it up. I went to bed again. Same thing, yelling at me. She got up, stormed out. I was worried but thought that it was a one time thing. Nope, I instantly hear my name being screamed. This time, much worse. I come out to see the cut is even deeper, attempt to stop the bleeding but it just won’t. I call 911 while making a makeshift tourniquet to try and stop it. The paramedics get her after the police, which was someone I knew. I told them about how she was saying before that she wanted to die. I didn’t think this was an attempt, but a callout. I took her to the hospital after the medics said she didn’t need the ambulance after patching her up. Stayed up all night at the hospital, dropped her off at home, then went to work. I was miserable. I couldn’t stand this anymore. I didn’t want to break the lease, but at the same time I also still cared for this girl. I felt bad. I needed a way out, that night was my chance, but you just couldn’t leave her alone, she cried and begged me. So we continued our relationship. A few months later, same thing, yelling at me and saying I don’t give her enough affirmations and accusing me of deleting snapchats and sneaking people in when she’s off at work. Which led to a night that she destroyed my tv in the living room, put holes in the walls, and screamed at me in my face. I was done, I left to stay at my friends house. Told her to leave, we’d figure out the situation after. The day after, she said she needed time to move, and wanted to talk. I went over, and we talked the whole night. She promised she’d get therapy, and help. And I felt so terrible, I truly loved this girl, but it was such a toxic relationship. I gave her one last chance. We decided to stick together, agreeing to talk things out more. See, I still have my trust issues, and being accused of things makes me curious why it’s that in particular. I memorized her password months ago, but never really felt the need to look through her phone. I had it just in case. But I was working one night, straight shift. She went out with her friends. Acted very strange to me, and I just felt something was off. I come home at 7am, find her dead asleep. Couldn’t even wake her up to give her a kiss. She had left her phone on my side of the bed. I felt the urge to look through it. Went through it for hours. Finding hidden messages in messenger of her taking to her ex saying how she thinks about him everyday, and that she needs him. Other messages to her OTHER ex on Snapchat, came across it by chance because it had been cleared and muted. It was of last night being very flirty and him leaving hearts and her pictures with her hearting back. Her saying I miss you, and then a phone call about 6 minutes lasting. I called this number, I asked him to be straight up if she’s cheating. He sounded dumbfounded but said she wasn’t and that they were just friends that use to date. But I found pictures dating only right before we started dating that they were kissing and all over eachother. I woke her up, absolutely heated. Ngl this was probably the angriest I’ve ever been. I told her what I had seen. She of course denied it. Eventually admitting that it was cheating but they never had sex. Which I absolutely think is a lie. But I said it was over, and she took it so easily. She nodded and called her mom, got her stuff in the car, then laughing about a joke she made saying she’s tired of constantly moving. All while I sit and wait for her to leave. Also if I didn’t mention, this happened ALL ON MY BIRTHDAY. She leaves not answering any of my questions like why? how could you do this? Since then, I’ve been sitting here, she still left a few things and needs a truck to come pick them up. She just texted me that she’s coming today to pick them up. I still feel like shit, but can hold my emotions together.",

In my dating years, I had 3 accidental pregnancies and obviously I couldn't keep them so I went ahead with aborting them. I understood that it was not the ideal decision and a lot of people would have opinions on it, but it was the only right decision for me at that time. Now it has been some years since this has happened and I’m very happy with my partner today, but there are days when this sadness comes back about those three incidents . This sadness gets triggered by anything randomly. For instance, a friend decides to use birth protection, and I don’t know why I wake up thinking about that time when I had to do what I did. Another time, I could not go through the series, which was depicting in some detail about a couple dealing with the abortion and the decision making around it . While the abortion itself is a horrible experience to go through, the last one that I had was extremely painful and terrible due to some situations . My partner has been extremely supportive about this throughout the years, but I find it difficult to not feel like a burden when all of a sudden one morning, I am in a bad mood and they don’t understand exactly how and why I am feeling like that. So I guess I’m just dumping my feelings here because I’m not really sure what to do with them. I don’t want to burden my partner who already has a lot of pressure from work in everywhere else, and I can’t seem to make this sadness go away.",

I’ll most likely delete later and just need some sort of insight from other parents or people that have had people like this in their lives. Me and my mom still live under the same roof but I’m genuinely thinking of getting out of here because I don’t know how much more I can take.\n\nWe had an argument a few days ago because I was trying to explain a situation that happened and she immediately started with saying I always have an answer and an excuse for everything. I tell her that it genuinely hurts she still thinks I’m lying to her and I’m trying to reassure her that I’m not. She resorts to mocking me about how my feelings were hurt. She then accused me of gaslighting her which I literally would never do and I had tears streaming down my face because it was clear she didn’t want to listen to anything I was saying. And she’s been passive aggressive towards me for the past couple days. I don’t know if I want to try and talk to her again because I don’t want to be at the brunt of another one of her episodes or if I should just cut my losses and just finding a way to move out. If there’s actually something up with her or me that I’m not seeing then please tell me so. Also I should have prefaced that a lot of our “conversations” end up with her yelling at me and making me apologize when she could just leave me alone.",

    "content": "Sorry for the long ass post. I would have made it longer but wanted to spare you the novel.\n\nI’m honestly just really lost and struggling so much right now. I’m 25, and suffer from a long list of mental and physical disabilities. I’m not really able to work right now due to my disabilities but am in the middle of a long process of trying to get on disability payments. I still live at home with my mum and brother (dad is deceased), and I just found out last week my mum has stage 4 bone cancer. My partner of 3 years doesn’t live with me but is soon having to move out of his family home so has been putting pressure on me to move out with him as we’ve been together for a significant amount of time and we should be moving onto the next stage of our relationship. I’ve tried to explain that it’s difficult for me to move out as I don’t have a job and the income I do get from the government isn’t going to be enough to pay for rent let alone my food, medications, my dog’s food and be expected to save for my doctor and specialist appointments but also to save to eventually buy a house like how he wants us to be able to do before turning 30. He just keeps telling me to apply for work and I only have experience in retail but due to one of my medical conditions I can’t even stand for more than 5 hours on a good day without being in debilitating pain where I literally struggle to walk. I have no experience in being a receptionist and no matter how many jobs I apply for no luck. He wants me to move out as well as I’m being treated as a stay at home mother looking after my mum and brother (this is well before the cancer diagnosis). I don’t think as well that it’s sitting in for him that I very badly need and rely on being on my mum’s health insurance considering I’m chronically ill and it can turn at anytime for me and sadly I’m having a different surgery at least once a year, sometimes twice a year so idk how I’d be expected to afford that if I wasn’t living at home, with no job. He refuses to live with my family until we can save enough to buy a house because he hates my family and well understandably is struggling to even see a future with me like this but I feel like he’s in between a rock and a hard place with the fact that he does love me and how he doesn’t want to leave me cause I’m sick cause it’d be like leaving someone who’s got cancer which is an asshole thing to do. And it doesn’t help that I’m struggling with my mum’s new diagnosis. On top of everything else I personally am just really struggling with how beyond god damn emotional I am. Late last year I fell down some stairs causing me to be bed ridden for 2 and a half weeks and in turn has caused me to develop or severely worsen potential already undiagnosed OCD. I’ve never been diagnosed before with OCD because truly I don’t say out loud my thoughts and whatever I have disclosed or displayed gets pinned to my autism but since the fall I’ve been consumed with anxiety, depression, anger, guilt, agitation and panic with mess, things not being in a particular order (mainly MY way of order). I feel like a shell of who I once was I struggle to hide anything well, I cry almost daily and have just started to learn either cry to myself when no one is around or wait for my therapist. I don’t ever want to leave my house cause if I stay at my partner’s house, guarantee I’ll be a sobbing mess when I get back cause my mum and brother always make a mess and they never clean up after themselves which in turn triggers me more. I already am a pretty reserved person when it comes to my feelings cause I think it’ll come off over dramatic to others even though I know they’re valid but today I got proven why I think that because my partner asked me what was wrong when I got home and I spilt 1/4 of my thoughts and feelings and I got stopped with being told that “maybe you just like to make things more difficult for yourself than it has to be”. Potentially that’s true but also I don’t mean to, my brain just never shuts up which I’m realising with typing this that yes it most definitely doesn’t shut up. The sadder thing is there’s a lot more to my anxieties and why I can’t take it anymore and maybe I’ll just get a diary and deep clean till I can’t walk. I just want to be alone and lowkey sedated but I got an appointment in a couple days on an update to some scans and if I’ll need surgery or not which is obviously another anxiety. I frankly just feel a lot of pressure from my boyfriend and I feel pressure to look after and help my mum and if I don’t well no one will cause my brother and her partner are useless. I feel pressure on myself with my own mental and physical health, getting a job and what kind of job realistically would even be good for me, I feel temptation to go back into eating disorder tendencies or back into my addiction to smoking weed. I feel beyond insecure about my appearance which I know is a vanity and self esteem issues. I truly don’t know what to do because try and take it day by day but I clearly have some control issues. I’m frustrated cause I don’t want to die, but I also don’t want to be alive or at least conscious.",

I had a thick canvas work jacket on so the teeth barely broke the skin. I carry a folding knife as a habit since I was a kid in boyscouts. I stabbed the dog with my free hand after trying to punch the dog and it ran off back around the corner of the house. A woman and her teenage daughter came around the corner screaming at me and I told them what happened. Apparently they were neighbors there to take care of the dogs. It all happened on the front porch in front of a ring camera. I then left, called my boss and the cops but decided not to take legal action. I guess I felt bad for doing that to the dog. I don’t know what else to say it’s been a few months. I’m pretty sure the dog died and it probably would’ve been put down anyway.",

My brother was 3 when we got him and always treated him as sibling. They were never referred to as adopted growing up. Flash forward I’m 19 he’s 13. He becomes obsessed with me completely out of no where. Starts with cutting the back out of several pairs of jeans attempting to see me exposed. Then one day I noticed while using the restroom there’s small holes chiseled into the wall. Yep peep holes. Parents patch them. He creates more. Mind you he’s in extensive therapy they’re basically begging for help as to why he’s doing this. (Of course the state wants you to adopt and then ditches you when there’s a problem.) He then started exposing himself in weird places in the house so I would walk in on him. Then I worked all night was tired accidentally dozed off on the couch (still am pissed I fell asleep because maybe this part could have been avoided) and he touched me from my butt to my vagina in one quick movement. I wasn’t hardly asleep so I instantly woke up saw him walking away and he admitted to my parents that he did it. (I moved out 2 weeks later) Now flash forward again I’m 25 he’s 17. My parents obviously continue to raise him. there was no punishment because he was a minor (he was sent off for a year if you want to call that something) my parents have a relationship with him and I have a relationship with my parents. He talks about me to mom still which I find very odd. I have not said a single word to him since the incident. Being around him even this many years later physically makes me ill. I hate his guts and quite frankly wish terrible things upon him. I’m no where close to being healed from this and don’t know if I ever will be. He has a girlfriend that he’s been with for awhile she has no idea what he did and it just makes me sick because if that were me I’d want to know and I feel wrong by not telling her but I do not know her and the fight within my family it would cause ugh. I witnessed him today with the gf and he’s constantly in her face demanding affection and overly touchy. Just makes me sick for the girl and any future potential victim. sorry for the long post.

    "content": "I don’t know if anyone remembers me but a while ago my girlfriend and I had a home invasion incident that culminated in her beating the shit out of the intruder. I’m tired of saying my gf so I’m going to call her Diana.\n\nTurns out the guy was a drug addict from the next town over. He was in his 60s and he had an extensive history in jail and mental hospitals. Unfortunately about two months after my post, he passed away. We didn’t know anything about why until we got a chance to talk to his sister, who insisted she didn’t blame Diana and that the doctors even said that he probably didn’t have much longer anyway. (Diana was visibly distressed during this conversation so I’m not sure whether or not the sister just said that to comfort her)\n\nAfter that Diana went on a trip to a national park during a week she knew I couldn’t take off and forgot her meds. She has seizures that look like mild psychosis/magical thinking and ended up refusing to come home at the end of the trip. She kept saying that she felt like she couldn’t leave the woods because she was certain there was something she needed to learn there that she hadn’t yet, and when I asked her how long that might take, she said “some people take a lifetime.” I asked if she was breaking up with me, and she said something about feeling like she was “too attached” to me, her house, her pets, etc and that she needed to meditate on that for a while.\n\nI ended up going to her temple to see if anyone was willing to give me some perspective on the situation since she was seeing things through a Buddhist lens. It was the right choice. A monk actually drove the six hours out to her with me to talk to her in person since she wasn’t picking up calls. I am so, so unbelievably grateful for that monk because Diana started taking her meds again and came home soon after. I’ve never been religious but I started to read the Pali canon afterwards and that shit slaps. Diana was already volunteering her time at the temple so now we both go together when we can.\n\nAll things considered, since then, things are back to normal and going well. We’re both children of divorce so even before all this we were doing prophylactic couples counseling every few months, and for a while after we were going once a week. Diana has started seeing a therapist on her own as well which I am so proud of her for since she’s always hated the idea of individual therapy.\n\nWe also stepped up our home security game. Diana already had plenty of cameras, but now we have door/window alarms and motion sensors. I also convinced Diana to get another dog, so now we have a 75lb puppy…\n\nI know a lot of people were rooting for us to get married, but that’s not going to happen. Legal marriage isn’t something that interests us and it never has. But we did buy each other rings, and it’s been a great comfort to have something physical to remind me of her on my person all the time. We’re also considering having a small commitment ceremony next fall <3\n\nThanks again for all the feedback on my previous post. I got a lot of great advice, and some good criticism. I showed it to Diana and she got a kick out of the comments, and we had a little mutual cry over how kind a lot of you guys were. I asked her if she was okay with me posting this update, and she clucked at me and told me to do whatever I want online as long as I’m being nice (and anonymous lol). So… hope this qualifies!",

I have so many insecurities in regards to being included in outings. Her communication is really lacking and forgoes telling me how she feels about things.\n\nOur most recent disagreement has been in regards to travel - we can’t come to a compromise and find a balance between her travelling with her (and also my) friends with time for us to spend together. We promised we’d travel with each other after this year fell through for similar reasons. Instead, I had to leave it at she will go with her friends instead of me. I’m hurt because it feels like she doesn’t want to go away with me, but she’s hurt because I think that.\n\nShe’s promised to do better and apologised so many times for not communicating. I feel like our bad times are more frequent than the good. I want to push through because she is so loving, caring and sweet but I’ve got a massive piece missing rn and if I explain this to her, she breaks down and stops talking entirely. I’m stuck. I know I am so far from a bastion of perfection in this relationship, but I just can’t help but be frustrated and saddened by this.\n\nToday, I was sick and quite feverish, so I spent a while thinking back to a past relationship. While I’m absolutely over that girl, I just couldn’t help but reminisce about how that short relationship three years ago made me feel. I do hold it in very high regard because I was in the wilderness prior to it - alone and totally confused about my place in the world before she showed me, so I’m now quite nostalgic about what she was for me, especially now my needs just aren’t being met. That girl and I met in the wrong time and the wrong circumstances to last, but we ended very amicably. I know it’s horrible and so unfair for my gf as well as the previous girl to keep thinking like this.\n\nI love spontaneity and random, intimate things (and I have told her this) but never does she ask me to come over for a karaoke drive at midnight with the windows down. Never does she say she wants to spend the night with me somewhere random. I sometimes ask but it’s usually a no. I feel like I’m right back to where I was pre-previous relationship and I’m lost and so sad.\n\nI want to make things better, and I know constantly comparing my last relationship to my current is really poor. I know I’m focusing on the negative things she does. I know I could be better but I’m so fucking demotivated bc she just doesn’t talk and we just don’t go out to do things. Then a rift forms and I have to be the one to try and pull it back, and then she’s extremely upset and scared that I might leave her, or she thinks she’s a bad person. I can’t say how I really feel because of that. It takes days for our usual fun side to return and then there’s a couple weeks of good. Rinse and repeat.\n\nLong-term relationships are loads of battles to stay in love. Some are so much harder, but I do love her. Though, is it worth losing parts of who you are when I’m this age? I’m emotionally exhausted by the constant confusion and stress of slow and lacking communication as well as my physical needs just not being met. I’m 23, so I’m not looking to waste her or my time any longer if this just won’t work. I like solving things but this feels like it’s becoming bigger than me.",

    "content": "It was just my almost 2 year old son and me in the house. Dogs were outside and I was at the kitchen table doing my makeup getting ready for work as I was supposed to leave in 2hrs. The doorbell rang and I ignored it for a couple minutes. It's not uncommon for solicitors to try and sell shit. I slowly walked up to my front door peephole and looked out. There was a man standing with his back to the door blocking most of my view and then a second man was out at my curb back also facing my door kinda looking around. I started to get nervous and slowly turned the lock on the front doorknob so he wouldn't hear I was on the other side.\n\nImportant to note: my mom's transmission went out last week so she's borrowing my car. No cars in the driveway or in front on the street. But the TV was on playing a kid show for my toddler so he wouldn't miss my presence as much while getting ready.\n\nI watched him for a bit and decided he'd probably leave soon and started walking away. That's when I heard my glass door open. I thought I'd hear him knock next but instead I got to watch as my front door knob started jiggling like someone was trying to get in. And then I froze. Instead of getting my husband's gun to protect myself and my child I did nothing. I just froze. He fiddled with the door knob for a bit and then eventually walked away. I peeped out the kitchen window and watched as this dude met up with his buddy and then they started walking away.\n\nI texted my husband instead of calling the police. He's the one that did. He told me to call them because they wanted to ask me questions, and so I did. Then when I tried to call my phone said I had to connect to a wifi or network to make a call. My bill is paid every month on the 2nd and I was connected to wifi. Just another thing that was going wrong. The police had to call me back and ask if I was ok to even talk to them. When the police did show up they said the guys were solicitors and it's illegal in the city to do that. We even have 2 no soliciting signs taped to the glass door. She said her partner found them up the street and was kicking them out of the neighborhood. Since there was no proof they tried to enter the house nothing could be done. The only thing they could do was drive up to the company and tell them that if they walk onto our property again they will have trespassing charges filed and the company will receive a citation.\n\nAt the end of it all I'm extremely shaken. I didn't do anything right except lock the door. I didn't tell them to go away. I didn't call 911. I didn't get a weapon. I just locked the door and then watched as they tried to get in, texted my husband, and then did what I was told. I cried for a long time after. I'm still not doing great. If I hadn't locked that door I really don't know what could've happened. If you've read this far thank you, I just really needed to get this off my chest and out.",

    "content": "This is a bit odd, and by intimate, I mean a bit more than just touching.\n\nFor a year, I've felt like I've initiated every kiss, every makeout. We're not sexually active yet, but have been dating for almost 3 years now. And we were fairly physical before, but now the extent of her initiating anything is holding hands or resting her head on my shoulder.\n\nI love even that. Makes me melt. Makes me feel wanted. But then I realize at the end of the day, that I initiated every kiss. We make out once in a couple months when I initiate.\n\nI've asked her about it. Multiple times. Is something bothering her, does she want some support, is this not something she wants in a relationship.\n\nEvery time the answer is that she wants it, and that she'll initiate but then it's like she forgets about it. I remember the time she'd hold me, look me in the eyes and kiss me. I remember the times she'd take the slower, non supervised elevator to kiss me in. I remember when she'd ask me to come over when she was alone to make out.\n\nNothing. For a year, nothing. I don't even ask her anymore, cause at that point it feels like I'm forcing her or making it out to be a major fault. I can't even tell what's wrong. What's changed. Every time I ask her it's a different thing. She's not feeling it, she's lost her sex drive (but then a month later, she said that wasn't the issue), there's shit going on in her family.\n\nAnd it's fucking killing me inside. I've started to cook up an actual fantasy in my head. Fantasies of being intimate with her someday have turned into a fantasy of a girl in the future who actually physically expresses love for me. I have shit in my life too, and a kiss from her makes all that go away.\n\nI just feel broken at this point. For 3 years almost, I've worked with this girl, and I genuinely love every inch of her, but somehow this issue itches at the inside of my head and makes me miserable. And I've tried talking to her, but it makes no difference. We reach an agreement and she changed things for a day and then she just reverts to the way things used to be.",

    "content": "For the past 2 years I’ve been smoking weed, almost daily. I recently went through a lot of changes, and in that I quit smoking and started taking supervised urine tests. (Among other things) I knew that taking these tests meant I couldn’t take my drivers license for at least a few months, and that was okay with me. What I didn’t know is that it meant I couldn’t drive at all, until these tests were finished - which is 6 months - even tho I am clean.\n\nMy doctor failed to tell me (or I failed to remember) that I can’t use the license for my motorcycle that i already have.\n\nI recently met a guy who made my passion for driving motorcycles light up again. I was so ready to get back on the bike, bring it out of the garage, change out the oil and have it in pristine condition. I was so excited to spent a summer on two wheels while getting my life back on track - and this time with someone to share the joy with. In some ways it was part of my motivation for staying clean, and having it ripped away in the span of a few google searches made it that much harder.\n\nI feel so angry, and stupid. I feel like I should have known, and I feel like it was obvious. Yet I thought in some magical way that I could keep my excisting licence, just not take another drivers test. I was so ready for the freedom of driving to work, and going on road trips. Or just driving to the store without relying on commute or friends, or having to walk for 15 minutes.\n\nI know it really isn’t the end of the world, but the next 5 months is gonna be that much more challenging knowing I could have been on a bike if I hadn’t admitted to my doctor that I smoked weed. Im gonna call the doctors office tomorrow to see if I’m correct in thinking I can’t drive my motorcycle, but I’m scared of getting my hopes up. I’d rather sit with knowing I’ll get told I can’t drive than be let down again tomorrow.\n\nBut on the other side of things, I probably wouldn’t have quit if it wasn’t for having to do this at some point either way.\n\nIt just sucks that I’ll be done with these tests in September, at the very end of the season.",

Our relationship is going strong, but that’s not the point.\n\nFor some context, I’ve been very sheltered throughout my life, which has made me extremely introverted and anxious. I just started college, and I have no friends from school because, about two years ago, my mother decided I should be homeschooled and demanded that I cut off contact with my friends.\n\nWhen I got into college, I ended up in a group of friends who were super shallow. Being around them gave me terrible face dysmorphia and a spending habit from mirroring them. From the outside, it looked like they had loads of fun together, but I was with them for four months, and it was terrible.\n\nI had a friend in class, but we drifted apart because she became best friends with this one girl who was no better than Regina George. We still talk amicably, but not often.\n\nI’m friendly with my roommates, but there’s a language barrier since they share a common mother tongue, so there’s not much connection there.\n\nI was best friends with one girl, but she would get mad at every little thing. On top of that, she would spread other people’s secrets to unrelated parties, which was a huge turnoff. We had a final confrontation, and that friendship burned out.\n\nI’m friends with two other girls, and as nice as they are, they’re closer to each other. Honestly, they’re a lot like me, but I’m so self-conscious around them that I don’t feel like myself. They’re super open, and the hesitant vibe I bring to the table just doesn’t fit well with them.\n\nThe only real support I have is my boyfriend. I have online friends and people I talk to occasionally, but no actual close friends. He isn’t isolating me—he actually encourages me to talk to people—but I just can’t. I know I need to put myself out there, stop caring about embarrassing myself, yada yada, but it’s way harder than it seems. I feel out of place.\n\nI just feel so lonely. I have no one to attend events with, no one to meet up with in the evenings. I pretend it’s by choice, but honestly, I’m just fucking lonely.\n\nMy favorite festival is a week away, but i know my bully will be there and i have no friends to back me up. it will be the most joyous occasion and it hurts to know everyone other than me will be celebrating. my boyfriend cant come bc of restrictions imposed by college",

    "content": "Ok so this is advice for how to survive these places. They are helpful, but in a weird way, but it sucks, and it’s traumatizing. But it’s very isolated and weirdly desensitized, so in there you aren’t effecting anyone you have personal attachments to. So first official tip, just make it to your release date, and you will be just fine.\n\nNext, a lot of people coming in to these places may have drug issues, or self harm. When I was in the ones I went to, I was too. And I was put in a terrible place with people on stimulants and benzos; along with a very odd amount of persistence and survival “methods” You will likely turn to snorting cheeked meds, drinking hand sanitizer and god knows what else. So go in with at least a little safety net. bring yourself alcohol wipes, an extra sock, and then a condom, if you are afab and haven’t had any surgeries or anything like that then this can work for “transportation” but the condom has other uses too. Not for sex.\n\nPlease don’t have sex oh my god. Just jerk off or something, everyone there is fighting literal demons. You do not want to end up in bed with them, I know that sounds stupid, but two people going through a mental health mess will have a very weird and toxic dynamic.\n\nI should also say that people are going to be judgmental. They are judging themselves so they are also projecting it. So I just don’t think you should form attachments or like preconceptions. You should talk to them though, it will really help to hear about someone’s life the closest you ever can. It makes you feel less alone. And it’s incredible to know you’ve seen these people be horrible and they the same for you, and you will never see each other again, and they know the most and least about you.",

    "content": "Three years ago, I met a girl online, and we hit it off instantly. We texted every single day, flirted shamelessly, and honestly? It was one of the best connections I've ever had. We never did video calls though, so neither of us knew what the other looked like. We're both introverts, so it never crossed our minds to FaceTime (weird, I know, but that's introvert life for you). Despite that, we developed a crush on each other, but we decided to remain flirty friends who sometimes roleplay sexy things because we're both not relationship people and and long-distance relationships are a hard pass for us. So we just kept texting and gaming together.\n\nSince I didn't know how she looks like, my brain started creating an idealized version of her and I imagined her like this alluring, confident, intense and mysterious femme fatale.\n\nOne day this girl disappeared without saying anything. Poof, gone, she deactivated all her gaming socials. She was always quite depressive so my mind started to jump to the worst conclusions, I was very worried. And I endlessly tried looking for her everywhere, but I only knew her name and country so I got nowhere.\n\nI eventually gave up looking for her but she always remained haunting me in the back of my mind  because of the way she had disappeared and the fact that I didn't know what happened to her. So I kept thinking about her throughout the 2 remaining years, replaying our last conversations to look for cues, and all of that led me to dead ends. It was frustrating. And it was like a mystery that I needed to solve. Alexa play \"oh whooo is sheee?\"\n\nSo one day, I decided that enough is enough. I was going to find her and I was going to get my answers even if I have to become the FBI myself. I believe in manifestation and law of attraction so I spent a whole night visualizing me finding her personal socials (the socials we had each other added were not personal socials, it was gaming socials, so I wanted to find either her Instagram or Facebook).\n\nAnd it worked! Next day, I went full FBI detective mode. I said the only information I had about her was her name and country, so I used those leads and somehow I managed to stumble upon her real full name! (I think this was the manifestation and law of attraction at play or some kind of witchcraft I dunno). It turned out that the name she had given me was a fake one but that's understandable so I don't hold it against her. Whatever. With her real name in hand, I found out where she went to school, where she went to college, and of course her personal socials.\n\nSo I opened up her Facebook and Instagram, filled with anticipation because finally I would be able to put a face to the ghost who'd haunted me for 2 whole years! And when I laid my eyes on her, there she was... THE SHEER REFLECTION OF MY GRANDMA WHEN YOUNG!\n\nNo, really. Like not kind of, not a little resemblance, I mean copy-paste, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, a perfect genetic duplicate of my grandma in her youth. ...I had spent years chasing this mystery woman, only for my brain to go, \"Wait a minute… is that… grandma?\"\n\nI WAS FUCKING IN LOVE WITH MY GRANDMA! FOR YEARS! Years of mystery, longing, idealization GONE IN A SECOND. My attraction to her? Instantly killed. Biggest turn off of my life. All the sexy things she had ever told me were no longer sexy and I just couldn't picture us physically together anymore...\n\nWe used to roleplay fear play scenarios AND NOW THE FEAR PLAY TURNED INTO FEAR FOR A DIFFERENT REASON. Like, instead of \"I'm going to hunt you down and devour you\" being hot, now it’s giving \"Eat your vegetables, sweetheart\" and I'm just sitting there like NOOOOOO, THE MAGIC IS GONE.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that would send Freud into overdrive. \"Tell me, how does this make you feel?\" LIKE SCREAMING, FREUD. IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE SCREAMING. My brain had built up this intense, mysterious, alluring figure, and then boom! grandma vibes! And I ended up in some kind of weird family reunion, yay!\n\nThis is for real one of the biggest plot twists of my life. I basically turned 3 years of longing into a detective saga with a twist ending, and instead of crying, I'm laughing about it. At this point I'm just happy because I can finally close this chapter but at the same time I feel shallow for losing attraction towards her immediately after seeing her. Oh well, not everyone can be attracted to their grandma.",

I feel so guilty...I want to pay them back but I don't have the means to....whatever little money we get we use to pay for food and our utilities. There's never any extra left. We're stuck in a constant loop of borrowing money to pay for all our debts, and we've been stuck for years...nearly as long as we've been together. We know it has to stop but then how will we pay for things?\n\nWe're constantly looking through job postings and sending out applications, I actually got a response from 1 of them but it doesn't start until April (if I can submit all the requirements, which is proving hard to do because we have no funds for it...it sucks that you need money to make money), my boyfriend hasn't found anything yet, though he reassured me after one of our fights that he is looking at every job posting out there and stepping out of his comfort zone, like I finally did last year. Our fights have mainly been about our relationship (we're like roommates, raising a baby) and money troubles, that usually leads to fighting about his difficulty finding a job. Some days I understand that it's just really hard to find one, also we stayed in one industry for so many years that branching out now is....hard. And some days I doubt that he's actually expanded his options, because I expanded mine and I found one so why can't he?\n\nOur relationship is suffering almost just as much as our finances, it's dying. I'm barely interested in sex, meanwhile being intimate physically is his love language. He's barely interested in other forms of intimacy, which is my love language. We've had so many discussions to try and find a compromise but to no avail. Most days I think our relationship is actually over, I've actually tried to break up with him in the past. A few times before I even got pregnant, a lot while I was pregnant and a few times after our baby was born. All those times tho he's refused, says he wants to keep fighting for our relationship.\n\nI had..or maybe, have really bad post-partum depression, it took me 3 months to even \"like\" my baby. I was depressed and anxious the entire pregnancy, but he was just so....unreliable. Like yeah, he did what he could to make sure I got my check-ups and other needs but he wasn't a good emotional support system, he did the bare minimum is what I would call it.

I also know how this makes me sound but I was working during my pregnancy because we couldn't afford for me to not be working too. We both know that we both definitely should have stepped up when I got pregnant and looked for a better job than the ones we had, but we didn't. We were both scared, and we've regretted it ever since. Because even now that decision is bleeding into our current issues.\n\nI've considered just taking my baby and leaving so my boyfriend and I can get some much needed time apart, to think. But there's nowhere I can  go. I also have like a lot of cats that I don't want to leave him with because that would be an AH move, they're mainly my responsibility not his. And yes I know they add to the expenses but they barely eat anymore because we can't afford to feed them regularly. We've tried to get them adopted but no one here wants rescued stray cats. Most people in our country think they're a waste of time and money...\n\nI know we need therapy, together and separately..but that costs money...and...money is the one thing we just don't have....\n\nThese issues have been weighing so heavily on me for a long time, but as I'm typing it I just feel silly...like these aren't really problems...other people have bigger problems is what my brain is saying. Insecurities I guess....\n\nTLDR; My bf and I are broke, in debt, still looking for jobs, have a baby together, dying relationship, exhausted, fighting all the time and DEFINITELY need some form of therapy...",

I am not massive but I have a community that I could never leave behind.\n\nI also have another job - sometimes people assume once I say I'm a content creator that it's my only source of income. I think people overestimate the money content creators make. Even with 50000 subs, your barely be making enough for rent and maybe food.\n\nI'm known for being the woman of my streaming group, which is predominantly men. I get targeted with a lot of female-oriented questions during streams - sometimes sexist jokes but usually stuff like \"Hey, X, you're a girl so is it true women feel X on their period?\" - just as an example.\n\nI started streaming when I was 19. I'm 24 now. In these last five years, I've learned a lot about myself. Including that I have simply never truly felt like a woman. It's always felt like a costume and a role. I've reached more self awareness and understanding of myself and I know for certain, I am not a woman. Mentally, at least.\n\nI don't know what to do. I know the most important thing is \"to thine own self be true.\"\n\nBut I kinda wish I could transition and continue to play the role I've had in my group.

I am scared of all the jokes and commentary that will be made.\n\nI am just scared, uncertain, and shaky.

I say technically because the first was so on-off that it didn't even count as one, plus she ended up cheating.\n\nBut what I've noticed since the that one is that I tend to be overcaring, sometimes clingy and think about whoever I have feelings for constantly, as if an image of her is burned into my mind no matter where I look or even if my eyes are closed.\n\nI've been through some brutal ones where a girl I met at university (a mate's mate but single) was so unbelievably beautiful, funny, well-mannered and smart that it was painful to keep thinking about her until I asked her out but she polited declined.\n\nThe other relationship was when I met an American girl studying here who actually liked me for who I am which was a surprise considering I believe myself to be the equivalent of Rocky Dennis in terms of looks, but with the way I was around and to her I realise now I was too overcaring right at the start treating her as an already long term girlfriend when we just started dating for 2 days.\n\nAnd then, after a while of dating she tells me something resulting in a glorious stab in the heart where she quite literally said \"over these past few weeks dating you has made me realise I miss my ex\" and proceeded to fly back to Murica (reddit won't let me say it properly for some reason) THE NEXT DAMN WEEK FFS so naturally I crashed out and drank a lot.\n\nSo referring to the title of this the one main thing as to why I don't want a relationship is that I don't want to lose her, ruin her life or make her detest me because of how I am with overcaring. I hate it but better to stay alone than to ruin someone's life.\n\nAnd for those of you who say work on changing yourself, trust me I've tried but it's pretty hard when you have little experience in the dating scene because you look like a damn goblin from clash of clans.",

    "content": "My boyfriends of a year is only my 3rd sexual partner. When we met he told me he hated getting oral but loved giving it.\n\nWhen we first started having sex it was really good. I was worried he told me he was a porn addict previously but the sex was very focused on my pleasure and I was pleased.  I did try to give him oral but he would stop it after a couple of minutes and move on to me. During those attempts I could tell what he didn’t like and did so I stopped doing the things he didn’t enjoy when I would go down.\n\nAbout a month into sex he one day pulled my hair and started face fucking me. After he asked me if I liked having him control me when down there or if I preferred being in control. I told him I was really uncomfortable being held down there and I was really uncomfortable being face fucked. He claimed he liked me being in control.\n\nLast 2 months or so sex has completely shifted. He hasn’t gone down on me. I feel like a rag doll he uses. He grabs my legs and moves me where he wants me and grabs my head and pushes me into giving him oral often while holding me down there.\n\nThen last weekend happened.  I said I wanted to try anal but have been scared. We tried it once before but it hurt and I cried out and he stopped. It wasn’t off the table to try again.\n\nHe woke me in the middle of the night while I was asleep on my side by entering me from behind (on his side too). It felt good and he and I have an agreement to “wake up sex” when we spend the night together even middle of the night.\n\nA few minutes in he pulls out and aims at my ass. He pushed in a little I cried out and pulled away (no lube used and he has a big dick).  He put his hand over my mouth and grabbed my waist and pulled me hard back onto his cock. I started crying from the pain but he just held me there while he finished with his hand on my mouth. When he was done I told him it hurt and all he said was I never said no and rolled over and went to sleep. Then he woke me up again a few hours later and repeated the whole thing so I was super sore and have been since.\n\nI love him but I don’t love feeling like his sex toy.\n\nEdit:\n\nI’m sitting here crying. I felt used but never really thought about the fact I was violated. I grew up in an abusive household and sometimes boundaries and normal things don’t feel normal and abuse and bad things do.  I’ve been really emotionally numb to this all and I guess I needed a wake up call to see this isn’t okay behavior.",

    "content": "My boyfriend and I have been together for 3months. Before we met he met a girl from a dating app; when we first met then he texted her information about us. Sometimes during dates he would text her constantly and tell me that she is lovey dovey with him saying “thank you for being the brother I never had.” She rejected him from dating app but suggested they be friends. I didn’t say anything initially but as we started getting serious I asked him to delete and stop talking to her. And he did. Fast forward to now, we have had some issues and almost broke up a couple of times.\n\nSome examples of problems include but not limited to incidences when we talk about the future plan and type of children we would have, he says they would have “chinky eyes” because it is a dominant gene. Or when I’m driving he always says “they are probably thinking why is that Chinese driving so terribly.” (I’m not even of Chinese descent btw). Or when I'm going to work and wearing a mask because I didn't want to get others sick, he would say that they would think “that Chinese is spreading covid” when confronted, he would say that he is only saying what the general population is thinking, and I shouldn't take it personally.\n\nRecently, I found that she texted him and they have been referring me as “chinita” (I’m Asian descent and they are Hispanic. Then they would talk about relationship life and sex life, as well as how her mother is doing (she is ill).\n\nWhen I confronted him why he kept saying “I don’t know why I texted back” and that there is nothing going on that is flirtatious. He is now crying profusely apologizing saying he loves me.\n\nIs this emotional cheating?\n\nUpdate 1: he keeps saying “I can’t lose you ur the love of my life I blocked her, and ur my wife”\n\nUpdate 2: he threatened to take his own life when I tried breaking up with him.",

    "content": "Hey, Team! I've been feeling super duper down in the dumps lately and want to vent serious style without fear of personal societal repercussions! This is a throw away account n such. Not really curating this post just typing about whatever comes to mind.\n\nI've never really been the happiest of people. Even in my youth I remember being melancholic more than not. Didn't have the best upbringing (not the worst by a long shot either). My parents fought with each other all the time if I didn't have someone over. I remember hiding in my room hearing them arguing downstairs hoping against hope it wouldn't lead into my room with them competing for my favoritism. There were times either my mom or dad would try to drag me out of the house to stay at a hotel with them because the other parent was \"crazy and untrustworthy\". Events like this were common place (once or twice a month) in the house up until I was around 14 when it all kinda just died out. My parents stopped fighting daily, maybe once a month or so until not at all. They never even acknowledge the horrors they would put me through. They just tell me it wasn't as bad as I think but it totally fucking was. It was hell, not to mention how often they would remind me how abnormal of a human I am.\n\nI've been diagnosed either adhd and I highly suspect I have high-functioning autism. I never really managed to fit in around others as a kid, often doing things my own way. Friends were hard and socializing was harder. My parents would try with all their might to assimilate me into \"normal\" behavior. My mom didn't let me shop for my own clothes until I left the house. I bought some shirts with some cats on them with one of my first paychecks (maybe 16 yrs old). She took and hid them from me because she was afraid people would \"think I'm girly, or gay\" which blew my mind. My dad wasn't the most supportive of my interests either. I recall a time when i was in grade school I really liked filming and doing stop motion Lego things.. I probably just caught him at a bad time (wasn't very many good times).. forgot what I asked but I remember his reply was along the lines of \"it doesn't matter anyway, it won't go anywhere\" in regards to my short-lived hobby. I don't think I picked up that camera again after that. I wish I did. Can't blame myself there i guess.. I was young and impressionable.. I wonder often how things play out if he never said those words. Probably not much different but maybe..  instead I just spent most of my time online, hiding behind headphones blocking out the screaming.\n\nDidn't have many friends growing up. I'd typically just pick one person I liked and puppy dog around them. I was pretty shy and often to target of harassment from some of the meaner kids in school. I got used to being the butt of jokes and such pretty early. It didn't bother me much but it definitely scared me off from trying to form connections. That said I managed enough. I had a lunch table to sit at most of the time. I wasn't usually the star attraction but the folks there didn't seem to mind my presence. I recall once I didn't really feel comfortable sitting at any table so I sat at an empty one. This prompted the principal to come over and with good intentions have me sit at a table with a bunch of strangers I didn't really know. Horrifying experience. That said, I didn't really spend too much time hanging out with friends irl. I unfortunely found connections on the world wide web..\n\nDespite how strict my parents could be they let me have unfiltered internet access from the very get go when i got my first laptop at 12 or so. They never monitored my activity, or set restrictions on screen time or anything. Long-story short I end up in some unsavory online spaces. I met people who at the time I thought were nice friends, parental figures, people to talk to when I didn't have parents I could. It wasn't until a bit later in my life I realized how groomed I got. I never thought much about it at the time. It seemed like people finally enjoyed my company, wanted to invite me to chat and stuff. I didn't see the harm at the time at all. Just some text-based roleplays, maybe a picture or two without my face. Whags the harm? Now in my adulthood I feel like I'm able to see the effects more. My libido is so high yet the thinking about sex makes me extremely uncomfortable in a way that's hard to describe. I get jealous, disgusted, confused, lustful, etc etc etc whenever I see or am reminded of the mere concept of penetration. What's worse is I think it's effected my love language too. I feel I have a really difficult time feeling like I'm showing I love someone if I'm not having sex relatively often. I doubt myself, and if I'm able to provide and be a good partner. I know there's so much more to a relationship but my brain always defaults back to thoughts along these lines. I hate it but the nature of the issue causes me to love it. Its such a conflicting mess of sexual frustration. I have no idea how to do a segway here so... :3\n\nAnxiety is a big thing in my life. It wasn't so bad when I was younger, mostly manifesting in social anxiety around new people or crowds. Nowadays I sometimes feel anxious just leaving my apartment. Going to the store is a massive panic attack and I have no reasons why. I desperately want to put myself out there, meet new people and enjoy this life I have but the exhaustion from the anxiety and depression just constantly kick my dick straight into the dirt.\n\nDepression is the worst. It's only gotten worse since I broke up with my seven year long partner (we were engaged too at the time). The break up is a long story with no heroes and only villains and victims. I don't want to dive into it here. I'm a bastard, theyre a bastard. Point is I'm a total bastard livid with regret over such minute details. I miss my ex... I care about them... but I don't trust them anymore and I loathe the mere memory of them. It's such a dissonance... I can't think back to the early days and not wonder if any of it was real at all. I'm sure there was true love between us sometime... I wonder when we lost it, and I fear they mightve never felt love for me like I did for them. We were young when we met. Stupid too, probably. Grew up and got distant yadayada... happens.. I still miss them.. their quirks and such. The way they talked and the way they ate. Even the things that annoyed me I miss... its wild how much I miss the things that pissed me off...\n\nAnyway, this post is going a bit long. It's bedtime for me.

It doesn’t matter how exhausted I am, I end up getting most of my sleep in between classes.\n\nI’m in an expensive university in a first-world country, my tuition is being paid for by my rich parents. This comes with a weird kind of pressure. It’s like I’m living someone else’s dream.\n\nI have no idea if my university is worth it. The more time I spend here, the more I wonder if this place is actually good or if it’s just an overpriced scam for ppl who couldn’t get into A list schools, especially for an English degree? Idfk\n\nI have no friends. I’m extremely shy, and socializing feels like an impossible task, I had a girlfriend through most of my first year here who I met early but she left me out of boredom and since my entire social group consisted of her friends (since she grew up here) im now a extreme loner. I barely ever leave the house unless I have to go to class.\n\n(No seriously how tf do I come from a family with so many degrees in prestigious top 100 universities and end up in this niche hellhole? Its mind boggling to me.)\n\nIt is completely meaningless to me. I do not really learn anything, all I do is put the bare minimum effort in my classes to pass because they’re all extremely contrived. Instead of helping me develop knowledge and useful skills, it is making me extremely stressed, unconcentrated, feel empty, like I'm losing my identity and living the most meaningless life there is.\n\nI was homeschooled for most of HS, I hated it but being here is honestly making me wish I could turn back time because at least I had my parents to talk to all the time and not over the phone? now it’s a different type of lonely.\n\nSo what am I gonna do with my life?

If I haven't experienced that myself?\" \"Do you think im your mother or something?\" \"What you sow you reap\"... so many things, but I kept my cool, \"yeah i do care a lot about my cat\" is all i said and went about my day.\n\nIt made me even more mad, because I am also fkn sick, I have a bad stomach bug that has been going on for 4 days now, and guess what??? She hasn't done sht for me, hasn't asked how I've been if I'm better or what... \"probably something you ate\" is all she said when I first told her, and off to work I went. Didn't bother to check in, didn't bother to ask how I was doing, if she could make me something to help me... and she has the audacity to say that sht to me?... and guess what, im hating myself for this but here goes.\n\nThe day before, she went to work fkn sick when I had told her the night before not to, because she was literally dying with a high fever. She still goes cause she's a workaholic, Anyway, it's 2pm and I see i have a missing call from this woman, I was showering getting ready to go out with my boyfriend. I call back i asked her what does she need, she tell me to go pick her up because she can't drive back home, that she feels weak... i tell her why I didn't answer when she called, this is what she says \"why didn't you shower earlier, you need to be more attentive\".... wtf??? Why would I pause my day for her? Does she want me to just sit there and wait around for her to get home or call me and finally function, for her? Wtf.\n\nLong story short, I call my boyfriend and let him know what happend, he ended up giving me a ride. So we rushed to get ready he ended up givin me a ride to her work place to pick her up and drive her back home. On the way back, she just kept going on about, why didn't I answer when she called, why am I not paying attention, why was I still sleeping late... I don't fkn know maybe cause I'm also sick and fkn tired from work???? No a thank you to me or my boyfriend, nothing.\n\nI did that sht just for her to be telling me \"you care more about the cat than me\"... but she's right, I don't care as much about her than i do about my cat, I don't love her, but I don't hate her, I see her as the person that gave birth to me, which gives her the mother title, but she is no mother to me emotionally.\n\nAnyway, i wanted to get this sht off my chest, so thank you of you took the time to read this! Have a good night 👍🏻",

I used to work long hours with decent pay, but quit for mental health. When I did have money i burned through it. When I started making less, I didn't adjust and kept burning through it. First time we were behind, it was by about 3k and eventually we paid it. Now we're about 1500 behind and as I'm working still for very little, I don't really have a way to catch up quick and since it's the second time, our landlord whose kind of just a buddy wants us to pay by a certain date or leave (fair). Definitely don't have money to move, definitely can't catch up just by working the way i am. Deeply scared to try and go back to working long hours. I have no formal training or schooling. Definitely have analyzed the past few years and have realized I'm mentally ill and unmedicated. It's also so hard for me to get my head together because I feel like the country is going to shit and it feels so useless to try to do anything. I also recently stopped talking to my parents which was a good decision, but I didn't realize how much of a toll that would take on me. I just feel so stupid about everything.",

    "title": "I (24F) am going on a proper blind date tomorrow night and I genuinely don’t know how to feel about it.",
    "content": "Hello there. This is my first Reddit post so please bear with me.\n\nA couple of days ago I received this text from my mom, “Hi. I am at the nail salon with Susan. She knows of a young eligible bachelor with an affinity for Lord of the rings who really would like to date a nice young lady. We’re setting you up on a blind date.” A minute later she texted me with more personal details about him that would possibly be of interest to me like his career and degree which are both awesome.\n\nSome context: I am a massive nerd who has struggled with dating for quite a while now. I know being 24 lends itself to the thought that “a while” is an exaggeration but, when you’re a hopeless romantic, I promise it’s not. I’ve been in two serious relationships that both weren’t great. The first was with an emotionally manipulative and hateful guy, the other with a guy who thought hiding insults behind the guise of jokes was hilarious (including calling me chubby and saying I have a mustache). Beyond them, I’ve gone on a few first dates with guys and girls from dating apps that have all panned out to be quite awful and many of them have said I was “too much” or “a lot” or have just ghosted me.\n\nI will say, I do have quite a big personality and a lot to say which can feel really intense to people. Especially if they’re just looking for a hookup which I never have. I’m also awful at flirting because I’m just a dorky lady who truly has no concept of that. For gods sake I have two Lord of the Rings swords on either said of my bed. I’m always thoroughly myself which I know can be a lot for some people but I stopped apologizing for that or letting people make me feel bad about it. It also goes without saying that I’ve matured quite a bit throughout the 6 years of being in the adult dating world. I digress.\n\nBack to the topic at hand. I called my mom to ask what was even happening and if she really was setting me up on a blind date. She made clear that this was indeed happening whether I liked it or not. My mom can be quite the character and since she quit teaching a year ago I think it’s given her more time to think about the future including her kids’. I am one of four siblings but I’m the only one who is 100% about wanting to settle down and have a family someday. Granted, my little sister is 12 so she still has time. Anyways, my mom and I chatted for quite a while about how this all happened and how she was talking about my genuine struggles but eagerness to find a life partner. My aunt Susan thought of a family friend of hers whose son has had much of the same issues I have had with dating. And how actually great we would get along, largely because of many common interests as well as being huge romantics and finding that hard to express amongst the modern dating scene.\n\nSo after finagling some of the details, Sunday night I’m going to be having dinner with him at a local pizza place. I’m incredibly nervous for a few reasons. One, our parents have made sure we didn’t get each others numbers beforehand so we are genuinely meeting for the first time with little context, that way we can be more genuine without too much of a vision of each other in our heads. Two, literally there’s no vision of each other because we have also both not been shown what the other looks like so we keep from making judgements too quickly like on dating apps. Although, my mom assured me she would never set me up with a guy she didn’t think was at least a little handsome. And three, this all terrifies me because I have awful anticipatory anxiety as well as a lack of control over my facial expressions. Meaning I don’t know who I’ll be looking for which I’m sure my mom will help me clarify before I get there. But it also means if I don’t find him attractive off the bat, he will likely know right away. I’m not too worried about that as much as how I nervous talk which is why many dates have found me to be a handful. At the same time, whomever I spend my life with is going to have to love that I’m, as my sister coined it, “a professional yapper.”\n\nI guess I’m just feeling very anxious due to the fact that I really get my hopes up before every date but I always feel like I tend to ruin them because I talk so much. I also have a sense of anxiety because I truly know nothing going into this except we have a lot of common ground and that he can be a talker too. All of this also excites me in a way because it would make for a great story whether it does work out or not. I’m really posting here because I don’t know who else to throw up my anxiety on because I’ve spent three days now pondering about how this is going to go. I guess I just need a vote of confidence and maybe some preemptive first date advice because I’m a little rusty (been 7 months since I’ve been on a date). Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

My dad, however, has 12 more children from his previous marriages in Asia. He has three spouses in total, and my mom is the last one.\n\nMy dad is extremely strict. If my 3-year-old brother cries, he gets yelled at or even beaten. The house has to be quiet all the time. If my dad sees any dirt on the floor, he calls all the girls and gives us a two-hour lecture while insulting us.\n\nI first met my dad when I was six because, before that, he lived with his other wife and children. Now he’s here with us, and life has been unbearable. My 7-year-old sister has nonverbal autism—she can’t talk or understand what we say. When she cries or yells, my dad beats her. Imagine that—beating a child with a disability for something she can’t control.\n\nHe constantly compares us to our half-siblings and calls us \"useless\" and \"stupid\" every single day. My mom wants to protect us and has considered divorce, but she’s terrified that he’ll take us away or even stalk us if she tries to escape. He also beats her, and that’s the worst part. I always think, I’d rather he hit me instead of her, but I’m too scared to say anything.\n\nA few months ago, my half-siblings and their moms moved to Europe to live near us. It was the first time I met them in person, and they seemed nice at first. But my dad always loved them while treating us like garbage. My siblings and I work hard—my sister is studying medicine, my brother and I are in engineering—but our half-siblings see it as a competition. They take information from us but feel jealous instead of happy for us. Most of them didn’t even finish school in Asia, but now they want to study. My dad supports them completely and seems to want us to fail.\n\nHe actively tries to sabotage us. If I have homework, he finds random tasks to keep me busy. Even when I study late at night, he calls me out to do useless chores. It’s not just me—he does this to all of us, except for the half-siblings.\n\nAnd now, things have gotten even worse.\n\nLast week, he became stricter than ever. He yells more and beats us over nothing. If my mom speaks up, he tells her to \"shut up,\" and if she says anything back, even just \"huh?\" he threatens to beat her.\n\nYesterday, he gathered all 11 of us in a room, closed the door, and talked for three hours. He said that if my mom ever speaks after he tells her to shut up, he will beat her so badly that her bones will break and she won’t be able to do anything again. He also warned us that if any of us try to stop him, he’ll break our bones too.\n\nI’m scared. I can’t live like this anymore. A father should be someone who protects you, but mine only brings fear. Every time he talks to my mom, I get so stressed, afraid of what will happen next. Even at school, I can’t focus because I’m constantly thinking about them.",

He says he's a fault-finder and that it's just a part of his personality.\n\nIn the beginning, he only used to praise my appearance, but over time, he started commenting on my facial features (nose, forehead, etc.) and many other things. I’ve had a bad case of acne throughout my adolescence due to sensitive skin and genetic factors, so it couldn’t be cured completely. While I don’t have cystic acne all over my face anymore, I still occasionally get breakouts. The skin on my body also gets inflamed easily after waxing.\n\nEarlier, he never said anything about it—in fact, he used to love and support me despite all of this. But eventually, he started telling me to use certain products to improve my skin. I’ve told him multiple times that this isn’t how things work (since I’ve undergone treatment for most of my life), but he gets irritated and says I don’t even want to try and that I lose hope too easily. Similarly, he made comments on my facial features and said I need to get plastic surgery. When I got upset, he claimed it was just a joke.\n\nI have a very chirpy, bubbly personality and get excited easily. We recently went to a concert, and everything was fine until we were walking back.

He got annoyed, removed his arm, grabbed me from behind, and pushed me through the space.\n\nAfter that, he started scolding me for being \"too dumb\" to stand there and not move immediately (which I don’t think is even a reason to fight). For the next hour, he kept verbally abusing me, asking if I was really dumb or just pretending to be around him. He even mocked my excitable personality, saying I get too excited to see him and then start acting dumb. He also said I don’t deserve anything he does for me (including the concert, which was my birthday present from him). He kept going on and on while we walked back for an entire hour. My head hung low, and I was holding back tears the entire time.\n\nWhen I had to catch the train to return home, he held my backpack tightly from behind and forced me to jump onto the moving train, even though I was scared and there was a huge risk involved in doing something like this, I mean, anything could have gone wrong! We had gotten late and almost missed it.\n\nJust two weeks ago, he \"faked\" breaking up with me to \"teach me a lesson\" because he thought that was the only way I would understand. He said he had fought with me multiple times over a single issue, and since I didn’t seem to get it, he had to do this. At first, I thought he was just angry and didn’t take it seriously. But the next day, he texted me dryly and told me it was final. I was heartbroken and broke down in tears, desperately trying to reach out to him.\n\nThat afternoon, I video-called him while crying hysterically, begging him to come back. He laughed in my face and told me not to cry, that everything would be fine in two to three months, and that I should just leave him. He was completely unemotional and unnecessarily cold. Each word hit me hard, and I kept wondering where all his love had gone.\n\nHe knows I’ve had traumatic experiences in my past relationships, yet he took advantage of my biggest emotional vulnerability. He knows I get anxious, overthink everything, and become inconsolable. Despite that, he played on my emotions. The very next day, he went on a five-day trip with his friends, which they had been planning since the previous week. He barely responded to my texts or calls while I was a crying mess, unable to eat, sleep, or work properly.\n\nWhen he came back, I decided to talk to him one last time because I was so hurt that I had finally made up my mind to end things. But when I called him, he acted as if nothing had happened. I lashed out and told him everything he had done wrong and how I felt all those days. After listening, he finally realized how horribly he had treated me and admitted that he thought we would reconcile. He had only pretended to break up with me so I would \"realize my mistake.\" It was never real. He thought we’d just talk and sort it out.\n\nI wasn’t in the right headspace, but I still gave him another chance.\n\nThere are other things that bother me, and I’ve told him a million times to work on them. I always get excited for the weekends because we’re busy all week, and I look forward to spending time together. I usually plan for us to watch a movie, and he always promises to be there at a certain time. But then, he keeps postponing because his roommates drag him along, saying he can’t stop them. He keeps pushing it forward until it’s too late, and I end up waiting. At the end of the night, I just say, \"I understand,\" and go to sleep. He apologizes, promises it won’t happen again, and then does it again the next weekend.\n\nAfter the \"breakup\" drama, we discussed this, and he promised to change. But that very day, he did it again. And then again this weekend.\n\nHe has also told me multiple times that if I don’t start making \"good money\" and move in with him soon, he might get attracted to someone else and leave me.\n\nHe constantly tries to make me jealous by talking about other girls, even saying he doesn’t want to waste the best years of his life in a long-distance relationship and wants to hook up with other girls. Later, he claims he’s just joking and doing it to \"motivate\" me to work harder, earn well, and move in with him.\n\nOn the other hand, I’ve never belittled him or made negative comments about his appearance or insecurities. He has acne scars and body dysmorphia, but I’ve always loved him as he is, making sure he feels comfortable in his own skin. I tell him he’s the most perfect guy for me and that he doesn’t need to change anything to feel good or deserving.\n\nBut he constantly criticizes me, mocks me when I express my struggles, and calls me \"weak\" whenever I try to talk about things that hurt me. He says he doesn’t like weak people who \"crib all the time,\" which makes me feel like I can’t even discuss my problems with him. If I do, he gets annoyed, fights with me, and tells me I’m playing the victim instead of being strong.\n\nHonestly, I’m just really confused. I love him and don’t want to leave, but I don’t know if he’s good for me.\n\nPS: The \"mistake\" he wanted me to realize was that he thinks I need to develop new skills to switch to a better job. My current job is hectic and low-paying, but I have to work hard throughout the week. With my parents' declining health, I can’t study every weekend. Sometimes, I slack off because I’m overwhelmed and need to cool off. He tells me I need to hurry up, and when I explain my situation, he fights with me, mocks me, and says I’ll never earn well or do anything in life because I’m not trying hard enough.\n\nEdit : Additionally, he has told me multiple times that other people’s opinions of him matter a lot. He wants to be \"likable\" to everyone. He said he used to get a lot of attention before developing acne, but things changed after that, which is why he constantly seeks validation from others. He gets upset when girls, in general, don’t give him attention. Whenever I ask why he seeks attention from other girls when I’ve always appreciated and motivated him, he simply says it’s because I’m his \"girlfriend,\" so my words don’t count. He also gets noticeably excited and happy whenever he finds out that a girl is interested in him, as it satisfies his need for validation. I've always brushed it off but idk if it's a concern or not.",

Up until two days ago if I looked at a bright light I'd just get this dark smudge in my vision which went away soon.\n\nWell, on Friday I looked at something bright. Don't even remember what it was, maybe the light reflecting off a car, it was sunny. I went into Maccas to pick up a burger for my mother and I had trouble reading past the black splotch. Ordered the burger, scrolled tumblr while I waited.\n\nThe black splotch soon disappeared but there was nothing where it had been. I was reading something about COVID and it was hard to read. I could see only the top third of the C and the bottom left of the O in COVID was also gone.\n\nAnd then I got this static that appeared. This flashing rainbow static. It started moving out across the left of my vision, and I could see directly in front of me but the blind spot was getting bigger and moving. If I held up my hands in front of me I couldn't see my left hand at all.\n\nI made it home OK but half an hour after it started the left of my peripheral vision was gone.\n\nLuckily in another half hour my peripheral vision was back, but augh, it just happened again. I looked at a candle and went to read a book, and oh shit, I can barely read again, and oh no there's the small flashing staticky crescent, and it went and spread across the left of my vision again. Like a ripple going outwards.\n\nMy peripheral vision on my left is gone again.\n\nI hope this isn't going to become a thing. I had a similar thing happen to me fifteen years ago, once, but this is twice in two days. Am I going to have to start making sure I don't look at bright lights now? What if it gets worse?

He constantly chose other people (friends, girls) over me and put me last. I can’t think of anything positive about him when it comes to our past relationship. For some reason, I still think about him every day. I still think about the very few good moments that we had together. They play in my head over and over again.

The only thing was girl bullies don't normally bully to your face they do everything, if not most behind your back, which lead me to blaming the only person who openly made fun of me but what he did wasn't even that bad. Example he would snicker to his friends where I could hear or throw snow balls at me. Chomp change in comparison to what I was going through at the time. Although it was enough for me to tell everyone I hated, loathed and despised him. For Years and only when I became an adult did I realize that what I was saying about him was somewhat the same as what I heard about myself. Hatred with no context. I've felt bad ever since and even though it's been 20 years I've always wanted to say \"I'm sorry\" but could never find him. Till tonight at 2am I found him and he's engaged and looks very happy. So I just wanted to get this off my chest, since I will stop looking now, I have no intention of trying anymore cuz he deserves to not have this random piece of knowledge.

There was this one small house on the left side of the road and coming up on it, I could hear splitting noises like someone was being hit but I think I couldn't believe it until I actually got close enough. There was this guy, 20s maybe both of them, standing over his wife or girlfriend on the front lawn, she was lying down on her side and had her arm stretched out. Then as I walked by slowly, unable to stop for some reason, he started beating and slapping her and grabbing her by the hair and yanking her towards the house. He also kicked her multiple times. I think he might have called her Alicia. But the eerie thing was that she was surprisingly quiet about it, not like crazy screaming, but just like, please stop! You would think she'd be screaming and crying out for help or something. I remember that I was just walking in horror, the guy didn't seem to notice me or if he did, he didn't care. I couldn't stop and I couldn't stop looking at them. I think I was trying to figure out what street I was on but I had never thought to memorize the alley way streets so I didn't know. The whole scene moved in slow motion but I still remember the entire beating, the sounds, the sounds of grass scraping, the shape of his hands. Just broad daylight at 3pm on a weekday, front lawn, no one else on the street but them and me, springtime.\n\nI ran home in tears and told my mom who just told me not to get involved. When I tried to tell her that I think he was going to kill her, she asked me what street and address this happened because if we report it, I'll have to know all these things. I had no idea, so again, she told me to mind my own business.\n\nI was 10 or so when this happened and I'm in my 30s now. I still have the exact same fantasy memory of having gone back in time and instead of walking away and running away from the scene, I get in between them and save her somehow. If not save, but at least make such a fuss that someone calls the cops. It's always the same thing - that I don't care if I get hurt in the process, I would have done the brave thing. Instead of what I actually did... just run away in literal horror. I feel so haunted by this scene. I don't think I'll ever forget it for the rest of my life, honestly.",

    "content": "A bit of backstory: I used to live in the countryside with an older relative and she had a habit of acquiring pets she was unable and unwilling to take care of, eventually we ended up with four dogs, two small and two large. The problem is that every time we would open the front gate to take the car out the dogs would run out into the brush and potentially put themselves in danger, so we’d lock them in a tiny cage for a few minutes while we drove out and then come back in and let them out into the yard. The two large dogs started to get too big and the relative refused to buy a new larger cage for them and told me to figure it out (it was my job to lock up the dogs and this relative could basically boss me around all she wanted.) eventually I started putting one of the smaller dogs in an open plastic barrel while the others stayed in the cage, but she learned to jump out, so I would put a lid on it for more than five minutes. I hate myself for it, but I am an extremely, almost medically, forgetful person. And one day, I simply forgot about the dogs, and went to work, truly believing that I had let them out as usual. I came back to find that the dog had suffocated in the covered barrel. I can’t explain the emotions I had in that day, but that happened when I was 16 and it still makes me nauseous to think about. I’ve had a very hard life, but for some reason I think that this day was the worst day. There was a lot of screaming and crying from both the relative and I and she made me wrap the dog in an old dog food bag and carry it to the car so that I could dump it far from our property, unceremoniously. It still fucking haunts me. Everyone tells me it was an accident, but I still have nightmares about it. All I can think about is how horrible it must be to be a tiny innocent thing suffocating in a plastic barrel on a hot day. It eats me alive. Everything makes me anxious, I don’t want to be responsible for something like that happening again, I want to have kids one day, but how can I knowing that there’s a possibility that they can meet a horrible end just because my mind is in the clouds. The only time I spoke of this event was the day it happened, to various online friends, and then I never spoke of it again since until now. I’m laying in bed and trying to sleep, and maybe it would help if someone knew.\n\nI’m sorry Lila, I didn’t mean to.",

    "content": "I Ran Away from Home at 13 to Escape Abuse Now I'm Trying to Change My Life\n\nI don’t know if my story matters to anyone, but I feel like I need to let it out. Maybe someone out there understands what it’s like.\n\nI grew up with my grandmother when I was little, and she made me feel loved. She taught me kindness, humility, and the importance of sharing, even when you don’t have much. I still carry that with me today. But when I was five, she had to leave, and I was sent to live with my mom. She tried her best she worked abroad to support me. Eventually, I was left along with my half siblings to their grandmother, and that’s when everything changed.\n\nFrom the time I was six until I was thirteen, I was abused. Not just words physical beatings that left my skin red and bruised. My teachers saw the marks, but I told them I fell. What else was I supposed to say? No one would have believed me anyway. My only escape was watching TV dramas. I cried along with the characters because, for a moment, it felt like I wasn’t alone. I had no phone, no way to tell my mom, no one to vent to.\n\nI tried everything to please her. I got good grades. I cleaned the house. I did the dishes. Nothing was ever enough. Because in her eyes, I didn’t belong I wasn’t of her blood. No matter what I did, I was unwanted.\n\nSo one day, I left.\n\nI walked nearly 6 kilometers to my grandmother’s place. It wasn’t my first time running away I even did it once when I was six, but that time, I brought a school friend with me. Their grandmother was furious that I brought their grandchild along with me tbh I didn't know what I was thinking I was still a child that time in 2nd Grade. But this time, I was alone and determined. When I finally arrived, my grandmother wasn’t upset she was happy to see me. She took me in without question. It was only after the third time I ran away that she finally got mad and went straight to confront the woman who had abused me.\n\nThat was the moment I finally felt safe. My grandmother has been my safe space ever since.\n\nBut the past doesn’t just disappear. Even after escaping, I still struggled. In 7th grade, I got dengue and had to be hospitalized for a month. That’s when the doctors found other health issues, but I was never told what they were. No one ever explained anything to me. At least my stay was covered by PhilHealth, so it didn’t add to my problems.\n\nNow I’m 19, but I still feel stuck. I have trust issues. I struggle with self-worth. Sometimes, I wonder if I’m the problem, if I’ve just been blaming my childhood for everything. But I also know I want to break free from this cycle. I want to change.\n\nI want a better life. I want to help others like me. I want to leave an impact and make a difference. And if I want that, I have to keep going.",

He died suddenly. I'm still working through that, I  was the one who took him to the hospital a few times that week, but the last time it was a serious emergency and he didn't get out. He died a few weeks later after being in a coma for the time.\n\nThis sort of, at least in my opinion, galvanized us into having a closer bond.  Or so I thought.\n\nDad dying was only a few months ago. It hasn't been a year yet. But I'm still trying to pick up the pieces and start moving forward.  And it was like our relationship with each other improved over it. We were a very loving family before, but this hurt us and we leaned on each other more.\n\nThen I learned the other day my Mom brought the hypothetical prospect of me being homeless.\n\nI don't intend to be homeless. But she brought it up to him or he brought it up to her, and he flat out told her that if I ever end up homeless I am not going to be living in his and his wife's house. For the record, I didn't ever ask or mention this. But this conversation took place behind my back and he apparently said that I was never going to be allowed to live with them.\n\nThey have a very large house btw, essentially half the rooms are empty at any given day.\n\nThat shocked my Mother to hear that and she told me.\n\nAnd quite frankly, it shocked me too. I am not going to be homeless. But to hear someone you thought you could rely on if things ever went to total shit say that, it's sad. But what made me more sad was remembering a conversation I had with him a few months before.\n\nHe told me his wife (31 f)'s best friend (30 f) who has a kid and either got kicked out of her own house, or cheated, or something became a single mother. My brother told me he was actively considering moving her and the kid INTO their house. She, who has had numerous problems from heavy drug use, alcohol use, partying hard, who has seemingly reformed her ways - was welcome to live with them. It didn't end up happening because she QUICKLY found a new guy.\n\nBut that was a total shocker to me, that I, who has had no problems with drugs and alcohol, who helps take care of his kid, who buys her toys and plays with her, who has bought them gifts every holiday, is lower on the totem pole than the single mom best friend of the wife. It totally blindsided me, and I feel betrayed. I'm not at any risk of being homeless, but the conversation came up between my Mom and him and that's how it went. To think your own brother won't be there for you, but will be for some sketchy broad, is totally insane. And for me it's like I'm feeling just heartbreak, resentment, sadness, disappointment, all mixing together - I love him, I still do, but I feel like I just got betrayed... Betrayed over something that hasn't happened yet. But that he thinks so low of me is shocking really. I don't know what to do.",

    "content": "When a baby is born with harlequin ichthyosis, most opt to do the merciful thing of putting it out of its misery. When someone develops in the womb with a hormone imbalance, they are told they should be supported and forced to live. I am 22. From a very young age, I have never seen myself as the sex I was born. Even before I understood what any of that meant, in my head, I never once saw myself as a boy. Even though my brain doesn't agree with the rest of my body, my body is indisputably male. I was miserable as a young child and I am even more miserable now because the reality sunk in much harder after years of treatment. My body will continue to mature like a man's, and I will never be female. I will never have the sex chromosomes my brain so badly wanted. When I was a teen, I became so overwhelmed by the way my mom was treating me that I decided to either die or convince myself and everyone else that it was just a phase and I'm just a normal male. I truly deluded myself for an entire year, and I remember that being a particularly miserable year of my life. I couldn't lie to myself forever though. I wish I could. Life would be so much better if I could accept the chromosomes and genitalia and bone structure and organs that I was born with.\n\nI don't want to be supported. I truly do not want to live knowing that I will never have a uterus or be able to relate to the life experiences of a female human being. I will never look female, no matter how many surgeries. Hormone treatment only does so much. Cosmetic surgeries only do that: cosmetic altering. But I'm poor anyways, so surgery would be unlikely for a long time. I think it is unbearable to live like this. How can I ever accept my existence? It is so horrible feeling that my condition must constantly be made into a joke by the people who supposedly experience similarly and the people who oppose them. I must be reminded of my condition every waking second.\n\nI feel completely alone. I suppose it is nice that others can find happiness in a life like this, but I genuinely cannot underatand how. This is an incurable mistake from birth. Nature makes mistakes. Birth defects happen all the time. Predispositions happen all the time. It feels cruel when others try to validate my existence. I don't support my own existence. It is genuinely horrible anyone has to live through this. That is what I think. It's unbearable. I've been hospitalized before. I've been an extremely suicidal person for longer than I can remember.\n\nWhy do I have to live with this? How is it not cruel?",

    "content": "Okay, so I am going to try to keep this short, but I need advice. My ex (27F) and I (30F) first started seeing each other in February 2022. Very early on in the relationship she complained about one of her machines she uses for work, and it leads to me getting her a loan in my name, under my social, to be her new upgraded machine. The machine ended up being a 2.3k loan.\n\nTime goes by and we realize we are not right for each other. We were both super toxic during the relationship in our own ways. Her and her daughter moved out in the middle of June 2024 after us breaking up initially in the middle of May.\n\nEver since they moved out, she was constantly late on the payments, which caused her to make late payments every single time. Thankfully, this did not impact my credit by some miracle in this universe.\n\nOn 1/10/2025 of this year, after not paying since November, I went in and withdrew money from a mutual fund my dad gave me when he passed away. Not something I wanted to do but I had to because it was starting to impact my credit drastically.\n\nBefore this, on 11/25/2024, her daughter called me because she missed me. My ex wasn’t home, her mother (kid’s grandma) was. I said hi to her even and she didn’t say anything to me. When my ex got home the kiddo dropped the tablet she was using, and it disconnected.\n\nI ended up texting my ex asking her not to be mad at her kid when she just missed me like I missed her. We have a fight where we both said some intense things (and I did a lot of it). I have no excuses for the things I said, but I don’t regret it either.\n\nLong story short – she blocks me and deletes the calling app off her kiddos tablet so she can’t call me again.\n\nThe loan, in the beginning, was $2,299. When I paid it off, I paid $1,154.39. I paid 50.22% of this loan.\n\nDo I have grounds to get this back? How do I go about getting it back?\n\nAlso, do I have grounds to get my dog back? I let my ex take her when I was not in a good mental space because I couldn’t even take care of myself. Dog’s microchip is under my name and to my knowledge she didn’t update her vet records so the last person for her was me. In the dog space – I am this dog’s favorite person. I went over there one day and was talking to my ex and my dog freaked out for a solid 15 minutes over seeing me.\n\n*We live in Oklahoma in the USA*\n\nSo, should I just cut my losses and move on and try to save that money back up or should I text her from a different number or a friend’s phone to ask her to give it back since I paid half. Genuinely I have no idea what to do in this situation and I’ve gone back and forth for 2 months.",

    "content": "Hello everyone. I am writing this in hopes to get it off my chest no matter how familiar or boring the subject may be.\n\nI am a 24yo woman, I am a student, currently unemployed and I live with my boyfriend. I consider myself a normal person, nothing out of the ordinary in my life or in my character. I am healthy, i have hobbies, i have friends and normal healthy relationships, and nothing in my life is out of line.\n\nI am giving this info because the story concerns my father’s behaviour towards me basically since i was 11yo.\n\nHe has always been the provider for our family ( my mom, sister, dad and i ). The problem in my story is his character and his behaviour towards everyone in his life ( i mean family and close ones ). Since I was a little girl he has always used derogatory language with me and my mom. He has fits of rage every day and shouts at us and mostly her because i do not live there anymore. Name calling of all sorts for no reason.\n\nI will give an example - once i was going out for a walk and i took a bottle of water with me (1L), small bottle nothing insane. He saw it and started screaming at me every offensive word you can think of. He said no person in his right mind takes water outside on a walk. Another example - he screamed at my mom and the didn’t speak to her a whole week because HE forgot his lunch on his way out. Apparently she needs to be there every second and remind him to even blink.\n\nHe is the same with my sister and his parents( my grandparents).\n\nNo one in my family has ever talked to him about this and they are enablers to his behaviour.\n\nFor the years that I spent living with them, when he would get home from work I would stay in my room and not even go to the bathroom for hours even if i needed to just because to get to the bathroom you have to go through the living room and that is where he watched tv and spent the evenings.\n\nOver the years i developed severe anxiety, low self esteem, binge eating disorder and many more characteristics and conditions that make my life miserable.\n\nThe binge eating disorder came because all my life he would call me fat and huge and enormously big ( I have always been 50-55kg at 1.65cm height, i work out at the gym and have been a runner for a few years, so yeah I am slim and have even been very skinny for some time )\n\nSo, this person with his insane behaviour has long ago lost my respect and fondness of him. Although until now i have been silent.\n\nToday, at dinner i couldn’t take it anymore. For months i’ve been having dreams of him screaming at me and while asleep I felt the hatred in my heart. So today, he started to insult me again and I didn’t stay silent this time. I told him that respect has to be earned and he doesn’t have mine because of all the years of name calling and treating me like garbage. He was stunt and said that i don’t have a father anymore. To be honest, i’ve felt like that since i was 11.\n\nEven though it hurt him, he can’t begin to imagine the pain i’ve been feeling for years.\n\nI can’t stop crying because of the words I said but I know I had to say them at some point in my life to free myself and defend myself. I feel pity for him and nothing else. I am sorry that he is the way he is because it can only end badly for him.\n\nI am proud I defended myself for the first time but I will always be in pain because he’s been brought up to be the person he is. He is incapable of change and I am sorry for him.",

    "content": "Hello. I just came to get this off my chest because I can't take it anymore. English is not my first language.\n\nThree years ago, I adopted a stray puppy. After having him at home for five days, I realized he had parvovirus, so I had to hospitalize him for ten days. It was a miracle that he survived, and after that, he had to stay home for two months without going outside, as recommended by the vet.\n\nThe first time I took him out, I noticed he was terrified of absolutely everything—noises, cars, other animals, people, but especially men. It took a lot of effort to get him comfortable going on walks. We took it slowly, and after a year, I managed to take him to the dog park.\n\nNow, my dog is three years old, and for the past three months, his condition has worsened. He only wants to go to the bathroom once a day, around midnight, when no one is on the street. I live in the city center, which is always busy and noisy (for various reasons I just can't afford to move to the country side). Every day is a struggle. He prefers to go inside the house to avoid going outside. He trembles and cries. If visitors come over, he hides and shakes the entire time. The only time he is happy is when it's just me, my partner, and him at home.\n\nSeeing him like this breaks my heart, and on top of that, no one wants to take care of him—not even paid services or dog daycare centers because of his condition. I took him to a specialist ethologist, tried medications, relaxants, and behavioral exercises, but nothing has improved.\n\nSometimes, I think about giving him to someone with a huge field where he could run and be happy, but at the same time, I don’t want to let him go. It feels wrong—no one will take care of him like I do, no one will love him like I do. What if he misses me? What if he feels abandoned?\n\nEvery day, I suffer for him and blame myself for not being a better owner.",

Then I'm angry at her for how she acted in her anger, then she's angry at me for being upset by it all.  It's a vicious cycle. Anyways, her dad offered to pay for us to go to therapy. Therapist was a 70 year old guy that's been doing it for 50 years. Seems very wise. Is all about accountability. Doesn't want to hear what the other person did to you, he only wants to know how you contributed to the situation.\n\nMy wife has missed the last two sessions. Which hurt me alot, as things have been so bad I've been desperately wanting the help to break the cycle. The first time she was angry and didn't want to come. The second time she said she forgot the appointment.\n\nI vented out alot of our problems when I was alone this last session, and was grilled for my part of it. I talked about things I've done, she's done, and things that are affecting the children. He said we will plan to get her side of things when we come back together.\n\nWe both showed up yesterday, and he wanted her side of the issues I talked about. Every time she went to talk about something, she prefaced it by saying \"I only did this because he did this first\" etc... even an issue i had with how mean she was to our daughter recently. Our daughter is 6. But the story still started out with \"well she yelled at my sister, so I did this.\" He became irritated and impatient with her. Told her that he wouldn't keep trying to beat the issues out of her and that she needs to stop blaming other people and just admit to what she did. She stammered and couldn't talk without trying to shift some guilt first. It went back and forth between them for a minute, with me sitting silently to the side. She couldn't get any kind of admission out without having someone else to blame first. Eventually she started reading out some horrible texts she had sent me out loud on her phone. It was painful to hear her read it off so robotically, but to me it seemed like a step in the right direction because the things she said were awful and she was technically admitting to it by reading it out loud. She got towards the end, but threw in one more \"then he did this, so I did this.\"\n\nHe said \"Both of you need to get out. This sessions is over.\" As soon as she finished reading. We both left silently. As I went to leave the building, I had the urge to go back. I knocked on his door and asked for a few more seconds of his time, which he obliged. I asked why he ended it at that point, because in my mind she seemed to be cooperating. He said that it's a combination of things. Firstly, her not showing up to appointments. He helps us outside of his normal office hours as a favor to her dad, who he knows from a rehab program. Her not showing up is disrespectful at best. Secondly, it was the combination of the horrible things she said via text, the robotic way she read them, and her inability to take accountability. I said I understood and thanked him for his time.\n\nI don't know where to go from here. Things have been so awful. She's been fighting with me and other people nonstop over the smallest things. After that appointment, she has flipped a switch that's been engaged for weeks now and is acting as sweet as possible. I feel like it's a love bombing facade.

Although she never saw a specialist or therapist to treat these problems (which she admitted to me was out of fear or pride), I always try to explain to her that right now it is impossible for me to be devotedly aware of her every second of the day, with my career, my activities, my friends and my own life in general. Every day I talk to her to accompany her in the little free time I have during the day and when I return home exhausted I also make sure to communicate with her and ask her about her day and if she would like to talk about something with me, in which most of the time her answers are \"I have nothing interesting to tell\". There are also times when a harmless joke I make unleashes hell where she gets offended at me and I need to reassure her of how much she means to me and how much i really love her, I apologize for upsetting her with something I said, to which she (apparently) accepts my apologies and (also apparently) everything is resolved. Last night I even went out with my guy friends to a bar after a hard week and all day long I let her know who I was with and what our plans were for the night, to which she ended up responding, as a way of throwing it in my face, that I will never be able to understand her and solve all the damage she suffered with me with a simple forgiveness, and acussed me of not caring about her and not being able to see things the way she sees them.

It’s frustrating how people would rather disappear than have an honest conversation. A simple message saying, \"Hey, I don’t think this is working out,\" would take seconds, yet they choose to leave me confused and questioning what I did wrong. I’m done wasting my energy on people who don’t respect my time or feelings.",

So the day of, I was told to get completely undressed and put on the generic open back gown, which due to my frame made me look like Donald Duck, if you know what I mean. I was led to the or by a nurse and placed on a cold metal table. They administered some local anesthesia to my legs and after about 10 minutes laying naked in a cold, brightly lit room waiting to be sliced up, the 2 doctors strolled in. I was very anxious, cold, and self conscious, so I just stayed still. Nurse: Anesthesia was given, patient ready. Doc1: (walks to the table) wow, big fucker and such a small dick. Doc2: Haha. Me: WHAT??? Nurse: (panic) oh no, you have the wrong patient file, this one isn't the fully sedated one. He is awake. Doc1: ... Doc2: ... Me: WHAT??? So yeah, nobody said another word to me for the rest of the operation, just 200 decibels of awkward silence while they ripped veins out of me. It felt like Ricky Gervais wrote this scene. I should have walked out, but I was too shocked to even think. When they were done they exchanged quiet words with the nurse and quickly walked out. It was a bit shocking, but I quickly laughed it off. I mean, they weren't WRONG, but man... Some people. Edit: this was 10 years ago, I am fine.",

    "content": "I have to get something off my chest, it's been bothering me for a while.\n\nDepartment of Children's Services (Australia) are the most incompetent, useless, stupid government agency I've ever had the displeasure of working with, whom I'm sure hire only the worst and dimmest of candidates and have fostered a culture of ineptitude and apathy throughout the system.\n\nI have nothing but complete and utter contempt for the department and their so called social workers, as I can say truthfully and without hyperbole or exaggeration that I have not seen them make a good call on a child or family situation in the 30 years I've been cursed with their association.\n\nI am a psych and behavioural analyst and run a disability and aged care support company in remote Queensland. I am involved with the department because I provide therapeutic placement for children with disabilities. My company, as best as I can tell, is one of the very few with capacity for kids with serious behaviours of concern, certainly the only one that I am aware of in my or any surrounding regions, judging by how far some kids come to be placed with us.\n\nThe ignorance on display from DoCs staff is breathtaking. They don't listen. They don't understand disability, which to be fair, I don't really expect them to, not really, but they just are not willing to learn. Somehow the decisions they make seem tailored to be cruel and hurtful to parents for no good reason and they are openly hostile and dismissive to families they have independently decided they don't like.\n\nVague examples for privacy:\n\nSingle mother with 5 month old baby. Has 2 other children in placement. Meetings for one occur in Town A. Meetings for the other occur in Town B. She lives in City C. The meetings are set for 8am for one, and 9am for the other. Town A is 90km (56mi) from City C, and Town B is 107km (66mi) from City C. Town B is 193km (119mi) from Town A. She has no car, and relies entirely on public transport to get around. This is utterly impossible.\n\nThere is a department office 7 minutes from her house by bus. They flat put refused to entertain the idea of having meetings at that office, or even just Zoom meetings. She had to attend in person. Every failure was used as evidence of inability to manage her time, and proof she shouldn't have her children.\n\nChild with serious behaviours of concern (violence, property destruction, suicide ideation) who was surrendered by family was placed with us on short notice because previous two placements claimed no capacity. (Probably because of the damages combined between the two of them). No behavioural plan was supplied, despite them having one and being requested for 7 weeks, in the end I had to go behind their backs and track down the practitioner that wrote it myself. DoCs severely downplayed the behaviours upon placement, and frankly if we weren't so good at our jobs and able to adjust so fast, serious harm absolutely could have happened due to the lack of accurate information provided. We got lucky those first few weeks.\n\nTheir sole focus is on reunification with the family. Their solution was to force them together every weekend. No support, no plan, just shove a violent individual in a house with a shellshocked family for 2 and a half days, the siblings of which actively (and with good reason) do not want them there, for a couple of days and hope for the best. When sexual assault claims were made by a sibling, DoCs ignored it and tried to push for the next weekend anyway. It took a call to Children's Safety who in turn made a stern call to DoCs for them to decide against that decision for a weekend.\n\nI sat with the case workers and supervisors and went through the complex disabilities and mental health issue for this individual and explained what realistically needed to happen for reunification. What to expect. A recommendation for steps to take moving forward. I thought it went well. A follow up meeting with the school a mere 2 hours later and the case worker said that a fidget spinner should keep them occupied for 4 hours and thus solve the school attendance issues. Moronic. No attention paid whatsoever.\n\nThey openly blame the parents, their lack of parenting for the issues. Stay at home dad, mum has a pretty unusual job that has her travel often but pays very well. They mock her in meetings, talking about how she's \"living her best life\" on \"holidays\" when she's away for a week, working.\n\nI am so frustrated. They are now looking at foster care options. Removal from a therapeutic placement where they have made real progress, (for example, nearly $100k in damages, zero school attendance between 2 placement over 3 months, compared to us where we have had maybe $500 in damages and school attendance every day at first with support and now independently between an hour and 4 hours and we have had them for 6 months) to be put with some unsuspecting and unqualified family for $700 a week. Absolute madness.\n\nI just want to scream into the void. The family is actively working with us, the school is actively working with us, but DoCs... DoCs don't give a shit. And they hold the cards. They claim they care, but when it comes to complex disability they actively ignore vital information and forge ahead like it was a typical kid, damn everyone else.\n\nSorry, I got a bit ranty. They just piss me off so much.",

It was all fun till eventually I started to actually have feelings to her because I would always talk about my personal life and struggles to her and she would say back to me while hugging me \"it's okay, everything's going to be all right, just note that I'm here for you when needed ♥️\" like seriously guys even while quoting what she would say to me I'm literally crying 😭 (I'm not effing joking) not only that she was also my comfort and coping zone as well for the $hit I go through in life. Even when I go to see I like to use my pillows to imagine it's her and I can hug and kiss her randomly as I pleased, other ways I like to imagine she's there for me is when I daydream about her (mostly) draw or write my stories with her (fun fact: I created her for my comic but my personal life, I want to publish it by doubt anyone read it so I just keep it to myself 🤣) journal about her in her ways for me and what we would do together! I know I'm weird but I'm not ashamed of it\n\nLike literally last night while I was walking around the neighborhood, right now I'm in the forest type of neighborhood so it's a lot of trees and hills here 😅 (also it was around 11ish night time 🌙) and I'll admit I was kind of scared and a little nervous to go to dark areas like that even the street lights wouldn't work so it made my nervous system 10 times worse, but while walking I could hear her tell me \"why so scared? I'm here with you! Just hold my hand and we'll walk together! Breathe and calm down\" (I would Literally hold the air or hold my own hand to think it's her) like it come for me so much that my heart for her couldn't take the fact that she's not real because mentally (to me) she is! As soon as I got back to my Airbnb I was literally crying a river for her! Even my own friend had to comfort  me to tell me everything's okay to not feel too down about it (he's real btw) so yeah I know which y'all thinking I'm a loser, weirdo, idiot for going out and crying for something that doesn't exists and your right I do! I just wish she was real she's my everything!!!  If it wasn't for her I probably be scared out of my mind or even worse....\n\nNote: I doubt anyone is reading this but if you are and if you're interested to know more about her I'll tell you more of her name and her information and another story if anyone's interested trust me I don't mind explain more about her I love my sweet bone 🦴😍💜💋\n\nBut seriously I would love some helping tips and other ways to cope with her! She really helped fixes my depression and suicidal mindset 😭 🥺",

That might sound harsh but that’s the only word I can think of. We will go downtown to some place she wants to go and she will walk down a street and be like “oh wait wrong way” then walk down another street and be like “oh no wrong way” then walk down another street and be like “oops wrong way again”. It’s horrible, she has no sense of direction and I feel so stupid following her around.\n\nShe also talks in circles which makes me so angry. Like for an example yesterday she asked me, “do you want a burrito for dinner?” Then I replied we don’t have the ingredients for a burrito so I’m going to eat the food we have in the house. She then asks, “oh so you don’t want a burrito?” So I thought maybe she bought ingredients for a burrito so I said sure I’ll have a burrito. She then says, “ok but we don’t have the ingredients for a burrito”. Like YES I KNOW THAT.\n\nHer stupidity makes me treat her worse which I hate because I don’t want to be rude to people but sometimes the way she talks and acts just infuriates me. I also feel more slow and held down when I’m with her. Like when she makes a dumb decision I’m usually around her so I have to help her correct her mistake.\n\nAnytime I do something alone I feel a huge wave of happiness go through my body because I don’t feel held back from her behaviour. Overall she’s a good person but I honestly don’t think I can continue a relationship with her. Her misjudgments cause me so much financial loss and general stress.",

    "content": "another long post...\n\nfor context, my(f18) sister(17) and her best friend(f15, almost 16, let's call her Dana) have been friends for almost a decade, they've always spent a lot of time together because our moms were friends. the last few years have been very very rough for Dana, and we've always been here for her, especially my sister, and that made them even closer.\n\nso, today, during lunch, my sister came to my mom and asked her if she could go out for a party night with Dana and her friend group, BUT. here in italy, there are two stages of the party: the first one is open to everyone, the second one is only 18+, and she wanted to go right to the second one, that begins around midnight. my mom immediately said \"no.\", and my sister started whining, saying that Dana went there too a few weeks ago, and guess how she did that? fake ID and some connections, and that surely didn't help to have a \"yes\" as an answer. a few hours ago i was with my sister and Dana, just talking, until my sister asked my thought about going to that party at that hour, and i said: \"honestly i don't approve that, not because you're going there, but because you're gonna do it 'illegally'.\", and she got angry, saying that she wanted to do that experience because she's a teenager and blah blah blah, to which i replied: \"yeah, you're a teenager and have to do your experiences, but you can make them on the first half of the night, where you can go without any problem.\", and i think she expected me to be the \"cool older sister\" because she got angry, and it only got worse when my brother(21) also said he agreed with me. so she went upstairs and i stayed with Dana, so i started talking with her about all this. the conversation then went to my sister's general behaviour, and we went to my room to talk more liberally. after a while, we were talking about how she (my sister) almost never wants to go out unless one of us has weed or cigarettes and stuff like that, and that's when i told her something i had forgot:\n\nlast august they both were at home, my best friend was there as well, and we were all chilling in the backyard, when Dana told my sister that she had to go to her(Dana's) place, that she promised that, but my sister was whining about it, saying she didn't feel like it, but not giving a reason to break the promise, so they came up with a deal: Dana would have gone home, and my sister would go there about a half hour later, so Dana left. i stayed with my best friend and my sister, who started saying things like \"i don't wanna go\", \"i don't feel like it\", and i replied other things like \"why don't you tell her?\", \"if you stand her up without saying anything, i'll tell her.\", and she freaked out, saying that if i did i would be a bitch, and i just rolled my eyes. after a while, she left and went to her room, and i immediately gave my best friend a \"i know how this will end up\" look, but didn't say anything.\n\nalmost a hour later, Dana calls me and says: \"your sister isn't answering my texts and calls. where is she?\". i took a deep breath and face palmed mentally before answering: \"she's in her room, i'll go check on her.\", and so i did. i muted myself and went to my sister, who was awake, and told her: \"Dana's on the phone, what do i tell her?\", and she replies: \"tell her that i'm asleep.\". my heart dropped and i didn't know what to do, so i just played along, unmuted myself, and said: \"she's sleeping.\". Dana was so disappointed and told me to wake her up, so i started shaking my sister trying to \"wake her up\", but she just pretended to fall asleep again and again, and i heard Dana say: \"look, never mind, let her sleep.\". i asked her if she was sure, and she said \"yes\", and i just said: \"okay, then... bye love, i'm sorry.\", and hung up. i looked at my sister and said a few things like \"you're an asshole\", \"you're a shitty friend\".\n\nso, returning to two hours ago, i told Dana about it, even though i probably shouldn't have, but i just thought it was the right thing to do. her face dropped and she became visibly sad and disappointed, said something like \"i don't even know what to say\", \"i can't think or look at her the same\", and i felt kind of guilty, but still thought that she had the right to know.\n\nwe smoked two cigarettes and she went to sleep, saying that she would figure out what to do about all this, again, she's clearly disappointed and tired of my sister being disrespectful.\n\nit's currently 4am, and i'm sorry for ruining her mood, but also scared of my sister's reaction in case she finds out that Dana knows, i've already made a post about my sister and her behaviour:/\n\nenglish is not my first language, so, sorry for any mistakes and/or things like that, i just didn't want all this to eat me up.",

    "title": "I broke a close friend’s heart after playing him 6 years ago",
    "content": "TLDR: My cousin’s ex fell for me and I flirted back, causing a “situationship” or as he called it, friends with (nonsexual) benefits . I told him I didn’t want to date because he dated my cousin but never stopped flirting. I started talking to my now husband when him and I were a thing and broke his heart. Last week, I was bored at work so I started going through old texts with my Snapchat friends and found one that’s been driving me crazy. Basically, when I (20F) was in 8th grade/14 years old, I played this guy (we’ll call him Carson) right after my ex broke up with me. He really really liked me and I didn’t start flirting back until after my ex broke up with me on April 1st (easy date to remember because I made jokes about the relationship being an April fools joke). Idk if I really liked Carson or if I just liked the attention but either way, I flirted back, hung out with him, etc. and I have a video of him trying to kiss me but me not really going along with it, but I also have pictures of us somewhat cuddling (one was of him laying on my lap) and I know we were alone a few times, once was just us watching a movie. We were a thing but never officially started dating because I told him I didn’t want to since he was my cousins ex. My cousin didn’t really care so maybe I was using it as an excuse?? Idk. But everyone around us knew that there was something going on between Carson and I.  Well, on April 18th, I started talking to my now husband (we’ll call him Riley) and April 21st, we started dating. Ig I never told Carson myself, my friend told him, thinking he knew, and he was absolutely heart broken. At the time, I didn’t think about how much it’d hurt him. He had liked me for a long time but I didn’t realize it until after my ex broke up with me and Carson stopped saying “jk” after every flirtatious comment. After looking through the texts, I feel like I did know and just acted like I didn’t. Idk. When he was told, he was just so confused and hurt. I apologized a million times and eventually told him “well, your chance isn’t completely gone, maybe after Riley and I break up”. Idk why I’d tell him that but I did, probably because I had dated a few guys and it never lasted long so I figured the same would happen with Riley and I. Before school ended, we were able to go back to being regular friends, with some occasional tension but we worked through it. A few months later, I lost my virginity to Riley and Carson somehow found out (I’m guessing my cousin told him) and told me how hurt he was and how he’s not sure if we can remain friends. I told him it wasn’t that big of a deal but I was sorry. I told him I’d help him find a girlfriend and everything but i struggled to find someone. Throughout the beginning of freshman year, he tried to date different girls but each time, he told me they didn’t compare to me or they would end up blocking him. He started smoking a lot of weed and drinking and was just all around really sad. Eventually, we had differing opinions on politics and kinda just stopped talking to each other until sophomore year, one of his friends saw me when I was walking home (I went to a different high school than anyone I went to middle school with) and asked why I played Carson. He said it as a joke but it really annoyed me. I texted Carson and told him he needs to stop talking about me and needs to tell his friends to stop bringing it up because it had been two years and I didn’t do anything wrong. He said he agreed, it had been years so he hadn’t even talked about the situation so he didn’t know why anyone was still saying anything to me but he’d talk to them about it. It didn’t happen again after that and we really haven’t talked since but we do still have each other on socials. I talked to my husband about this, telling him all of it and he thinks I should get in contact with Carson and just apologize. I talked to my best friend and she said “we’ve all done it, don’t feel too bad” so I just don’t know what to do. I know it’s been almost 6 years and he probably doesn’t care anymore but also, if he does, I don’t want to make him feel that pain again so idk if I should text him. The guilt has just been killing me and I feel so horrible. Advice?? Also, I know I seemed like a hoe. Back then, I really just wanted attention from anyone. I didn’t even plan on dating Riley but it just happened. I’m not looking for judgement or anything, I promise you can’t say anything that i haven’t already told myself. I’m really just looking for advice.",

I have quite an interest in sterling silver religious jewellery, and he had given me a few pieces during this time of us hanging out. (a silver chain with a saint pendant, a very dainty 14k gold bracelet, another small silver bracelet). I thought nothing of it, it's quite common amongst us here to exchange gifts often among friends and family so i didn't see it as anything more than that, as i myself have given people fine jewellery randomly before.\n\nOne day, he asked me if i wanted to go to his home to see his pets and just chill and do some art. I agreed, as he had some very unique reptiles which i was curious to see.\n\nAfter getting to his house, it was then that things took a really bad turn.\n\nHe sexually assaulted me on several occasions, I was not allowed to leave the house unless he was supervising me, and it would only be to his garden that i could go.

He allowed me to return to my own home on two occasions, however he was present the entire time and would not let me out of his sight and would regularly complain about how we needed to leave back to his home.\n\nHe would regularly belittle my appearance, try to convince me that i would have to laser remove all of my tattoos as they looked disgusting, he told me that my earrings were disgusting and masculine and how he couldn't believe anyone would ever have had sex with me because of how gross they were. He would force me to stand on weighing scales when i didn't want to so he could know my weight, and then proclaim to me that 'we'll have to fix that'.\n\nI know that people will probably wonder where were my parents in this situation, and the reality is that they were on vacation. They left the family home for multiple months at a time, and whenever my mother would call me, he would answer the phone on my behalf and tell her how i was happy and i was okay and convinced her that i was his 'girlfriend' even though i was being held against my will and assaulted in his home.\n\nI asked on several occasions to go back home, and he would tell me 'maybe next week...' and next week would just never come. and even then, i had no clothes so i simply couldn't leave.\n\ni managed to escape because i had a large concert planned, and after arguing with him for days, he finally let me leave so i could go to the concert. as soon as i got home i messaged him and told him never to speak to me again or i would be calling the police.\n\nfor a few weeks after this, he harassed me on different platforms. he posted pictures of me he had taken against my will on social media saying for people to 'look at his girlfriend' , he would change his profile pictures to pictures of me or would make profiles in my name.\n\nin the end, i ended up blocking him and changing all of my social handles.\n\nthat brings us to now.\n\nits been about 10 months since this happened. i did not go to the police as i did not want to have to relive what happened to me. he also told me many stories of violence he had committed against women who had called the police on him in the past. we also had no text conversations at all prior to me being harassed by him & i truly just believe the case would get thrown out.\n\ni have had a reoccurring nightmare about him breaking into my house killing me almost every night for the past few weeks. i confessed this to my sibling who introduced me to him, and was told that he had been trying to contact my sibling. he was claiming to have purchased gifts for them, and sending them photos of the gifts he had bought and how much he had paid, and that this had been happening for weeks and my sibling had been simply ignoring his messages.\n\ni feel sick. why would he do this? why would he want to come back into my life? after the terror he put me through? he told me on several occasions that he, in his own words, felt like he was 'the predator' and that i was 'the prey' and it was 'his natural instinct to hunt me down'. he also told me how he had only been coming to hang out at my house because he had been fantasising about me.\n\ni don't know what to do in this situation. all i know is that i'm scared and i feel like i have no one to tell who can truly understand my story or my fears of him trying to pry his way back into my life and into my home.",

    "content": "Teen Nightmare\n\nThis happened many years ago I don't want anyone to get in trouble or press charges I just need to finally be able to speak about what happened.  I was 17 at the time and I volunteered as a Sheriff explorer during this time I met a deputy who in the beginning was really nice to me. I had just graduated high-school but my 18th birthday wasnt until a few months later. I was scheduled to go on a ride along we were required to go on patrol at least once every three months or so and he volunteered to take me on this day. This first time went fine I was super shy but he got me to open up, he talked about himself and asked me about what my plans were after graduating. It wasn't until the second time I went on patrol with him around a month later that things took a turn, I knew he had a girlfriend she was only two years older me, but this time around he started talking about how things were rocky between them. I didn't think much of it I thought he was just venting and no harm done. However  he was being super touchy and was flirting and at that time I was too shy to say anything. He ended up kissing me out of nowhere and he just smiled and said he needed to know if I was attracted to him. I'm not going to lie I was, he was good looking but I asked him about his girlfriend he said she wouldn't care. He offered to take me home after the shift and he did but not before he ended up taking me to an abandoned field and said he just wanted to talk. We ended up making out in his car and i told him i didnt want to have sex that it was as far as i would go he said it was fine but kept pushing and pressuring for more. He said if i really had feelings for him i would be willing to go all the way. He took me home after about an hour and explicitedly told me that if i was asked by any other deputy to just say were friends. I liked how special he made me feel and the red flags were there but i honestly  thought he wouldnt force me to have sex with him since  at that point he did stop when i told  him to even if he continued to ask. From this point on whenever I would patrol with him things would go further. Until finally one day after my 18th birthday he said he would take me home but instead he  hopped on the freeway towards his apartment. I was scared but at that point I felt speaking up would get me abandoned somewhere unfamiliar or worse. We made it to his place and he gave me a beer and led me to his bedroom. I felt like I couldn't say no he told me to relax that I would like it that it was just my nerves. We ended having sex but I finally was able to tell him he needed to stop that he was hurting me but all he would say was just let me finish its OK you'll like it in a minute. No amount of pleading worked until he finally rolled off me. By then I was shaking and oddly felt numb about the whole thing. He took me home and again told me to say we were just friends. He would lose his job if anyone found out making me feel guilty. I ended up quitting the program a few months later and foud out he was being investigated for misconduct on a whole different issue. I regret keeping quiet but at the time I was confused and developed feelings for him. Other deputies became suspicious since they noticed he would go out of his way to talk to me but no one ever asked me personally if anything happened. I know this is long and confusing but it feels good to finally speak about it I've held this in for 16 years. I had posted and then deleted I freaked out a bit that it was shared but if it helps anyone else in a similar situation so they speak up then it is what it is. Also for clarity he was nine years older than me.",

And the more I need her.\n\nShe was wise, creative, confident. Her soul was light and gentle, like a breeze. Everyone loved her. She was mischievous, but even her mischief was innocent. Despite being quiet at times, she was still well-known because she left a soft, lasting impact. Even if she caused a little trouble, it was never harmful—just the kind of mischief that made people laugh later.\n\nI admire her. I love her. I miss her the same way I mourn the people I’ve lost in my life.\n\nI’m grieving myself. Because I died.\n\nI’m nothing more than a body without a soul.",

    "content": "basically what the title says. I've slowly lost sensitivity since we got married 4 years ago. I thought at first it was due to my depression, so I got therapy. Then, after overcoming depression, I was still experiencing very low/nonexistent libido, no sensitivity, nothing. It didn't matter if I was on my antidepressants or not, before, during, and after it was about the same. I used to be able to enjoy sex, and finish, but now I can't even remember the last time I finished at all. (No I'm not interested in masturbation, nor has that ever done anything to me). My husband has gotten mad at me over the years and accused me of being asexual or lesbian, which I don't think is the case because I KNOW I am sexually attracted to men and not women, and I've experienced normal sexual response cycles many times before, especially as a teen. I did save myself for marriage, if that makes any difference. I then thought, well maybe it's not my depression, maybe it's sexual trauma from seeing and hearing my parents doing it a lot after they always told me sex was bad? (religious upbringing) and so I went to a sex therapist, and she said she couldn't help me. I had another therapist after that who I really liked and helped with everything else in my life except my ability to enjoy sex/ have a sex repsonse cycle despite thoroughly discussing that topic and my traumatizing experiences as a child with my parents. I went to my primary care doctor and he basically told me there were no meds except one that costs $1000 a dose and only has a 10% chance of working. He did blood work on my hormone levels and those were all normal. so basically no one can help me and it leads to dissatisfaction on both sides of this relationship, and makes me so sad. I feel like I should just divorce my husband so he can find a functional woman who can have and enjoy sex with him :(",

We met in 2022 and we had a friendship that you wish on everyone, but the friendship got stronger and so did our feelings. At first he started getting feelings, at the time it was not appropriate because I was still in a relationship. I broke things off so I could be with him, but when that happened he didn’t have the same feelings anymore and everything went downhill. I’m not gonna explain everything that happened in those 6 months, but I can say that nothing went back to how it was.\n\nBecause I was still in love with him when he basically ghosted me at the time, I never got the closure I needed (I think). And I begged him to let me stay in his live as friends, and now that I’m hearing myself I sound so stupid. After everything that happened in those 6 months we kissed etc. for like 2 more times and that made it even worse to get over him.\n\nLike I said we stayed friends and talk like 3 times a year (new years, birthdays and holidays). I even got a new amazing boyfriend whom I’ve been together with for almost 2 years, and who I really love and could see myself marrying one day. But I still think about him (the ex). Last week he even responded on a story I posted on Snapchat and we exchanged maybe 10 sentences. I wake up the next day and he deleted me from snap. I would like to think his new gf made him do it, because it would honestly hurt more if he did it himself.\n\nSo now 1 week later and everyday I’m thinking about it and everything that happened almost 3 fk years ago.\n\nSo my question Reddit users is why can’t I get over him? Why can’t I get over the memories that we made? Why not after everything this person has put me through?\n\nEnglish is not my first language so I’m sorry for my grammar.\n\nSide note, 1,5 years ago he moved to another city so I haven’t seen him in 1 year. And I see him maybe once I year now. I was supposed to see him last week, but he couldn’t come…",

We have a friend group of five since high-school and she's always been the one who has the most other friends outside of the friend group, but we never minded. She has friends from other city and an on and off boyfriend (24M) who's literally the worst human I've ever seen. He's manipulative, controlling, alcoholic with anger issues and he controls who she is friends with, where is she, if she's drinking, etc. He constantly brings up her past before they met and holds it against her. When his friend started hitting on her he blamed HER!! They broke up two weeks ago and we literally celebrated because it felt final. She sent us a 13 minute recording, when they officially ended it, of him just cussing her out, screaming and calling her a slut who doesn't deserve love from anyone, even her parents. He also threatened to kill her dog. Her parents hated him (obviously) so he always talked bad about them.\n\nShe stopped texting us this week but we thought that she was just busy. But turns out she's BACK WITH HIM AGAIN AND THEY MOVED IN TOGETHER! What the hell!! I don't even know what to think.\n\nShe also forgave her ex (now current) best friend after she bad mouthed her and used her so she would buy her and their friends alcohol. Btw she's dating her boyfriends brother who's another jerk. It literally runs in their blood.\n\nI'm serious considering just going low contact with her because she clearly doesn't value our opinions on those horrible people and will ALWAYS choose them over us. I feel like crying from frustration every time I think about it. We have literally tried EVERYTHING to open her eyes. The worst part is that all of us others are at uni somewhere else and she's the only one who's living in our hometown so we can only call her (but she doesn't pick up often).

I have said it many times and I have no problem saying it again, simply because it is true: you are the first person that I have ever felt true, pure love. a feeling that I thought people invent in movies, that made me think it was not something that was even possible to feel. You made me feel it. It is real.\n\nYou know how sentimental and emotional I am, it is very easy for me to look at a picture of us from a month ago and feel nostalgic because I miss a specific day that I had a really nice time with you. Like for example on your birthday, when you invited me to sleep over at your place and told me that I was really cute and that you wanted to kiss me in front of everyone. These are things that are hard for me to forget and I hope I never forget because it makes my heart feel good. Sometimes I am completely reluctant to mention things like this or talk about it at all because the fact that I talk about it means that in moments like these have a lot of weight. It makes me very vulnerable and it's scary, I prefer not to mention any good moment we had, not to say I love you, not to say I miss something that happened two days ago, and that way if you don't say something nice back, I won't be offended by it, I won't think it's not mutual, I won't think I'm taking everything too personally and that for you I'm just another person to have fun with every now and then. even though i know if it was just fun it would have ended a long time ago for you. But I choose to say it anyway, because I want you to at least know how much good you can do, even if you don't mean to. I choose to get hurt a little every now and then.\n\nI think you are very talented You write in a way that is very impulsive, for better or worse. In the pieces you wrote, it is very clear that what you write comes from that moment deep inside, and it is not calculated, it is simply what is happening in your heart at that second, and you bring it out. Another talent you have is the way you get to know people. Something that I am very jealous of, but I feel I am lucky to experience it as a friend, and even learn from you. You ask bizarre questions that no one thinks to ask, go into strange depths, and we would sometimes laugh at you at that moment in class because it is really very funny that you ask things that no one thinks are interesting enough, but it is a trait that I appreciate very much. I think that I will move here in this letter between things that you might be flattered by and things that you have a chance of being offended by, It is important for me to point out that it is okay to be offended just as it is okay to be flattered by everything I write, but you should know that everything I write is things that I think and feel. There are no facts here. And there is not even a single intention to hurt.\n\nIf I could, I would write this in a letter and bring it to you physically, but right now we are after a not very pleasant interaction that was on through messages, as there is every now and then between us. And right now I am not in the mood to see you because I feel like I will cry and I will not be able to say anything coherent.\n\nMaybe I am too sensitive and take everything too hard. Maybe you love me but don't like me very much and sometimes try to hurt me. It could be both.\n\nSometimes I feel like you really want to hurt me. That you know exactly what combination of words will hurt me the most, and you choose them specifically. I don't think it's bad intentions. I think it's more of you trying to defend yourself. Maybe I say things that I think come out well, but they hurt you, and then you, who feel attacked, try to attack back, because that way you'll have the power, and you can hurt and leave. Sometimes we encounter a situation of unpleasant messages and at the peak you'll say something like you're gonna stop answering me, or something more cynical-passive aggressive to imply to me that you're not going to answer anymore no matter what I say. Sometimes I'm in a good mood, and after a conversation like that with you i get very sad in a restless way, like i have to talk it out. And when you cut off at the peak of this conversation, I have no way to explain anymore, no way to resolve, no way to do anything. All that's left for me is to sit with myself, with the feelings I have about myself, about how much I may have hurt you with the words I used incorrectly, about how much I want you to understand that I don't think such bad things about you. And to sit with myself, with the feelings I have for you, that with how much I love you, you are the person who most manages to hurt my most sensitive points.\n\nOnce in a conversation of this style, you managed to throw into the air that it would be better if we ended the relationship.\n\nAfter that, when we met and I mentioned it, you said that you said it in the heat of the moment, and that you didn't really mean it.\n\nI think you did mean it, just, at that moment. And then at some point when we managed to talk and get along again, you regretted meaning it. I think that both of these situations are correct, and that they don't necessarily contradict each other.\n\nSometimes I really have thoughts like, 'Wow, maybe I should really end this relationship.'\" Sometimes I feel like the relationship with you is doing me a lot more harm than good. Sometimes I feel like you hate me. Detest me. And maybe you stay in touch with me because it's easier than breaking up. And maybe that's true sometimes, I don't know. But I also don't think it necessarily contradicts other good feelings you might have for me sometimes. In any case, I can understand. There's not a single person in the world that I can say 100% that will never get on my nerves, accidentally hurt me, get tired of them. and I also told you, I think that if I spend enough time with anyone, at some point I'll want to not be around them. On the other hand, you're one of the only people I prioritize spending time with. And the only person I want to be around even if I'm very hurt and we're not at our best terms.\n\nI think something happened the day we started hooking up for the first time. That day I went out with you and a friend for a walk in the city, we went into your old school, the friend stayed outsid. we were left with just you, with the stories and experiences you had there, with all the nostalgia from there, and I was there, and listened to you, and I really enjoyed experiencing something sentimental with you. A big part of your life you spent there, and then I was there with you and somehow managed to be a small part of all of it. of you.\n\nLater that day, after we hooked up, when you walked me to the train, and we were both very nervous because we had arranged to meet the next day, but we were both afraid that suddenly we wouldn't want to meet again when the time came. Because we both had that similar problem. that weird avoidant way of dealing with life. And then the next day came, we still wanted to, and it happened, and it didn't exactly stop for a very long time.\n\nUsually when I want someone, as soon as they show interest in me back, I stop wanting them. It didn't happen with you. You shared your flaws with me and not only did I identify with a lot of them, but it only drew me in more. I really fell in love with a person, and not just an idea. I think that's why it's so easy for me to get hurt by you.\n\nI love you very much. The whole person that you are. I'm very attracted to you. Physically, emotionally, mentally. In just about every way.\n\nWhat you think of me, how you think of me, is very important to me. I really care about you and your opinions. Sometimes you say things about me, that you think I'm not intelligent, or things like that, I say very directly that these are things that hurt me. Insult me. You take it more lightly, and with a laugh, and with a certain detachment towards me and how I feel. I think you might have the feeling that you're above me in all sorts of ways. That you have more power over certain things. That your opinions are more important or true than mine. And that facts are perhaps more important or true than my feelings. Sometimes you are the most sensitive person in the world, looking for a hug, love, intimacy, making me laugh when I'm not feeling well. And sometimes you treat me as if you are a person who doesnt know how to be a friend. That you have no ability to understand or contain my difficulty, my feelings.\n\nI think a lot of it is also my fault. Every time I told you that you were crossing a certain line, that's all it was. I tell you that you're crossing a line, And that's it, there were no consequences beyond that. I say my piece, carry on as usual as always, and then it repeats itself. Again things are said, again I'm offended, again I don't want to talk to you again in my life, and then I come back to you the second there's a chance, because I want you in my life. It's like I'm giving up a lot of myself, so that I can feel good, sometimes, with you.\n\nI'll say something now that if it wasn't clear before, it can be very recoiling and disgusting to hear, at least for me- My relationship with you, and you, in general, is very addictive to me. I'm addicted to you. You feel like a drug to me and I can't find a better or worse way to say it, that's how it feels to me. When I'm with you and everything is good, everything is the best in the world. When it's bad, it's very bad.\n\nthere was another time, at some day, I was at your place I think a few days after we agreed not to sleep together anymore.- of course we met and slept together because how could we not): There was one moment, you put your head on my chest as if I were a pillow. we just sat like that in bed for an hour, cuddling, calm, comfortable, quiet, pleasant.\n\nWhy do I get so hung up on these moments?\n\nIt's like if I'm not bipolar enough on my own, there's another layer of bipolarity in our relationship.\n\nI remember especially at the beginning of this relationship, when I was at your place and I felt so nice and comfortable, I didn't want it to end simply because it was the peak of the day for me. The moment I had to go home, just being on the drive back home, alone, sleeping alone, suddenly that was the lowest point of my life.\n\nI've slept alone my whole life. Why does it feel so heavy now?\n\nIt's like craving you helped me survive a little longer, every time. And this is the most unhealthy thing I've ever experienced, and the most disgusting thing I've ever said. It's embarrassing to admit it at all, especially when I'm sure it's not mutual.\n\nFor a very long time I was emotionally dependent on you, like if you were in a good mood it would be great for me, but if you were feeling bad and would withdraw from the world, I could easily take it personally. Because when I'm in a bad mood, I still want to be near you. I still want to talk to you. And it's disgusting to me. Why is it different only with you? Why am I not interested in sleeping with anyone, except you? Why did I think for years that I wasn't interested in sex at all and that I could easily live without it, and then after I met you, I became a nymphomaniac? Why can I just say bye to people and leave without a hug, but with you this intimacy is so important to me? I don't even have one answer really I have no idea why it's like this\n\nOn the one hand I think, if I kept my distance from you, I would get used to being without you, it would have been hard at first, but little by little I would stop wanting anything like this with you, and then maybe I would be able to quit you. On the other hand, You're funny You love Why would I keep my distance just because it's a little hard sometimes?\n\nI'm in these dilemmas every now and then But I really don't want to lose touch with you\n\nSometimes I think you don't see or appreciate things I do for you, take me for granted. Why not, actually? you said so yourself, no matter when you text me, I will answer. if you need a favor, i will do it. if you want me to come to you and be with you, there will never be a situation in life where I will say no. I haven't given you a single reason to make you think that I'm not simply there whenever you need or want. So maybe it's my fault. Maybe I'm too accessible, not enough hard to get. and it's too convenient, it's easy to take it for granted, I don't know.\n\nMaybe you'll read all of this and think I'm a psycho, Tell me that you think it would be best and most worthwhile to end the relationship, and I'll understand from that, that you don't want anything to do with me, and I'll be offended, and we'll never talk again, and all that this relationship will be is some cute memories from time to time that are accompanied by a bad taste from how it ended.\n\nMaybe you'll read all of this and say nothing, pretend you never got it, maybe you'll even see that you got this letter, tell yourself wow this is really long I'll get to it someday, and forget about ever getting to it.\n\nMaybe you'll read this and tell me what you think and feel too. Share your side. Tell me that everything is okay, it's okay what I feel, it's okay that I'm an addicted psycho, and that I'm too important to you to lose touch with me over stupid things that can be solved in an instant with a little communication and the right mood.\n\nI don't know what you'll choose, but everything is legitimate and I'll understand in the end, even if not at that moment. I love you, I would be happy to talk whenever there is a problem, I just want us to really be able to talk.\n\nI am not here to apologize, and I do not demand any forgiveness from you, Whatever happened was. Do you want us to stay in touch? I would be very happy. Just please try to pay attention, appreciate me, respect boundaries. If situations arise where you feel that I am attacking you, that I am unpleasant, that I am unbearable, that I am repulsive, inconsiderate, offensive, - tell me. Let's talk about it. It doesn't have to be at that moment when you are at your wits' end, you can do it at any moment, but let's try to communicate more healthily and hug after that and be good please:)\n\ni love you”\n\nid like to know your thoughts about this. if it made anyone feel anything, or anythig like that.after he read this letter he has said that relates, understand, and he was the one to tell me to maybe do something creative about it in the future, i never even thought about it until he sais it, as it was a very personal thing that was meant for his eyes only.thanks for reading:)",

My last serious relationship ended in a painful breakup, and it's taken me a while to process my emotions.\n\nAs I reflect on what went wrong, I realize that I was blind to some major red flags. I ignored my intuition and stayed in the relationship longer than I should have.\n\nBut despite the heartache, l've learned so much about myself and what I want in a relationship. I'm taking the time to focus on myself, my friendships, and my community.\n\nI spend a lot of time getting to know God more. He has helped me through the years to achieve a forgiven heart and renewed my spirit of a fun filled life. Being single increases my loneliness but only those who have gone through this same pain would understand how scary it is to give love another chance.\n\nI'd love to connect with serious minded people and hear about your experiences.

    "content": "PS:I apologize if some things don't make sense as english isn't my first language!!\n\nI'm not sure that anything will genuinely get better.I feel as if I'm a rotting corpse. I'm a 15 year old girl,it may sound childish and dramatic saying this at such a young age,but let me give a backstory.\n\nI've had extreme trouble socialising my whole life. I was a very sensitive child,people could barely speak to me or crack jokes with me without me starting to cry.Regardless,I did have a few friends as a child,but it wasn't the best experience. I couldn't handle insults and staying with people for a longer period of time,I much preferred to stay home and do my own thing,so of course people found me weird. The fact that I wasn't born beautiful didn't make this any better,\"ugly\" was peoples favourite insult to use on me.\n\nOnce I started school,it became even worse.I still haven't learned to accommodate to people,but I was academically gifted,so people still came up to me,but mostly to help them with their work,aside from that I was bullied and I've never managed to stand up for myself.I would simply sit through all of that,I would say my prayers at night hoping it would eventually become better.\n\nEventually my mother said she will leave to a different city to find a better job,she didn't pay much attention to me in the first place,it was mostly my grandma taking care of me,so I though this was an opportunity to get closer to her and get a better school life, so I begged her to take me as well and said I could continue school there,but God little did I know it was going to get much worse.\n\nI got bullied a thousand times worse at my new school,and at home there was nobody to comfort me this time.She got a boyfriend,who was and still is a horrible person.He sexually,physically and verbally abused me.She knew but couldn't care less as he had lots of money,plus she was already neglectful,so what could have I expected from her. It was simply too much for me to handle,I started skipping school every single chance I got,if I got sent forcefully by my mom once the teachers started sending her messages,I would simply wait for an opportunity to run away.It somehow never got taken to court,for 4 years I was skipping as long as It was still possible to pass the year with such a big number of absences.Ive developed a sh addiction as well.I would burn,cut,scratch myself,whatever option was available at the moment.\n\nI started causing a lot of trouble as well,I won't go into detail on this one,but it was mostly to have some form of control over my abusers, to make them feel as shitty as I did,so to say.Eventually they got tired of me and sent me to a psychiatrist which gave me some sertraline (I was 13 around this time) and the psychiatrist suggested to move to a new school. They refused to check out another school and just sent me back to my old town.\n\nNow that's where I am.I got back on track and I'm at the top of my class once again,but of course I am still given cruel treatment from my peers. My other relatives are the only people who don't hate me. I am at an extreme form of social alienation.I have no friends.Not even one (in real life) ,I spend all of my time online,drawing & reading books or drinking. I am severely traumatised,I have severe OCD,anorexia,ARFID and Im in such deep derealization,I also have a history of psychosis and I am unable to get treatment. (I've also gotten told I fit the criteria for BPD but due to my age there isn't a possibility to get diagnosed).I also have a ton of health issues. And if I'm being honest,at this point I'm not even sure if I truly wish to get better or to make friends.I hate people and they hate me. I don't speak much either,I only speak once it's necessary,I hate doing it anyway.\n\nI do love spending my time daydreaming though,Im a maladaptive daydreamer and I spend up to 10 hours just daydreaming.I love daydreaming that I am a beautiful and kind girl living an adventurous life with lots of meaningful connections,because Irl I feel hopeless,I feel that I will be alone for the rest of my life.I have no dreams for the future and remembering the fact that I have school makes me wanna commit suicide,but I would never do this to my relatives or to my bestfriend.(though the urge to try once again is STRONG) I sometimes wonder if Ive committed some terrible crimes in my past life and if this life is a punishment for that.  </3 I have no clue why I have always gotten bullied either,but my best guess is that unattractive girls are seen as a societal embarrassment,plus the fact that I dressed and looked \"too weird\" for them.",

    "content": "I recently remembered an event from the past, and I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. It happened a long time ago, so it’s possible that what I remember is not exactly what actually happened.\n\nA few years ago, in 2022, when I was 14, I was coming home from school with some friends when an idiot thought it would be funny to open my backpack and ring a doorbell without telling me. Immediately afterward, everyone started running. I quickly zipped up my backpack and, for some reason I don’t remember, I decided to cross the road to the other sidewalk instead of running forward. Maybe it was because there were too many people in front of me, making it difficult to run quickly—I don’t know. I really don’t remember.\n\nThe thing is, as soon as I stepped onto the road, an older man on a motorcycle appeared right in front of me, just a few meters away. I moved away as fast as I could and got back onto the sidewalk where I had been before. I think I remember the driver swerving a little when he got scared after seeing me (though I’m not entirely sure about this). I didn’t hear any noise that would suggest the man had fallen, nor did I hear a scream of pain—just a “¡Me cago en la madre!” (which roughly means “For f***’s sake!” in Spanish), which I believe means he kept driving (I think).\n\nThe problem is that I don’t know if I started running once I stepped back onto the sidewalk, which could have prevented me from noticing an accident if it happened. But it’s more likely that I stayed still after stepping away from the road—at least long enough that I would have noticed if anything had happened. I’m not sure what exactly happened in that moment. It all happened so fast, and it’s been a few years since then.\n\nWhen I saw the idiot who opened my backpack again, all he did was laugh. I guess he saw what happened in some way, and that’s why he made fun of me when we met again. Or maybe I told him about it, and then he started laughing—I don’t remember. I also seem to recall that I had two other friends behind me, on the other side of the road, and when they caught up with us, they were laughing too. If what I remember is correct, that would mean nothing actually happened.\n\nI got home feeling like an idiot, but at no point did I think I might have caused an accident. I’ve walked through that area dozens of times since then, and while I wasn’t specifically looking, I never noticed any signs that an accident had happened. I also searched online for news from that year in my city, and I didn’t find anything similar to what I experienced. I never heard anyone mention that day again, which reinforces my belief that nothing actually happened.\n\nI recently remembered this incident, and I think I’m becoming paranoid. I’m scared by the possibility that the man could have had a serious accident or that someone nearby might have been hurt, since it was a very busy area at that time, with lots of cars and many kids coming back from school. I’ve been really worried for the past few days, and I honestly feel bad about it.\n\nDo you think I’m just being paranoid? I need someone to reassure me—I’m a bit scared.",

    "content": "I’m a woman in my 60s who for the bulk of my adult life has been able to keep and cultivate good relationships with friends, family, and coworkers. I have suffered off and on with depression and anxiety that I felt was bad enough to seek treatment for since my mid 40s. I had no shame in admitting this as it was a difficult time for me given perimenopause, a stressful job, kids heading off to college, etc.\n\nThings really began unraveling for me about a year ago. I had gained a bunch of weight, felt like crap, was facing some unexpected backlash from my two adult kids whom I had raised alone and were each facing their own separate personal crises simultaneously, was helping my widowed, aging mother navigate life alone, and a second new and stronger wave of “ideology” was evolving.\n\nI started therapy for the first time in my life and leaned heavily into journaling out my feelings, as I have a love of writing and my therapist felt it would be helpful for me. I dove right in to a shadow work journal with writing prompts that ask you to relate negative thoughts and feelings you are having now to your childhood, in order to heal your inner child. I have written at length on my memories from early childhood and nothing came forward that I hadn’t pondered before, so no big revelations this time… except for my anger.\n\nAfter a year of processing these events, poking at my anger, examining every piece of it through the lens of this tired and wounded old woman, and having the entire world bursting into flames exponentially more every day, I am at my breaking point. In the past year I have lost my 3 friends to the above mentioned “ideology”, then most of my family, and now, because I am so sad and really suffering from the effects of anger about not only the abuse and neglect I experienced in my past, but the trauma of the problems my entire continent is facing, I’ve got my mother in my face telling me she doesn’t like how it makes her feel that consequences are happening as a result of her actions. Nobody is blaming her for anything, merely mentioning they are losing their job. Or that they are struggling mentally. Or that they’re boycotting hyper consumerism. Or that they’re scared. Or that they feel compelled now to join this movement or become anti-whatever to make a statement and support people who’ve been hurt. She doesn’t like feeling that feeling that comes up when she has to wonder if people actually know her leanings, and maybe even think her actions are causing harm to them. It’s her own thought process guilting her, and outing her at the same time.\n\nIt’s so hard telling this without using certain words that are crucial to the story, but hopefully I’ve avoided the flags that will get this story banned.\n\nNow, I find myself on the verge of lashing out at my 84 year old mother the next time she berates me (I see it coming) because I don’t know if I’ll be able to bite my tongue. I carried for 60 years the memory of her attempted suicide in front of me as a 3 year old, where just before losing consciousness, instructed me how to use a telephone to call for help. She doesn’t think I remember. I protected my mother from her own shame of her daughter carrying this secret knowledge all her life, while enduring beatings from her 2nd husband, repeated emotional betrayals from her, being called a slut every day of my teen life. I was shamed mercilessly for my own emotional problems growing up, and was told I’m not good enough constantly. My own suicidal thoughts at 13 were claimed by her as embarrassing, and would make her look bad. I was never allowed to feel my anger and it caused me to make some really poor choices regarding relationships in my life.\n\nWell that rage has come to life and I think if I express it the way it deserved to be expressed all along, it might kill her.",

    "content": "I always hear a lot of critique about how the western world is too individualist. Well, I feel like I completely understand why now. I’m in Canada for reference.\n\nI have been at my current job almost 3 years now. I have been on contract that entire time. I’ve been fighting to get permanent but no positive movement yet. Anyway, the last position I got was a 2 year contract-which comes to an end this summer. I feel I’ve been a positive addition to the team. The team was short staffed (is short staffed, even now) and I was able to help out with the work load. I’m a quick learner and pretty efficient, and I’ve definitely shown that on our extremely busy days, or days where extremely short staffed (we often have people falling ill or someone is on vacation). With my contract end coming up I asked my boss if there was a future for me. I have also been looking for work-with no luck-in preparation.\n\nWell, this week she told me the chances of me being kept on were slim to none. I cried at my lunch break. Hell, I had panic attacks and cried before all this. I have been trying to find work and it’s rejection after rejection or just not hearing back at all. Even jobs I’m more than qualified for aren’t responding.\n\nWhat has really hurt and frustrated me, is the apathy of those around me. Friends, coworkers I thought liked me, even family to an extent, could all care less. “Oh damn that sucks. Anyway.”\n\nAnd I 100% understand why. Why would anyone, even people who like me, give two shits about me? They have their own partners, families, finances, etc. to worry about. People don’t give two shits what happens to anyone around them when they have their own lives. Someone they know could go homeless and it’d just be a “damn how tragic! They were a nice person. Anyway, what’s for dinner?”\n\nI’ve been bullied at jobs to the point of being suicidal. People saw-and looked the other way. Dont want to involve themselves. I’ve complained to bosses/supervisors about workplace bullies only to go ignored. I’ve been chastised for speaking up. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. No one cares-they can like you, but they’re there to get their bag and go home.\n\nI see this a lot in Canada with the housing crisis. People who own their homes have a “fuck you, I got mine” attitude. They don’t care about the rest of us, especially younger folk, who will never be able to afford even a modest apartment. They got their house, they got their family, fuck everyone else. The homeless are just an inconvenience/nuisance to them.\n\nI’ve tried in my life to have a community mindset with helping others, caring, I always would send fitting job postings to unemployed friends who were looking to try and help out, tried to be there for others. No more. Never again. Not a single person around me would give a fuck if I died tomorrow because understandably, they have their own shit to worry about. Only people I can see caring about me being gone are my mom and dad.\n\nI have fought my entire life to try and be better. Grew up with abusive step parents. Didn’t grow up wealthy. Pretty much everything I did after 18 was my own-rent, schooling (with help of loans, which I am also paying off solo), finding jobs, figuring shit out, etc.\n\nI’m done. My hope for finding work in time before my contract ends is extremely low. Even with experience and schooling, companies dont want to hire, or they want to pay you minimum wage for skilled work. And if they can’t get a canadian to go that low they’ll find a TFW who will take below minimum wage (story for another time). Idk what will happen to me but I know that I will not care about anyone else again. Im gonna worry about me only. Good luck to everyone else.",

    "title": "I’m a culturally assimilated Hispanic, and I see more people struggling because they aren’t. Does assimilation really offer an advantage?",
    "content": "I’ve been thinking a lot about how cultural assimilation impacts opportunities, especially in the workplace. I was raised in a predominantly Caucasian church group in the Midwest/South, where my mom worked multiple jobs, and members of the church helped babysit me. Because of that environment, I never learned Spanish, and I became a native English speaker without an accent. My name and skin color make it obvious that I’m Hispanic, but everything else like my speech, my interests, even the way I present myself is very much in line with mainstream American culture.\n\nI never really thought much about this until I started noticing a pattern in my jobs. I’ve had no issue moving up. I’ve always been recognized for my abilities, and promotions have come naturally. But people I know people who are just as educated and capable tell me they’re being overlooked for management positions or even treated differently at work. Most of them have thick Hispanic accents, and many were raised in predominantly Hispanic communities, even if they were born here.\n\nI live in a primarily Caucasian area, and it’s become clear to me that how you present as Hispanic plays a massive role in workplace opportunities. Whitewashed Hispanics, whether they grew up like me or are half Hispanic with “white” first names, seem to have a much easier time getting ahead than first-generation or immigrant Hispanics who retain strong cultural ties.\n\nI don’t think this is talked about enough. People love to say that discrimination is just about race, but I think it’s also about how comfortable people feel with you. If you fit the dominant culture and don’t challenge their perception of what’s “normal,” you get a pass. If you don’t, you hit a wall.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this?",

Thanksgiving month of last year the mother and I got into a heated argument which led to a back and forth (physically) the most I did was push her to get some space to walk away, because I truly don’t believe in hitting women( unless it’s life or death). Before that even happened, two days prior to this she was already putting her hands on me which led to a big bruise on my back. And a long scar going from my neck down to my back. Once I pushed her away from me she instantly called the cops and said I was the one being belligerent and she wanted me removed from the house. The police arrive and she!! Yes she showed them the camera footage of what had been going on and ofc she was deemed the main aggressor and was taken to jail. Once she got out “apparently” she has a court order to stay off of the property and to have no contact with me. Her name is still on the lease so she helps out by paying her half of the rent and once a week will ask if the kids need anything( she has a friend that reaches out for her). She currently has no where to live but she stays with a friend and still has her job as a nurse and is in school during the day. She gave me the option of getting a hotel room to get the kids because it’s going on four months since she has seen or talked to any of them. I thought the hotel option was a good idea and I even offered to pay for half the expenses. But it never happens because she either to busy with school and work. I would like too take her to court so she can at least help me by getting them and keeping them for a week. I have managed to do what I can with childcare and anything else the kids need so I can work my self and I have managed to do this alone. What do I need to do to get her to court so we can have our time with the kids individually? I understand she is in a situation but I shouldn’t have to suffer because of it. I hope this doesn’t sound bitter on my end but we are not together anymore so she is going to have to start riding her storms out alone now. Im not complaining about taking care of my kids because I love them dearly and I don’t find anything manly about complaining about something you helped bring into this world but I need a break some times and I’m only asking for a week.",

I feel there is something wrong with me because friendly conversations with people in class never progress further into a full fledged friendships, it's as if I'm invisible in people's eyes until I talk to them, and then they go back to their friends and ignore me like usual. I know this isn't the worst situation to be crying about, but it feels awfully isolating. And I was so absorbed in my own mental health struggles that I forgot to check on my best friend, and I feel bad for that as well.

And listen, I never had an issue with that—I knew their bond was stronger, and that was fine. But recently, it’s been feeling like I’m just... there. Like, I’m included, but not really included, y’know?\n\nOne of them is dating this guy, and their relationship has been a damn rollercoaster. Long story short, dude was dramatic as hell, dumped her over some misunderstanding, then ran around spreading shit that made her look bad. Back then, our whole group was like, “Nah, he’s trash, you deserve better.” Fast forward a few months, and suddenly they’re treating him like he’s some god-tier boyfriend. Now he’s “so sweet,” “so caring,” “such a gentleman.” Like girl, be so for real.\n\nNow, I’m also dating someone, and every time I bring him up, I get the driest reactions possible. “Oh, he’s nice.” Thanks??? That’s it??? Meanwhile, they’re out here writing a whole PhD thesis about how amazing her man is, even after he did her dirty?? The math is NOT mathing.\n\nAnd it’s not just that.

    "title": "I wish I had ignored his suicide note",
    "content": "TLDR; I am a sex worker and I let a client get too obsessed. He threatened suicide when I ended things with him and I went to the police on the off chance he was serious. It turned out to just be another ploy to try and get me to talk to him.\n\nLet's preface this with I am an independent sex worker. I do in person sex work by the hour and it's my job because I enjoy it and it gives me a lot of financial security.\n\nMy best friend, \"Celia\", also does sex work and we share notes about the job, and even have the same clients on occasion.\n\nShe met \"John\" first. John is an obese 300lb man, early 30s, and a high maintenance client. He was very recently divorced because he cheated on his high school sweetheart wife with another friend from high school. He left his wife, only to have his new girlfriend leave him about a month later for another man. Why did he cheat on his wife? Because she had \"gained so much weight that he no longer found her attractive\" (I saw photos of her, she was barely overweight. He on the other hand nearly doubled his weight since they got married).\n\nJohn is a home inspector for an insurance company. He makes good money by inspecting a high volume of homes, but part of the job is using all the data collected to write personalized reports on each home inspection. When John was married, his wife did the reports for him (this was illegal because the information is supposed to be confidential, but he was able to get away with it because they lived together and she used his work PC to help him out).\n\nSo he left his wife, then his girlfriend of two months left him. He was desperate to get her back any which way, and knew she needed money, so he offered to pay her to do the reports for him (which worked out because his wife was no longer willing to do them). He figured out a way to log into his work from her PC, trained her up, and used his position as her boss to make her spend as much time with him as possible so he could potentially win her back (he would only ever pay her in person, for example, and coerce her into spending hours with him before he paid her the money). This isn't important to the story, it just gives background information on his history of inappropriate relationships and manipulating women.\n\nIn the meantime, he started seeing escorts to fill the sexual void. Eventually he met Celia and very quickly fell into limerance. For the first time since his ex girlfriend left him, John had a new woman to obsess over. He shared his whole life story with Celia, texted her all the time, and visited her more often than he could afford. She found him exhausting to see (he had strangled dick syndrome from a porn addiction, and struggled to get off, but would urge her to keep trying). He talked constantly about himself, overshared about his childhood trauma, and would stay longer than he paid for, forcing her to have to kick him out each time. She set boundaries about him texting her so much and taking so much of her emotional energy, but he kept breaking them.\n\nSo she enlisted my help. I have a few more years experience under my belt, and felt confident that I could handle his neediness. After she talked me up, he agreed to meet me.\n\nThe appointment was a success. I was able to work around his strangled dick problem and he began to see us both regularly. But it became obvious that he was obsessive and inappropriate. He talked about Celia non-stop and shared personal details about their time together with me. He also shared private details about his ex-wife and ex-girlfriend.\n\nWhen he saw Celia, he talked about me and overshared in a similar way.  It made her very uncomfortable and she set boundaries around it. He didn't abide by the boundaries, so she fired him.\n\nHe was devastated... But I was able to distract him and help him process the heartbreak. He felt betrayed by her, because she treated him as a client and he felt like he deserved better treatment. I gently defended her actions, but not so much that it would offend him.\n\nBy this point I was earning steady money seeing him, so I didn't want to risk jeopardizing that cash flow.\n\nI could see that he needed the full girlfriend experience, so I gave it to him. He was very insecure so I often needed to reassure him that he could count on me, that I would be a stable person in his life, so long as he kept paying my rates for time together. I allowed him to take me to dinner off the clock occasionally, and texted him back on occasion (I didn't get triggered by his incessant texting in the same way as Celia).\n\nIt worked out pretty decently for a few months. I felt like I was meeting his needs, and he seemed happier and more stable. Unfortunately, my carefully set boundaries started to erode. He didn't see me as an escort anymore, he saw me as a sugar baby... Then as a girlfriend. He told me he loved me. Often. He started celebrating \"anniversaries\" for us and booking me for holidays.\n\nI, too, found his company exhausting. The whining, the complaining, the bad decisions, the love bombing, the delusional thinking.... It started to be too much. I felt like I was wearing a thick mask while I was with him, forcing myself not to show my disgust. I hated the way he bragged about how much money he made, while breaking the rules to do it. I hated his \"nice guy\" syndrome and how entitled he felt to attention from women. I hated the way he would eat dairy despite being lactose intolerant. I hated the way he binged on McDonald's after eating a large dinner with bottomless cokes. I hated the way he touched me and kissed me. I hated the self obsession, and the victim mentality he had.\n\nI couldn't stand his inability to take any personal accountability in his life. I eventually learned that despite making over 300k a year he was completely maxed out in debt because he had a gambling addiction in addition to his sex addiction. He learned to count cards at the casino and managed to con a younger card counter (I think he was only 21) into lending him tens of thousands of dollars to \"invest\" into being an advantage player at the casino. Unfortunately John lacked discipline and lost everything on slot machines. To his credit, he is planning to pay the kid back, but learning about this made me incredibly nervous and I started to get the sense that I was in over my head.\n\nI hated the way that he would talk about being sexually abused as a child without warning in excruciating and disgusting detail. I hated that he would rather spend money he didn't have on escorts and gambling than see a therapist.\n\nI felt gross and drained for hours or even days after seeing him, and would sometimes have to turn down other work because I didn't feel up to it.\n\nThe last straw for me happened Feb 16. We were supposed to see each other on Valentine's day, but I fell ill with the flu a few days earlier. He complained every day while I was sick and pestered me, dangling the money for my overnight fee over my head. He wasn't able to schedule another overnight until March, so if I didn't see him by Sunday, I would lose out on the $2000. Also he just really really really needed to get laid, and if I didn't see him, he'd go see another escort.\n\nSo, still feverish and really fucking ill, I let him come see me.\n\nIt's important to note that the first time he booked me for an overnight, he touched me in my sleep. This is a hard NO for me, and I let him know. Subsequent overnights, he did not cross that boundary. But this night, I woke up again to him assaulting my body in my sleep. My heart was racing and I felt so violated that I wanted to cry. I didn't want major confrontation, so I just pushed his hands away and told him I was still trying to sleep. But I spent the rest of the night on high alert, only able to doze for short periods of time.\n\nAfter that, I knew it was time to stop seeing him. Because we planned our appointments for each month up to two months in advance, it did not seem appropriate to simply ghost him. I struggled to find the right way to end it. I knew he was obsessively attached to me and it would be chaotic no matter how gently I tried to let him go.\n\nThen an opportunity presented itself. He saw another escort and fell asleep in his car in her parking lot. He woke up to the police questioning him and searching his car and phone. He cracked under pressure and admitted to paying for sexual services. He told them about me and about her. They chose not to arrest him or press charges, but when he related all the information to me, I decided to seize this excuse to stop seeing him. I told him that for my safety I did not want him to ever contact me again.\n\nAt first he said he understood and said goodbye. And then for the next five days, he bombarded me with texts and emails. He also sent YouTube videos of him crying and begging, snot dripping. Or drunk and begging and crying. Then sober and matter of factly laying out the reasons why my fears about his interaction with the cops was unfounded. More texts, more emails from different accounts.\n\nI responded to none of it. It made me feel even more disgusted by him, honestly. I hoped that he would eventually tire and just go the fuck away.\n\nThen he emailed me a suicide note. I didn't receive it until nearly four hours after he sent it because I was busy working. It stated that by the time I received it, it was already too late to stop him. But then three hours after the email, he sent me a YouTube video suicide note, which seemed fishy.\n\nIt has my already frazzled nerves in shambles. I worried that I could somehow be found responsible if he was found dead and they traced the cause back to me.\n\nI eventually gave in and called the police. I posed as a girlfriend and I hoped it would be a one and done call, but they kept calling me back for more information (I knew his address and full name and vehicle) and they wanted copies of his suicide letters.\n\nThey tracked him down and it turned out he was absolutely fine. He just wanted me to talk to him, and was willing to do anything to make it happen.\n\nI guess the cop successfully conveyed to him that he needed to stop harassing me, because the emails, texts and videos stopped. He did message my friend, but she told him the same thing the cop did - that he had to stop harassing me through her or else we'd go to the police.\n\nI wish I had ignored his suicide note. I feel tricked and I'm still angry about it.",

    "content": "I’m a 17-year-old guy, and I’ve always been a hard worker—energetic, supportive, and the kind of person who lifts others up. But for the past eight months, I’ve felt like a completely different person.\n\n(No one knows about this, and this is my first time venting or talking about it.)\n\nMid-2024, my parents had a huge fight. I thought, they argue all the time, it’ll be fine, but this time was different. My mom fell into depression right in front of me. I took her to therapy, checked in on her daily, and tried to be there for her.\n\nThen my dad shut down too. He locked himself in his office, barely ate, and was cold whenever I tried to talk. My dad is just like me—we hate sharing emotions—so I just sat with him in silence, hoping he’d feel less alone.\n\nWatching the two strongest people I know fall apart broke something in me, but I held everything together. My routine was: wake up, check on my dad, school, gym, study, then spend hours with my mom. The only time I had to myself was 12-4 AM, and that’s when I met a girl online. Our dumb late-night conversations were the only thing keeping me sane.\n\nBy September, my parents were worse—and so was I. My grades were bad no matter how much I studied. And the girl who helped me escape started playing mind games, making things worse.\n\nThen in October, my parents got better. They were laughing, eating together, and finally acting like themselves again. I thought life was turning around.\n\nBut a few days before my birthday, I got a phone call. One of my childhood best friends had died from cancer. That was my breaking point.\n\nAt his funeral, my brother cried. Everyone cried—except me. At the grave, surrounded by people sobbing, I felt like an outcast. I wanted to cry. I should have cried. But I couldn’t.\n\nThat night, I sat in the shower, eyes red as hell, trying so desperately to cry. But nothing. I just wanted to feel human again.\n\nI held it together until February. That’s when the girl told me she loved me. I said it back, and for the first time in months, I thought maybe life was finally giving me something good.\n\nBut now, for the past eight days, I’ve done nothing but eat, sleep, and doom-scroll. I haven’t gone to the gym. I haven’t studied. I haven’t done anything. And I have an important test in three days. I’m stressed, but I don’t even care.\n\nAnd to make it worse, the girl who said she loved me is playing the same mind games again. I don’t understand why. I thought I finally had something good, but now I just feel like an idiot.\n\nI feel like everyone’s life is moving forward except mine. I’ve been stuck since July, and I don’t know how to fix it.\n\nNobody knows anything about this. It’s just me, alone, going through all of this by myself.\n\nI just feel lost, scared, and overwhelmed, so please, what’s happening to me? What do I do?\n\n(Small note: I finally cried actual tears today, and I don’t even know how to feel about it.)",

This was a time before I was saved, so I engaged in fornication with her (she claimed she was saved as well), but I never had intercourse. We went through a lot of problems in the later half of the relationship, and had minimal contact after it ended. A week after she broke up with me, she dated a new person. Today I just found out that after nine months, she’s still with the rebound.\n\nI want nothing, absolutely nothing to do with this person. I want to make that abundantly clear. But the idea that after a 1.5 year relationship that she moved on so quickly and ended up having a successful relationship with someone else really does hurt me, considering that I myself haven’t been so lucky to find someone. This might also be TMI, but I also think about how she lost her virginity to someone who wasn’t me.\n\nI feel like God wants me to focus on my walk with him as opposed to finding someone else, but it really does get lonely. And my ex is always in the back of my mind when it gets too quiet.",

    "content": "Y’all, I’m struggling. There’s so much, and I’m not faultless. Mother & Daddy divorced before my 5th birthday. Mother “let” my older half-brother* live with his bio-dad once he turned 13. Mother also was diagnosed as bipolar in the 1960s and was treated far too long on lithium. I get this logically, but emotionally.,,I always lost out.\n\nMy mother & my aunt/:her sister have always found a common ground. They’ve had typical sister disagreements over the yearsbut have always been each other’s biggest advocates. Point is my mother was not a bad person.\n\nAround my 5th grade year I tuned into fashion. I wanted what I liked, not her cutesy smocked dresses, etc. listen I am now as Southern as can be…I have a ridiculous amount of monogrammed items and would/will happily support a smocked personalized/monogrammed adult dress! There’s no shame in my game. Whatever I buy for my niece will have a matching auntie(or mom) part! ***\n\nWhen my older half-brother was 12, he went to live with his father. After my older brother’s death when I was 12 myself, I was sent to my father and his wife and my younger half-brothers. To this day, we are all full siblings in each other’s eyes. My daddy raised my older brother, and his final wife helped raise us. This stepmom loves me and adopted me. Today, on the anniversary of my husband’s death, I learned that my bio mother passed away 6 days ago. Our last visit was very pleasant; neither of us drug up the past. However I am struggling with the fact that the hospital (where I used to work, and still love) did not notify me, my aunt, or the temporary Power of Attorney. I’ve been out of reach for a couple of years so a family friend stepped in as mPoA, knowing my mother’s wishes. My aunt & I have consistently been listed in medical records as emergency contacts. No one from the hospital contacted my aunt, me, or the mPoA. My mother’s body has been unclaimed in the hospital morgue for 6 days. 6 days!!! How am I supposed to feel?\n\nTL;dr: my bio mom passed away 6 days ago in the hospital. They disregarded all emergency contacts listed and her temporary medical PoA in my absence. Her body has been unclaimed in the morgue for almost a week. They told my aunt on Monday that she had been discharged(blatant lie). There’s a lot to unpack but she was my mother. We had a lovely visit before I left town 3 weeks ago. I’m so furious that her body has been “unclaimed” in the hospital morgue. Note: I loved this healthcare system. I spent almost a decade of my career in their local hospital Admin. When I was very, very sick, this staff literally saved my life. I’ve been so loyal until this circumstance…",

I never thought about killing you but about you dying and freeing me from my vow. I resented you.

Only I didn't see it.Then you found a new victim and toss me when I started speaking up.\n\nSo no we will not stay friends. Not now, not in a year, never. I do not want to ever see or hear you again.I am sorry for your new GF I warned her. I tried. She didn't listen you love bombed her like you did it with me in the beginning. She will come to her senses and hopefully get out without major mental and financial damage.\n\nI now finally see how live can be with a loving and responsible partner.\n\nPart of this conversation happened in a dream.I never had the chance for closure because I was always afraid he could do something and harm me legally/Financially. So until the divorce was final and I got the money from our apartment I played it friendly and civil. I intended to have this conversation when this was all done but we went NC before that because he tried to fight my new partner(now husband).\n\nI do not see sense in telling him this now.But I might wanna keep it, just in case he shows up again on my doorstep when his new GF dumps him.",

    "content": "I am a male in my late 20s and am writing this post because I wanted to get something off my chest to get honest feedback from people. Good or bad. I have a pregnancy fetish. Essentially I find a big pregnant belly extremely attractive and the thought of the women's breasts, hips butt, getting bigger very attractive. It is purely objective/visual and I have had this ever since I was young. I have always felt very uncomfortable with having this fetish. Pregnancy is normally thought of as an amazing beautiful thing which to most people means 'baby' on the way. I also see it this way but separate to that I have this fetish as well. I worry that if someone hears pregnancy fetish that they will immediately think that this is some sicko thing for unborn babies or just not understand what the hell that kind of fetish is or what it means and immediately feel uncomfortable. Don't get me wrong, I'm not planning on openly telling people but as my peer group enters the 'having kids' stage of life I am feeling weird about it. I know that society has changed quite a lot but fetishes are still very taboo and make a lot of people uncomfortable. Sometimes I wish I didn't have the fetish just so I wouldn't have to deal with the mixed feeling. The only person who knows about it as an ex girlfriend of mine. I worry sometimes that she might tell people about it and I would feel very embarrassed and not know how to deal with it / friends looking at me differently. I know this post might be a bit of an unusual one but any honest and realistic feedback would be appreciated.",

It was my absolute favorite, basically the only one I wore and I wore it everywhere, it was perfect for everything, I didn't even need another one.\n\nI wore it to a party in December, and I clearly remember taking it off inside the house and putting it in my jewelry box. But when I went to wear it again, where was it? It doesn't make sense. I didn't lose that earring, I put it where it should have been, but someone took it, didn't tell me and to this day has never given it back to me.\n\nI live with my mother, two sisters and my grandfather; and my aunt is the neighbor in the apartment across the hall, and she and her daughter have complete access to my house. I've already gone to everyone, calmly asked if they had taken it, if they had borrowed it and forgotten to return it; everyone said no.\n\nBut here's the thing: my older sister is a bitch. She comes into my room and takes my stuff. She's already finished my perfume, makeup, skincare, hair products - expensive stuff. She complains when I complain, she takes absolutely no care with anything. My whole life has been like this with her, and my whole life I've complained to my mother about it - but my mother just told me to keep my stuff away from her. It's kind of hard when we live in the same house, but it's okay.\n\nShe's already taken some of my jewelry and broken it. When I was a kid, she took three of my rings and returned them to me broken that same night, but I was a kid and the rings had cost 30 reais in total.\n\nWhen I was 17, she took a pair of earrings that my aunt gave me for my 15th birthday, big earrings with stones, more expensive, but besides everything else, a gift, the same thing happened, they disappeared and one day, rummaging through her room, I found them broken; She didn't even bother to show it to me. This one caused me problems, but this woman had the nerve to tell me to my face \"I'm not going to buy another one, they're too expensive\" with the utmost disdain in the world, and my mother did nothing. I kept up the conversation for a while, telling her that she was an irresponsible idiot who had stolen my earrings, but it was no use, and at 17 years old, what was I going to do? Sue her for a pair of earrings? Alone, even more so, because my mother wouldn't help me.\n\nBrother, this story about that earring that she broke has been cooking in me all these years and, along with everything I went through with her in my childhood, God, I hate this woman.\n\nNow, the same thing happened. My earring disappeared and there was absolute silence. I know she has it, I know she took it. But it was in December, it's already March. I've asked her on separate occasions if she took my earring and she said no. I've already gone to her room and turned everything upside down looking for those earrings and I couldn't find them (I found other things of mine that I hadn't even noticed were not even with me anymore). I want to look in her bag, but she won't let me, she'll get stressed and throw them to my mother who will be on her side like she always is.\n\nBrother, I'm going to go crazy because sometimes I stop and think about this piece of crap earring that I know she took. I know I didn't lose it, I know where I put it; if it had been my fault, if I had left it at the party where I wore it, if I had put it in my bag and it disappeared, if it had fallen on the street, I know I would have gotten over it by now; but no, it disappeared in my house, in the place where it should be, someone took it. The only person who has the nerve to steal it from me and act like the biggest sly person there is. Practically every week I end up staging fights and fights with her, demanding that she give me back the earrings that I know she stole, but she'll turn the story around and I'll leave like a crazy person because I've already looked in her room and nothing. And I swear that, for real, if I found that piece of shit earring with her I would sue her, now I would sue her. It costs a lot less than the earring she broke, but I don't care. I just want my earring, I just want that bitch to give me back what's mine because I know she has it.",

    "content": "Yesterday, my parents went out to attend a family function, leaving me alone at home. The first time my dad left me alone at night, I felt a little scared. After all, for a girl, spending the night alone in a big house isn’t always easy. But this time, it was completely different—I felt calm, confident, and absolutely at peace.\n\nWhat surprised me the most was that my parents didn’t call me even once to check whether I had eaten or done my work. Not because they forgot, but because they know I am responsible enough to handle everything. Being the eldest daughter of the house, I have always been expected to take care of things on my own.\n\nWith ₹200 in hand from my dad, I first treated myself to chhole bhature. Later, I managed to earn ₹1000 by sending some rice, so now I had even more freedom to enjoy!\n\nFor lunch, I had paneer curry with rice, and at night, I went full feast mode—pizza and pasta while watching Tenali Rama on TV. No one to disturb, no distractions—just me, my food, and my favorite show! After that, I enjoyed gulab jamun and ended the night with a cold Thums Up, making the day feel even better.\n\nThe best part? This time, I didn’t feel scared at all. Sleeping alone, which once felt a little uneasy, now felt completely normal.\n\nWhat I realized was something even bigger. Every night, when my family is around, I feel lonely. But when they weren’t there, I understood that I don’t actually need anyone to feel complete. If someone doesn’t want to be with me, I can still live happily on my own. As the eldest daughter, I have often been ignored because of my younger brother. But now, I’ve finally understood—there is nothing wrong with being alone.\n\nThis morning, I woke up, spent some time soaking in the warm sunlight on the terrace, and now I’m making myself a cup of tea. After this, I’ll do some housework, and before my parents return, I’ll prepare a meal for them.\n\nHonestly, this experience made me realize that being alone doesn’t mean being lonely. It’s peaceful, freeing, and fun! No unnecessary stress, no chaos—just me, my time, and pure happiness.",

    "title": "My dads in the icu, my boyfriends planning a trip",
    "content": "This happened in mid January. For context, I am 32F and my boyfriend is 34m, we’ve been together for 3 years and we live together in a house that I own. Now for the story- my dad has been unwell for over a month and my siblings and I (mom died from cancer when I was young) have been taking care of him while we waited for test results and some answers. Last week his condition took a turn for the worst and he ended up being taken to the hospital by ambulance and has been in the icu for a week. He was diagnosed with cancer. We still don’t have all the answers and I don’t know what the future holds for my family. On the third day that my dad was in the icu, my boyfriend was at work and texted me about his plans for the following day that consisted of him meeting up with friends to “plan their trip.” I knew they had been talking loosely talking about potentially going on a trip at the end of the month, but I thought it was common sense that since my dad is in the hospital, the trip would be off…. Well apparently not. Needless to say, we had an argument. I told him it’s extremely hurtful that he would abandon me at a time like this. After a lot of back and forth throughout the day he let me know the trip was cancelled (nothing had been paid for or even booked yet), but at this point I just feel like the damage is done. Who would prioritize a “boys trip” when their partners only parent is extremely sick in the hospital. The obvious answer is to break up, but I don’t know if I have it in me to go through a breakup right now. It’s been a few days now, my dad is doing much better, he’s out of the icu and I’ve been there everyday helping him with his recovery so he can come home. I’ve been off work for the past week and a half during all this and went back yesterday and have been going to the hospital between shifts. My boyfriend has been moping around the house the last few days and every time I ask him what’s wrong he says “nothing” or “I don’t know, I’m just sad.” I said if this is about the trip, then just go. He says that’s not what it’s about. I suggested he goes to talk to someone , a therapist or a friend.. or me. He declined all of this. I asked what I can do to help, he said nothing and “I’m not his therapist” I said nothing and just collected my stuff and went to work. I have a lot on my plate already, and I’m feeling angry that he’s putting this on me now as well. We spent the next few days avoiding eachother around the house which was making my mental health seriously depleted. We finally had a conversation, I told him he should go on the trip because there’s no sense of him staying here if he’s not even going to acknowledge me or be supportive to me and my family anyways. The next day, he booked his flight. I tried to convince myself I was okay with it, but his 5 day trip suddenly turned into 10 days, and I just knew I was done. We had a few conversations while he was away, mostly me crying and telling him how angry I am with him. He came home, and I ended it as soon as he walked in the door. He begged and pleaded, said he “never would have left” if he knew I would end it because of the trip. There was a lot of back and forth and I asked him if he could just leave for a few days to give me some space, which he did. He ended up taking me on a date for Valentine’s Day later that week and things seemed to be getting a little bit better. We planned a night away the following week to try to connect again. During our “romantic night away” he decided it was a good idea to invite his friend and friends girlfriend to join us for dinner (the girlfriend ended up not coming so it was just me, my bf and his friend) ….. and then “surprisingly” a bunch of his other work friends just happened to be at the same restaurant. What was supposed to be a romantic evening to try to repair our relationship ended up being a table of 8 of us, talking about my boyfriends job. We went back to the hotel, got into an argument and went to bed angry. The next day we woke up and he got in the shower and left his Apple Watch on the night stand. I had that gut instinct to check his messages, and there it was. He was been messaging with another girl the entire time my dad was in the hospital and was meeting up with her for “coffee dates “ …. Which I highly doubt is all that happened. So ya, that’s it. He moved his stuff out last week , and the person I thought I knew for the last almost 4 years has become the person whose hurt me more than anyone ever has in my life. I’m on my own again, going to be 33 next month, and starting from scratch. I don’t know what the future holds but it has to be better than this, right?",

    "content": "today I found out my mom was murdered. blunt force trauma to the head that lead to brain bleeding. she had a migraine for 11 days and vomited daily. I had no idea she was sick. she passed in july of last year, and the county I am in is so backed up that the medical examiner took 8 months to get back to us. we all assumed it was a fentanyl overdose that she may have come in contact with because one of her friends was an addict. it turns out that she had no drugs in her system.\n\ni’ve been waiting for 8 months. i’m only 20. my dad hasn’t been around at all for my whole life. my mom picked terrible men. her whole life has been around horrible men. she was raised being beaten by her father by anything and everything possible he could find. she married a man who got addicted to crack, my father. she then married another man who cheated on her the entire relationship with other men. the final man, a man who had stolen from her in a relationship prior and who has killed 2 of his previous partners indirectly, took her, too.\n\nthe only answer it could be is that the final man took her from us. he had never killed them exactly, but both of his previous wives were completely clean before they met him. 5 and 7 years later, they both died of a heroin overdose.\n\nI cut off my relationship with my mom in 2019 due to something I was a victim of when I was younger by the man who cheated on her with other men. he did some fucked up things. a lot of fucked up things. he let a lot of fucked up things happen to me under his supervision. I had caught a disease from what he did/let happen and decided to move in with my grandma because I did not like the man she was now with, the man who (may) have killed her, the final man. I had no contact with her after I got a restraining order.\n\nshe and I had started to get along for once in 4 years. I had hugged her (albeit halfassedly) for the first and last time. she cried and cried. I don’t know what I would have done if she were to have passed and I didn’t get on good terms with her again.\n\nI wanted to see her succeed in her life. she spent all of her life desperate to be shown that she was worthy of being loved. I tried to show her before she passed, a few months before, that the way I had loved her growing up was enough proof that she was worthy of love. that if she can say she isn’t worthy of it, then my love I showed her as a kid meant nothing. she finally started to understand.\n\nwe were going to go to college together. I wanted to help her get her GED. to start going to school. to make the loser of a boyfriend she has had for years go work instead of making her work 2 part time jobs being disabled and still not being able to make the rent. he did nothing for her other than steal from her and hurt her.\n\nI had to protect myself by moving out those years ago. she didn’t want to listen when I knew he was bad news. i’ve known since I was 14. I just wish I could have done something to save her. I wish he never met her. I wish I could have been there to stand up for her when he hit her.\n\ni’m terrified. i’m so scared of being angry. I don’t know how to deal with the fact that someone took her from me. she was my everything for years. someone so cruel took her from me and made her be in pain. no one knew he had hit her. no one knew her migraine was not just a migraine. she couldn’t tell anyone or go to the doctor because she would have to admit he hurt her. again.\n\ni thought I processed it all when she died. but being told today that she died due to blunt force trauma and brain bleeding makes me feel like I lost her this morning. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to feel. I feel like my world just broke. again. and now I have to deal with detectives, with getting information, with anything that I can do to help them investigate.\n\nI just want my mom back.",

    "content": "Today is my 18th birthday a milestone that’s supposed to feel like the gateway to adulthood, independence, and new beginnings. But instead of feeling celebrated, I feel overlooked. Instead of joy, there’s this heavy weight in my chest, pressing down on me, making it hard to swallow the disappointment.\n\nFor almost two months now, my father hasn’t been able to work due to a job-related injury. Money is tight so tight that even something as simple as a cake, a small token of acknowledgment, is out of reach. I understand. I really do. I know it’s not their fault, and I know they love me, but that doesn’t make it hurt any less.\n\nBirthdays are supposed to be special, a day when you feel seen. But mine never really have been. I’ve had birthdays forgotten, birthdays I had to share like they weren’t fully mine, birthdays that felt more like an afterthought than a celebration. And now, here I am, reaching a turning point in my life, and it feels like just another ordinary day except worse, because deep down, I wanted it to be different.\n\nWhat makes it harder is the facade I feel forced to maintain. Everyone around me assumes I’m fine, that I’m well off, that things in my life are smooth. My friends ask me what my plans are, and I don’t even know how to answer. Do I pretend I have something lined up? Do I admit the truth? How do you explain to people that your birthday this huge, symbolic moment feels hollow because even the simplest things are out of reach?\n\nI keep telling myself to be grateful, to focus on what I do have, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t struggling. It’s not about material things it’s about feeling valued, feeling like this day matters, feeling like I matter. And right now, I just feel invisible.\n\nI know life isn’t about birthdays, that one day in the grand scheme of things shouldn’t define anything. But when you spend every other day just pushing through, birthdays are supposed to be different. They’re supposed to be a pause, a moment where you feel like the world sees you. But today, I feel like I’m standing in the middle of a crowded room, screaming for someone to notice me, and no one even looks up.",

    "title": "Coming to terms with the thought that my sister is not a good person after all",
    "content": "It has been almost 15 years since it's slowly started to dawn on me that my sister never really loved me: she just thought I was so much lamer than her, that she didn't see me as a competiton.\n\nFor the context: she is 10 years older than me and for as long as I can remember, I loved her more than anyone alive. I loved her more than our parents, brothers, friends etc. She was my absolute role model and everything she did was perfect.\n\nIt is fucked up to compare kids ever, but when parents and relatives are comparing two people who are so different and not even in the same age group, that is especially fucked up. She was always labeled the beautiful one, me as the smart one. She was the caring child, I was the mean one. Her life was hard, mine was easy. Everything that was happening to her was always celebrated if it was good, or we were all devastated together with her if it was bad - and it was never her fault when it was bad. Everything I ever did was considered as luck, or as normal if it was good and my fault if it was bad.\n\nShe loved me back and always worked on building my self confidence - but never to the extent of me succeeding in being better than her in any way. This was particularly obvious in her relationship with our parents, where she told me multiple times that our father wanted mom to have the abortion when she was pregnant with me. Any sign of me not liking that thought was being met with the comment along the lines of \"me being too sensitive\" or \"oh, come on, he loves you now\". I reacted explosivelly about that only once, when I told her openely to go fuck herself with those fucked up pieces of info, which, of course, ended with her being in tears, appologizing, and making me promise THAT I WILL NEVER REMIND HER ABOUT THAT EVENT. She made it about her and her feelings and I was told by the involved parties that I shouldn't have been so hard on her.\n\nThese were occasional outbursts, when I would always make a conclusion that I over reacted and I would end up crying, begging her to forgive me and promising never to do it again. Bear in mind - we are talking about my teenage yeara here, not adult me.\n\nFF to my 20s: while she had one relationship with her then long-time bf, who became almost like a family member, I mostly fucked around and either didn't really meet reciprocated feelings in guys, or I didn't even want anything serious. She eventually broke up with him - it was a family tragedy, ofc, like anything bad that happens to her - and she somehow put us both together to \"we are never getting married\" file. I mean, she never said it, but it was obvious that she is not supportive of my potential relationships. I kind of knew it, but I became sure about it when I started to date my now husband, when I was 25, and as I became more self-assured because I felt loved, she started to become more and more openely toxic, and she was doing it often. She would use every opportunity to let me know she thinks he is lazy and irresponsible, while I didn't think any of that. She started to hate my hobbies, style, habits (which didn't change much - I just wasn't as miserable as before) and she was suuuuper pissed when she broke with her second bf and I got engaged. She called me and raged about how it is inconsiderate that everyone is saying \"congrats\" on social media, while they are aware of her recent break up. I felt bad because during the last year of her relationship she lost one pregnancy, but I still didn't think that I should hid posts my boyfriend put on social media when he proposed.\n\nAfter that, it all went downhill. She was good to me either when something super good would happen to her, or when something really bad would happen to me. She hated my wedding day and pregnancy, but she was full of understanding when I had PPD. She did nothing to help, but she was good to me then. As soon as I got better, she was hating me again. In the meantime - all good that was going on in her life was still celebrated and all bad was mourned, while my life was kind of unimportant to our mutual loved ones (mostly).\n\nI started to fight back, but I was rarely talking shit about her to our family, while she wasn't really private about her opinion on me. Every time when she would show her good side again, I would come back to life because I would regain the hope that the most loved person from my childhood is still there.\n\nRecently, I lost all hope that I will ever want her back in my life. Our father died and in his final months, while I was crying my guts out and doing EVERYTHING to help him - as we all did - she told me that I was selfish as always and not showing any empathy towards him. That was the straw that broke the camel's back for me and I screamed at her and told her to get the fuck away from me forever.\n\nWe did communicate after that, because there were many things that had to be done with our dad, and I was there for her to be her shoulder to cry on when she needed me, but it was just because I felt I had to, for the rest of our family.\n\nAs our dad passed, my feelings of disgust came back and I am back to feeling hurt by our last fight. She mentioned it briefly and said that it was just a dumb fight, as she always does after moments like that, but to me - it wasn't. To me now, none of the fights we had were dumb and they were all about one thing: her wanting me to be the obedient, loser sister that she had when I was from 0 to 20-ish and her from 10 to 30-ish.\n\nI can't stand the thought of her hanging out with my kid anymore. My kid loves her and I was so happy when my sister and I patched our fight from a few years ago and she had good relationship with her niece, but honestly - I have two fears:\n\nShe would fuck her up the way she fucked me up,\n\nShe would be telling my kid mean things to show me as a bad person, for whatever reason.\n\nOne thing I found out later, after my PPD was gone, is that she was planning to take the kid away from me \"because it seems like I am not fit to do it\", but she never considered talking to my husband about it. Like, he didn't have PPD, he was fine - why didn't she talk to him? Why was she planning to adopt the kid who was not out for adoption?\n\nAnyway... I am done with her, but I think I will need a lot of time to process this. Maybe therapy would be beneficial.",

    "content": "I am a 26 year old guy born in 1998. I’m going to sound crazy in this whole rant.\n\nWhen I was 18 in 2016/2017, I became curious how others were perceiving me. I thought I looked young and still had the teenage look. As someone born in 1998, it wasn’t my turn to be 20+ yet, I was still a teenager. Growing up, people born in the early 90’s and mid 90’s seemed to look more mature than me and I thought it was obvious that I was younger.\n\nI began posting pictures of myself to Yahoo Answers and Facebook “guess my age challenges” and asked people to guess. Every picture I posted, there was at least one person or a few people who guessed correctly that I was 18. That gave me validation Yet I also heard 23, 24, 25 etc and that felt super weird at the time. I felt weirded out and uncomfortable because I just didn’t understand how/why I was being perceived as much older if there were people who were guessing my age correctly. I remember feeling upset even if I heard 20. I suffer from OCD too and numbers are very triggering for me. They were adding on years to my life and that just made me feel very restless and I felt absolutely disgusted. I was like Omg i’m still a teenager and I’m being seen as old??Do I have an abnormal appearance, what’s wrong with my development. But at the same time there were many people online who guessed correctly that I was 18. I remember one picture someone told me I looked like a teen and that she thought I was 14/15 but another person thought I was 23. Another picture, 4 people thought I was 15-19 yet another person thought I was 24. One picture someone guessed correctly I was 18 but another person said “early 20s unless you have brilliant skincare regime”. I also uploaded a picture of myself with glasses once and someone thought I was 17 or 18 yet another person said 20-25. I was like 25!!?? And that haunted me for several years. I constantly kept having intrusive thoughts about these extreme perceptions and suffered so much. I even had to see a doctor and psychiatrist and took medication to try and stop the intrusive thoughts. I made a vow in September 2017 to stop posting.\n\nIn real life, many people thought I was a teen in school and asked me what grade I was in but at the same time some people thought I was past university age and doing my masters. It just felt super weird. This kept happening to me throughout university. People asking me what grade I was in (being shocked that I was university) and a few people who thought I was past university age. I will never forget September 2019. A guy born in 1992 told me that I looked younger than 21 to him and still looked like a teen but the day after that, a lady thought that I was older than my then 29 year old sister (1990) and kept saying she looked really young like 22ish and I wasn’t even 22 then like wtf.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I suffer from OCD and constantly had intrusive thoughts that I was filthy and disgusting because years were being added onto my life and I wondered what I was going to look like when I was actually 23-25. These numbers were disgusting in my mind. I also developed Body Dysmorphia and hated my appearance. I didn’t mind being perceived as young but wondered what was it about my face that made me look old to others??? How could I look young and old at the same time?\n\nThen when I was actually 23/24, 2 people asked me what grade I was in and a few days before I turned 25 in 2023, someone asked me if my school was closed for summer break. But then in January 2024, someone asked me if I was 25 and I was like omg have i looked 25 for the past decade?? Am I living in some sort of time warp??\n\nNow I’m 26 and many people ask me if I’m a student of a postsecondary institute (uber drivers, restaurant/cafe owners, people helping me in stores etc) That’s a common perception many people have of me. But I have a sneaking suspicion that history is going to repeat itself in a new context and that a new trend will form that I’ve got to be 30, or 30+ when I’m technically not even in my late 20s yet. This is why I don’t post pictures online and avoid socializing with people. Because I’m afraid history is going to repeat itself again and that I’ll suffer again. I’d much rather be alone than be around people who have the potential to make me uncomfortable in my own skin. I wasn’t uncomfortable withy appearance until I became aware that some people have extreme perceptions of me. I also get really angry like why are most people so stupid and unable to read my face???\n\nSometimes I just wish I could stay locked up in a tower like Rapunzel away from the whole world so that no one can ever see my face again. I’m also pretending to be Evil Queen now as a coping mechanism. Someone obsessed with her appearance, constantly needing validation and being vindictive towards those who challenge her identity.",

    "content": "I usually don't post about this kinda stuff online or really talk about it out loud with anyone, to be honest; It's often just a page on a random notebook where I braindump anything and everything that crosses my mind at the moment when I feel like it's too much to handle.\n\nToday is different. I decided to expose it exactly because I never did. Been trying different stuff to see if something changes, in hope that any change could chain more and eventually things get better.\n\nI've always felt sort of an inadequacy around life, if that makes sense; A feeling that I never really belong anywhere or am passionate about anything. I'm currently 30 years old and so far I've been navigating passively. I wonder if there is such a thing as not really fit to being alive. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a cry for help and I'm not planning on hurting myself in any way; Also, I'm not trying to throw a pity party, I'm coming from a place of trying to figure this out logically.\n\nLike I said, I'm currently 30. Turned 30 this year. I still live with my parents, am unemployed but am currently studying computer science at an university. Never really been into a relationship, but I do have some good friends and a loving familt, for the most part. Still, there is something wrong with me. I look around sometimes and hear shared experiences from other people about romantic adventures or success on their jobs and I feel like I want that. It's not jealousy, mind you, it's more of a self questioning as to where have I been if not doing all that stuff?\n\nMy current situation is my fault, and I understand it's not good and even then, I don't have the strength or willpower or whatever you may call it to change it. It's like part of me wants to experience the world and... I guess a good way to explain it is, I want to want to do stuff, but I don't know what or how to start.\n\nStarting things is another problem of mine. I know what needs to be done and even so starting things is so difficult that it's insane. Normally that could be ruled out as being lazy or procastination but frankly, I've putting things off for 30 years, the problem has to be something else right? Currently, I know that I should be sitting down to work on programming projects to create portfolios and help me get employes but doing so is... hard. Not as in, programming is hard, it's not that. I'm also not scared of making mistakes, I embrace them as an opportunity of learning. It's a mix of not knowing where or how to start and perhaps a disbelief that it is going somewhere? I even thought at some point this might be related to me playing too much games or watching too many shows but even if I cut all that off, I still won't do what I need. I'll spend time laying in bed, overthinking, planning too much for stuff I never have the guts to get done.\n\nI guess you could call me a leech, but I don't feel like it's the case. I don't take pride nor plan on taking advantage of my dad's kindness forever, but I just feel... lost? It's always been hard for me to set goals to achieve because I feel like I don't really have anything. I can feel content with so little and that's maybe the reason why I never try and get more. I don't consider myself ambitious: Having fancy stuff or being famous or helping people... None of that stuff really pushes me forward. And those are the common stuff that people want so how can I move forward without a good reason to?\n\nThere are things I'm interested in, yeah. Like learning languages. But also some stuff I'd love to try and have no money for right now like woodworking maybe, music and theater.\n\nI still feel like a kid, frozen in time watching it go by and desperately trying to grow up but failing miserably. And although I umderstand there is no point in thinking too hard about my past mistakes that led here, I'm scared that I'm forever trapped in this loop of not being able to move on. I want to escape, but am not sure what I should do. Therapy would help I feel but I'll only be able to afford it when I manage to get a job. I'm hoping I'll manage to get my first internship this year and maybe talking to someone would help me figure things out. Sure, I have friends, but I don't feel like I have a safe space to be vulnerable with them or anyone else in my family.\n\nI always thought, back then, that I would have this figured out by now. Sometimes I think all it's needed is a small change that gets other things in motion, so lately I've been trying to do that. Doing things differently, trying to experimenting new stuff. I recently created a routine to try and force myself to do stuff; It hasn't helped much so far because even if I write things down I end up forgetting to look at the list or just can't bring myself to do it but on good days, I actually get a small amount of stuff done.\n\nI'm the kind of person who tries to understand and look for a purpose on everything and this here is kind pointless. This post went nowhere and is not going anywhere. Kinda like my life so far. It's funny to think that. But that's why I decided to do it. I'm not sure things will work out and despite hearing positive encouragement from my friends, still can't see much of a future for me but I'll keep doing what I can and trying my best, even if it's not the most optimal for a normal human being.\n\nIf you actually managed to read this far, my apologies for this mess. I wrote as the thougts came, no organization or anything.\n\nI hope someday I understand myself and determine my purpose.",

I am a really busy graduate student, I try to fit in workouts and other activities too but it is pretty hard. I do not have a lot of extra energy left to put in substantial effort to find the right person for me on most weeks. So the thing I kinda wanted to get off my chest is I have been working on concepts/writing for a (fantasy) novel for a while when I get some time alone. With my life being romantically unfulfilled, I have fit in a relationship between two characters (the MC and another) to fulfill all the things that I have dreamed about. It was not really part of my original ideas for the story but it kinda just happened. Its pretty much all wholesome relationship stuff that I have never really got to have; the hand holding, the closeness, sharing feelings, tender moments, having each other's back, etc. As lame as it sounds, it has been decently fulfilling for me. There are still days that I really could use a hug even from a friend, but there is something about getting all the stuff I have always wanted on paper that has been pretty nice and comforting. Even though adding this stuff in has been satisfying for me, I am a little afraid it makes the writing worse lol, and when its all finished it makes me that much more afraid to show it to anyone. Some of my friends know I have been working on this but have no idea there's romance involved in it. I just really wanted to get off my chest I have been vicariously living out my romantic dreams through my fictional characters because I do not really have a better outlet. I think its been a healthy way to express what I am missing out on?",

    "content": "My partner and I were in bed watching silly videos when a clip of a comedian popped up, asking people about the weirdest place they'd had sex. Without thinking, I laughed and said, \"Oh, for us, it was definitely the beach! Remember when we used to go there?\" (For context, it was a very isolated beach.)\n\nBut then, he looked at me and said, \"Nooo, the weirdest place was in the bathroom at Asda.\"\n\nI froze. What?\n\nI stared at him, confused. \"We never had sex in a bathroom at Asda.\"\n\nHe insisted we did—back when he was living with his brother and I was staying with my aunt. He even painted the scene: our son was asleep, so we snuck off to the bathroom.\n\nOnly… our son wasn’t even born yet. I was pregnant at the time. And I am absolutely sure I would remember having sex in a supermarket bathroom. That kind of adrenaline rush would have stayed with me forever.\n\nYet, he kept insisting it happened.\n\nAnd that’s when it hit me.\n\nDid he cheat on me and forget that the person he was with wasn’t even me?\n\nThis was 10 or 11 years ago, but still, I would not have forgotten this. And I know this because I remember every place I’ve ever had sex in public, even from before I was with him. So this made absolutely no sense to me.\n\nSo yeah, there you have it—the truth off my chest.\n\n. . . .\n\nEdit or update whatever you want to call it\n\nI didn't expect this post to get so much attention. This is my first time posting here. This is not AI or fake. English is not my first language, but I am somewhat fluent. My grammar isn't the best, so I asked AI to correct it, I don't see a problem with that. And seeing how some people are roasting me in the comments for being with a cheater, saying my child deserves better, hoping he's not a doormat like his mom, and that I deserve this I can only imagine what the comments would look like if my grammar was bad! As for those commenting about my child: He doesn't know anything about this. He's never seen us argue, all he sees is what we let him see. Apart from the things I mentioned, we've had a very loving relationship the cheating 5 years ago I forgave and I dont regret that, we have been happy trust is still hard sometimes, but at the moment in the present he has not given me reasons to think that he has cheated or though about it. I understand what people are saying, that he might be abusive or mentally manipulating me but I dont really see it that way maybe when we argue but I don't think he does that on purpose or maybe I'm just blind . Right now, I’m thinking this might be something he's confusing with a dream, or something like some people have said. Thinking back, I have mentally blocked out a lot from that time, I had a very stressful and traumatic pregnancy, and it's not something I want to get into or talk about. I posted this just to get it off my chest.\n\nPlease don't offend me in the comments that's just mean, and don't bring my son into it he has nothing to do with this!",

    "content": "My sister (f 30), has been with her baby daddy(m 30) for about 15 years now. He’s very much an abusive, manipulative, disgusting person that feeds off of people’s weaknesses. They’ve been together quite literally half her life, since she was in high school and at the time I was about 12 years old. At first he was an amazing brother in law and did all the cool stuff that comes with the brother territory. Then once I reached 14 all hell broke loose. I won’t go into too much detail but my sister’s baby daddy sexually assaulted me from from the ages of 14 until I was almost 17. Her and I had a huge falling out after the fact due to her denying it ever happened even though she was there for a few of the occurrences. He’s a very violent man and has even attempted to murder a misbehaving dog by strangulation that he had owned. I always had a sneaking suspicion that he had been laying his hands on my sister but after two days ago, my suspicions have been confirmed. A few days ago I got a call from my nana(f 71) stating that the baby daddy had beaten my sister pretty badly. He blackened her eye, busted her lip, attempted to strangle her(he left hand prints on her neck), and beat her in the stomach with a broom handle. In a panic, she managed to get away, escaping to a neighbor woman’s house a few blocks away. After he tried searching for her in his pickup truck, he then called my father and stated she was missing. He even tried filing a missing person report for her. Unfortunately for him, my sister had already contacted the authorities and notified them of the attempted murder. The cops escorted her the next day to get her two children from him and she’s currently in a women’s shelter until my nana can get to her.\n\nI don’t wish what she went through on anyone and I hate that she even had to endure any of that. I can only imagine the turmoil and sorrow she feels. Especially having been with someone for so very long. The problem I’m struggling with is setting aside my pride and being there for her in her time of need. We haven’t spoken in 5 years. At this point we’re two very different people.  I think back to me being that scared 14 year old that no one believed or cared to stand up for. I had messages and physical marks on me at the time and the adults failed me. I know she was a victim too, but it’s hard for me to forget her part as well. Any advice would be much appreciated, but please be kind. Thanks Reddit.",

We were just on call and she said she was gonna call me back but she went out to eat with her friends. Ever since she started school we’ve been texting less and seeing each other less and it almost just feels like we have our own lives. A month ago we hung out all the time and I was so happy being with her. Now she prefer to hangout with her friends or she’s busy and we just don’t have time for each other. She’s a sweet girl but I don’t feel much for her now. I want a girl I can have time for and be with. But she doesn’t seem to really want to be with me. It doesn’t even feel like a relationship. I barely see her, no romance or contact is going on. I crave so much just for us to not be able to do anything. I feel like I’ve lost interest in her and I don’t want it to be that way cause I feel bad. But how can we be lovers when we aren’t lovey dovey or we don’t see each other or anything. It could just be a boring period right now but I just can’t do it anymore. I need someone who I can be with that we will have time for each other and be with each other",

    "content": "Hey all,\n\nI feel silly to be in this spot making this post but I just needed to get this off my chest.\n\nI (23 M) started talking to Walter (49 M fake name) a few months ago. He found me on an app based around a certain fandom, which name I’ll be leaving off, where we ended up connecting.\n\nI knew he was older, and I know better. But he’s so charming. And I just feel so silly because I can see the red flags but fuck is he so easy to talk to and he makes me so happy.\n\nWalter is not well, he told me he has BPD. He’s had to do two stays in mental hospital in the times I’ve known him. Well, today, we were talking, everything was normal. And then randomly, he texted me that he took a bunch of pills and that he was sitting outside of a hospital and I just started panicking. I mean, what the hell.\n\nI feel like I should state, I too am mentally ill. I just have started making improvements to my quality of life, and I thought Walter was as well. We’ve been bonding over growing as individuals. Trying to keep each other up. Y’know. So I was really worried to see this turn today.\n\nHe said he was on the phone with the hotline. I asked him if I needed to call for help. I pleaded with him. I sent him audio messages because he tells me how cute I am. I pleaded. And he just said how cute I was, and asked me to say please like that when we meet.\n\nHe kept telling me how much he’s going to miss me and sending me virtual hugs and just complimenting me.\n\nI know. I know better. I know what’s going on. I don’t know why I’m still letting myself fall for him. He’s just so smooth. He makes me feel safe. I feel like he understands me. He listens to me. I just. Is there. And I don’t have many people there for me. And I know that’s not a reason but just. Here is where I am in life. I didn’t think I would find myself in this position but I haven’t heard from him in 2 hours. He said he thinks he likes me. He brought back up when he asked me out, but I turned him down then. He’s just a weird little guy that I think I’m starting to like.\n\nIt feels good to say that. I can’t really explain this to people my friends my age. My best friend knows about him, but not that I like him or flirt with him back. I just don’t know if they’d understand. I know what’s happening, and honestly I’m okay with it right now. I probably deserve this happening to me. Because I put someone else through this before. I’ve been the suicidal guy making someone plead for me. I am not proud of that guy I was. And I am making these changes to my life and trying so hard to be better. But maybe before I get better I should go through what I did someone first.\n\nMaybe it won’t be bad. Maybe I’m worried over nothing. But he is truly sweet. Maybe it doesn’t always have to turn bad.",

    "content": "I have two toddlers. We live in Florida, so we take them Disney. Initially we wanted to wait until they were old enough, but it became hard to find places to go on vacation or long weekends that had facilities for children.\n\nToday we were at one on the parks — and at a slower ride intended for all ages (toddler friendly), when our youngest threw a tantrum (1.5M). It was close 30 minutes until nap time, and he’s been teething.  We decided to come celebrate my eldest’s birthday (3M), and especially since the recent passing of my father left him very sad and aggressive toward others at daycare (he cried seeing photos of my dad and asking where he was).\n\nWe apologized to the two women next to us, as my youngest threw things on the ground near them. They started off saying that it’s OK. Then they proceeded to let us know that they never came to the parks before a certain age, and that my kids would be better “just by the pool or something.” Keep in mind, we are in the Disney Junior area. And that drowning is a common cause of death in young children, and I know at least three families that have experienced that loss. I tried to keep it nice and then I finally said “you know, they usually do well with travel, they’re just tired today.” And said goodbye.\n\nWas biting my tongue the whole time and wanted to remind them that this is a ride meant for younger children, and not adults in their 20’s-60’s (the two women were mother and daughter). I never understand the idea “children must be seen and not heard.” At a children’s ride in a theme park that is centered and based on children’s cartoons and film. I don’t care if adults show to the parks, but it’s insane that adults want to also keep children acting like children from children’s spaces.",

But then I think about life, specifically in my country where I can only focus on having a decent career a d get money to pay the future bills. I really like being single as I have to give explanations to no one when i go out or stuff like that, but sometimes feeling someone's body close to yours (not in a sexual way) its all you need.

    "title": "I got terminated from my volunteer position with no explanation",
    "content": "So I (18f) just finished volunteering for the day at my workplace (animal sanctuary) yesterday, when I got a message from my boss to see he sent me a termination letter, nothing in the message either just the letter itself, and they have ignored me since.\n\nAlso sorry this is a long one, I just have a lot of things in my head I need to sort out.\n\nSo a bit of backstory, since I was around 14 I’ve been dealing with the struggles of depression, anxiety and adhd and ended up leaving school in yr10 because of it. Took a while to figure out but I ended up going to tafe to complete my cert ii and iii to become a qualified zookeeper as I’ve always loved animals and can’t see myself doing anything else. Because of tafe I had to start volunteering to complete the practical component of my course and ended finding this amazing sanctuary to work at.\n\nSo I ended up starting there in early February 2024 and fell in love with the place and the people. I was originally going once a week but started going twice a week in around November bc I loved it so much and wanted to be there more. They always told me they loved how I would be there consistently every week and I would pride myself on it as it was a big commitment for me as I lived an hour away.\n\nThe environment there was great, honestly I couldn’t have asked for it to be any better. The owners always quite involved and prided themselves on this and wanted us to feel more like family rather than a workplace. Because of this I became quite close with the people who were on my days and considered them my second family.\n\nThe owners also lived on site and their kids were always around, because of this I became quite close with them as well, even buying them small presents for their birthdays and helping them with their homework.\n\nI suppose I’m telling you this so you understand how close I was with them, their family and the other volunteers, so you can understand how hurt I am by the way they’ve handled this situation.\n\nEven on my bad days, they were half the reason I’d get up in the morning, even when I didn’t want to drive, or talk to people, I’d still show up bc I didn’t want to let them down, as again I seen them as my second family and greatly valued their opinion.\n\nSo fast forward back to yesterday, it was completely normal. Nothing out of the ordinary, we were still talking like normal, doing all our tasks as normal, having lunch together like normal, I even got a last minute tour and stayed back to finish it up, which brought in a fair bit of money for them.\n\nAlso just a note, it’s a non-profit, all the money from tours goes right back into the sanctuary to care for the animals, food and water, vet bills, etc.\n\nSo just my little routine afterwards, I stop on the way home to go to the bathroom, get food, etc. So I was checking my phone like normal, and seen he sent me an attachment, funny thing is I thought he was sending me a dumb reel or something. Boy did I have a rude awakening when I read termination letter. So naturally I read through it and start crying because again, that day was normal, there was not even a hint that something like this was coming. Luckily I had one of my friends with me so I didn’t do something dumb like driving with so many tears in my eyes I could barely see and probably getting into an accident.\n\nIn the letter he basically highlighted the fact that he wants to maintain a positive workplace and while he values my input, he needs to put the sanctuary first, blah blah blah, the typical things in a letter that would put the blame on me so he doesn’t seem like the bad guy.\n\nSo one important thing to mention, they say this to everyone but from the start they said that they’re the kind of workplace to make sure everyone’s included and don’t like people to form cliques. However, I became really close to two people in particular, specifically because they’re great friends and have done so much for me.\n\nNow while I was really close with these two, I feel we included everyone when we could. Especially since some days at the sanctuary we’d be so busy we’d barely see each other that day. So we’d always go out for lunch, however we’d always ask everyone if they wanted anything and never ate out, always came back to be a part of the whole team. (We’d all have a break at the same time.)\n\nNow obviously being friends, we’d hang out after work, (but again we’d ask some people if they’d wanna come if we weren’t going too far away.) And we would call and stuff, but I feel it’s normal for friends to do that.\n\nSo one thing I could see where they wouldn’t have been to happy with this, is that we were doing an animal course about 5 hours away. You have to finish the online part first before you go do the practical bit. So one of my friends told the boss that we were going to be doing it (he already done it prior and was just driving us), and unlike the last time it was done, they didn’t put it on the group chat or anything for people to say they’re interested. I think they assumed we’d tell people that we were doing it and ask if they’d want to come. Mind you this was about a month in advance, so plenty of time for people to do the online section. I will say this course ends up being quite expensive so some people weren’t able to do it due to financial reasons anyway.\n\nAnyways long story short, one other person from the sanctuary ended up doing the course (btw the course only has 4 spots for the Prac part). We had a great time and included him in nearly everything we did (he traveled separately to us so was only left out of stuff we did on the way). We even had a game night and everything and really the only people who were left out were the people who couldn’t come but wanted to, which I don’t blame them for.\n\nI can only assume that this is the reason they fired us (my friend that drove was quitting, next week was going to be his last, however they messaged him yesterday basically telling him to not come back, and my other friend also got a letter similar to mine.)\n\nAgain, I was completely blindsided by this, as yesterday and even the last few weeks were completely normal. No they didn’t even try to chat with us, saying something like, ‘hey this is what we can see is happening and we don’t like it, can you just try to include the other people more’. Something like that and I wouldn’t have been as devastated.\n\nThe only other thing it might be is that I would make some pretty crude jokes, although I wasnt the only one that would say them, and me and my boss would say them to each other and everything (we’re Aussie btw, it’s part of our culture I suppose, if we don’t know you or don’t like you, we’ll be quite civil/polite to you, but if we do like you then you’ll probably cop it.) although I don’t think this was the problem bc again it wasn’t just me making these jokes.\n\nI guess what hurts the most, is that I really respected my boss and viewed both of them quite highly. Like they’re great people (at least I use to think so), they’re great parents, really community oriented and from what I’ve heard, quite highly regarded in our field. So basically for him to not even have the decency to even send me a message along with the letter it is what hurt the most. So naturally I sent them both a message, asking them to give me a call bc for my own peace of mind, I really need an explanation. Both of them (I assume accidentally) opened the message and I can see they read it, however they both ignored it. So I sent them an email this morning, however still waiting on a reply.\n\nI’ve never been through a breakup but I imagine it’d be like this, except instead of breaking up with one person, I’ve just lost my second family. With no warning, no explanation.\n\nAnyways thanks for listening to me ramble, sorry it was so long, I’m just kind of at a loss for now. Hopefully I’ll stop crying and get out of bed soon. Thank youse 🫶\n\nTLDR - I was volunteering at an animal sanctuary when I got a termination letter from my boss, with no warning, no explanation. I feel like I’ve lost my second family.",

    "content": "I (17M) am a Filipino, and have been living in Canada for about 6 months now. Just last month did I finally land a job at the deli in a supermarket after months of seemingly endless jobhunting.\n\nHowever, my manager at the deli is... lets just say, a not very nice person. Shes very condescending, and pretty much just has something against the students that work in the deli (me included).\n\nHer very obvious and not well hidden hatred towards the students finally came to a full fruition when she scheduled ALL the students for the rest of the month just less than 10 hour shifts a week. In fact, one of us was even getting just 4 HOURS in a week.\n\nIts not like we were being greedy or anything. All of us need the money. One of us needs it to buy insurance for his new car, and another one of us needs it to buy a new car. I need it to pay the internet bills in my house, help my parents with their payments, and maybe soon buy a PC for myself.\n\nWhen I saw my schedule for the rest of the month, as expected, I was pissed. I mean, seriously? We haven't really been slacking off either, all of us even do our jobs arguably well.\n\nWhen we went to ask our manager about it (she was supposed to STILL be at work) another one of the employees at the deli said she already TOOK OFF.\n\nOf course, we are planning to ask her about the schedules tomorrow.\n\nBut when I told my parents about it, they were not happy.\n\nThey thought I was asking for too much.\n\nOf course, I was once again pissed. For someone who works as a STUDENT and earning MINIMUM WAGE helping his OWN PARENTS PAY THEIR BILLS, I think I should atleast have SOME right to extend my hours, no? But no, of course not. When I told them it should be MY RIGHT to ask my manager for those few extra hours, they then went to comparing me to protesters.\n\nNo joke, heres how the conversation went:\n\nDad: \"What if the next time I start seeing you on the streets holding a placard? What if you end up like those pink protesters back home?\" (Referring to what happened back in the Philippine presidential elections)\"\n\nMe: \"I don't think it will go THAT far. Besides, even if it does, I think protesting about our hours should also be a part of our rights, no?\"\n\nMom: \"What are you thinking? The way you're thinking now, you're gonna end up a member of the NPA!\" (A Philippine communist terrorist organization)\n\nNow, this made me even more pissed. But to my parent's credit, they DID try to diffuse the situation.\n\nHow did they do that? Why, by insulting the way I do my chores at home, of course.\n\nThey said I needed to \"Prove myself at home\" first. \"Do the chores well first\". Like huh? I already do my job/s to the best of my ability as far as I know, I don't really know what else I need to prove at home. I mean, I guess fair enough??? I suppose theres still a few things to work on I guess??\n\nJust so yall know, I DID consider telling them that my manager was a not-so-nice person. But considering they already called me a communist for wanting more hours, I don't even wanna KNOW what they would wanna call me if I complained about my manager. \"Just do your job and bow down to your bosses\", thats their motto, after all. (Not even joking).\n\nHonestly, my brainrotted side thinks this is pretty funny, but it kinda made me feel bad at the time. My parents would literally rather compare their own child to a bunch of terrorists rather than siding with them! Amazing!\n\nTLDR: Manager is an asshole, gave me bad hours, and when I told my parents I was gonna ask for more hours, they compared me to communist terrorists",

But life was going on anyway.\n\nDuring those months together. I've had multiple relapse of alcohol and would send dumbs drunk messages to her. Nothing to serious. But it happened quite a bit. Just forgave me and understood my alcoholism, if I definitely stopped drinking.\n\nThat what I did. For the last 15 days, I was sober. I didn't told her but it was really really harsh, sweating, mood swing, shaking. But I was determined to not disappoint her.\n\nLast Sunday. She sent a friend of her to message me on Instagram. I told her I was in couple. But then, I liked a photo of her in bikini, and told her we could flirt.\n\nShe had few followers, only one photo, for me it was pretty much a fake and I was messing around.\n\nI would never have gone said that if I knew it was someone real, nor gone any further.\n\nI am french and here, I've been asking friends and most of them tell me it was dumb, and a bit disrespectful, but not cheating, that our love must go above this mistake.\n\nFor her, friends and family all tell her I'm disgusting, it's unforgivable, and she told me you can't repair a broken glass... She never forgave cheating, and won't.\n\nShe is now ghosting me, blocked me everywhere because I have been spamming her to talk to me at least.

I never ever cheat, and I would never ever, I guess our boundaries are different and it's a miscommunication.\n\nI have nothing to ask, my chest is empty, my life is empty, I just wanna kill myself now, and I have no way to contact her to explain her my point of view...\n\nTLDR : Sorry if I failed you, I don't know how much longer I can endure this. I love you more than anything. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry...\n\nEdit : The worse part is she never let me a chance to explain myself, to even say goodbye, she just disappeared like I am nothing. I can't express how much pain I am going through right now, I just cant keep living this life without her.",

    "content": "My (52M) father-in-law (85) moved in with us from another state due to his declining health. There was no way he could live by himself any longer. He’s a solid guy...sharp-minded, well-read, but lately, he just sits, naps, and stares into the void for hours. I work from home, and watching him decline, watching him die...has started to weigh on me in ways I didn’t expect. He says that if he stops eating he won't last as long and things like that. He's on all kinds of meds for cancer to depression of knowing he's dying.\n\nIn the past two months, I’ve had to give him more showers than I can count after accidents. I’ve hosed down clothes, scrubbed poop from the shower, and still not used to the loud burps, the constant farting, the mad dashes to the bathroom, while using a walker, hearing his despair as we walk, listening to him crumble in humility. I haven’t said a word to anyone about it because the first thing I feel isn’t frustration...it’s sadness. He had prostate cancer, and it’s spread to his bones. The doctors haven’t given us much insight into what’s next, but every day, I can see him slipping. My heart is breaking in all kinds of ways.\n\nMy bride works crazy hours and makes about twice what I make. She feels awful that this is upon me, and we even tried bringing in a nurse for a day, but after they left, he begged me not to have them come back. He likes it here, just the two of us most of the time during the day. He moves between the window with a bird feeder, his recliner, and his books. When my teenage boys are home, they watch history documentaries together, and for a little while. And we do small things on the weekends.\n\nI don’t say anything to my wife—she’s losing her dad. I won’t let her see me struggle. I won’t let him see it, either. I’ll be here 100%, without a single complaint. But the truth is, I can feel it getting to me, and my kids can too.\n\nHow do I stay positive? How do I keep from drowning in this? I knew this would be hard, but I didn’t realize just how much. I’m in over my head, and that itself makes me feel selfish. UGH!",

    "content": "We have been coworkers for almost 10 years and best friends for over 5 years. I'll keep it vague because she uses reddit regularly. Annie (fake name) and i are both in our 30s, both single, we talk constantly- we are either texting through the day or voice noting each other while we are driving. Everyone at work thinks we are a couple and are constantly asking if something is going on, unfortunately nothing ever has.\n\nI've been in love with her since I first met her. She's just so beautiful and smart and funny, there's nothing I don't love about her. She's a great mom too and I've been partially filling a void in her sons life of a male role model. Anyway on to the incident. We were out for dinner after work. I had asked her out knowing I was going to finally confess my feelings, but she didn't know that was my intention, we get dinner regularly enough.\n\nWhile eating we were gossiping about work and about a new project we are starting. It'll be us two and a guy called Craig (m 50s). Craig has asked me out multiple times to the point its definitely an ongoing joke. He knows I'm interested in women only and we have a great working relationship. Annie makes a comment about us having some late nights working coming up and I better watch out for Craig's advances, I joke that I guess everyone just wants to kiss me, she says not everyone. OK not a great start. I say well speaking of kissing and she cuts me off and just says \"please dont\".\n\nI just said ok. We both got fairly quiet. Finished our dinner with some small talk and work chat. Went our separate ways and haven't spoken since. It's been 2 days. I'm just so sad and lonely without her. I miss her son. I want to talk to her so much, but I know I can't keep this situation going on or I'll lose my sanity. I'm going to look for a new job. Maybe actually start dating women. In time I hope I can be a real friend to her. I feel bereaved. If anyone has been through this type of situation and has any advice please let me know.",

    "content": "I (19F) work with this girl, Genly (25F).  At work, she plays the sweet, quiet girl, and everyone thinks she’s so nice and understanding. But behind the scenes? She’s a two-faced gossip who talks shit about everyone, including the people she claims to be close to.\n\nAt first, we were pretty close, but the more I got to know her, the more I noticed how fake she was. She’d backstab people she said she liked, and I realized she was probably doing the same to me. So, I decided I was done. No warning, no explanation  I just blocked her on everything and moved on.\n\nThe second she found out, she ran to Facebook and posted some weird, fake-intellectual quote about people being “obsessed with psychology and personality traits,” my coworker told me clearly trying to make it seem like she’s above the drama. She even told people I blocked her, which is just petty. Like, just admit you’re mad and move on.\n\nBefore all this, Genly used to be super close with another coworker, Joanna (24F). I asked Joanna about something that made her realized that Genly was saying behind her back, and that opened Joanna’s eyes. Their friendship ended after that. So now, Genly has no one left except two other coworkers, Maribeth (22F) and Kenneth (20M), who are just as fake as she is.\n\nThe crazy thing? The day after I blocked her, Maribeth and Kenneth almost got attacked by a dog on their way to work. I passed the same dog later, and it didn’t even look at me. Then, Genly didn’t show up to work that day, claiming she had a “stomach ache.” The timing is insane, like the moment I cut her off, her whole vibe got thrown off.\n\nI know some people are saying I should’ve talked to her before blocking her, but I honestly don’t owe her an explanation. She was fake, I removed her from my space, and that’s it. I’m done with her.",

    "content": "Am I being used?\n\nDo I (26F) need a reality check? I’ve been friends with my friend, Blake (26M), for over a year now. We have been pretty close since the beginning. When we first met, we bonded over our shared love for playing soccer together and music. I would say we have many similarities. We both enjoy adult animation, like Studio Ghibli, raves, and playing board games. Since we shared many similarities, we kept in touch daily through text messages, phone calls, and FaceTime. We had a mutual friend named Jennifer. Jennifer and I were very close until I noticed that whenever we spent time together, she spoke negatively about everyone around her. As a result, I gradually distanced myself from her. Around the same time, Jennifer and Blake started dating. Although I wasn’t close to Jennifer and didn’t personally like her, I wanted Blake to be happy. Blake and I maintained a consistent relationship and communication. We talked every day, even during our lunch breaks, via FaceTime. However, things took a turn when Jennifer informed Blake that I had feelings for him and wanted to pursue a romantic relationship with him. That was not the case, and I was even in a relationship at the time. As a result, Blake ended our communication to preserve his relationship with Jennifer. We did not talk for eight months. However, in January he reached out to me. He told me that Jennifer suddenly broke up with him in December. Since then, we’ve been hanging out again. In February, we attended a rave and ended up having sex that night. A week later, we confessed to each other that we had both harbored feelings for one another since we’ve first met. At this point, I informed him that I didn’t want to be a rebound, and he responded by stating that he wasn’t ready for a relationship and wanted to focus on healing. I accepted his decision. We continued spending time together and continued having sex. However, I later told him that I no longer wanted to have sex with him because I was struggling to separate our friendship and romantic feelings. Around the same time his ex-girlfriend, Jennifer, filed a protective order against Blake.\n\nSidebar: Personally, I have had past experiences with abusive men, which may have influenced my perspective. However, I must admit that I am not entirely aware of the details of Jennifer and Blake’s relationship. Given Jennifer’s personality, I can’t help but wonder if this situation is a attention-seeking ploy. On the other hand, I have only heard Blake’s side of the story.\n\nHowever, I suggested that we establish boundaries. We agreed to refrain from having sex and I told him I need a break from constant communication. I also told him to fine another trusted friend to confide in about the Jennifer situation because I haven’t healed from my own trauma from the abusive I had endured. Blake expressed his agreement to the physical boundaries and expressed he didn’t want to lose me again and our friendship.\n\nSince implementing these boundaries, our relationship has undergone a significant change. We don’t talk that much anymore and when we do the protective order case seems to be the main topic of discussion. Although, last night, I visited Blake’s place to watch Star Wars. During the movie, he asked me to engage in a platonic cuddle. We did, and he said Thank you. I inquired about the reason behind his gratitude. He mentioned that my presence was naturing and made him feel less lonely. Am I only in his life  because he feels lonely?",

    "content": "I'm 14 years old and have told two of my friends briefly about this but I feel like I'll annoy them if I speak about it more. I just want to get this off my chest and put my experience somewhere in hopes it'll make me feel better. I'm also posting this here because I don't want anyone to try and intervene, it'll just make everything worse. Content warning for violence as well, but suicide is mentioned first so I used that flair, sorry.\n\nMy mom is an okay mom most of the time, but she's very quick to anger and has total freakouts over small things that always result in herself threatening to kill herself, or saying she's going to kill herself. I have a little brother who is 13, and my mom is 45 with a history of suicidal thoughts and one attempt before we were born, which she told us about.\n\nWhenever we get into huge fights, she usually takes my stuff and threatens to destroy/burn it (she never does), she never let's me talk and always screams over me, and then of course she threatens to kill herself and says it's because of me and my brother and she says we ruined her life. I can understand why she resents us to an extent, my brother and I are rape babies and we look like our dad. On the topic of him, he's an abusive rapist who was/is addicted to drugs, and who hasn't been in our lives since I was 3. He has gone off the radar for a few years and nobody knows where he is. My mom keeps threatening to send us back to him and has shown us her text in him multiple times telling him she's done with us and that he needs to come get us. He never has, obviously. The last few times we've gotten in fights I never even yelled once and just keep talking calmly because I heard that helps calm angry people down, it doesn't work she just keeps yelling, and there's even been a few times when I do raise my voice that she literally covers her ears and says \"lalalala\" like a toddler until I stop talking.\n\nAfter she threatens this, she usually leaves the house and says she's never coming back and says we can live with our grandmother. She says either that she's gonna drive off a cliff, into a brick wall, etc etc, or that she'll just straight up abandon us and start a new life somewhere. Then she'll come back some time later and act like nothing happened, very rarely she'll apologize but if I ever try and bring up what she's done again when she's calm, she'll just get enraged again. I've tried talking to her about it through text only once when she was out of the house, sending her a lengthy few paragraphs about my concerns, but she responded back basically just shaming me, and when she came home she was angry and she said she showed the text to all of her friends, which are mostly my friends parents, and she said they don't like me anymore and I won't be able to hang out with any of my friends anymore. I started avoiding all of my friends and eventually began online school because of this, and now my mom claims all my friends and their parents miss me and they don't understand why I don't talk to them anymore. I don't know what to believe anymore.\n\nWhen she isn't in these weird freak out modes she's an okay mom but she snaps at random stuff before flipping like a switch and being happy again. Just yesterday she was yelling and slamming around her computer because she couldn't upload her photos to Facebook, she's a photographer. A few people had just been over to fix our dryer about an hour earlier, which has been broken for months, so mid yelling at her computer she just got up and went to go text out the new dryer and then when it worked she was all smiles and apologized for yelling.\n\nShe also frequently tells me and my brother that we're the only thing keeping her alive and that she would probably kill herself without us, and she's told us multiple times that she doesn't own a gun because she's afraid that when we grow up and move out she'll kill herself because she has no one to rely on anymore. This scares me and I want to move away for college when I'm grown, I planned on leaving this household as soon as possible, but I don't really want to anymore because she keeps saying things like that. She says stuff like that and says she loves me and my brother, but then says the exact opposite when she gets really angry and says she wants to die because of us and she blames everything she's mad at on us \"stressing her out\". She's also gotten physical with me and my brother multiple times, like digging her nails into the back of my neck and holding my face into a pillow because I wouldn't give her my phone because she said she was gonna break it, chokeholding me and dragging me out of me room before locking me out of my room and tearing it apart because I hid my art tablet from her, and more. She's done stuff with my brother too and I'm ashamed to admit this but I don't know what because whenever she's mad at him I just hide in my room so I won't get punished for helping him. He does the same when she does that stuff with me. I only know she hurts him because I can hear it.\n\nI don't want to call the police, I'm scared and I don't want to live with my grandma or in a foster home or anywhere else and I don't want to be separated from my brother and pets. She actually encourages me to call the police on her and says she'd rather go to jail than live with us. I just want to explain to her how her her actions hurt me and my brother and I want to get her to stop. There's been periods of times where everything has been fine for a while and my family is just a normal happy family and I cry sometimes thinking about how that's what my family could be like if my mom wasn't the way she was. I know I'm doing it to myself at this point by not calling the police but I'm just scared and keep hoping things will change.\n\nRight now is one of those times where everything's fine, my mom is currently talking to my brother, offering to clean off the couch and sit and braid his hair while they watch the movie together. We're all acting like nothing's wrong. I just wish my family could be this way all the time.",

I should always be grateful that im in this position, which i am. It’s just there are things that still bothers me, that ruins my mood, sucking the soul out of me little by little, draining my life day by day, inch by inch. Idk if im just a whiny wife, but here are some things that messes w my head everyday:\n\nHe NEVER puts his coffee mugs in the sink after he used them, there’s always hundreds of them outside where he smokes (i told him a million times to put it in the sink after he finish using it, i dont mind washing it, JUST PUT IT IN THE FUCKING SINK) but noopee, still compiling outside the house. Til this day, i let it be, there are still 4-5 mugs outside the house, not gonna touch it ever unless he brings it in. This is so sad for me, cus he knows i got a bad eczema on my hands, so everytime i wash BUTTLOADS of dishes, i have to wear gloves, wash the gloves, dry the gloves, also wash my hands bc rubber gloves makes me itchy a bit etcetc my main point is its hell and back on earth for me to do dishes, and he’s not considerate of that. We once had a big fight bc when we’re at our inlaws (his fam) he fucking WASHED HIS MUG??? Huh? Since when the fuck do u do that? So you care what your family says about you instead of caring about your eczema hands wife? Yea fuck you.\n\nhe rarely takes care of our son. I literally do everything. He only takes care of him if i told him to. Sometimes when i shower, i have to actually ask him ‘can you watch him for a bit’ he has this ugly smug face and said ‘k’ like um wtf? You’re supposed to b excited?? He’s your son??? You will b rarely seeing him cus you work offshore???? Get this, infront of his family, he acts so fatherly, playing with him, taking care of his diapers etc while me, if we’re actually home, IM DOING ALL THE FUCKING STUFF, not him. He literally does shit IF i tell him to. He’s never considerate of how tired i am 24/7. 90% of the time if I dont wanna see his smug face if i have to shower and no one is watching our son, i had to put our son in his crib and let him watch ms rachel on ipad, eventho it hurts me doing that cus im limiting his screen time. And what was my husband doing that time? PLAYING LEAGUE OF LEGENDS, and he’ll be like ‘sorry im in game, i cant quit’ well fuck you. And also get this, when i found out that im pregnant and i wanted to abort it (cus i know im not ready) he was the ONE who strongly insisted to keep it cus he said he cant wait to be a dad. Well step the fuck up bro\n\nidk if im wrong or just exaggerating but he prioritizes his family over me and my son. If there was a fire, he would save his 4 brothers and 5 sisters instead of his wife and son. He would go to the ends of the earth for them ( once he had to deliver something car oil at 6AM for his sister n her husband, 6AM??? Mf usually wakes up at 2pm ffs.\n\nhe has this obsession w fixing up old cars he would spend loads of money on it and w literally his blood, sweat, tears and his time. Yo i don’t mind mf got a hobby, i got a hobby too, that’s great for him, but wht abt when i need to shower???? Do i have to go outside to ask you to watch over our son again with your ugly smug face again?? to sum up he has 2 obsession, league of legends and his car. None of which you can bother him at all. My hobby is just gym. JUST GYM. FOR 1 HOUR. At which i can ONLY work out when my son takes his afternoon nap! I just want him to evenly schedule his hobby.. not to the point he doesn’t have time for his son or me. Do u think he listens? Nah. Everytime i told him this he’ll be like ‘this is the only time i can do this, while im working at sea i cant do this stuff’ im like HELLO? cars and games are forever?? Your wife and son could leave you or die anytime? wtf is his mindset mahn istg he’s still acts like a teenager. I literally feel like i have 2 sons as of this time.\n\nhis dirty clothes and socks. Need i say more? I feel like almost every wife experienced this.\n\nhe spills his coffee and chocolate milk every where in the kitchen but never wipes it. (I once saw the mf VACUUMS his family’s kitchen bc there was a spilled rice grains). Basically he’s really sloppy.\n\nThere are more but that’s the top of my head. Idk what I should do. Everytime i tell him whats been bothering me, we always have a huge fight and it always ends with (ok i promise i wont do it again) but he still does and its and endless cycle. I cant leave him bc I literally have no money to raise my son alone (AND my mom is getting old, so i have to take care of her too). So til now im just tolerating everything but it drains my energy so much but at the same time i put on a happy smile on my face for my son, i dont ever want my son to see depressed or angry.\n\nMind you, he used to b very sweet and thoughtful at the beginning of our dating life and marriage life. I thought he was the most amazing guy. I know he loves me and my son, but i dont think he loves me enough to change his ugly habits.",

You can imagine that I, an introverted and nerdy kid, wasn't able to make many friends, and so i got lonely. In fact i was known as the lonely kid, no one ever wanted to talk to me and sometimes even made fun of me (i discovered some years later that everyone talked behind my back during those years, and that was the reason no one even wanted to approach me). And so i spent three years of my life by myself: i spent my days alone, definitely years that i wouldn't want to live again. Once middle school ended, i was full of hope: that same summer i made some friends and had a lot of fun with them, and so i was positive about starting high school. And so, once my first year of school started i tried to me more extroverted and social (the outcome was awkard, i'm not good at being extroverted). Even tho i tried, the outcome wasn't positive. This time no one talked behind my back, but i had trouble making friends and so i became the lonely kid once again. I was depressed, spent my days listening to music and sleeping all day just to escape that feeling of void that was suffocating, swallowing me whole. I was ready to end it all, but i wasn't brave enough to even try, so i kept living my life and eventually things got better. I made new friends, i became more social and felt truly happy after years of suffering. I am happy about how i lived the rest of my teenage years, but that feeling never got away. I am now left with an overthinking mindset (idk if i can call it like that), which leads me to anxiety about all the friendships that i currently live: i can't be calm, because i sometimes think that everyone will sooner or later go against me and make me live the hell i went through one more time. I can't trust anyone, and this thing is making me mad, because come on, why am i so defensive? why can't i just live my life like the others, and not worry about this? i don't truly know why i wrote this, probably to feel better or to relate to someone here who perhaps lived my same experience. Anyways, i feel costantly feel this overwhelming sense of entrapment in my own life, i feel like my past will always follow me, no matter what i do. No matter how many new people i will meet, i will always have this anxiety that they will disappoint me, and life is so hard this way. I don't even know if someone will read this, i will probably only get some upvotes and my post will be forgotten in this sub",

When I moved to New Zealand at 16, I hoped things would change, but I found it even harder to make friends and felt even more misunderstood. That sense of not fitting in just followed me.\n\nOver time, I started wishing I had been born into a different culture—not because I think life would’ve been better, but because something just never clicked with my own. I’ve always found my culture awkward and uninteresting, but when I met my first South American friend, something felt right. The more people I connected with from Chile, Peru, Brazil, and Colombia, the more I felt at home.\n\nI know South America is incredibly diverse, and I don’t mean to generalize, but I can’t ignore the feeling. Maybe belonging isn’t about where you’re born, but where you feel understood.",

    "content": "TW: drug abuse\n\nSo, I don’t know how to start. My sister has/had a long-term relationship and I even considered him my brother because he was like that with me. They even have a child together. It all started last year when my bil asked my father for 400€  but not to tell my sister and he would pay it back as soon as he got paid. To this day he never payed back and he lost my father’s respect because of this. We suspected that he may be doing drugs but we kinda hoped he wouldn’t do something like this because he loves his child to the moon. There were few incidents where he acted off… we never interpreted much into this and just hoped everything would be okay. He works in a field where the future is the secured and a few weeks back he told us that he and his other colleagues were laid off but they would all receive loan payments till the contract ends. Idk it came with a surprise and I had a thought that maybe he was the only person that got laid off. I asked my bf about it because his father works in the same company but in a different department. He said he didn’t know anything about this. Well, wednesday was the incident that ruined my sister’s life. We don’t know what happened exactly but my sister has ended the relationship for good and threw him out because she found drugs. She told our mom that he had a history with drugs a long time ago but he swore it would never happen again. Since yesterday he is supposedly in rehab. I don’t how to talk to my sister about this and I don’t know what to think myself. He was like a brother and I always defended him to everyone. I am scared what will happen in the future, I mean what if he collapses again? Right now my sister is a single mom who works full time with only a half day daycare. I don’t know whether my bil was under influence when he was watching my nibling. There were times where he was alone with my nibling for two weeks. Was he driving under influence? And was my nibling with him? For how long was the abuse? Will my sister recover from all this? Was he thinking about what his abuse will do to my sister and nibling? Was he even thinking?\n\nThere is only so much hurt that a person can endure and my sister had enough in her life. My mind all over the place and I have so much questions I would like to ask but I know that I can’t get an answer. I would like to tell my bil how disappointed I am but I know that this would not help his rehab. My mind is all over the place and my heart is hurting and I can’t talk to anyone expect my mother but she feels the same way expect that her heart hurts more because this is her daughter. I don’t know what to do right now. I don’t know what to think. I don’t know what to feel. I don’t know how to help my sister.\n\nI had to get this off my chest, thanks for reading",

Just the two of us are going on trip, this can either going to ruin our whole trip or strengthen our bond. The biggest problem is that I am worried he will think I am too young to talk about these topics and he’ll say I can change, either when I am older, or when I find the “right” person. All that to say that I love my brother, but knowing his biblical stance on sexuality has made this very difficult for me to say anything.

    "content": "Hey everyone, to whoever’s reading this story. I’d love to hear your thoughts on it. I guess I should start with a little backstory.\n\nAround early autumn last year, I was walking through one of the neighborhoods in my city. It was my last day at work, and after finishing up, I decided to take a stroll, grab something to eat, and soak in the last warm, sunny days. I found a nearby bench, sat down, popped in my earphones, and just listened to music as I made my way to a café.\n\nAt some point, I noticed a girl who looked really upset.\n\nI hesitated for a moment but then decided to go up to her and see if she was okay. Turns out, she’d had a really rough day. We ended up walking together, exchanging contacts, and chatting later on when we had time.\n\nOur first few meetups were easygoing and fun. We talked, got to know each other, and with every meeting, we started growing closer. After about a month, I started visiting her place after the gym to unwind a little.\n\nAnd then, at some point, things between us started feeling like more than just friendship. There was this warmth, this physical closeness that I’d been missing (even though I had plenty of friends, I was single at the time).\n\nShe’s absolutely gorgeous—like, the kind of girl who turns heads wherever she goes. She’s tall (about 185 cm), has an amazing figure, a beautiful face, and these deep brown eyes that just pull you in. She’s got a great body, though that’s far from the only thing I like about her. She’s also a few years older than me.\n\nThen, about three weeks later, after lots of time spent together and some really great conversations, I went over to her place again, this time bringing flowers to surprise her.\n\nI rang the doorbell, and when she opened the door… my jaw literally dropped.\n\nThere she was, standing in front of me in red silk shorts and a top, looking absolutely breathtaking. I just stood there, speechless, until she pulled me inside, wrapped her arms around me, and kissed me.\n\nWe headed to the kitchen, where she was cooking some meat for dinner—something she knew I liked, even though I’d never actually told her. That moment just hit differently. It was like she knew me better than I knew myself. That was when I realized—this girl had completely stolen my heart.\n\nLater, she even got me a pair of shorts and an T-shirt so I’ve have something to wear around her place.\n\nI changed, sat down with her on the couch, and we put on some YouTube. Before long, we were cuddling, and yeah—that was when we kissed. The whole evening was just perfect.\n\nAnd now, every day, I catch myself wondering: am I doing the right thing? Because I honestly love spending time with this girl.\n\nI could really use your advice.",

That habit has hurt me in more ways than I can count, and this situation is no exception.\n\nAt the same time, the immigration system has changed significantly over the years, making it much harder for someone in my position to qualify. In the end, it was a mix of bad timing, personal missteps, and an immigration system that has only grown tougher for people like me.\n\nI moved to Canada as an international student a little over 15 years ago. I started from nothing, learning English from scratch, completing my academic English education, and then going to university and college. I worked multiple jobs as a developer while paying my taxes and contributing to the country I wanted to call home.\n\nDespite all that, I lost everything when my work permit expired a few months ago. I did not qualify for enough points under the ever-changing immigration system, so as soon as my permit expired, my job was gone. Because my work permit expired, I was not eligible for unemployment benefits, had no options, just the expectation to pack up and leave like I never existed.\n\nThe worst part is that this is not just about money or survival. I genuinely loved my job. I had amazing coworkers, a great team, and what I believed to be the perfect job in the perfect country. I was lucky enough to have made meaningful contributions and had so much more to offer as a 32-year-old with a bright future ahead of me. That is why I have so many regrets about how things turned out, and I know they will stay with me for a lifetime. I would give anything to go back and keep doing what I love. But because I wanted to do things the right way, legally and honorably, there just do not seem to be any options left.\n\nLosing my job did not just mean losing income. It meant losing my ability to stay afloat in the country I call home. Even when I had a good income, I was living paycheck to paycheck, covering expenses for two people. A large portion of my money went toward taxes, rent, and paying off debts that piled up after I lost my previous job during the pandemic. Now, with no work permit, not even under-the-table cash jobs would be enough to cover my expenses, and those would not be legal for me anyway.\n\nOver the years, Canada’s immigration system has become increasingly strict. The requirements kept changing, the point thresholds kept rising, and options like employer-specific work permits, which could have been a lifeline for people like me, were removed in Ontario. By the time I finally became eligible or was just about to, things had already shifted again. I know people who moved to other provinces because obtaining permanent residency was easier there, but even that became riskier when some pathways suddenly disappeared.\n\nGoing back to Turkey is not just about starting over. It is a nightmare waiting to happen. My brother and I are both considered army escapees, which means we would be forced into mandatory military service soon after arriving. The Turkish army is notorious for its brutal conditions. As ethical vegans and atheists, we would be in an impossible position. The army does not accommodate veganism, and being openly atheist is frowned upon both socially and institutionally. I know our time there would be unbearable in every way.\n\nThe system does not account for people like me, those who have given everything to this country, only to be left with no way to stay.\n\nIs this how the system treats people who dedicate their youth, education, and labor to this country?\n\nI do not want to sound ungrateful. I have always loved this country, and I still do. I love its people, and I consider Toronto my real home. Leaving would feel like losing a part of myself forever. But after all these years, not having a viable pathway to stay just does not feel fair to me.\n\nAfter more than two days without sleep, with stress piling up and rent due while I have no income, my mind is all over the place while writing this.\n\nI also recorded myself talking about all of this for about half an hour right before writing this, crying the whole time. It felt like therapy in a way, just letting it all out. Now, writing this feels like another form of that release.\n\nI do not know what comes next, but I needed to get this off my chest. If nothing else, I hope sharing my story highlights how the system fails people who follow all the rules and still end up with nothing. I truly hope it will somehow help future people like me.\n\nThank you for reading. I truly appreciate anyone who takes the time to respond with feedback, suggestions, or criticism.",

    "content": "Me (26F) and my friend (25M) met during university, but we didn’t talk much back then. He had his own friend group, and I had mine. It wasn’t until a few years after graduating, when we ended up working together, that we became inseparable, because our cubicles are right next to each other.\n\nI have pretty bad abandonment issues, but I also get attached to people way too easily (a deadly combination, I know). So when we started hanging out more, I didn’t think much of how close we were. I was just happy to have such a good friend.\n\nI didn’t realize I had feelings for him until my birthday. He was running late to my party, and I caught myself looking at the door constantly, waiting for him to show up. I felt this ridiculous relief when he finally arrived. At the time, I had just gotten out of a really toxic situationship, so I dismissed my feelings. I told myself I was just trying to replace what I had with the other guy.\n\nThen, a few months later, he told me he was interviewing for a job on the other side of the world. I had a full-on breakdown. That was the moment I realized how deep my feelings for him actually were. I can’t even tell you how many nights I cried over the idea of him leaving. In the end, he got the job, but still chose to stay.\n\nSome part of me thinks maybe he likes me back. He’s told me before that he thinks I’m pretty, he cooks for me, listens to me vent, spends whole weekends with me, and just shows up in a way that no one else has. Sometimes he makes comments that imply he does want something with me, but then he also says he wouldn’t date someone outside of his culture (we are from two very different countries). So I don’t know if he’s sending mixed signals on purpose or if I’m just reading too much into things.\n\nTo make things worse, he recently started messaging back and forth with a friend of his from high school, and it seems pretty flirty, he seems excited. It’s killing me. I don’t know what to do or how to deal with it. I want to cry every single day. He is going back home for vacation soon, and I’m terrified that he’ll come back and tell me he has a girlfriend.\n\nI know now that a relationship isn’t possible, and I don’t want to lose him as a friend. But I don’t know how to deal with these feelings.",

She doesn’t attempt to speak to me or have a relationship with me, she doesn’t speak to him at all, she would try to control everything about it. She honestly probably won’t even be invited at this point, but it deeply bothered me that it was somehow made about my sister.\n\nThis is the same woman that didn’t tell me that my cat had passed after having him for 10 years and refused to even talk about it or acknowledge it when I was upset about it.

    "content": "First of all, I want to apologize for my poor English since I’m doing this through a translator. I’m a 19-year-old guy who has had pectus carinatum his whole life. It has brought me a lot of teasing and stares, and even though I have the mildest case, I have a small banana-shaped protrusion on my sternum. I’ve wanted surgery since I was 14.\n\nAs a first option, they wanted me to wear a compression brace for a year, which is complete nonsense. I knew it wouldn’t fix what I have, and even the doctor said so. I fought for years to get surgery until one day they took me to the sub-capital to see a doctor. The doctor told me it was a very mild case and that the surgery was very simple: they would cut two cartilages, push the sternum inward, and that was it. This happened in June 2024. I was very excited about the idea of having a normal chest.\n\nMy experience with this condition has been horrible and has caused me a lot of insecurity. Every time I wear a t-shirt, the lump is noticeable, making me look much fatter than I actually am. I’ve been training for five years, and it’s horrible to see how I can’t make progress in my chest because this damn protrusion sticks out—it’s all I’ve seen in the mirror for five years.\n\nGoing back to what I was saying, my parents postponed the surgery until 2025. I got angry with them and gave them an ultimatum: “Either I get the surgery, or I leave the house.” I want to clarify that this was the only thing I was asking for, the only thing I wanted. I’m the youngest child, and I have a 29-year-old sister who is studying her second degree because she realized that the first one wouldn’t get her a job. My father has always helped her with her apartment and university expenses. I’ve always known she was the favorite, and I wasn’t asking for much—just this surgery.\n\nToday we went to see a doctor in our city, and instead of agreeing with the previous doctor, he said they would have to break my abdomen, cut all the cartilage, and insert a prosthesis. I suspect this was all planned because my father is a doctor, and I have a feeling he talked to this doctor to make me change my mind or to have an excuse to say no. I walked home because I was so angry at them. I’ve been fighting for this surgery for about five years, and they found the perfect excuse to deny it.\n\nTonight at dinner, I ate in my room. I’m so tired of them—they are the most vile, cruel, and arbitrary people I know. I hate them for making me go through my entire adolescence and now my adulthood with this lump in my chest just because they don’t want me to have surgery. They have no idea how much I’ve suffered or how much I wish with all my heart to die. I wish I could just wake up one day and no longer exist in this horrible world. I hate the parents I got, and I hate my sister for being the favorite. If I could, I’d take a gun and blow my brains out so I wouldn’t have to endure this anymore—but I will make them pay. As soon as I get a job, I’ll leave this place and never speak to them again. When they’re old, I’ll put them in a nursing home—and I’m being generous. I should let them rot in their own filth.\n\nI’ll update if there’s any news.",

    "content": "keeping events and names vague on purpose.\n\ni have a very close friend, A, who i love very dearly, but shes been in bind after bind. her family had disowned her and she has been in like 5 horrible relationships in the past two years and both the places she has worked at in the past two years have gone out of business. none of this stuff is her fault but i think it puts her in a shitty place where she feels justified in her own mind to just not hang out with friends or justified to be rude to friends in a way.i love hanging out with A and i love just sitting around and chatting and watching tv with her while i do art and such like that, but i also love getting out of the house on occasion if im invited.\n\nfor example, As roommate, B, invited Bs GF, me, A, and another friend out to go get food. we got all ready and then A was like 'i actually dont have alot of money so im gonna sit this one out.' and we were all super sad and then we all look in our wallets and agree we could chip in a few bucks each to cover As meal because shes been in hard times so much and we go tell her and shes like 'no... i dont want to...' so we go out to eat without her and have a great time and come back and even bring her food back from the restaurant and shes all angry and depressed and sad she didnt get to go.\n\nTwo weeks ago, B took a bus to stay in her GFs dorm for a few days and when she came back i picked her up from the bus stop, we got some fast food, even got some for A and then came back home and me and B were talking and being silly when A goes 'i hate hearing you talk and have fun like that when you got to go do something fun while i had to work for all those days with no break.' and then A goes back to her room. I went to class and didnt hear anything for a few days but i know that A and B argued.\n\nthen some friends from me and As highschool that we still regularly talk to texted me and said theyre gonna do something fun over this coming weekend and i was like hell yeah i love hanging out with my friends and they told me to ask A if she wants to join in and i call up A and ask her and she goes 'idk... i dont have my work schedule yet...' and i said 'ok could u text ur boss and ask for the day off? we really all want to hang out with you!' and she says 'ill see'. weekends coming around and i just texted A to ask if shes gonna hang out with us and she goes 'no i have work' i say 'oh im sad you couldnt get work off' and she goes 'oh i didnt really try... they (highschool friends) didnt directly ask me so i figured i wasnt invited.'like girl.... i literally asked you because they wanted you there? and i showed her the texts from our friends asking if A is coming because theyre so excited to see her, both friends live a ways away so we dont see each other often and one of the friends hasnt seen A for about 4 years due to moving states and then coming back. and we were all excited and waiting for her to join us. but i go 'ok... i wish u could have joined us maybe we can pick u up after u finish working and hang out?' and she just goes 'no i think your all going to have fun without me'and i kinda was a bit pissed w her so i said she should have take the day off when i asked a while ago and shes just like 'oh. i could  have. but i didnt.' ??? girl?this is around when i told her she needs to stop victimizing herself.\n\ni hung out with her roommate later that day and we discussed how shes kinda been and B said she would talk to A about how she needs to stop isolating herself. I also ended up inviting B to hang out with us over the weekend instead as the highschool friends have all met B in passing and like hanging out with her. ik this is gonna piss off A a bit but like A could have also hung out with us.... and then A is gonna be mad and not want to hear about what weve all done for a while.im just so tired of her self deprecating behavior where she always HAS to be the victim who just CANT hang out or CANT do anything fun and all that bull.\n\nTLDR; exactly what the title says. i told my friend that she needs to stop victimizing herself and i dont really feel that bad about it. thats the end.",

    "content": "Good morning yall! A couple days ago I made a post at 3 in the morning to confess to doing my roommates dishes because I secretly love to watch her do a happy dance when she sees her favorite mug is clean for her to use again. That post changed our lives and I'm only being a little dramatic by saying that.\n\nI gotta say thanks to everyone who upvoted and commented on my original post, I'm still shook at just how many people read about me and my mug happy best friend. The amount of people saying my post made them smile or reminded them of their own friendships or significant others has kept me smiling for days. I'm kind of into making people happy, if that wasnt already obvious, so the fact that so many people had even a moment of positivity because of me has been awesome.\n\nWhen I made that original post it was because I just wanted to tell someone about the mug dancing but I knew Gwen wouldn't like it if I told anyone we knew so I came to reddit to shout to the void and oh boy, did the void shout back. There were so many comments asking if I really thought we were just friends, and I'll be honest when I made that post we absolutely were just friends. We had never talked about being more than friends and I was happy being friends because we have an amazing friendship. I hadn't really thought about there being a possibility for more because dating was always something I planned to do when I had my life together or when I had more money. I never let myself consider what I was missing out on by waiting for the \"right time.\" Her finding my post opened up the chance for Gwen and I to talk about things that we hadn't before and over breakfast that morning we found where we stood with each other and what we thought things could look like moving forward depending on what we both agreed was the best course. We didn't make any solid plans or decisions and didn't want to rush into something that would ruin the good we already had going for us, but I'll admit I was hoping for a specific outcome.\n\nThere was one comment on that first post that had really caught my attention. To paraphrase, they told me to think about how I would feel if someone else got to see Gwen do her happy mug dance instead of me and it hit me so hard. I didn't mind the idea of someone else seeing her so happy. I just dont know if anyone she dates would notice what I did and decide to do what I did. What if they didn't care or didn't think it was that important or any of the other things I do to make her laugh or smile. I really didn't like the thought of not being there to make sure she has that extra reason to smile in the morning. (Gwen wants me to admit that I'm a sappy moron because I teared up writing this. Im a sensitive man in touch with my emotions and you know you love it so shut it you 😝.)\n\nTo all the people saying it's possible for platonic relationships to be like ours you are absolutely correct. Our friend group is very open with physical and verbal affection and we help each other all time with big and small things. We all say I love you to each other, it's just normal communication for us as a group, not just between Gwen and I. Honestly, if I hadn't made my original post I'm not sure when or if we would have gotten to the point we are now. Maybe we would have continued as we were and that would have been just as happy of an outcome, just a different one, like a choose your own adventure with multiple options for a good resolution.\n\nWhich brings me to the actual update. Gwen and I agreed we want to try dating. We aren't putting a new label on our relationship yet, but our first date is next week. I'm making it all a surprise. Gwen helped write this post and will be reading the comments so I can't give any details, but it's going to be the best first date she has ever been on, or I'll eat my candy corn patterned socks. I think she might be the one for me and I'm going to take every chance I can to make sure she thinks the same about me.\n\nYall are the best and we love you. Do something kind for your loved ones for us and everyone can and should find something to happy dance about, it makes life more fun.\n\nLove Gwen and Peter 🩷🕸",

They were in a T-bone position with the truck to my right. Before I could react, both vehicles slammed into me, totalling my car.  Thankfully (or so i thought) I wasn't injured. I got photos, names, insurance information, license plates, everything I could think of. I was told by two of the adjusters involved that I pretty much did their job for them. After 4 months of being pulled around, being told that I was not liable by all parties involved, that the claim was going to arbitration, then in subrogation, and finally being told that my insurance didn't cover damage to my own car, I am so frustrated and exhausted. I have a part-time job an hour away that I haven't been able to go to for the past 3 months. My husband has his own business that uses the only other car we have. I was told by so many people that I just needed to wait for liability to be settled and I'd get payment for my car. But today I was told that I am fully shit out of luck, that because insurance hasn't paid anything for repairs or a rental or anything that there's no point in paying for my car. I understand it's because I had basic liability, but I can't afford another car right now.\n\nI've been trying to find a lawyer to help, but I've been told by literally everyone that it just isn't worth it to pursue. That the lawyers fees would be more than I'd get in a settlement. I've tried legal aid, the local law school, referral after referral, and as soon as I mention I wasn't injured it's over. I'm at such a loss. I don't know if it would be worth it to try and represent myself, or just leave it alone, but even the few thousands of dollars I could get for the value of my car would make things so much easier. I'm so frustrated that something so detrimental to my day-to-day is just not worth it for absolutely everyone. That I can lose my only asset, be told I've done everything right, and still be on the losing side because I wasn't injured.",

    "title": "Boyfriend wants to get married and I’m indifferent towards it",
    "content": "Back story I’m (F28) and my (M30) wants to be married. We were on and off from the years I was 19-20 and when I turned 21 we got together offically and I was convinced by him and his mom to move in since I was living alone and my parents are retired in a different country.\n\nFrom the years 19-22 he was just not nice very rude and he would always choose his friends over me and his friends were always females. In the early stages his friends or family will tell him to leave me and he would do it and then be adamant on staying friends when I would say no. He also kept crying to me about his ex and how much she hurt him and he hid the fact he would talk to her mom like once a week. When I found out he stood his ground and said no to cutting her off. He only agreed to cut her off because I was pregnant with his child.\n\nWhen I turned 23 during Covid we fell pregnant although I took Plan B I didn’t realize I was ovulating so it didn’t work. We kept our son but he was just so rude during my pregnancy he took it upon himself to be there for a female friend all because she was dating a guy and needed “help” and instead of her going to her female friends my bf was always available. He went as far as to stay out all night and get drunk with her and their other friends and the guy she was dating when I didn’t want him to and when he returned home he cursed me and his mother out because I held him back in life. I also had told him for years how important marriage was to me and he was just so whatever about it. I told him while I was pregnant just ask with a ring pop since we didn’t have too much money and I wanted to be married before having a kid and he came home a few days later and as I was lying on the couch he threw the ring pop and said “ you going to say yes right “ I said no because he made it seem like a chore or obligation rather than him wanting to. He also spend all my pregnancy mad at me because I didn’t want to name our son after him. When I’ve told him since I was 19 and even before when we were sort of friends at 16 that I do not want to name my son after their father name.\n\nFast forward our son is born and he is currently 4 and throughout these 4 years he keeps wanting to be married and I told him unless he has a career were he can  care of the home expenses what is the point. Since our son been born I’ve made almost all the money paid our rent our bills he’s has jobs here and there.  He just made one year at his current job and he does pay his part but even before our son and now I’m also paying like 60/70% and he pays the rest and theirs been times I’ve paid 100%. I told him if he becomes a police officer id feel okay and comfortable marrying him since it’s a good paying job and he can support us and he wants to and he’s doing it for him and for us to be married. But I also feel so indifferent like I don’t see the excitement in calling him my husband since we skipped over the step. Sometimes I feel like it’s my fault and I should of ignored that he threw a ring pop at me and other times I feel like if I would of accepted it I would be open to constant disrespect from him in the future.\n\nHim as a father: super good and kind he takes our son to school and picks him up he lets me sleep in and sleep whenever. He tries to pay for dates when we are out our son and him have a strong bond. He gets me flowers offers to cook even it it doesn’t taste the greatest. Overall him as a dad and a partner is nice I do feel spoiled. But because I can’t let go of how he treated me I’m always going to have this fever he’s going to revert back.",

I’ve contacted help lines and end up feeling like a waste of space on the line. I contacted a couple more places and even I told them they were my last chance. But every single place has waiting lists. No matter how much I say, “I don’t have time to wait,” they just tell me to hold on. I don’t think I can.\n\nI’m drowning, and I can’t breathe. This feels like it.\n\nI don’t know if I actually want to be saved or if I just want people to understand that I fought. That I tried. That I didn’t just give up for no reason.\n\nI feel invisible. Even when I’m here, I don’t feel here. It’s like I’m just moving through the motions, waiting for the date to come.\n\nMy whole conscious life has been abuse. I can’t get everything out of my head. I’m an adult now, I have to move on but I can’t. I’m stuck and I can’t get help. Real help! The last therapist I had was in my late teens and she said one day I would just go and kill myself. I wish I could tell her how right she is! I tried to prove her wrong and failed!\n\nI don’t know what I want from this post. Maybe just to feel like someone sees me before I disappear. Maybe to feel like I wasn’t completely alone in this. April is coming so fast and I tried but I can’t anymore.",

    "content": "Just couple months ago I(23F) and my husband (24M) decided to move in with my husbands family till we’re able to afford to buy a house. It’s just his parents, his sister and her son. Recently his sister (19F) has been using my clothes and shoes without asking. If I leave it in the living room or anywhere else that’s not our room she’ll use it. I left my jacket and a bunch of clutter from the car in the garage cause we were cleaning the cars out and I kept putting off when I’d put everything away. Next thing I know my jacket is upstairs and it’s clear she wore it cause it reeked of her perfume and her bag was on top of it, whatever not a big deal I take it to our room. But this continues to happen with a bunch of other shirts, jackets, whatever.\n\nNext instance, she broke her one pair of sandals and started using mines which I honestly didn’t mind cause I have at least 5 pairs and it was peak summer time. Next thing you know I don’t see my one pair I usually wear and I just start wearing a different one, eventually I find it in MIL car with the strap broken. My MIL doesn’t wear my stuff and his sister uses her car constantly. Clearly SIL broke it and never mentioned it to me but okay cool whatever. Then another pair go missing, okay cool she probably got hungry or something idk but whatever I can get new ones so I let it slide.\n\nIt’s now colder out now so I go out and buy some ugg tasman slippers and she starts wearing that. This is where I start to get a little annoyed cause I’d get dressed according to what shoes I’m gonna wear and when we’d head out to the garage my shoes aren’t there and she’s gone. Okay moving on. My husband bought me a pair of pandas that I rarely wear, I wore it out one time and switched to sandals so I kept the shoes in the garage next thing I know they’re upstairs and SIL had just came from somewhere. Okay now I’m definitely annoyed cause literally sandals are fine but sharing shoes is gross.\n\nAnd that brings us to today. I’ve been looking everywhere for my black leather ankle boots I last wore on Christmas and haven’t seen since. For some reason I decide to stalk her Facebook and I see a picture that she posted from 2 months ago from a trip she took to Vegas and I could see the top of her shoes and it literally looks like my boots. Same dent, same scratch. She doesn’t own any shoes like that either. I’m not confrontational so I ask my husband to ask her if she has my boots and she says she doesn’t know and that she “doesn’t wear boots”. So now I look like the crazy person and my husband thinks maybe I misplaced it. It’s literally no where else in the house or the car. He’s been aware of her taking my stuff and never says anything to her and the one time I ask him to ask her, he gives in and sides with her like she hasn’t been taking my stuff for months now. This seems so stupid and petty to get mad over cause she’s younger than me but literally just ask. She’s the youngest and grew up with all brothers so I understand the entitlement but I grew up with all sisters and it’s not hard to just ask.",

    "title": "The Weight of My Own Mistakes",
    "content": "There was once a boy who believed in love—not the fairytale kind, but the kind that made the world feel right. And for a while, he had it. A girl who stood by him, who saw the best in him even when he didn’t see it himself. She loved him with a kind of loyalty that was rare, a love that never wavered even when he gave her reasons to walk away.\n\nBut love isn’t just about feelings; it’s about choices. And one day, fear made him choose wrong.\n\nHe let go—not because he didn’t love her, but because he was afraid. Afraid of not being enough. Afraid that one day she would leave, and it would hurt too much. So instead of holding on, he let himself drift away. He convinced himself that if he stopped putting in effort, if he stopped making her a priority, then maybe, just maybe, it wouldn’t hurt when it finally ended.\n\nBut she never left. She stayed. She still believed in them, even when he had already started moving away. And then, he made a mistake he could never take back—he gave his heart to someone else before he had truly let her go.\n\nAt first, he thought he could move on. But something inside him shifted. After some time in his new relationship, he finally understood his mistakes. He realized how deeply he had hurt the one person who had truly loved him. But he never knew how to make it right. How do you fix something after breaking it beyond repair? How do you face the person you betrayed, knowing no apology will ever be enough? He wanted to go back, to do something, anything—but the guilt held him back.\n\nAnd so, he stayed.\n\nNot because he had moved on, but because he was afraid—afraid that if he left his new relationship to make things right, he would once again be the villain in his own story. The guilt consumed him, so instead of looking back, he convinced himself that staying was the only way forward.\n\nAnd in his guilt, he changed.\n\nDetermined not to make the same mistakes, he became kinder. He tried to treat the new girl right, giving her the love and care he had once failed to give. But kindness, when given to the wrong person, is easily taken for granted. And she did exactly that.\n\nShe manipulated him, gaslighted him, twisted his guilt into a weapon against him. She made him believe he was always wrong, always at fault. Every time he questioned her actions, she turned it around, making him doubt his own reality. Whenever he felt she was wrong, she made herself the victim and made him feel like he was the one to blame. Slowly, he lost himself. The person he once was—the person who understood things clearly—began to fade.\n\nAnd as you already know, he never spoke up.\n\nRegret became his shadow. Guilt, his reflection. He had apologized to the one he had hurt, over and over again, but some wounds don’t heal with words. He had hurt someone beyond repair, and now he was paying the price—not just through his own pain, but through the way he was now being treated.\n\nHe wanted to move forward, to leave it all behind, but no matter what he did, the past followed. Every quiet moment became a reminder of what he had lost. Every time he tried to love again, he feared he would be taken for granted, just as he had once done to her.\n\nMaybe this was karma. Maybe this was what he deserved. Or maybe… just maybe… he still had a choice.\n\nAs he stood at the edge of everything he had been and everything he could become, he realized something: he had no idea what came next. Would he ever forgive himself? Would he ever find peace? Or would he always be haunted by what he had done?\n\nHe didn’t know.\n\nBut for the first time in a long time, he was ready to find out.",

    "content": "This started years ago now and I’ve pretty much let it go, but I never talked about it fully with people (out of trying to not pull people into it) when it was happening so here goes. Warning-It’s long lol\n\nI met this friend through another friend, and we quickly became close. We ended up working together as well (for my parents, another area of my life I needed to have boundaries but I was 19 and thought it would be fine), would hang out after work… we called each other “twin” because we had a lot in common. We got hired for a creative project together as we were both into photography. We worked on personal creative projects together… we were together CONSTANTLY.\n\nWe were teenagers, and as teenage girls often are, we were constantly talking about different guys we were interested in, and I found out she was interested in my brother. They went on a date and my brother very quickly realized they were not compatible. This is where I can pinpoint a change in our friendship.\n\nShe stopped asking me to hang out. I would ask her to hang out and she would be busy. She would constantly hang out with our mutual friends. At the time, I thought reaching out and asking if I had done anything wrong to warrant not being invited places I had previously been invited to was the right choice, and got told “don’t worry about it, everything is good.” I was getting married at the time and had already asked her to be my maid of honor, so I assumed that maybe it was a rough patch, I was stressed, etc. (tip: don’t assume everything is fine, she’s in all my wedding photos now lol)\n\nThe REAL switch to trying to ruin my life was after I got married. I have been photographing for years, and decided to try to pursue it as a business as my parent’s business had closed. She HATED that because she did photography too, and suddenly any similarities we had were me “copying her”. I posted a story on IG about prices, she posted “the original is always better than the copy.” One of her friends (that I didn’t know was her friend at the time) modeled for me, and she posted that “people always try to undercut your business.” At one point, I posted something (I don’t even remember what it was at this point) and she posted within 5 minutes and said “Okay, she’s obviously copying me right?”\n\nNow, full transparency- I did not handle this well. I tried to talk it out with her, tried everything I knew, and she would smile to my face and tell me everything was okay and then continue to do this. I found myself looking at her posts constantly because she would never say what I had done to hurt her to my face but would post consistently, so I felt like at least I could try to piece together what had gone wrong (and also, if she felt I had been copying her, I wanted to make sure I didn’t post anything similar to her because I genuinely just wanted it to stop.) We talked a couple times, tried to make amends, but she still would post about me often.\n\nA couple years later, I did a photoshoot with another photographer modeling for me for a concept around a pregnancy loss. I have chronic health issues and so does this photographer, and I decided to center it around healing. It was a beautiful project. The DAY I posted about it, she posted a video on TikTok that said “if you want to be me just say that.” I didn’t follow her, but with her being a contact in my phone sometimes her videos would still pop up. That was it. After all the posts and all the years of just dealing with it, I was done. She had tried to isolate me from members of my husband’s family, she had deleted texts and then posted screenshots of our “conversations” and I had just turned the other cheek… but if she could somehow take a photoshoot about MY pregnancy loss and make it about her, I was done. I blocked her on everything. And then I started seeing friends of hers looking at my posts, so I blocked several of them as well.\n\nI’m 28 now and have a wonderful life with my husband and our son. I do photography part time now so I can stay home and take care of him. I have talked to her once since, and I asked her why she did all of that. She told me that it was because she had a hard time with her dynamic with my brother and my family after working for my parents. I asked her specifically what I did, and all she said was that I was “clingy and she wanted other friends”. I personally have let a lot of it go, but there’s always little reminders of it because our circles are so intertwined and tonight I feel like it’s okay to talk about to strangers on the internet because I never said anything to anyone else when it was happening except for my husband and a few friends, never did anything about it and just prayed she would stop.\n\nSo there’s that. Just a big ol’ “get it off my chest”. The biggest thing I learned from it is friends that aren’t willing to talk through it are not friends I want to have, and that sometimes you just need to block and walk.",

Ranging from people telling me I'm an awful human being for not appreciating my mom or women in general(despite this being wholly inaccurate) to people threatening to assault me because i didnt do something special for my mom on mothers day. I wanted to hear from random strangers online if my reasoning is sound and makes sense as toward why I don't celebrate them specifically as when I explain it in person, people seem to get quite upset with me regardless.\n\nI would like to note that around the holiday, not on the holiday itself all the time, just around that time period, I still put more effort and care into the relevant individuals, but I just don't like to celebrate the days themselves for the reasons listed below.\n\nMy reluctance to celebrate holidays like Father’s Day, Mother’s Day, International Women’s or Men's Day, and others that specifically celebrate a group of individuals stems from a few key personal beliefs and feelings.\n\nForced Social Expectations\n\nI often feel that these holidays create an obligation rather than a genuine expression of appreciation. Society dictates that on this specific day, I must express gratitude or admiration, even if I already do so in my own way throughout the year. It feels performative—like I’m expected to participate just because it’s a designated date, rather than acting on my feelings when they naturally arise.\n\n2. Commercialization Over Meaning\n\nThese holidays have been heavily commercialized, turning what should be a meaningful moment into an opportunity for businesses to sell cards, flowers, gifts, and expensive dinners. It feels less about genuine appreciation and more about fulfilling a marketing-driven expectation. I don’t like the idea of my relationships being tied to consumerism, where love and respect are measured by the money or effort spent on a particular day.\n\n3. Personal Connection to the Honored Group\n\nSometimes, I don’t have a personal connection that makes celebrating these holidays meaningful. For instance, if someone has a complicated relationship with their parents or lacks a strong figure that fits into the holiday’s framework, these days can feel alienating rather than celebratory. It’s a reminder of what someone might not have, rather than an opportunity to appreciate what I do.\n\n4. Selective Recognition Feels Arbitrary\n\nWhy do we elevate specific groups on designated days while overlooking the everyday contributions of others? It feels arbitrary—why celebrate fathers on one day and mothers on another when both play roles throughout the year? Why single out women for one day rather than advocating for equal treatment and appreciation daily? It seems more symbolic than substantive, and I prefer actions that carry meaning every day rather than confining appreciation to a calendar date.\n\n5. Pressure to Conform\n\nThere’s an implicit pressure to participate in these celebrations, whether it’s through social media posts, attending gatherings, or giving gifts. If I choose not to, there’s often an assumption that I don’t care or that I’m being inconsiderate. But in reality, I simply prefer to show my appreciation in my own way, at my own time, without feeling compelled by external expectations.\n\n6. Not Everyone Experiences These Days Positively\n\nFor many people, these holidays can be painful rather than joyous. Someone who has lost a parent might struggle on Mother’s or Father’s Day. Someone who has faced discrimination or hardship might not feel comfortable with the broad generalizations made on International Women’s Day, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, or International Men's Day. These celebrations assume a universal experience that doesn’t exist, and I’d rather avoid engaging in something that might inadvertently bring discomfort to others.\n\n7. Personal Values and Approach\n\nUltimately, I value sincerity over tradition. If I appreciate someone, I want to show it naturally, in a way that feels right to me, not because a calendar tells me to. I don’t need a designated day to tell my parents I appreciate them, nor do I need a specific date to recognize the struggles and achievements of any group. I’d rather express my respect, gratitude, and admiration in everyday moments, through my actions and words, rather than as part of a structured societal ritual. For these reasons, I tend to avoid participating in these kinds of holidays. It’s not out of defiance or lack of appreciation, but rather a personal preference for authenticity over obligation.",

    "title": "I'm a male escort and I have a crush on my client: Part 2? (Tiny update on my plan, and back story)",
    "content": "I just want to say thank you for all the replies. Honestly, it’s really opened my eyes. I think I was very lost in my feelings, and I truly appreciate everyone encouraging me to go for it, as well as those who reminded me to be careful and respect her boundaries. That’s really important to me. The last thing I want to do is make her feel uncomfortable or like I’ve overstepped, so I want to be very mindful of that.\n\nI also just want to say thank you for all your love and support. I'm a bit shocked. You guys are incredible people.\n\nSomeone suggested a book for me to read, and someone else suggested that I HEAL... Yes. I do think this is the crux of the matter. Thank you for that. I looked into the book and honestly, I think it's exactly my current experience.\n\nI got a lot of DMs asking for my personal experience and also, how to become a male escort. I thought I'd give a tiny update on what I plan to do, and then my story, in case people might be interested.\n\nSorry of its long and jumbled. I've only ever really spoken about some of these things with my current client.\n\nOkay so my idea: I don’t know if it’s going to work, but I think it allows me to put the idea there in a careful way. Based on how she reacts, I might then make the decision to drop her as a client because I don’t think this situation is healthy for me. Some people have pointed out that this isn’t a great way to do business as an escort, and I completely agree.\n\nHonestly, if I’m being real, I don’t think I'm a good escort anyway 😄 businesses wise.\n\nSo, here’s my plan. My birthday is later this month, and there’s a company in our area that specializes in theatrical productions. They have a live performance at a restaurant where you get dinner and a show all in one. From what she and I have talked about, this is exactly the kind of thing she values. She loves theater, singing, opera, she’s very cultured in that way. And it’s something that appeals to me, too, for my own reasons, which I’ll write in my back story, in case someone is interested.  She also knows this is something personally meaningful to me.\n\nSo, I’m going to buy two tickets, but I won’t invite her outright. Instead, I’ll reach out and jokingly reference the terms of the boyfriend experience she paid for, something like, “You know, technically part of the package is me checking in on you, and I haven’t heard from you in a while (haha)\". Depending on how she responds, I might then say something like, “I was actually given two tickets to this event, but I don’t have anyone who would really appreciate it. Would you maybe want to come with me?” She knows that’s true. I really don’t have anyone else for something like this.\n\nThe reason I thought this might be a good approach is because a lot of people pointed out that her paying puts her in control of the dynamic, which I completely agree with. But in this scenario, there’s a disconnect from that. It’s something separate... What do you think?\n\nHere's my story:\n\nI grew up in a small rural town, close to where I currently am. My home life wasn’t ideal, a bit of a mix of financial instability and neglect. I didn't finish school and by the time I was around 16, I was doing odd jobs, mainly in auto repair.\n\nI learned from the older men in town, working informally in backyard garages. I guess I figured this would be my future. Everyone in this town was kind of like that. Grew up there. Married someone who lived there. Never left... Everyone has dated everyone, kind of thing. I was never really interested in dating.\n\nThere was a girl a bit older who only showed up on weekends and during school holidays. She was visiting from somewhere bigger. She went to school in the city. We weren’t close or anything, but just knowing someone like that existed, that could... Leave the town? I don't know. I think it gave me hope or something.\n\nLater on, I got an opportunity to work as a farm laborer in the area. The farmer was an older man, past retirement age but still running around and working. He had a wife and two adult children. I was fixing fences and machinery, driving tractors, hauling feed, digging in the dirt with spades, but eventually the farmer saw, I don't know, potential? In me. He gave me more responsibilities, and a few years later, I had some kind of a foreman role.\n\nOne day, I was about to go into the farmer’s office when I overheard him and his son talking about me. I ended up eavesdropping, probably shouldn’t have, but I did. His son is more 10 years older than me, I'm not exactly how much older, and he was basically saying that me and my whole family were low class.\n\nAnd honestly? It hurt. But also because I felt like he wasn’t wrong. We were low class. But my mom was trying her best. She wasn’t around much, but that was because she was working constantly to make ends meet. And I have my own complicated feelings about her, but I also recognize that she was doing what she thought was best for us.\n\nWhat really got to me, though, was the son has had every opportunity handed to him... His family is wealthy, he can travel wherever he wants, study whatever he wants, never worry about money. And yet, he does nothing. I don’t want to sit here and judge someone else’s life, but he sleeps until 10am every day, barely does anything, then goes out drinking every night.\n\nHalf the time, he’s passed out on a couch, sometimes puking from drinking too much. And that’s the person calling me low class?Someone who’s never had to fight for anything, never had to struggle to survive?\n\nBut maybe he has his own demons he’s dealing with. Maybe this is just his way of coping. I don’t know. What I do know is that comments like that stick with me. And I do know that I’m not that guy passed out on the couch. I’m out here trying.\n\nEventually the farmer offered to pay for a GED for me. I took the opportunity and I'm so grateful for that man. I took a GED course that was offered by the university in the next town over. The \"big city\". But it was actually just a bigger town 😂\n\nIt opened my eyes. Suddenly, the world felt bigger. I had savings from working on the farm, and I wanted to go further, get a degree, but I needed a way to make some more money.\n\nThat's when I kind of considered escort work. I don't really have some dramatic story. I just Googled \"Male escort agencies near me\" 😅\n\nI was surprised by how many results popped up. At first, it was just research, out of curiosity more than anything. But found a website that seemed legit (or at least, more polished than the sketchy looking ones). I sent an email, attached a couple of photos. And then a few weeks later I got a call and I met up for coffee with two men. One was the \"manager\", the other was an escort himself. They explained the business was small, just a handful (lol) of guys. Their clients are men and women. They weren’t high-end, but they aimed for discretion and professionalism.\n\nAt first I wasn't sure. But I did like these men and the way they carried themselves. They were confident, polished, almost like businessmen who just happened to be in a very unconventional business. They made it seem... professional. I decided to just give it a go. Why not...\n\nThey provided me with a handbook of some sorts. It had information on how to conduct one self as an escort. How to negotiate with clients. Self defence... Information on drug use. How to identify and avoid STDs. Things I always need to take with me when seeing clients. How to dress yourself. Some legal aspects that might arise. Honestly it was all very helpful.\n\nMy first client was a woman in the middle of her PhD. I didn’t know what I expected... But I guess it was not was I was expecting? She was blunt, straightforward, and treated the encounter like a business transaction. There was no awkwardness, no false pretenses. It was surprisingly easy. She was my client for a long time. I saw her maybe twice a week.\n\nOver the next two or three years, the agency changed. More men joined, some left, and eventually, the guy managing it moved on to other things. The few of us who remained started working more independently but still using the agency’s reputation, but mostly managing our own profiles.\n\nThat brings me to the current situation, I guess.\n\nSome people have asked about my future plans, whether I’m thinking about a different job or what happens if things pan out with my client. So I thought I’d write something about that here.\n\nFrom the beginning, my business as an escort was always slow. It seems like the escorts who take both male and female clients get more work, but I was only comfortable working with female clients, so maybe that played a role. Either way, it was never something that fully supported me. There were times, especially over the last year and a half, when I didn’t get any work at all. It was really just a side hustle, something that sometimes worked out and sometimes didn’t.\n\nI'm trying to focus on getting my degree. I’m older than most of my classmates, of course.\n\nIn my second year, I got the opportunity to work as a pharmacy assistant. The pharmacy was close to my university, so I could walk over after class. I’m really grateful for that job because it helped me a lot financially. Then, from there, I landed an internship at a company in my field. It’s part-time, but they’re paying me to work there, and there’s an understanding that once I graduate (which, if all goes well, should be by the end of this year), they’ll offer me a full-time position.\n\nSo, escorting was something I turned to as a way to earn extra income, and for a while, it did help. But I always knew it wasn’t sustainable, and I’ve been slowly stepping away from it. In fact, before this specific client, I hadn’t taken on anyone in quite a while. I had a few once off clients here and there.\n\nSome of the comments suggested that I should let my client know that I’m quitting escorting and that if she still wants to stay in touch, we could. That’s something I’ve been thinking about too. Because the truth is, I am stepping away. The agency doesn’t really exist anymore and it’s basically just a bunch of us still lingering. But I think I’d like to make this official. It feels like the right time to close that chapter and fully focus on what’s next.\n\nAs for why this event that I want to ask her to is special to me:\n\nIt ties back to something from my childhood. When I was growing up, there was an old lady in town who played the organ at the church. My home life wasn’t great, as I've said. But to give more context, my mom was raising me, my sister, and my sister’s baby, my niece, who was unfortunately born addicted to heroin. My dad was... somewhere, but not in the picture.\n\nI had a cheap bicycle and used to ride around town a lot. One day, I rode past this lady’s house and saw that she had a dog. I don’t know why, but I just went inside her yard and started playing with her dog. I was about eight or nine at the time. She invited me in for tea and cookies. She was a retired music teacher. She actually called my mom to let her know I was there, and my mom was absolutely livid, telling me how inappropriate that was. And yeah, maybe it was. But the old lady seemed to like me.\n\nI ended up going back a few times, I guess I helped her around the house and in the garden sometimes. She was a widow and her son was living overseas. She tried to teach me how to play the piano. I never really got good at it, but it became something special to me. I sometimes go to concerts when I can, sometimes there are music concerts at my university.\n\nSo this specific even that I want to invite her to, really resonates with me. I don't know if it's the right thing or not. I guess we'll see.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you for time. I think I really needed this and I needed all of you.",

Basically, I was unable to eat, and had diarrheas (all evenings from 6pm, which is very weird, your digestive system ain't supposed to work that way) I had tests running, and nothing worked. Nor they found what I had (I had like deep tests, including bloods and cameras in my stomach). It caused a depression (or the depression caused it? Who knows?). I was belittled by my GP who was like \"you've got nothing dude you're fine, in fact you're overreacting\". (I was willing to kill myself at the time because I had no hope I'd able to have a normal life) Then, I changed my GP, she gave my antidepressants, and it went slowly better. I finally recovered after like 8 months in hell. I was able later to enjoy my life.\n\nNow, as I am about to do something thrilling in my life for a few months, symptoms are back. It's been one month. I'm unable to eat, and I want to puke like a lot (like I have no appetite at all, I have dark thoughts, eructations...) Don't know why, might be after a COVID infection I had (but like I've had 6 of them till 2020 so I don't know). Or a changing environment. I left my city. It's bad, but that time I got antidepressants quick, whereby I hope my symptoms will get better. I searched on the Internet, might be dyspexia.\n\nSi if anyone is experiencing something similar (or generally troubles with their intestines yk), you're not alone. We are a lot struggling with a society that does not understand us. I always had the feeling that, for people, when you don't have something killing you like cancer, it's no big deal you are overreacting and complaining for nothing. Cancer is terrible, worse for most of them, but our troubles count. Especially when you can't enjoy a meal, a party, or just hanging out with friends because of that.\n\nGotta wait one week for the effects of my antidepressants, we'll see. The only good thing is that it disappeared one time, so it can disappear again.\n\nBless you guys,",

    "title": "I'm Tired of Not Having Friends",
    "content": "Just here to vent.\n\nI (29m) have never had any real friends. I've always just had people that I know. Now, I'm at the point where I realize that I don't have anyone at all. I thought that I had friends at various points in my life, but they never stuck around for one reason or another. They were only \"friends\" with me out of convenience, meaning that they didn't have any of their actual friends around and buddied up to me to pass the time. Then there were those who were only \"friends\" with me to get what they wanted out of me before ghosting me or flipping out when I stopped providing what they wanted and ditched me. Those \"friends\" who wanted rides or money or favors that monopolized my time and resources to the point where trying to tell them that they were asking too much of me made them lash out. Those \"friends\" who wanted everything from me, from a listening ear to a walking atm, but who wouldn't do nearly the same thing for me. Those \"friends\" were some of the worst, but, honestly, the worst ones were those who tried to buddy up to me because they \"felt bad that I was all by myself\" because friendships built out of pity have the least amount of respect for the one being pitied.\n\nHonestly, I'm tired of it. I'm tired of feeling and being alone in crowded rooms. I'm tired of not having anyone around who cares about me and actually wants me around. I'm tired of being made to feel like it's a chore for others to talk to me. I'm tired of caring more about others than they do for me. I'm tired of being so lonely.\n\nI haven't had any real social connections in years and it's, obviously, starting to get to me. I just want to have people to talk to about random, every day crap. Or, better yet, I want to have people to have serious conversations with about the universe and life or whatever over a bonfire or in a random spot in the middle of the desert on a clear, star filled night. I want to have people who don't look at me funny when I say we should go on a random adventure to a museum that I think looks cool or some gimmicky attraction that I found that looks like it would be fun. I like gimmicks and museums and want people around who aren't going to call me weird for liking them and wanting to go experience them. I want someone to go fishing with who isn't going to say they're bored every five minutes or tell me we should just go to a bar because \"it's the same thing.\" It's not the same thing and I don't drink. I just want to have people around who take as much interest in me as I do in them without calling me or my interests weird or creepy or boring or lame.\n\nI want to go to museums and attractions with people. I want to go on random adventures to random places; maybe go randonauting or urban exploring- there's plenty of places to see. I want to go fishing with people. I want to watch football and baseball with people; maybe even go to a local game together. I want to have people who'll play basketball or badminton or Pokémon Go with me. I want to go bowling and to the arcade and to the put-put spot with people. I want to play billiards with someone who isn't going to call me creepy for loving to play it. I want to drive around aimlessly listening to true crime podcasts or creepypastas (Creepsmcpasta specifically) or just with people who'll share music with me and not call my taste in music weird or old-fashioned. I want to go have lunch in my car in the Sonic stalls with someone (don't know why, it just sounds like it'd be fun). And on that note, I want to have someone who's willing to go try new food places with me. I want to have someone to talk to about anything and everything. I want to be able to talk to someone about who's the best Robin or how Anissa is the worst character in Invincible (even worse than Immortal). I want to have someone to talk to about some random occult things that I read about or saw on the internet. I think it'd be kinda fun to pull out the Ouija board or some tarot cards or something. I want someone to share random fun facts with me as much as I like to share with them. I want to be tagged in random posts on social media or actually have someone acknowledge that we did something together or, better yet, have people who'll want to take pictures with me without telling me that I ruined the picture by smiling weird or just telling me that they don't like taking pictures with me. I want to have a barbeque by the pool in the summer; maybe throw a football around in the street. Or maybe have some random potluck and I'll make some Currywurst for people to try. I want people to teach me some of the languages that they speak or maybe want to learn one with me or I'll teach them some German.\n\nHonestly, as long as I had someone around who would share with me what I share with them, then that would be enough. Looking back on what I've already written, none of that would actually matter in comparison to just knowing that I had a friend. But, writing this all out and venting just makes me feel pathetic. It makes me feel even worse than having my family question me when I go out because I don't have friends so why am I out. That hurts on it's own, but the vibe of desperation that this seems like feels worse than that. I don't know. I've gotten this far, but it feels like none of it even matters and there's no point regardless. I'm just that person who doesn't have friends and it's just one of those things that needs to be accepted even though it hurts. It is what it is. It's really not like it matters anyway because if the rest of this year plays out how I'm expecting it to, I won't be here by this time next year anyway, so that just makes it easier, I guess. So, why not vent and ruminate for a while and see how I feel later on? Maybe things will be different and I'll feel differently. Plus, thinking about everything makes me think that I'm just better off alone regardless, but, even then, it doesn't make the pain of that loneliness go away, so at least having some type of outlet helps in it's own way. It's better than nothing and just keeping all of this bottled up at least.",

    "content": "I(MTF 19) and my girlfriend(F19) have been together for about 4 months now. I know it isn't a lot of time but I really felt something for her. She was the only person with who I could share my deepest secrets without judgement. She knew me, I didn't have to wear a mask around her and that made me comfortable. We lived 8 hours away from each other. We met every month or even more frequently. I helped her with her struggles at the beginning. She was freshly after a breakup with a guy she lived with, she was extremely emotional since they guy seemed not to have cared for her. He promised to visit her, but didn't and only like 2 months after their breakup he started relentlessly calling her. Nudging her to go to therapy etc. He even joined her friend groups discord server and that made her so emotional she quit the internet for a week and only talked to me through phone. I helped her through this period, i was always calling her and wanted to spend every minute of my time with her. First off it was good. We talked, we played games, we watched movies. She had her weird habits but i got used to them. Eventually we started arguing, a lot. I mean I really did all i could for her. She was my priority all of the time. I called off parties to want to spend time with her. I went on a 10 hour train ride just to see her and comfort her in a place she didn't really have a lot to do. But the thing is, she never really cared for me the way I did for her. I reserved time for us during new year's eve just so I could see her and she had a mood swing or something and called it off since she thought I was getting attached to quickly. We were to meet about 2 weeks ago but she called it off too since our conversations wasn't good. I am not going to lie, It was not a pleasant conversation but a honest one, nothing to get offended by. Just us talking about us in a slightly sadder tone. I get really emotional and jealous, like she was talking to her friend that he has to watch something and that she's willing to watch the entirety of it with him. I just thought, well, why doesn't she want to watch things with me? Why does she want to visit him, not me? I was her girlfried at the end of the day and that guy called everything she recommended \"crappy\". It's like I gave her all this attention and she didn't even care enough to visit me. This morning she wrote me an ominious message \"Would you still want to be around me if I had kissed someone else in the past month\", I replied that if she would give someone a kiss on a cheek or something, which is kind of normal in my part of the world, I'd be okay with it but if it was romantic, something that could be classified as cheating I would leave. She then said that it is going to happen and that she would have done it a long time ago if it hadn't been for that that she doesn't go out much and is pretty asocial. I mean that kind of broke me. I never had any meaningful relationship, I was always hiding a part of myself and when a person that accepted me came along they stab me in the back in such a heinous manner. I already got cheated on once. I know how it ends, there is no redemption, no coming back to what once was. I really loved her, gave her everything I could but that still wasn't enough.",

But when you're me, that can lead to some serious problems. Showing up to the hospital with a severe nosebleed, two puffy, black eyes and a bump on my forehead that puts comic books to shame, I absolutely understand they're worried. And especially when the explanation is \"I walked into a door\".\n\nHere's the thing though: I ACTUALLY WALKED INTO A DOOR!!! Not only that, I was wearing crocs. And yes, I know: ewww crocs! But my mum bought them for me and they're really practical when I just need to put some shoes on to run to the mailbox.\n\nIn case you're unfamiliar with crocs, they're like bouncy rubber balls when you wear them and hit your foot on, let's say, a door! So here I am, in a bit of a rush, shoving my feet into said crocs and then attempting to run out the door. Only, I somehow misjudged the distance to or the size of the door? Maybe? Whatever the reason, when I pulled the door open while simultaneously rushing at it, my foot hit the corner of the door. So the door stopped instantly, but my body didn't, resulting in my face smacking straight into the side edge of the door. Impact no 1. As if that wasn't bad enough, my leading foot was between the door and doorframe, so when the door bounced off my back croc, it hit my front croc, bounced back and smacked me in the face again. Impact no 2. It then bounced into the front croc, and back again. Impact no 3. I'm pretty sure that's when my nose got squished. I'm not sure how many more times it happened, but it sounded like a machingun was going off! I was so disoriented, seeing double, blood flooding out of my nose, my eyes rapidly swelling shut, and it felt like my forehead was splitting down the middle.\n\nSo yeah, I don't blame the hospital for thinking my \"I walked into a door\" was a lie...",

You’re probably wondering why I’m still with them. I don’t really know, I’m starting to hate them and I’m starting to feel deep resentment towards them. I honestly thought we were going to get married and have kids and idk why I thought that when they have fought me at every step. I’ve realized I wouldn’t want to have kids with them as I wouldn’t want them exposed to my partners bouts of explosive anger. I wouldn’t want them thinking the way I’m treated is acceptable and I wouldn’t want them thinking that not wanting to be a better person is okay. I say all that but I am deeply in love with them, I don’t really know what to do because leaving is hard for me and for them but I can tell at this point that’s what’s needed. They are very clear with their actions in showing me they don’t care for me the way I care for them and my self esteem is shot to hell. Sometimes I envy they’re ability to treat me poorly and still feel like they’re a good person, but then I remember there’s a reason every person they’ve ever been with has left, and I need to follow suit because everyday I fall deeper into the cycle of nonsense and bullshit. I love them deeply, like I’ve never loved before but maybe that’s bc we’re addicted to each other’s toxicity. I want to be with someone who shows me through action they want me and love me and all they’re capable of is pretty words, they lie over and over and promise things they can’t give.. I want to leave I promise I know I need to for my mental health and for theirs, I just don’t know how…I just wanted to get it off my chest. I’m having a really hard time coming to terms with this relationship failing for some reason and I’d honestly do anything to go back in time and figure out how to make it work but I can’t so this is just how it has to be ig.",

    "title": "Influencer Marketing Agencies Are a Scam – I Worked for 3 of the Biggest Ones",
    "content": "I worked at three of the biggest influencer marketing agencies over the last decade, and now that I don't, it's finally safe for me to speak the truth without risk to my career - I need to expose that whole industry as a scam and no one is talking about it..\n\n\"Influencer Marketting\" agencies make almost all their money NOT from sponsorships but from influencers paying them monthly fees to FIND them sponsorships that never happen. I was shocked each time I got a new job at a new \"influencer marketing agency\" to discover they all work the same way- colleagues who mentioned it were fired or made redundant. It's kind of like a pyramid scheme... Out of thousands of influencers paying monthly \"subscription fees\", almost no sponsorships actually happened in the years I was there. All of our workload was dedicated to finding more influencers to sign up rather than sponsorship companies.\n\nThink about it- why would we need sign ups in the first place if we can find sponsors? We'd obviously take a cut of sponsorship as that would make more money- right??!! What's going on is dishonest & takin advantage of the poor.\n\nMost people think that a large following of 500K+ followers, makes that person wealthy. The reality is that 99% of people with 500k followers on insta and tiktok (and in many cases, youtube shorts), make nothing. I’ve worked with influencers sleeping in cars, couch-surfing, living below the poverty line for years, incredulous to the fact they aren't making anything, while my colleagues persuaded them to continue building a following and that sponsors were \"just around the corner\". We would be told to persuade these people to by dangling carrots like this. Many of them worked 20 hours a day to build a following- often from uplifting or positive content- and weren't narcissists- it is not a pleasant life, and I knew of so many like this.\n\nI don't like how the industry is taking advantage of these people. Websites like SocialBlade are hilarious - the number of times I've seen them claim people are making $500K+ per year but in reality, they're earning nothing... It happens all the time.\n\nThe key is that most audiences aren't monetisable no matter how big they are, and the ones that ARE monetisable (e.g. \"technical\" topics), are nigh on impossible to persuade sponsors to bite because they're all so stuck in the past (they think of social media as something \"free\" and will only pay to advertise on TV or via traditional routes).\n\nTo make things worse, 99% of companies reaching out just want free advertising. They offer “exposure” or a cheap free product and refuse to pay. They all think that someone with a large social media following is a philanthropist millionaire, or can eat \"free products\", didn't work full time to build that following, and doesn't need income.\n\nMeanwhile, marketing agencies exploit this situation by selling influencers false hope and taking their money with no return. It has to be biggest public perception vs. reality mismatch I’ve ever seen.. on such a grand scale.\n\nNo one is talking about this. Agencies won't talk about it because their income comes from maintaining the lie. Influencers themselves won't talk about it as they fear it might destroy their chances of getting a sponsor in future (which is never going to happen!!). So I had to get this off my chest, now that I don't work for them anymore. I'm frankly amazed these \"companies\" haven't been shut down.\n\nI'm sorry but I can't name myself or the companies for obvious reasons, but they're all the same (afaik), and I can't give examples of specific social media accounts for similar reasons unfortunately. Therefore, you don't have to believe me on this, but I speak the truth & just happy to get this off my chest.\n\nMy advice to you if you're unable to find sponsors for social media following:- Don't waste any more time on it. Views can't pay your bills. Don't waste your life..- Don't trust any social media \"marketting agency\" that requires a monthly subscription fee from you (if they are genuine, they'll operate on a percentage of sponsorship deals that they obtain for you - NOT a monthly fee from you)- Don't trust when anyone tells you \"you're just marketting wrong- it's impossible to have no income on 500k followers\" - they don't know what they're talking about unfortunately. Most influencers even in the 500k braket make NOTHING, but none will admit it for fear of it sabotaging their future chances.- Spend your time re-skilling to do something else that will make a living, don't fall for this scam.- Even monetisable accounts with monetizable topics are VERY HARD to get sponsors for, that's why so many don't have a sponsor for years.- Don't fall for the \"if I get a big following I will automatically find ways to make an income\" trap\n\nThere. Off my chest!",

I will be honest I partially took a term off so I could focus on moving out because I find this more important at this point in my life. I do not think I can be open about it since the city seems “unrealistic” in his eyes.

I'll probably delete this at some point after.\n\nI'm 27M and I'm a \"rent man\". Another term for what I do, is \"male escort\". But I live in a small, sleepy town, and we just don't call ourselves escorts.\n\nI decided to get into this because I needed some money to help me finish my degree. I'm also in good shape so I thought it would be an easy side hustle. I didn't/ don't have a partner and I haven't been interested in dating.\n\nBusiness is generally very slow. When I first started, I only had 1 client who I would visit every week. After that, she moved away and I had two more clients that I would see periodically. It was always a very clinical and mechanical experience (Get in, do what needs to be done, get out).\n\nThings were quiet for about a year and a half. I wasn't really providing services anymore. But a few months ago, I got a message on my profile from a lady who was interested in my services. She was just reaching out, asking how it works.\n\nWe spoke for a bit and we decided to meet up. My services are customisable and she selected a variation of the \"boyfriend experience\".\n\nI went to her house and I was... Surprised? She had a really nice place. In a rich neighbourhood. I'm sure this might not be out of the ordinary for other male escorts but my previous clients weren't situated in rich neighbourhoods. I didn't grow up rich.\n\nShe was very welcoming. She was a few years older than me. She seemed to have a successful career. We sat in the living room and just talked. She told me that she's had sex for her whole adult life, and she's enjoyed it for the most part. But she's had some kind of sexual awakening recently and she's looking for someone to explore this with. She said she doesn't even care if we didn't have sex that night. She wanted to talk to make sure that we would be a good fit for what she had in mind, and if I was okay with it. That was also a first for me. My previous clients didn't really care what I was okay with.\n\nAnyway. Lots has happened since then. I see her maybe once every two weeks. And it's always an incredible experience. I can't explain it. Sometimes we have sex. Sometimes we dont. Sometimes we eat pizza and watch movies, sometimes we drink and have sex. It's so passionate. Sometimes it's primal. Sometimes it's lazy and intense. It's not the mechanical sex that I'm used to. She truly turns me on. She likes it when I'm satisfied.\n\nSometimes we just talk and nothing else. I've opened up to her about my life. She pays me every time. I've even started insisting that she doesn't need to. But she believes in me and my future and wants to support me in finishing my degree.\n\nThe problem is, I no longer see this as a professional relationship. I really like her. And she seems to really care about me, as a person.  We know so much about each other but I feel so weird to say that we're friends... She pays me for my time so are we really friends?\n\nAnd sometimes I let my mind wander... What if we were more?\n\nShe's quite an incredible woman. And we've had many deep conversations. She's been through a lot.\n\nOne of the topics that came up was her previous relationships. Because I was wondering why she would approach a service, instead of exploring this with perhaps, a romantic partner? And I guess, long story short, she was in a relationship with a man who absolutely destroyed her. She no longer trusts people enough to share her life with.\n\nShe wants to be alone. Forever. But she desperately wants to explore her sexual side. I guess that's where I come in.\n\nBy the way. I know who this man is. It's a small town. F*ck you for what you did. You had such a great woman. What's wrong with you?\n\nI haven't heard from her in a while. And I desperately want to reach out to her. I'm trying not to lose myself in this situation. I keep telling myself, she's just my client and nothing more. This is just me doing my job. But I know that I feel a certain way. Unfortunately, I don't think she'll ever see me as anything more.",

However what I found has hurt me and hit my confidence in myself and my relationship.\n\nI know that some girls have felt it too, that little nagging feeling that something is wrong. When I looked, I went straight for the girl best friend. And that is exactly where I found messages between them, Sexting.\n\nIt was about a year ago at this point that these messages were sent, however, they were saved in chat. He is still best friends with this girl and did not tell me about this because he said that he didn’t wanna lose her.\n\nTo give a little context, I have been cheated on with the girl best friend before, twice. So this immediately raised some red flags for me. To top it off too, recently the amount of times we are intimate has severely decreased(once a week or sometimes less)\n\nI cried for a bit, and then I woke him up to talk to him about it. He apologized, and I was very mature and tried not to let my jealousy show. I told him it’s OK that he is still friends with her. I just wish she had told me.\n\nHowever, a couple days later here we are, I can’t stop thinking about it, and how she’s everything I’m not. She’s skinny with blonde hair, he sexted with her and never does with me, and he seemed to be way more attracted to her than me. I can’t help but overthink and be jealous.\n\nEdit:\n\nthank you for all of the advice. I talked to my boyfriend and we have started to work it out, and set some boundaries so we can move forward. I am a firm believer of not having friends of the opposite sex but I also would never want to make him choose between us.

We have some growing to do of course, we’re young and new to this relationship, but we want to work it out together.\n\nTo clear some things up, no he did not cheat, just saying I have experience that issue with girl best friends in the past, and saying that I invaded is privacy is wrong. He put my face in him phone and told me I can look through it if I needed to. Yes, I’m crazy jealous, yeah I have some self doubt, but I was just venting about something that was bothering me, so then I could put words to paper and evaluate how I wanted to go about handling this.\n\nJust want to remind some people that everyone is different, along with their relationships. I hope you have the day you deserve <3",

I tried to show you love and you didn’t want it. There’s only so much I can do before I can’t anymore.\n\nYou say you miss me. But you never talked to me. You hid all your feelings from me. We’d go to therapy and it felt like an attack on everything I did. It felt like anything and everything I did was wrong.\n\nI was always the one in the wrong.\n\nBut what about the things you did that hurt me?\n\nYeah I’m good at compartmentalizing. I’m good at bottling up my feelings to make others comfortable. It didn’t feel like you cared that I was doing it since it gave more room for you to talk about how you were feeling.\n\nI gave so much of myself to you.\n\nDid you really love me?\n\nOr did you just love the idea of me?\n\nSomeone to listen to you and ask how your days were and what? Why didn’t you do that for me? I wore myself out trying to make you happy. Happy with me. Happy with you. Happy with literally anything. I couldn’t do it.\n\nI miss the days that we could sit and talk for hours. I miss the days that you would smile when you saw me. I miss the days that felt like you truly loved me. I miss the days that we were actually friends.\n\nBut maybe it wasn’t real. Maybe it was the attention I gave you? Or the gifts? Or maybe I was a distraction? Something shiny and new. Uncharted territory. I don’t know.\n\nI don’t know what you’re telling people. That I broke it off? That I did this and that and whatnot? You blocked me so it’s not like I can try to support you. Not that you were accepting of my support over the last year plus. I really tried. And it felt like you just didn’t care.\n\nI shouldn’t have looked you up on here. I noticed you blocked me days ago. You didn’t tell me where you were moving-not that it’s my business, but it really sucks being completely blocked out by someone who is saying they love me.\n\nLoved me.\n\nMy heart hurts. And I can’t even talk to my best friend about it.\n\nYou wanna know why I’ve been talking to her? Because my world revolved around you. I stopped talking to my friends. All of my friends. Because you were my world. But I was just a bother to you. An annoyance. A burden.\n\nI needed someone to talk to and she messaged me. She wasn’t a bad person so I don’t know where you got that from. If anything, I was the bad person in that situation. I let you be mean to her. I let you do what you wanted because I thought you were my forever. But you didn’t think I was your forever. You don’t treat your forever the way you treated me. How are you so okay with just disappearing on me?\n\nI truly hope you can find happiness. I wasn’t the one for you and that’s okay. I hope you can show love to the next person you find. Not as a rarity, but strong and unwavering. Love them with everything you have, because you deserve love and to love.\n\nI just wasn’t enough.\n\nI wasn’t ever going to be enough.\n\nI just wish you’d have told me sooner.",

    "content": "For some context, my boyfriend (23m) and I (24f) have been in a relationship. He was after me for 1 year, dated for 1 year, broke up, and have been dating for 6 months now. I have an autoimmune disease that is mostly affected by my mental health, and can create severe illnesses and damages to my body. Since I’ve been dating him I´ve been noticing my health getting worse and worse. To add more to the story, I found out he was attracted to his work-colleague and made some sort of move, check my other post to figure out some more about this (if interested, but it will add more to the story and will help you gain a better understanding). Plus, my boyfriend since the start of our relationship has told me how he’s a man who doesn’t watch corn, and has been flexing it to his guy friends and all.\n\nSo, my boyfriend has been recently saying non-stop how he’s open for me to check his phone, he has actually said it so much it was beginning to be suspicious. I had been noticing him becoming more irritated with me by the second without me doing nothing, and I asked him. I told him that I knew there was something he was hiding that was making him so anxious with me all the time, that's when I began suspecting, and he denied all of my comments, saying it was because he’s been so busy with work.\n\nAfter some days, he started saying it again, telling me that I could check his phone whenever I didn’t trust him. He was always used to me saying no, since I was keen on not doing so since I felt like doing that. There must be a lack of trust in a relationship and that’s how they fall apart. So, he didn’t expect me to say yes this time. I did due to all my suspicions at the moment. He watched me, and didn’t dare say a word. I gave him some time to be honest with me before looking through his phone and he reassured me there was nothing. I went to his recently watched in tiktok, and I found gems there. He watched these typical girls with boobs bigger than their heads move their butts and boobs sensually. Then, there were many replays of this girl we both knew he talked to before ever getting with me. He didn’t say anything and denied ever doing anything with her videos, only getting hard and then looking for other stuff to jerk off, which I think is a complete lie, but still.\n\nNot only did he break promises by telling and promising me that he didn’t watch corn or other girls, but also lied to me about it until I figured it out. He was never honest and I believe that he still is hiding things from me just because I didn’t figure them out yet. It was already bad that he did this, but worse when it was his ex situationship.\n\nI need some help and opinions to clear my mind, I don’t know if I’m crazy or being rational. I would appreciate other people’s experiences dealing with wrong people and then finding a good person for you. I need to believe that this is not the love I deserve and that there’s many guys out there that won’t do this to me.",

    "content": "I’m frustrated with how ASD dominates the majority of neurodivergent discourse. I get it. I really do. ASD is very misunderstood and it very often coexists with other ND types.\n\nBuuuuuut… it feels like everyone only talks about or thinks about ASD. Heck, even terminology seems ASD specific.\n\nSometimes I just want to find something about ADHD, and I get told it’s an ASD symptom that can be present in others. Erm, no. It’s an ADHD struggle too, based on self reports from those with a diagnosis.\n\nWhy are most ND struggles seen through the lens of ASD so much?\n\nI’m struggling to verbalise my thoughts and I’m hoping someone gets what I’m saying.\n\nWe need space for just ADHD, just dyslexia, just OCD. Co-morbidities are co-morbidities. Not the core of disorders.\n\nI’m sick of being told that something I deal with is “ actually an autism thing,” and I just happen to experience that just by chance. No. I’m not autistic. My struggles are not autistic traits. They are ADHD traits. We’d know that if we stopped calling every trait in an ND person an autistic trait.\n\nI’m sick of my symptoms being seen as an afterthought -  a fringe case of ASD symptoms.\n\nAcknowledge my disorder for what it is. I’m tired of being an “oh, by the way” addition haphazardly tacked onto an ASD discussion.\n\nYes, it is ok to acknowledge that some things are ASD specific that I happen to do by chance. No, not every ND trait is autism specific. My sensory issues are not ASD traits, they are ADHD traits. Stop telling me “it’s okay to acknowledge that some things are ASD traits that others experience.” What are you implying?\n\nAnd I’m definitely not arguing “everyone is a little ASD.” That’s stupid, and if you manage to get that out of my rant, I can’t help you.\n\nI’m saying, validate my struggles as they are. Not because they overlap with ASD.\n\nWhat’s funny is my friend who says this doesn’t pick up on the fact that it hurts me when they say these things.",

Depression has been a constant in my life, and I’m pretty sure there’s something seriously wrong with me mentally. I’ve never sought professional help never in my life. Instead, I’ve coped by abusing drugs like MDMA, LSD, and and ket, weed every single day since I was 14. It’s been my crutch, but it’s not working anymore. I’ve never had a real girlfriend, though that’s not even my main issue. The real problem is I can’t stay consistent with anything working out, holding a job, nothing. Today, I was supposed to get up and go to work, but I just couldn’t be bothered. I bailed. It feels like my brain is fighting against me. I’m suicidal 24/7. When I hit these lows, they last about three months, then I get a month of “normal” before it crashes again. Right now, I’m in one of those dark phases, and it’s so bad I’m genuinely debating whether to end my life today. I don’t know what to do anymore. My body’s a mess too I go from fat to skinny and fat to skinny again, stuck in this weird in between because of how depression screws with me. I’ve felt like this my whole life, and I’m terrified it’ll never change. I’m getting older, life’s getting more harder and serious, and everything’s so damn expensive. I have no ambitions, no goals. I never went to school. I blow all my money, I’m in debt, and I live alone. I feel like a corrupt soul. I say I believe in God, but I don’t really. I’m a fake religious person, a fake human. My friends are starting to ditch me because of how I am, and I don’t blame them. I’ve had enough. I feel like death is the only way out of this hell because I can’t imagine dragging this on until I’m 28, 35, or older. It’s already unbearable. My mom’s tried to help me so many times, but she’s given up too. I always end up back at square one, no matter what. I hate myself so much. I guess I’m posting this because I’m desperate.

Which means I’ve never gotten to take a woman out for dinner or coffee. Here’s the kicker tho, every time I tell someone that I’ve never been on a date, I get a variation of “no way” or “you’re lying” or “how?”.\n\nGetting these types of reactions means that I am good looking to an extent I guess, but it hasn’t translated to any dates. I will admit tho, I am a late bloomer, I was bullied mercilessly as a child, was fat then skinny and now I’m in the middle which is nice.\n\nI know I need to put myself out there more but every time I do so I get burned rather quickly, in spectacular fashion I may add. I’m also afraid of rejection which doesn’t help. My luck isn’t the best either, and considering how unavailable people in my city are, I guess it makes sense. I just feel so far behind my peers, I feel weird.\n\nI get everyone has their own timeline but at the same time, when most people your age are in committed relationships or going out on dates, it’s hard not to feel unloved/unwanted in addition to feeling like you’re behind.\n\nI also wonder if I should ever tell a woman this when (not if) the day comes? Will she be turned off? Will she be weirded out and think to herself “what’s wrong with this guy? How has he never been on a date?”\n\nThank you for reading and take care.",

    "content": "Ok, I know the tag is bad but let me clear stuff up right off the bat. I didn't try to kill myself, nobody in my family did, and nobody in this story succeeds in doing so. With that said, it's still disturbing.\n\nI go to a high school that is located right next to a PreK-8 school. My mom works there and teaches PreK4, while my brother attends as a 7th grader. Yesterday, my mom and brother told me of something that happened. Basically, a kid in my brother's grade tried to kill himself in the bathroom using his belt (part of the uniform) and was at it for several minutes before a friend of the kid went looking for him. To make a long story short, it was a whole 2 hours afterward that the police were called and something was done about it.\n\nNow this alone is devastating and disturbed my mom, but what made me call my post this was this detail of the story.\n\nThe kid tried this around 11 am. The administration was only made aware at 1 pm. The kids knew this and said nothing. Now you may think that it's because he's a bully or disliked, but he was a smart kid who played football at his school and was generally well-liked. The chilling part was that most kids were just indifferent to the whole thing. They felt bad, but nobody was particularly emotional. My brother said that everybody was silent but only a few who he knew feared death. The kid who went to check on the victim got texts from the victim with suicidal thoughts, and he said nothing at first. And that's why I named this post what I did.\n\nMy mom is one of those people who believes that suicide is cowardly and that there are always options for those who feel that way, but hearing how a group of kids witnessed one of their try that and then everyone not go talk to grown-ups was shocking for her. Even worse, since they have, the school has not made anything public yet about this incident and probably is just going to sweep it under the rug. Now I might have exaggerated the title a bit, my mom is a very resilient woman. But I fear that the way this story played out will affect her for a long time.\n\nAlso normally I would talk to friends and people in school about this, but the victim's older sister attends and probably doesn't want anybody to know, so I ranted here.",

Sorry!\n\nI (25f) always have disputes with my (59f) mother.\n\nWhenever I don't do something the same as she wants, she gets pretty acidic and even if I do it the same way as she wants, she somehow always has something to complain about.\n\nExample of today:\n\nBecause of the beautiful weather, I should hang my duvet out of my window, but the problem is that the winter garden roof is right in front of my window and I can't hang it out because it is a more or less flat level. So I decided to hang the blanket over the edge of the winter garden roof, mind you at one point that was quite clean (in my opinion) at least)\n\nAnd if I had hung the blanket directly out of the window, she would have been dirty or even dirty anyway.\n\nI also had planned (and also discussed with my mother) that I would wash the blanket this weekend anyway.\n\nNevertheless, she then sniffed me about half an hour later and she also found it very shit that I sucked at the same time as I was sucking.\n\nWe have a solar system that produces a very nice amount of electricity in very sunny weather and I thought that it would already be finished with sucking because I hadn't heard her vacuum cleaner anymore and then started sucking my room.\n\nHowever, she still has a problem with it because she apparently continued to suck again after a moment (which I couldn't hear because of my loud sucker) and also ran the washing machine (which I didn't know anything about because I couldn't see or hear her from my room on the first floor and that I was not explicitly told that it would be hired)\n\nIn addition, she also complained because I took a break when sucking (I have a cold and don't have enough endurance to create everything at once)\n\n(My room consists of two adjacent rooms of which I usually only do one because I am more in this, but this time I wanted to do both and only took a break in between)\n\nAfter I had explained Mama that, she told me that I always had an excuse.\n\nI then started crying (no idea why, sometimes happens during such confrontations) and Mama asked in a rather aggressive tone why I would cry now even though there is no reason for it and that we would only have a reasonable discussion.\n\n(Incidentally, the howling is nothing that I have an influence, I don't because it is to cry afterwards or something, I have zero control about whether or when this happens)\n\nIn the surplus, she also titled such moments as \"psycho shit\" and attempted manipulation.\n\n(Not today, but in other similar situation)\n\nIncidentally, she mostly teemers my attempts to explain and or counter arguments or ignores them entirely.\n\nI often have the feeling of being shouted at in these moments, even though she only \"talks to me very quietly\" (her words)\n\nI don't even want to do something in the household anymore because it is almost always wrong or not right.\n\nAnd almost every interaction with her consists that she tells me something what to do, or indicate that something is wrong/dirty or somehow not correct.\n\nThat would be okay, but everything is just too much, I don't want to come down to her or talk to her.\n\nWhen I come home and your car is not there, I'm already relieved.\n\nIs probably not your fault, I'm probably just over -sensitive or overreact or something.\n\nAlso, i haven't stopped crying the whole time while writing/translating this and my mom came in and asked me in a really passive aggressive tone what was up and why i am still crying.

    "title": "The cp case against my ex husband has been closed and I don’t know how to feel about it",
    "content": "In the beginning of the year, my (27f) ex husband (27m) came to me after not talking for a year since the divorce finalized, to confess to me of having sexual fantasies about children and looking at cp while we were together. I took this information to the police and have been working with an investigator since then, and made a controlled call to him with the investigator where he confessed only to looking at animated cp because “the real stuff is really hard to find”. Today I was told that they spoke with him and looked at his devices and haven’t found any evidence and are closing the case. And it’s a relief that, to the best of my knowledge, he didn’t hurt any children or consume any content that hurt actual children. But I was also warming up to the idea that he would face some kind of consequences for his actions. Because he also emotionally manipulated and raped me throughout our entire marriage. I know that I could still try to press charges for what he did to me, but I don’t really have any proof except for my own words. And I want to be able to just move on and enjoy my life now that I’m free from him. But he has a new girlfriend who is significantly younger and reminds me of me when I was young and fell for his bullshit. It feels so wrong that he can just do all of this and put me through so much and have nothing happen.\n\nI hope he’s telling the truth about getting help and wanting to change, but I also can’t help but believe that every word that comes out of his mouth is a lie, even when he believes it’s the truth. But I’ve done what I can, it can’t be my responsibility anymore.",

    "content": "Hi everyone, does anyone resonate or seems familiar to this? ( It's and italian text, so sorry in advance)\n\nUna quercia centenaria, che persiste passivamente al tempo, sostenuta dal gentil suolo che l'accoglie, offre sempre il suo supporto ad un uomo mediocre che sempre ha cercato la pace all'interno di una vita in cui è facile entrare e pressoché impossibile uscire, cullato dal gentil dire delle moire, senza mostrare obiezione. La quercia offre segretamente conforto ai suoi numerosi coinquilini che la abitano ed ignora coloro che le crescono affianco e che cercano di non interferire con la sua quiete.\n\nLe radici che prima estraevano solo preoccupazioni dai propri simili ora ricavano solo nettare puro e paradisiaco, ricco dei più naturali ed immediati piaceri: la pace del canto degli uccelli, la tranquillità di un bosco che come unica imposizione segue le stagioni con le bellezze che ognuna di essa gli porta, il rintocco lontano di una campana di qualche paese vicino. Le preoccupazioni inutili lasciano spazio solo a presa di coscienza ed accettazione.\n\nGuardare al bosco e avere nostalgia di paesaggi passati che solo la quercia ha avuto capacità di comprendere. Voltare le spalle alla città che invece di nutrirsi di ricordi campagnoli e pensieri ciclici, senza neccessità di crearne frettolosamente di nuovi, si alimenta con la scomodità ed il rumore del futuro obbligo non naturale, non favorendo una vita vissuta unicamente sul filare dei pensieri e l'evoluzione dell'umore.\n\nVivere senza un'obbiettivo od un peso sulle spalle, vivere essendo nessuno, vivere solo di artifici umani e fenomeni naturali, solo la salute conta, null'altro, tutto ciò di cui ho sempre vissuto e tutto ciò che ho conosciuto: natura, relax, ricordi, solitudine ed isolamento. Così come fa la stessa quercia che ho sempre ammirato, vivrò questa vita spoglia e silenziosa, senza più incappare in tumulti di pianto ed ansia paralizzante, accettando il vento che tra gli spazzi vuoti ed isolati soffia e che ricorda all'animo la dimenticata arte dell'accettare ciò che razionalmente odiamo ma che inconsciamente amiamo, la pigrizia. L'esistenza terrena è di per sé mortale, quindi perchè rincorrere la fatica e l'ansia quando si può semplicemente accettare l'inerzia?",

    "title": "I feel such deep gratitude towards someone and can’t share it",
    "content": "When I was 17(F), I met someone. A woman. Online. I never met her in real life, even years later. We only spoke on the phone once for an hour (years later). It was basically a purely texting relationship.\n\nIt was a blogging site, one of those where you just wrote an online diary, basically. We hit it off as conversation partners, but it wasn’t more than that for around a year. We didn’t even talk that often, but when we did it was magical. She was much older than me, and I knew it from the beginning. She was 31 when we met. It was weird for me to talk to someone older, but it just worked, and I didn’t think about it much, so I rolled with it. We talked almost exclusively about a shared hobby.\n\nA year later I was having a complete breakdown. It was my first major mental health breakdown. I think I was just lost in transitioning from school life to college life. I suffered alone for a year (I didn’t really have a support system), and after that, I decided to open up about it in my online diary. I didn’t know what I expected, if I expected anyone to care. But she suddenly supported me. She talked to me a lot. She said she had been through the same things, so she understood what I was feeling. And that’s how it started: she explained to me A LOT about how mental health works. When I was a teenager, I didn’t “believe in mental health”. Till it bit me in the ass: I mean, I had this major breakdown, and suddenly, my “nonexistent” mental health incapacitated me. I had severe fatigue, panic attacks, even diarrhea. So, the woman basically taught me some basic concepts, explained some basic things to me. I started to read up on therapy, psychology, we’d discuss issues.\n\nIt was also magical: she just got me. I’d never had the privilege of having anyone in my life who understood me, gave me a manual to myself. I internalized my family’s approach of ‘you’re just a lost cause hysterical little shit, and there’s nothing left to do with you but ignore you when you get difficult’. And with her, I suddenly understood that I wasn’t hysterical. That my feelings had a cause. That I could actually fulfill my needs, and there would be no breakdown. So, she taught me how to relate to myself in a healthier way, how to be on my side, always. And the best part? She never actually lectured me on anything, never made me do anything, never got mad at me for not trying anything. And she was always respectful to me despite the age difference. She never played the ‘I’m older and I know better’ card, even though she was definitely older and knew better. She just explained how things work (for her, and how she thought it worked for me, too because we’re so similar), and I could take it or leave it. She just treated me the way that I understood how to treat myself. Like, she’d do or tell me things that’d calm me down, or help me get out of despair, or a panic attack, and I made a mental note ‘oh, that’s what I need when I’m having a panic attack. Yes, this works for me when I’m overwhelmed. Ok, that’s what I’ll ask for when I need support next time’.\n\nI think I was going through this very major and life-changing breakdown for about a year. My health was never the same after that (still isn’t, 13 years later), but I was slowly learning to live with this new version of myself. I felt more stable, but I still needed a lot of support. And she was there. I don’t think I’d be alive or (relatively) sane right now if it wasn’t for her during that first year, if it wasn’t for her guidance and gentleness. I really had no one, especially no one who understood me like she did. She’s the one who made me try therapy. Not by talking about it (she never went to therapy herself), but a couple of months after we started talking about my mental health, I was reading some posts about therapy, and understood that what I felt with her, I could find in therapy. And I got really interested in it: with her, I couldn’t ask for more or for a more stable presence. With a therapist, I could get that presence for an hour a week on a regular basis. Well, I never found that therapist with whom I had this magic. Never found anyone even remotely not hurtful, actually (I have a bad trauma from therapy by now, tried 20 therapists). The woman was really the only person in the world who got me to relax and listen to her without fighting and rejecting right away. Others would just trigger me hard, trigger a defensive response and then hurt me when I couldn’t accept what they were saying, even though I was fighting myself hard not to push them away. With her, it felt like she was going through the minefield of my psyche, knowing exactly where to go and where not to go and how to neutralize at least some of the mines without setting an explosion off. And the most awesome effect was that the neutralization usually had ripple effect: she’d make one small thing feel slightly better, and I could feel the chain reaction of things correcting themselves months later, things that were unrelated to the first conversation.\n\nIt went on for years. I mean, she wasn’t my therapist, but… We talked about our lives, hobbies, mental health. It was always the older-younger dynamics, but not in a bad patronizing way: she’d just explain things, but she never pushed. She never said that because I’m younger I don’t get to have a different opinion. Never laughed at me. Never tried to make me respect her. She didn’t need to: I’ve never respected anyone like this in my life. She doesn’t have a conventional successful life: never married, never moved out of her family’s apartment, she didn’t even work most of her thirties (for reasons I didn’t fully understand but never pushed her to share). But I respected her more than anyone who had all those. She was very smart, driven, understood things deeply, always treated people with respect, everyone, she had this quality of attracting people to her, like, she didn’t wait for anyone to start talking to her (like I did), if she saw someone she found interesting, she’d just initiate. And she treated vulnerability with care. Doesn’t matter what happened between us, doesn’t matter if I hurt her (unintentionally. I’d never do anything bad to her intentionally), doesn’t matter what was happening — she never used any one of my open wounds, never chose to set any of the mines just to hurt me back. And she could do it at any moment. She spoke my language, she knew how to put things exactly in a way that her words would have the most effect, so she could destroy me. She never ever even tried in all those years. Not even when the relationship went sour and she was annoyed with me for years. She’d snap at the small things (once she started aggressively attacking me in a discussion about Harry Potter… Not me—my thought process. That’s when I knew it wasn’t just a rough patch but truly over), but she never went for my traumas. Not even when she didn’t enjoy me anymore.\n\nAs I said, the way she treated me had a ripple effect, fixing things without her even trying. Through the years, the way she treated me, talked to me, I developed that inner compass as I call it: basically, this feeling that in my life, I’m the one who always knows best. Even if I make mistakes, I’m still the one who knows best, and I’ll course correct if I make a mistake. I don’t mean that I feel that I’m always right about everything — just in my life, in things that concern me. It was very different from what my family told me: you’re incapable of anything, you should listen to us, you don’t have a brain. That inner compass made me finally start living my life. Not what my family thought was best — what I felt like doing. And the most beautiful part of it was that these things were not what the woman wanted either. They were truly mine. I moved to another country — something I always wanted. She clearly couldn’t understand my decision, but that didn’t matter. It was mine. I started speaking another language (English) more because that’s what I always wanted, and she couldn’t understand it either. And it didn’t matter. I knew what I wanted. And a thousand choices like that that she watched me make and kept her mouth shut enough. Because of this inner compass, I feel like there will always be a part of her in me, wherever I go.\n\nAs I’ve said, the relationship went sour. With years, I understood that this dynamics of her keeping me at arm’s length (I never knew much about her, her struggles, she never let me support her) doesn’t work for me anymore. And I wanted to actually talk on the phone, actually meet her. All I could get out of her was one phone call, and after that she was always “not in a good place” for a call. I finally was brave enough to admit to myself that I wanted more of her (and that I’m an equal in this relationship and an adult, too, so I have the right to pursue it), and wanted to have a relationship. She was vague about it. And then her reaction made me not sure about it, too. At some point she did try to rely on me more, and I didn’t get it, I guess, and it hurt her immensely (and when I understood that I hurt her, it was hard to forgive myself: she was someone I NEVER wanted to hurt. Not for any reason). And then we talked about everything — the dynamics, my feelings, our wants and desires — and just like that it was over, slowly, quietly, not really too painfully (and immensely painfully for me at the same time, but, I mean, she didn’t really hurt my feelings. I was just hurting because it ended). It was 7 years after we started talking.\n\nBut I could never forget her. I’d text her sometimes, just to know how she is. Nothing too personal — just to know if she was ok. She’d get annoyed at me for that. I couldn’t really understand why… She’d say something about me “trying to be a people-pleaser and showing that I still care when I don’t”. At some point, I asked her if I should stop texting her because I clearly annoy her. She said yes. I tried. I tried for two years. And then I texted her again and said that I’m not a child anymore (I was 28 at the time), and I don’t want to live in a world where we don’t talk. We didn’t have to be best friends, but I was certain we had to talk. Sometimes. About anything. At some point. And she agreed. It was weird, and I was the one texting her mostly. And then it fizzled out.\n\nI never talked to her about it. There was nothing left to talk about, nothing left to say. But I still think about her when something good happens in my life. When something bad happens, and I handle it like a capable adult without falling apart. When I manage to choose myself instead of caving in.\n\nYesterday was one of those days I couldn’t keep it in (the last one was a year ago, and she did acknowledge it, even if briefly). I texted: “Hey, it’s one of those days when I can’t help it but want to wish you the best. So, here I am, wishing you the best. You’re incredible, and I feel so lucky to happen to live on this Earth when you exist”. She read it immediately, and… left me on read. I’m not sure why. She used to tell me that she doesn’t know what to say when people tell her good things, and she used to do it with me, too. But she usually acknowledged it. Now she didn’t. Did she think I was weird for texting it? Did I make it awkward? Was it too much? I guess I’ll never know. But ChatGPT told me to try and write it in a journal, so, here I am, on this sub, trying not to bother the most magical connection of my life with my gratitude.\n\nI’ve been in love; I have parents; siblings (well, cousins); I’ve had best friends. And this connection was everything in one: an older sibling who’s almost like a parent who’s also my best friend and with whom I’m absolutely in love. She was my first adult love: the love when you don’t just fall for someone because you think they’re perfect, but the love when the more you see the imperfections, the more you respect and love the person. You understand how difficult their life is, and respect how beautifully they’re fighting and what a strong and capable person they are despite all their limitations.\n\nMy life (and mental health) are in no way perfect. I’ve made a lot of mistakes, some of which I won’t ever be able to fully correct. But the peaceful moments that I have, the good things, the authentic parts of my life, the parts where I feel like I’m living my life and not someone else’s, I owe to her.",

This is the third time it’s happened, and I feel like it’s destroying me because, with the first two, I ended up pushing them away, and we eventually became strangers again.\n\nRight now, I’m obsessing over a really close friend in our small friend group of three. We’ve known each other for almost three years, give or take, and we’re so close we even refer to each other as “siblings.” But recently, something changed ad I've started obsessing once again. I can’t stop thinking about them. I always want to talk, hang out, or just spend time with them. And when they spend that time with someone else, I get jealous to the point where it physically hurts and I even feel betrayed in a way.\n\nBefore you think I’m completely nuts, I know this isn’t okay. I don’t start arguments, and I never tell them how I feel because I know I don’t have the right to control who they spend time with or talk to. I would never want to make them uncomfortable or make them feel like they owe me anything. But that doesn’t stop the thoughts from eating me alive. I cannot help but wish I had them all to myself.\n\nSometimes, instead of hanging out, I’ll say, “I’m tired” or “I don’t feel like going out,” when in reality, I do want to spend time with them—but I just can’t handle it mentally. So instead, I drive alone late at night, trying to escape the overwhelming thoughts. I don’t want to lose yet another person because of my own obsession. I am trying my best to stop, but so far, I’ve made little to no progress.",

She told me she didn't have the same feelings and i know that and i have to be okay with that and I'm trying to. But it's really difficult to. She started talking to this new guy and I'm pretty sure they went out today because she looked so nice in the one snap i got from her. It was her going out look. And the only time she doesn't instantly respond to me is when she's out with someone like that. If it's one of her girlfriends she's normally really quick and talkitive with me still. And it sucks. It really hurts and she called today to say she had a birthday gift for me which is nice because i don't really celebrate my birthday i don't like making a day about me but it's such a kind gesture. And i could tell she was really happy in her voice. And she said she had a good day and wouldn't tell me why which means it's probably the guy.

In a way this more just confirmed that he has cheated. I’ve also always been a sneaky person, when i was younger i would always listen through the doors and behind walls whenever my parents would fight, just so i can know everything and see how transparent they’d actually be with me. I’ve just always been nosy. A while back I was maybe 13 or 14, me and my family decided to upgrade all of our phones. When each of us transferred all of our information to our new devices some of the applications pop up. And at 13 i was the most chronically online emo loser who grew up in the 2000-2010s era so i recognize a grindr logo when i see one. That day my dad did look a bit like he knew that i saw but he probably thought i didn’t know what it was he had on his phone. I just told myself maybe i thought i had seen that logo, and left it alone, until now. Tonight after my nightly routine i forgot my hair ties in my parents room so i decided to sneak in there while my dad was asleep, and his phone was unlocked with a chat opened. Like i said….im nosy. I didn’t see anything but i 100% knew it was grinder because i saw the logo. I did take a photo while his phone was open too , i dont know why but something was telling me to! I also wasn’t sure if this was something my mother knew of and just never said anything. Just because i feel like it’s her natural response to something like that. I love my dad, he’s still a father to me and my siblings, and he works hard. This doesn’t make me hate him but it does slightly piss me off because all i can think about is my mom and how much she doesn’t deserve her husband doing something like this.\n\nAs of right now i’m not sure what i’ll do.

I have this wonderful dog named Richy, he’s the best thing that ever happened to be but my parents have a rule where he can’t go inside the house, he’s an outside dog. It’s been raining a lot where I live- I’m talking like crazy winds and rain. I asked multiple times if my parents can let Richy in because he can get cold and lonely out side and the response I get every time is “no, don’t ask again” or they say I’m being dramatic about him and that he’ll be fine. To mention Richy has a little space under the balcony and in the laundry room which is right underneath the balcony but it’s still very cold there . I think the way my parents treat Richy is unfair there have been multiple occasions where Richy has gotten hurt and has been neglected, for example when he was a puppy a brick fell on his paw and he was limping for weeks and my dad refused to take him to the vet. As I’m typing this the rain is getting far worse and the wind is howling.To all the dog owners out there do you guys leave your dog out in the rain?",

    "title": "my uncle's girlfriend is tearing my family apart",
    "content": "So, I'm from a very close-init family, we love each other a lot and have always been together. My grandma had three children, uncle A, uncle B, and my dad, and then grandpa had a child with another woman, uncle C. This is about uncle B.\n\nI don't like his current gf. She immediately trauma dumped on my grandma to gain sympathy, then proceeded to imply she was old and getting forgetful and clumsy (grandma's perfectly fine, she's as healthy as they come), then she brought along her son she had with another man, who I have no trouble with. She herself isn't bad, but the way she and her son behave is weird, because it's like they're not a part of our family, they just kinda live there, and I have the feeling that she wants to kick my grandma out and have the house to herself, which isn't possible because it's decided 50/50 between uncle A and uncle B, but she's tried to buy the other half to uncle A, who firmly refused, because once they both pass away, the house is mine.\n\nThe worst part about all this is my uncle's behavior since she arrived. He works with my mom at a local restaurant, nothing fancy, its main target are the broke college students nearby, but they get paid well. My mom had a cousin of hers working as a waiter there, and he wasn't the best, but hey, acceptable,  but uncle B decided to start saying that he was more trouble that its worth, and that his girlfriend's son should work there, my mom firmly refused. My grandma has anxiety of going out on her own for years now and since she only lives with uncle B and his girlfriend, she constantly relies on him to get medicine or to just go out, and he's been getting extremely rude with her for no reason whenever she asks to go out, yelling and saying \"he needs his own time too\". We threw a party for grandma's birthday a while ago, and you'd expect him to sit with his mother, but no, he went and sat with his gf's family, completely ignoring grandma. I fell and got hurt pretty badly a while ago, and everyone called me and asked of I was okay, but him? Not a peep.\n\nMy last straw came a few days ago, my mom suffers really bad anxiety/panic attacks sometimes and he caused her one. Long story short, he missed work without calling in advance and my mom had to cover his shift and then tried to reprehend him because she's the manager of the restaurant. He completely flipped out and said something along the lines of \"leave, it doesn't matter, (gf's name) can replace you\", and my mom got really mad, and said \"I don't want to have anything to do with you as work or as family, you're never stepping foot into my house again\".\n\nNow I love my uncle, but his gf has completely ruined everything, I don't like her, I see her and I feel angry, but I can't do anything because I'm forced to interact with her, and you'd think my lack of warmth would tell her to not talk to me, but she talks to me as if she was my aunt, SHE'S NOT, and I genuinely wish I could just make her go away and make things go back to normal. I want my family back.",

I don’t really know how to explain how I’m feeling so I’ve started pretending I’m okay when really I feel like I’m being held under water.

We have been together for around two and a half years and we just dont really have anything in common, our conversations are frankly boring, she is a lovely girl which is why this has been the hardest decision ive ever had to make but i think its for the best. I spoke to her a couple weeks ago about a few things that were bothering me and sex was one of them and it made me realise that it was a different level of priority for us, for me its quite high and im very much experimental in that department and would love to try things but she just doesnt. And im not going to get her to do something shes not comfortable with or doesnt want to do. We also spoke about how id like to see more effort and enthusiasm during sex from her as i felt a bit like my pleasure wasnt that important which isnt a great feeling let me tell you, and she hasnt really put any more effort into it minus the absolute bare minimum.\n\nIf im completely honest, im terrified. Im scared of what the future will be, scared that I wont find someone else, scared about hurting her which is the last thing I want to do is hurt her but I also need to take care of my own happiness. This is my first proper relationship and girlfriend, I've never had to break up with someone and im so scared.\n\nMy minds still a bit mad trying to process my decision so sorry if this doesnt read very well.\n\nEdit: more things to get off my chest jesus sorry. I do still love her, and this yoyo effect I'm feeling of wanting to break up then doubting has made me feel so numb scared and empty I feel so lost. Each time my girlfriend messages me today it hurts so much i really do care for her but, i just don't know if I'm doing what I did early on and ignoring things that obviously do bother me because I've got complacent.",

    "title": "TIL that my coworker had a Title IX case against him - from my predecessor - and he's still here.",
    "content": "I don't really know what to make of this, and I don't really have anyone to talk to about it. I (23F) started my master's this academic year and was brought in as a graduate assistant in one of the academic advising offices on campus. Our office has a new director who comes from a high school administration background and relatively new advisors (two of them, both have been here five years max).\n\nUntil yesterday, I didn't know why the previous GA left her role. She clearly left in a hurry because my office (her office) still had wall decorations, cork boards with posters and flyers, supplies, and cabinets chock-full of folders with papers, guides, flyers - you name it, it's here. It looked like the place was already in use is what I'm getting at. She created entire binders about our department's programs and even fully stocked the supply closet that we have. I knew she hadn't left due to graduation, it had to be either right before she graduated or she hadn't renewed her contract, but I didn't know why. It's not really my business, but I was curious and wanted to be sure it wasn't for something nefarious.\n\nSo, my suspicions rise when a classmate of mine, M, recognized the office that I said I'm a GA for (a handful of us are GAs, most of them for our college, but me in this advising office) and she brought up that she used to work there in undergrad until she graduated last year. M started asking about names from when she was there, and it became apparent we've had a lot of staff changes in less than a year. I thought, \"Interesting, I wonder why?\" She also did not like most of the people (advisors/director) who are/were here. I kind of shrugged it off, figuring that she probably just had some bad experiences or that the leadership prior to our current director was suboptimal, because I liked my coworkers. Naïveté on my part, I'll admit.\n\nBut something hasn't quite left me since that day: M said the previous director, let's call him Colin, resigned after being caught in a relationship with a student. I took this with a grain of salt because I hadn't heard that, not even from the other student workers who like to gossip, and M had made it clear that she didn't enjoy the office atmosphere.\n\nThings came to a head for me yesterday, when I met with the current director to discuss some issues with the website. Things progressed to how she doesn't like how disorganized the supply closet currently is, and her plans to clean it out with our administrative assistant over spring break. She mentioned having so much stuff left behind by the previous GA, like thick binders of who-knows-what, and not knowing what to do with them. They're multiple 5-inch binders stuffed to the brim.\n\nBringing up the GA snowballed until Director casually mentioned how my coworker, let's call him Andrew, one of the two advisors in our department, was the one caught making sexual advances - and toward the previous GA. They had gone out for drinks after-hours (unsure if it was with a group), and he had texted her inappropriately about hooking up. The then-director, Colin, received word of this but didn't want to do anything about it. He was promptly fired for his inaction once an actual, full-blown Title IX case opened against Andrew.\n\nThe GA left after this incident and no one has seen her since. She left everything behind. Her friends harassed the office to try and hold Colin accountable, but it wasn't until the case was opened that action was taken.\n\nI'm in shock and just don't know how to process these instances. He came onto my predecessor, yet she left, and he is still working here. I don't even know if she's graduated, but it makes sense now why her stuff was left behind and why nobody talks about her aside from the student workers who don't know the truth.",

    "content": "i honestly really should probably talk abt this bc it honestly was actually pretty tramuatizing, enough that i feel like i may have locked away some memories of what happened bc of just how awful some of the experience was\n\nmy memory is somewhat spotty bc of how scary it all was but ill try my best to explain\n\nmy friend had a Halloween party at her house\n\nwe decided to play something that involved running, which was a rather stupid decision as everything was slippery and dark outside\n\ni was running near/on ground that was steeply raised up a bit for a buliding to be bulit flat on\n\ni slipped and fell, despite the mud, when i instinctively reached out to brace myself by putting my hand out towards the top of the small slope i got hurt, really really badly, i had never been in such pain before, i dont remember how quickly it arrived exactly but it was pretty quick to show up\n\ni started crying a soon as the pain hit and the girl i had been running behind took notice and from what i can remember asked if i was ok, the other girls i was playing with eventually noticed and the escorted me to the house and to my friend's mother who is a vet/vet tech\n\nshe wrapped it in blue vet wrap in the kitchen and asked if i wanted to go to the doctor, and child me refused out if fear of possibly having to get surgery and probably bc i didn't want to inconvenience anyone, the vet wrap was uncomfortable and irritating but honestly the splint i got for a broken foot abt 2 years ago was worse, and it was by an er doc too, and while child me had to experience that awful splint, the vet wrap did make my hand feel better, i felt like i could pick it up and move it safely\n\nso i ended up staying inside sitting on one of their couches in the living room and resting my arm on the arm supports, watching tv with my friend's mom, i wasnt rly interested in the show but that was the least of my worries then, i think at one point she brought me food, like a hotdog or smth, which had ketchup bc my autistic ass wouldn't eat meat unless ot had ketchup on it\n\nthe other girls went outside after everything calmed down somewhat, tho my friend stayed a bit longer from what remember to make sure i was ok\n\neventually they came back inside for an event i forget if it was planned or started bc it was dark and I was stuck inside\n\nbasically it was a game where someone would get wrapped on toilet paper to become a mummy, they included me in it by loosely wrapping parts of my arm/hand that i was willing to move\n\nand then we eventually all went home, i dunno when any of this next stuff happens exactly but ill try to explain it in order\n\ni was cyberschooled then and at first i was fine... until i needed to write something, im right handed and my right hand was the one that was injured\n\ni remember my mom yelling at me because i refused to use my right hand and i think i asked if she could write for me, she told me to use it and i remember crying and saying \"I cant! I cant!\" i tried to move it even slightly in order to try obeying what she said but the pain was terrible, horrendous, unbearable, i cant think of words that can extensively describe how much pain i was in\n\ni dont quite remember it all but i think when i tried to use my left hand to write i was yelled at too, and my mom minimized my pain by saying smth along the lines of \"it isnt that bad\" and i was also condescendingly asked if i wanted to go the doctor which i again refused fearing surgery and also bc having my parents yell at me made me upset\n\nall this time i remember i still had that blue vet wrap on, my hand was shaking and in so much pain, i forget if my mom did the usual \"let me feel it\" thing but if she did i most definitely refused and probably yanked it away, based on the fact I still had that vet wrap on i think it was probably the next day\n\ni was allowed to write with my left hand but not without being scolded, i remember writing down things in notebooks for fun with my left hand, and i even decided that a character id made had my left hand's handwriting, i eventually got better writing with my left hand and honestly really had fun with it\n\nwhile i wrote and did things with my left hand i also did not use my right hand or bend my wrist, at least i did as little as possible, i kept on using the vet wrap to stablize it until it wouldn't stick no more, then i found some wrap i has gotten from when i sprained my leg and so i it instead, and remembered how i treated my sprained leg, used that was refrence for resting my hand and also didn't move it bc it was painful\n\ni dont remember much else abt the recovery, i think i stopped wrapping it and started using my right hand again as soon as the pain lessoned, which probably was after like a month or two perhaps? ik it takes longer for a broken bone to recover but the pain does go away pretty quickly honestly, i remember my mom expecting me to recover from my \"sprain\" in about a week and was upset i still refused to use it and instead write with my left hand\n\ni did keep on writing with my left hand sometimes for awhile after that just for fun, which ironically probably helped my right hand recover lol\n\ni dont quite know how long after it was but i think it was a decent chunk after but within the same year, i once again slipped and fell and i forget which handi landed on but based on the pain and how caught myself (the same way again) i think it was my right, which i once again assumed was a sprain, but only a minor one, so i again pulled out the wrap i had and i think for abt a day or 3 days wrapped my hand, i remember not having much pain and wondering if it still needed wrapped the next day, but i still ended up keeping it on i think\n\nand until i was a teen it never hit me that the pain i feltin my bones was not a normal sprain thing but probably a broken bone, and it really hit me after a horse broke my foot 2 years ago that yea, that probably wasnt a sprain... bc like it was while less pain, that pain i got from my broken foot felt literally like a lesser version of the pain i felt in my hand when i was a kid\n\ntbh im not completely sure if i did break my hand as ive never rly had it inspected for past breaks, unlike my foot it doesn't rly act up when the weather changes or from overuse etc, at least i think so? i never rly took notice of anything like thay as a kid because i was never aware or looking for anybpain related to broken bones, so im open to anyone suggesting its something else, not for legitimate medical advice as well, ik i shouldnt get it from here and its already healed, just out of curiosity, i wonder if it was like a pinched nerve maybe, but it didnt feel like one at all (ive unfortunately had and continue of have pinched nerves in my neck 🙃)",

    "content": "It's almost been a year, and I made a mistake.In June I broke up with my girlfriend of almost four years because we were going away for college and we were both going out of state on opposite  sides of the country. I thought it would be the best thing for us, but it's been the opposite.\n\nI really hurt her when we broke up. The first few days I thought this was going to be the best thing for me, and I just tried to push her out of my mind as much as I could, but I just kept feeling like an asshole. She loved me so much, and I took it for granted. She would do things for me all the time just because and never expect anything in return. She would constantly put me ahead of her and also just loved me no matter what I was going through.\n\nI couldn't stop thinking about her, and during my first week of college, I was so excited about what was going on in my life, and I wanted nothing more than to just text her and let her know what was going on.\n\nIt bothered me that in the almost 3 months we had been broken up at that point, she never once reached out to me. I wanted to know how college was going for her; I wanted to know how she was doing. How could the girl who I once had this amazing love with not try to reach out to me once? I texted her, letting her know that I had been thinking about her and that I hoped she was doing well. She kept things super brief and said she hoped I was doing well, but I wanted to talk to her so much more, so I poked about what she had been doing, and in two months she had done so much, and she was going to this great huge school and was doing all of this without me.\n\nI know I should've been happy for her, but it just made me sad and angry. We didn't talk for a month after that until she sent me a picture of a tattoo she had gotten. I was so excited that she finally reached out to me. This was the first time since we had broken up that she initiated the conversation.\n\nWe talked for a little bit, and it felt so great. We fell back into conversation like back when we were dating. It felt so good to talk to her again, but at the same time, it made me feel sick that I knew so little about what was going on in her life now, and I was only hearing so little about it. I sent her a text telling her how happy I was for her and how what she's doing seems like such a great experience for her, and she never responded. That hurt a lot.\n\nI looked at her TikTok and Instagram for the first time in months, and I just wanted to throw up. She is living this whole life without me. She looks happy and, most of all, beautiful. Like, how dare she be so beautiful and smile at people with smiles that were once mine?  I would go to her Spotify, and I would be so paranoid that one of those playlists was dedicated to someone that wasn't me.\n\nI felt so selfish and angry and mad at the world and at myself. I had to push her out of my mind, so I started seeing someone. I wasn't even really interested in them. Looks-wise, they were nothing compared to my ex-girlfriend. Their personality was so dull and boring compared to my ex, and in the end, I ended up just feeling like this huge dick for stringing someone along for months just to get over my ex-girlfriend.\n\nI went home for my Christmas break from my college, and it got even worse. Knowing that we were in the same town and just a drive away from each other's houses made me feel insane. I got so nervous that I was going to run into her any time I left the house. I thought about going Christmas shopping in the mall she worked at so I could \"accidentally run into her\" and then would just get sad because I was becoming this huge creep. I wanted to text her every day asking if she wanted to get coffee, and I never did because nothing would hurt more than knowing she didn't want to see me. I texted her Merry Christmas, and she was nice about it, but she didn't want to talk to me anymore after that.\n\nAnd then I saw she went back to her college before me, and it was painful seeing her with all her friends having so much fun and having so much fun without me. Seeing her cozied up with a girl on her Instagram makes me feel like I'm going to throw up. I see them post together all the time, and I just want to know if they're dating. How could she date someone so soon after 3, almost 4 years? How could she be so brazen and post her and that girl getting coffee and going on dates together? Does she not think I'll see it? I think I would feel worse if it was a man. The thought of some man looking at her the way I used to and touching her and being intimate with her makes me angry and sad and violent all at the same time.\n\nI would stalk her pages all day while I was still in our hometown, waiting for her to post something and getting nervous when she would. How could she be having so much fun and be so happy all without me?  We were each other's first love, first kiss, first everything. And now I don't know if she's doing that with other people.\n\nThings got a little bit better when I went back for my second semester of college, but I still just can't get her out of my mind. I'm starting to see another girl now to try and get over my ex, and she's, again, nothing like my ex-girlfriend, and I don't think there will ever be anyone like her.When I first broke up with her, I didn't think it would hurt this much. I guess in the back of my mind I thought she would've fought for us. I thought she would've texted me more when we were broken up; I thought she and I honestly would've gotten back together at this point. I'm so insanely in love with her still, and I brought this on myself, but I thought I was doing what's best for the both of us. I guess I didn't appreciate or realize the things that she did for me while we were together.",

At the party that I went to with my cousins we were obviously setting off large fireworks, we ended up not using all of the fireworks and later that week while hanging out with the friend that hosted the party, he gave me the firework as a joke I guess and I just put it in my backpack that I had with me (note the firework work is the type you put in a mortar so IT IS NOT SMALL.)  I completely forgot about the firework in my bag so when I was packing to fly back home I wasn’t looking for anything in my backpack and was just throwing my clothes in. Turns out I never took the firework out, covered it with all my clothes and brought it with me to the airport. I went through tsa the whole airport and my flight without knowing I had this firework in my bag. I hadn’t realized that I even had it till I got home and was unpacking and it fell out of my bag.  Funny thing is my aunt got stopped in tsa on a separate flight from mine because there was some kind of flammable residue on her stroller that was detected and she had to be patted down and all her stuff looked through but they couldn’t detect a fucking big ass firework at the bottom of my backpack.",

See the problem is that when we broke up it was because he was making some choices that were really not great for our relationship. So, I have gone on several dates as a now single woman after 4 years of dating him and I feel guilty. Like I feel like even though I am single and I have broken up with him it feels like I’m cheating or lying by omission because I have gone on dates and made out with other guys. Like I still care for my ex but unless he can work out his problems I just can’t see a future with him romantically which sucks. I feel like me trying to sort out my feelings and date for fun would crush him if he found out I’ve kissed other men as I had only had one other partner before him. Ugh it’s been eating me alive anyways I just had to get that out to the world and not keep it inside anymore.",

In the few times I have mentioned it to other people, I'm always very calm. I'm very calm when I see him, too. I just can't seem to cry about it when you'd expect me to, but then I break down at random times.\n\nHe's a lot older than me, so if I ever thought about it, I probably would've guessed he'd die before me. But not like this. Not this soon.\n\nI'm not family or anything, or a really close friend. there are people who have known him for more than a decade, and I have to be some kind of blip in his life, having only really been his friend for a few years. In a way, it doesn't seem like I have any right to be upset about this. Not when he's got actual family and friends who are as close as family. but here we are.\n\nthe thing is, like, my own parents are...fine, but fell short in a lot of ways. i'd never, ever admit this to anyone i know, but I did/do see him as kinda a parental figure. Or, at the very least, a trusted older adult. Someone I could be honest with and rely on, which is pretty rare in my life. He looked after me a bit. Now I'm trying to look after him. I don't think I'm doing a very good job of it, but I'm doing my best to do as much as he'll let me.\n\nI feel so worn thin. I'm trying so hard to be here for him, and also be here for my best friend who's going through a rough time mentally, and my family, and also work and have my own life and not go absolutely fucking insane. i don't know. this is more important than anything else i could do. I'm just so tired and sad and i'm not sure i deserve to be but there it is. I want to tell him that he's important to me, that this is really fucking me up, but i have no idea where to find the words. I don't know that the right words exist. I'd give anything to fix this. If I could die instead, I would, but that's not how cancer works. I don't know. I'm tired and right now I just desperately want things to be okay, or to not have to be the strong one for once, but who else is gonna be?",

She'd been diagnosed with terminal cancer, didn't tell me and left because she didn't want me to deal with that, I found out from mutual friends years later after the funeral.\n\nIt hurt, confusing and I got real cynical about life. Relationships. All that. It was bad for a while, but I worked thru it.\n\nSince then I've been mostly single. Sort of a loner. Dated,  nothing serious. Closed myself off, from friends too. Life moves forward. Career takes off. My job requires a lot of moving.\n\nEnter my lesbian friend, who is honestly funny and so good hearted that it's made the craziness of the world bearable. I'm a male. We became quick friends both being new and looking for things to do.\n\nShe's refilled my faith in humanity. She's got hobbies, independent ideas and cares about people she doesn't know. She has sympathy for people that hate her. She's willing to be the butt of the joke and then dish it out.\n\nI want to make clear that this isn't about a secret love or desire to date her to get over my ex fiancé. She's just a good person and friend. I just like her. She's helped me realize how much I've shut myself off from the world.\n\nAnd she's reminded me of why it's so important to have connections and friends.\n\nShe's a bit of an introvert, and I'm too so we've been helping each other with that. Feels good, which I need in the world today.\n\nShe has a girl she's trying to get the courage to ask out. I'm trying to convince her to do it, like my friends did with my ex-fiancé a long time ago. She deserves a shot at happiness.\n\nBut I wouldn't have thought that for myself six months ago. This excellent lesbian friend has helped me rediscover the part of me that loves human connection. And it means so much.\n\nSince our friendship started, I feel the first genuine desire in years to try snd do things and date. To make friends and connect with others. To be part of the world, deeply and meaningfully.\n\nI'm so thankful to her for being just such an awesome friend, by just being herself, she's helped me in so many ways she'll never know.\n\nI think my ex-fiancé would've liked her a lot.\n\nAnd I hope all of you will have the chance to have a really great lesbian friend who will help give you faith in humanity too.\n\nWe need that.",

I met this guy online he was really nice I gave him my phone number and we hit off, we have been talking for two days the second day we call I remember he said \"oh!, someone is calling me bye!\" and I didn't think anything of it but uhm I haven't really heard from him since I texted him and he kinda left me on read and I texted him again I don't think he bothered looking at the message and I think I don't want to believe that I had just got ghosted but I think I did? And I don't blame him really because I don't know how to talk to people. I've noticed that I overshare and I can be awkward and maybe I make people sad when I talk to them but at the sametime I don't know how to approach people, or how to really make connections so I just blurt things out and I can see why that would drive someone away that kind of thing is so tiring to deal with. I also noticed when we were talking to him he said now you sound more relaxes or more comfortable or you're not trying too hard and i've got that a lot, I don't know what that meana though because sometimes thats how I genuinely act, I guess because i'm so awkward some of the things I say come off as forced but I can't help it and I don't know what to say really and I don't want to interview people and be like, oh so you like this? and this? and that? how do you feel about this? asking a ton of questions. I also was talking to someone before this guy not ina romantic sense but I think I made things awkward with that person too, I think I made them sad and I didn't mean to but it just happens sorta and I don't notice until like a day later or so and its like damn I shouldve approached it like this or like that. And even when i'm trying to talk with new people I always overthink what I want to say, I LITERALLY WAS OVERTHINKING WHAT I WANTED TO SAY TO BOOK A HAIR STYLING APPOINTMENT LIKE COME ON, thats just pathetic that it took me 3 days to ask my stylist how much is this or how do I get to her studio because I was ovethinking what I wanted to say and because I felt embarrassed and ashamed. And I started to realize that even my bestfriends don't really know what to say to certain things I say so its an awkward silence before I have to be like so uhm ahaha sorry about that!! and I have to make a stupid joke or something because I know they don't know what the hell to say and I made the whole convo awkward. I haven't even spoken to my bestfriend of 5 years, in which I should be thr most comfortable speaking to in like 5 days because i'm trying to think of something to talk about, again this is so pathetic and I don't know why im like this, it shouldn't be hard to talk to people but for some reason for me it is and it just makes me kinda angry and kinda sad and jealous because everyone makes it seem so effortless to talk to people and have a regular convo where you're like \"AUGH I SHOULDNT HAVE SAID THAT IM GONNA PUT MY HEAD IN A WALL!!\".",

The thing is that every guy I've been with since him hasn't measured up. He's the guy I compare every other man to. He's the only person in my 31 years of life that actually made an effort. He always respected me and my boundaries. He accepted everything about me. He's the only guy to actually plan a date with me rather than putting in the minimum effort of asking me which restaurant I want to go to. I broke up with him because I didn't feel like I was good enough for him. He was on the football team and I was an awkward emo kid. I blew him off at first because I had been asked out by another football player as a joke a couple weeks prior. So for our entire relationship I just kept waiting for him to reveal that it had all been a joke too. My first real kiss was an uncomfortable situation that felt pressured and forced, and I know that had it been with him it would have been so natural. I lost my virginity to someone who had zero respect for me who broke up with me because his dad said he should play the field. Itbshould have been him. I married someone abusive and ended up divorced by the time I was 27, and now I have a child with someone who I live with and still only see on weekends most of the time because he would rather play videogames all night and sleep all day than actually put in effort with me and our child. Hs bf and I hooked up years ago when we were between relationships and I psyched myself out again thinking I wasn't good enough and ended up blowing up on him over something that could have been easily talked through. I know that we are both adults and therefore totally different people now, but I find myself thinking quite often weather the new him would like who I've become. I'm so badly damaged by a string of toxic men when I had the perfect guy for me and screwed it up multiple times. He's my one that got away, and it's my fault because I pushed him away.",

By the end of it all, I was working for an escort agency, giving the boyfriend my money. I was bullied and forced into fucking old men and I was scared to leave my relationship. My parents finally found me (I had run away) and managed to get me help. I turned things around and ended up doing well in life. I never told anyone what had happened and I had planned to take it to my grave.\n\nFast forward 15 years (5 years ago), a detective knocks on my door. He wanted to know about my ex and the sex trafficking. I reluctantly spoke with him and agreed to do some recorded phone calls at the police station in order to get a confession. I also turned over my high school journals that detailed the abuse and rapes. We recorded a two-hour confession that detailed everything. It felt like a slam dunk. That was 2 years ago.\n\nGuys, it's been 5 years and I am tired. I am tired of waiting 3-6 months to hear back from the detective. I'm tired of having to tell and retell my story to different detectives. The further I get away from it, the less I remember, and the less credible I sound. I'm tired of worrying about my safety, and if people will even believe me. And I'm tired of getting my hopes up, only to hear back from the DA that they're working on more pressing matters. I get that my case is \"old news\" and not a priority. I don't begrudge the detectives for prioritizing more current, relevant cases. But I'm tired of advocating for a win that I don't think I'll ever see.\n\nSo today, I will be emailing the detective and asking them to drop the case. I wanted to hang on because I wanted to get this dude on the sex offender registry, so that other girls wouldn't have to go through what I did. But I can't be a martyr and sacrifice myself any longer for this cause.\n\nI have no one to talk to about this. And I just need to say that I'm sorry, and I tried :(",

My husband is bipolar and treats me like crap even though I am the sole supporter in a tropical country.  I have a business and work my ass off to support my legal husband and 23 year old daughter. She works now so not so much support. While in my home country I stay with a friend of the opposite sex and pay rent albeit not anywhere near market rent. When I am in my home country I pay my way.  But my “friend” definitely likes me. He made advances on me and because he did so much for me I almost felt to secure my life I needed to reciprocate or I would be on the street. My “husband” has never shown me he really cares. He is bipolar and I was emotionally and physically abused for years. I met my friend and moved in.  I run a business in my home country and travel back a lot to tend to biz.  I never wanted a relationship with anyone but felt guilted into it or I would be on the street. I could not afford an airbnb and needed to stay with my friend. Well he made advances and me feeling pressured went along with it to secure my and my family’s well being. I care about this person a lot but am not willing to give up my life in my tropical country.  I have 5 dogs that I cannot take to my home country and could not afford to live there. So I let the relationship continue. I feel major guilt every single day of my life. I do not want to lead this other relationship on but know I will be homeless when i go back.  I broke it off because the guilt was too much but he still is hanging on hoping I come back. I want to live in my home in my tropical country with little to no stress with my dogs.

My “friend” in my home country is a good guy but very insecure. I do not want to hurt anyone but it is inevitable. He does things for me without me asking and then holds it over my head. I am so torn. He lives in a dog free building so no way to take my babies there. I don’t know what to do. I never wanted this chaos. My life is upside down. I want to just do myself in and end it but my two kids 23 and 30 are my best friends and their lives would be destroyed so thats just not an option. I hate my life so much.

    "content": "I (19M) am bisexual. About two years ago, I fell in love with my best friend, T (now 19M). I knew he wasn’t into men, so I tried—and succeeded—in getting over it. However, one night while I was drunk, he was taking me home, and I confessed. I told him that I had been in love with him but that I wasn’t anymore. I apologized sincerely and explained that I just felt he had a right to know.\n\nNaturally, he was uncomfortable, but we agreed to try and maintain our friendship. Things were never quite the same, but we remained close. I made every effort to respect his boundaries and avoid making him uncomfortable. I also felt guilty, as if I had hurt him and ruined our friendship. Though he never explicitly said so, that was the impression I got. Whenever I asked, he insisted that everything was fine.\n\nAbout a year and a half after that, due to circumstances beyond our control, we had to sleep in the same bed. I asked if he was okay with it or if we should switch rooms, and he said it was fine. Still, I did my best to stay on my side of the bed so he wouldn’t feel uncomfortable. Unfortunately, at some point during the night, I rolled over onto his arm in my sleep. He woke me up and asked me to move. The next night, he decided to sleep in a different room, saying it was because of the bed. I thought that was an excuse, but I didn’t press him—he had every right to make that choice. Instead, he slept in a room with two of our female friends, A (19F) and K (18F).\n\nAfter that, things mostly returned to normal, except I noticed that A and K became more aggressive toward T.\n\nFast forward to about a month ago: I was out for coffee with A, and we were discussing T. He had made an awful joke toward K, and I was defending him when A suddenly said she had to tell me something. She revealed that on the night he changed rooms, he had told them about what happened. He told them I had feelings for him, that he constantly felt uncomfortable around me, and even outed me as bisexual (I am closeted because I live in a very homophobic country). He also told them that he couldn’t wait to work abroad for the summer so he could get a break from me.\n\nAt first, I didn’t want to believe her, but she knew details only he and I had discussed, and I was sure I hadn’t told her. A said they hadn’t told me sooner because they thought I wouldn’t believe them.\n\nI was crushed. I confronted T over the phone, but he claimed he didn’t remember anything from that night and insisted A and K were just trying to ruin our friendship.\n\nWe’re meeting for drinks in a few days to talk face-to-face and hopefully resolve things. I don’t know what to think. Everything points to him betraying me, and his excuse isn’t convincing—but I don’t want to believe it. Any advice would be welcome.",

Majority of my family including cousins are either on social assistance, housing, drug addicts, alcoholic, ect.\n\n6 or 7 years ago, I was on social assistance myself. I didn't finish high-school. I was drinking daily. Ended up in an abusive relationship. Managed to get a cleaning job.\n\nSince then I've gotten my GED, partially went through college, ended up building a career before I completed college, am now a program manager on my way to making 90k a year in a field i love that feels like I'm making a difference in people's lives, in a happy loving fulfilling relationship where I live with my partner, we plan to buy a house soon and are thinking about marriage and kids. I have a car. I've essentially hit all of the life goal milestones I wanted to hit by the time I was 30 and more (I just turned 30 a few weeks ago). I've been to therapy, ive been on a good medication for my mental health, I've done the work.\n\nI feel like my life is finally on the right track. Because of this, I've finally been able to shift my focus to more \"shallow\" or less important things that have been kinda low on my radar.\n\nFirst let me say, I love myself - not in a self centered kind of way, but I appreciate that I'm resilient, goal oriented, determined, am empathetic to peoples experiences, and I have a lot of love to give. And I have a lot of respect and compassion for myself- just as I do for others.\n\nWith that being said, my appearance has always been something that's bothered me. I've always had bad skin, I gained quite a bit of weight over the last 4 years- and I'm just not in a place where I feel good about how I look. So I've decided, this year, that's what I'm going to work on. I've bought more professional clothes, started my skin journey to help with my skin texture and acne scars and redness. And planning on getting my teeth fixed. Getting a good hair regime. And controversial- i decided id try ozempic. My insurance is covering it so essentially it's like why not? Why wouldn't I give this thing a try to support me in losing weight and feeling better about my appearance. It's not that I think I'm UGLY I know I'm not- i just feel like I haven't really taken care of myself and I'm working on it.\n\nAnyway long story short- I feel like I'm getting some much push back randomly now. And the more I think of it the more I realize how much push back I've gotten generally on decisions I've made.\n\nMy dad once said how will you live on your own your on welfare (this was 7 years ago before I met my boyfriend and 3 months before I got a fulltime job as a cleaner and my own apartment)\n\nMany times as I've changed jobs to move up and learn more I've gotten aren't you scared? Are you sure you want to do this?\n\nAnd now from some family members and old friends its - wow that treatment is a lot of money, I've heard so many negatives about ozempic etc. My own mother has issues with me improving the way I look for some reason.\n\nI just don't understand it. I would never try to put someone down for bettering themselves in anyway. It's actually almost hurtful.\n\nOf course I realize I don't have to and won't listen to others on my life choices, because my choices have gotten me to where I am today. I guess I'm just venting because it feels like the people who don't even make decisions try to influence yours.\n\nAnyway thats all haha.",

But since last year, it has been a bit up and down between all the three of us. It all started when my ex suddenly showed up at my door wanting to talk. But this girl friend of mine got angry at me because I asked back the money I am owed back, and went and told my boyfriend that my ex showed up, we “talked” and some other stuff. This caused a major break in between our relationship, and I only knew about this recently that she was the one who ratted me out when it wasn’t her place. I would have told him, but she went ahead and told him adding unnecessary untrue details to it.\n\nWe had some misunderstandings, and we moved past that. But as of now, she seems to be becoming more possessive of him, though she has her own boyfriend. She expects him to take her out everywhere, doesn’t include me, and he seems to be doing it. But when I ask him, it’s always reasons and excuses.\n\nShe still owes me a little around $600, and I am honestly scared to ask her about it. They have been doing a lot of video calls, texting constantly and I know it may be nothing but I just cannot digest the fact. I know I need to be more trusting but I feel like a third wheel in my own relationship. He expects me to adjust to this, but why should I be adjusting in MY relationship.\n\nYesterday night, I questioned him about it and he came to hit me. I got shocked that he raised his hand on me when I asked why did he video call her. He keeps saying I am more important to him and I am his first priority but I just cannot understand why he would get so angry when I questioned about it. This was the third time in a row he raised his hand on me. But later consoled me. I asked him to choose between me or her, he said he is in a situation where she is his roommate and he cannot do anything. I hate the fact that she is so touchy around him, I just hate it.\n\nI trust him that he wouldn’t do anything behind my back like sleep with her, but I just cannot let it go. I am still in shock from yesterday night. I feel like I lost all my friends because of him, I don’t feel like I belong with anyone and I don’t even have anyone to talk about this that I have to vent it out on Reddit.\n\nTL;DR my boyfriend seems to be involving our mutual friend a lot into our relationship and seems to be choosing her over me.",

    "content": "My, f29, boss, m late 40s, kept the camera feed of me on his computer screen at all times. Obligatory throw away account cause the details in this might be easy for some of my coworkers to find this and I don't want to give up my main account. Also I was posting this on am I over reacting but my update actually came as I was typing this on that sub so now I'm switching it to here that everything seems to be wrapped up.\n\nSo I work in a mostly male dominated field in a CNC machine shop as a brake operator. I am the only woman at my company that works on the shop floor. About a year ago there was a fist fight between 2 other operators and there were no cameras inside to show who started the fight so both operators had to be let go. To prevent this from happening again the cameras went up all over the shop. Absolutely no blind spots, crystal clear HD camers, we know this because our boss has a TV screen above his desk now where he can watch all the cameras. He can have up to 8 of the camera feeds on his screen at one time and it has the ability to cycle though all of the feeds, switching feeds every few minutes.\n\nThe problem came about a week ago when a coworker of mine came up to me and told me there was only one feed on the screen. Me at my machine. I have never been written up or even talked to about problems with my work so I was very thrown off by this. When I had the opportunity where I could think of a reason to go into his office to see for myself when I walked in his office sure enough I saw my empty station on the screen. I pretended not to notice and just asked a question about a part I was working on that could be a reasonable question and went back to my work like nothing was wrong. Over the next week or so I tried to put it out of my mind but I couldn't get past it and more coworkers approached me and said they saw me on the screen.\n\nSo late last week I went to HR and asked if I was in trouble for anything. The HR guy looked surprised and asked me what I was referring to and I told him how closely I'm being watched and it seems to be just me singled out. He said he would look into it and get back to me but as far as he knew there was nothing wrong. About an hour later I get called into the managers office with HR, screens are back to normal showing 8 different work areas. I'm happy for a second until I am asked why I'm spreading misinformation. I ask what they're talking about and I proceed to be gaslighted for the next 5 or so minutes about how the cameras have always been this way and I'm seeking attention. I say multiple coworkers have mentioned to me about seeing it and we can bring them in to ask. They threaten to write me up if I keep bringing up this \"blatant lie\" and that I'm slandering the manager to my fellow coworkers.\n\nI contact a lawyer cause at this point I'm like fuck it I'm going to quit this job anyway might as well raise a little hell but then part of me decides it's just not worth it and with everything I've been through lately its just not worth it. I decided to contact my ex who I've been broken up with for a year and fill him in. We we're together for 5 years and he's the love of my life, about a year ago he was offered his dream job across the country and asked me to go with him. My mother was dying of cancer at the time and I was the only one she had left to take care of her. He planned on turning down the job to stay with ne but I told him I'd never forgive myself if he passed on his dream job for me. About 6 months ago my mother passed and idk why I didn't contact him but it kinda felt like my whole world fell apart so I just accepted this was my life now.\n\nWhen I told him what was going on he said \"why don't you come move in with me?\" I didn't know it but he hadn't dated anyone since we broke up (and neither had i) because he had always planned on us reuniting after my mother passed and when she did he didn't want to rush me cause he wanted to wait until I was ready. I wasn't ready at all until he asked me that question but without hesitation I said yes. I put in an application that day at a CNC shop near where he lives and that was yesterday. So that's where this post was going to end on am I over reacting for picking up and moving across the country. And then the phone rang.\n\nApparently the place I was hiring was impressed with my years of experience and they're a newer shop so I actually have more experience running a brake then most of their employees. They offered my about a 25% raise of what I'm currently making and I accepted on the spot. They asked when I could start and I said next week. Immediately called my boss and told him he's a fucking creep and that I quit. HR has been calling me nonstop begging for me to reconsider but that ship has sailed. Ex bf or possibly just bf again said he's excited for me to move in but will be setting me up in a separate bedroom at first just so we can take things slow and figure things out which I think is very smart of him and I'm glad cause I think we need that time too.\n\nMy current landlady is an absolute sweetheart and knows how rough this year has been for me so she's letting me break my lease with no penalties and she already has someone lined up to take my apartment. I asked if they wanted to buy some of my furniture since I'm only taking what I can fit in my truck and they offered me a thousand buck for my living room set and all my drawers and dressers. Not having to worry about all that I can fir the rest of my stuff in my truck easily and I'm starting my cross country trek tonight. Fuck creeps and if you're thinking about putting up with that bullshit, don't. There's always another option, maybe even one youd.never thought possible.",

    "content": "Everyone talks about the eldest daughter trauma — the one who raised her siblings like a second mother, the one who carried the whole house on her back while nobody even asked if she was tired. But no one ever talks about the last daughter , the one everyone thinks had it easy. The one who was loved a little more, spoiled a little more, protected a little more… but never really seen.\n\nThey say I was the lucky one, the child who walked on a path already cleared by others. I always knew when to be careful and when to stay silent because my sisters had already made the mistakes I wasn’t allowed to make. Every fight had already been fought before I even reached that age. Every heartbreak came with a warning before I could fall too deep. They think I had it easy because I never had to struggle for my freedom. What they don’t know is — I never got the chance to fight for it either.\n\nI was the daughter who grew up watching the cracks in the house… but I was never allowed to acknowledge them. I was the one who learned how to laugh off the fights, how to pretend I didn’t hear the shouting behind closed doors. I was the daughter who learned how to act dumb — because if I smiled enough, if I played the little girl they wanted me to be, they’d believe they protected me from the ugliness of this house. What they never realized is… I saw everything. I just stayed silent because youngest daughters aren’t supposed to know what pain looks like.\n\nNobody ever asked how I felt. Nobody ever wondered if I was okay — because the youngest ones are always supposed to be happy by default. I became the light of the house not because I wanted to… but because someone had to be. The clown who made everyone laugh at the dinner table so they could forget how broken everything really was. The one who took up responsibilities without being asked — peeling garlic in the kitchen, making tea for guests, finishing the little chores nobody wanted to do. Not because anyone told me to  but because the guilt of letting my mother do it alone would eat me alive.\n\nI was the obedient one , the daughter who never crossed the line. The one who said yes to everything, who stayed quiet when she wanted to scream, who shrunk herself down to fit into the version of me they wanted to see. My sisters got to rebel, got to be wild, got to disappoint the family but by the time it was my turn, my mother was already too tired. There was no space left for me to be difficult. I had to be the perfect daughter. The easy one. The one who never asked for too much.\n\nMaybe that’s why I feel so distant from my own mother. She had nothing left to give by the time I came along. I watched her have those long, deep conversations with my sisters… conversations I never got to have. The only thing she gave me was rules. Maybe she thought if she was harder on me, she could save at least one daughter from turning out like the rest.\n\nI was always loved. I was always taken care of. But not because of who I was because that’s just what you’re supposed to do with the youngest child. Love them, spoil them, protect them but never really see them.\n\nNobody ever wonders what happens when the child who made everyone laugh starts crying behind closed doors. Nobody wonders if the girl who had it easiest was silently drowning in the weight of trying to be perfect.\n\nThey called me lazy when I took two gap years  not knowing I spent more time peeling vegetables with my mother than studying for my own future. They called me spoiled when I got everything I wanted not knowing I gave up dreams before I could even name them just to make life easier for everyone else. They called me the lucky one… but how lucky can you be when your whole life is built around making sure nobody in the house feels like they failed you?\n\nI was never the rebel… but I don’t think I ever wanted to be the perfect daughter either.",

I had initially thought that I would feel relieved but it’s tearing me apart. She was my first. We were together for 2 years and all of 5 mins it was just gone. Took everything in me to not lose it on the train ride home. Even though I initiated it, I hate myself for what hurt it has caused her and I haven’t been able to sleep or eat well. It’s really harder than I had imagined.\n\nOf course with any relationship, there were low moments but there were also some of the highest highs and I was so blessed to be with her. I broke things off because I haven’t been in a good place recently and I didn’t want to “bleed” on her due to whatever circumstances I may have. In hindsight, this was immature thinking as I chose the easy way out and I’m now dealing with immeasurable amounts of pain as a consequence.\n\nToday at work the events from the previous night replayed in my head over and over.

I’ve always been a pretty shy guy, but am especially cautious when socializing with women I work with. I try to be myself but not act in a manner such that they could feel uncomfortable (basically I’m afraid of flirting because I want to be a good human being and also keep my job).\n\nWhen I’m with this woman it’s pretty chill. We chat about our travels and places we want to go. She occasionally tells me very personal things, one time she randomly told me she had an IUD after we were just sitting in silence for a few seconds.\n\nAnyway I think she’s great. She’s very smart and successful. We both make 140k+ at basically the same job. She owns her own house but I’m not quite there yet. She’s funny, cute, and very fashionable. The little things like the way she paints her nails (neat like a professional does them for her on the daily) and wears her hair are so unique and attractive.\n\nSometimes things feel fantasy like when we’re traveling together. We might both reach for the temperature controls in the car at the same time because the AC is too cold and touch hands. We say the same things at the same time and have the same thoughts when a random event happens in front of us.\n\nSometimes she would say interesting things like “if it was appropriate I’d invite you to stay at my house” because the office is far for me and close to her. Or if I talked about moving she’d get excited and joke that I could be her neighbor. I always wondered if she was attracted to me, but she shows mixed signals. She’s a very smart woman so it’s possible she thinks the same way I do and doesn’t want to jeopardize her career. She’s had boyfriends on and off and I’m not even sure what her current status is.\n\nI feel like in an alternate reality we would be the perfect couple. But in this reality we’ll just be coworkers who live a couple hours apart. It’s frustrating. I’ve never been sexually active before because I’m waiting for someone who electrifies me as much as she does to truly desire me, and to be in the right situation for it. That’s hard to find.\n\nTLDR; just a dumb man crushing on a coworker\n\nUpdate: I don’t think I can ask her out. Messaged her at work today to ask how things have been and the conversation felt one sided. I can’t deal with the humiliation, embarrassment, and fear of her getting freaked out by me doing so",

    "content": "So, towards the end of summer last year, my coworker (26m) and I (24f) went on a date and ended up fooling around a few times after that. I had had a huge crush on him for a while and was so excited to finally go out with him. The date was super nice, but the hookups were unexpectedly really good. I don’t have a lot of experience whereas he does, and he knew that, and he let me take control of the pace and the things we did which made me feel comfortable enough to try stuff with him I hadn’t done before. Unfortunately, life stuff happened all at once, and he ended things like two weeks after the first date. I was crushed. I was hurt, disappointed, confused, and quite honestly, very sexually frustrated. I really, really liked him, and we had gotten very intimate very quickly with the expectation that there would be a lot more to come, and then all of a sudden, it was over. I felt like I was left high and dry.\n\nThe thing is, a couple of months ago, we basically ended up confessing over text that we both still wanted each other in that way and almost made plans to meet up again, but more life stuff got in the way, and we both agreed that it would still be a bad idea to do anyway. But now every time I see him at work, I can’t help but think about the things we said and did, and how much I want to do it again. The fact that I know that a part of him still desires me in that way is kind of driving me crazy. I could torture myself overanalyzing every normal conversation, every glance, every little interaction.\n\nIt would very likely be a terrible idea to do it again, and it would probably end worse than it did the first time, but the feelings just won’t go away no matter how much I remind myself of these things. I am down so, so bad for this guy.",

    "title": "exposing a narcissist",
    "content": "So I recently exposed a narcissist but my situation is very different and I can’t find anything online about this situation. So I came here for potential outcomes.\n\nSo back in 2023 of March I started talking to this guy and he knew me from my childhood (we were not best friends we just saw each other in passing during our middle school years) and it went well at first. (It only lasted two weeks) While we were getting to know each other I got on his IG and saw this girl constantly posting on his page but he never paid her any mind and of course I asked and he denies it. But he must have sensed that I was hot on his tail so he decided to end things but still wanted to be friends even though we were never friends but I just said ok. What he didn’t know is that I knew I was blocked after I questioned him about the girl on IG so I made a fake page to see what was up. And even though he said he wanted to end things he was still keeping in touch with me. Even though I’m blocked on his IG so in April 2023 I saw him with that girl and he she got him to move down there with her. He is originally from my city and this girl lives in the DMV area. And with me investigating I realized that it’s a money thing so basically this guy is a prostitute she buys him stuff and he agrees to be her bf. So of course I wanted revenge but I wanted to wait until it was unexpected so for a whole year I gathered information on this girl and realized she may be a narcissist. With my digging on this girl I got her phone number driver license address email you name it I got it. And I tucked it away. So in March of 2024 I made a fake number and pretended that I knew her from one of the colleges she went to but I told her that I wanted to stay anonymous. And she went for it and all I did was expose her bf for being with me. I also wanted to add that had I not been hot on his tail he would have continued to date me. And when I found out about the girl I cut all communication with him and he found a way to contact me and wanted me back and I told him no. He even told me he never wanted us to stop talking but he needed help from this girl and I had all that in the screenshots. And you best believe I sent them screenshots to her when I was hiding behind the fake number. This girl really wanted to know who I was so I decided to give her a call and actually reveal myself and we were on the phone for 27 mins. Mind you I recorded our conversation as well because I don’t trust this bitch. But while we were on the phone she talked bad about her bf and her bf family and I did defend the family because I actually know them. Because the city we are from is small. And at one point in time I was close with the guys cousin. She said really bad things about the bf mom too. And I didn’t like that so I spoke up and I think she could tell I wasn’t going for any of her lies because I knew she was lying. And I’m sure she didn’t like that. I actually got off the phone with her because she wouldn’t let me go. So the day after I spoke to the girl her bf called me screaming at me and accusing me of all these things I didn’t even say. I couldn’t even get a word in but I knew she was going to lie so I wasn’t tripping because in my head I was going to get my lick back. Fuck this hoe. The guy wasn’t even mad that I hurt gf feelings he was mad that I lied on his family and said bad things about him. Which I didn’t say anything bad about him or his family. So after I took a verbal beating from this guy I just said cool. But I wasn’t done yet. So I waited for about six months so now we are in September 2024 and from March of 2024 to September 2024 I kept my eye on them and I watched her crumble because she is very transparent on the internet and the bf broke up with her while she begged for him back because he realized that she lied on me and she must have found me on social media because she changed everything about herself to mimic me. Mind you when I spoke to her in March of 2024 she claims that he begs her but social media says otherwise. And between March of 2024 to September of 2024 this girl and her friends and her momma started to bother me because apparently I’m the reason why her bf won’t speak to her and I still keep calling her bf and pulling him away from her but I haven’t seen that man since March of 2023 nor have I spoke to him the only time I spoke to him was in March of 2024 and that’s because he yelled at me. So in September of 2024 I reached out to him I unblocked him on IG (in case you are wondering he did block me first on IG but unblocked me on IG to get in contact with me because I had him block on everything else then when he asked for a second chance and I told him no I blocked him on IG and he been on that list since September of 2024 and then I blocked him again because he is a dick) and sent him all the details of the conversation I had with the gf. I even revealed to him that I was behind the fake number but he told me to leave him alone so I said ok bet and changed my number and reblocked him on IG. But what I banked on was how much he liked me so I knew he was going to read and listen to all the things I sent and within three days he started calling my fake number (because he couldn’t get in contact with me because I changed my real number) so I deleted my fake number and got rid of my social media account because he had his family look for me too. He also offered to send me money to talk to him but I declined. And of course I’m still watching this all play out on my fake pages and again because she is so transparent on social media she is having a breakdown because he now knows the truth and she can no longer lie on me to him at least. But he is stupid anyway because why would you believe a liar with no proof but I guess because she is a narcissist and the guy isn’t good at setting boundaries. I never been involved with a narcissist well I don’t think I have been and I think it’s because I’m too outspoken and I have no problem getting into a fights. I promise you this is not what the fuck you want but overall I’m a pretty peaceful young lady if I do say so myself. Anywho, this girl is upset that not only is he furious with her but also his family is happy that someone was able to finally expose her for the liar and manipulator that she is (I didn’t know that his family didn’t like her) but apparently she plays victim and uses this guys insecurities and her money so she can get her way and this relationship was going on for years. I’m basically the hero. But I wasn’t done with this bitch yet so I got my black ass on Twitter and put her on blast so much so she lost a lot of followers on social media and her momma is off of social media completely because her momma was bothering me too. And I did this a few weeks ago me exposing this girl on Twitter. So now I’m satisfied. But I wanted to know what happens when you expose a narcissist? I wasn’t the one being manipulated but it was like I was the defender of someone who was being manipulated. And I came here to see if I could get any info because I couldn’t find anything.",

    "content": "This is a throwaway account because no one in my life knows about this, and honestly, I feel really ashamed about it. But here it goes... I’m a girl, and I’m really, really into men’s feet. Not just in an “I find them attractive” way.. this is one of my biggest turn-ons, and it plays a huge role in my sexuality.\n\nEvery time I’ve mentioned this to someone (mostly online), they’ve been shocked, or they straight-up didn’t believe me. Apparently, it’s weird for a woman to have this preference? Is it? It makes me feel even weirder about it, like I’m some kind of freak. But the thing is, I’ve had this for as long as I can remember.\n\nI think one of my earliest memories of realizing it was in high school during sports. I was sitting on a bench barefoot with some friends, and a guy next to me accidentally touched my foot with his. He did that a bunch of times. I think he wasn’t even paying attention. He was just watching the game. I remember feeling something I didn’t fully understand at the time. It felt so good in a way that was different from anything else.\n\nOver the years, I’ve tried asking guys for pictures of their feet, but most of them refuse. They’ll say, “No way, my feet are gross\" or something like that. But the thing is.. I like that. I’m not just into clean feet. I love the dirty, sweaty ones too. Sometimes even more. Socks, shoes, sneakers, slippers, flip-flops... all of it is insanely attractive to me.\n\nI know fetishes aren’t something we choose, but I really wish I didn’t have this one. I feel so embarrassed about it. I just want to be normal and have typical attractions like everyone else. I guess I just needed to get this off my chest.\n\nIf anyone out there can relate, please let me know I’m not the only one.",

    "title": "waited 6 hours for a 5 min with human services",
    "content": "Last year, I think I was sent an email in December saying that I \"needed to send proof of income\" effectively tomorrow. It was also a \"2nd notice.\" assuming the 1st one was lost in the mail. I was already gathering that for a different service, so I just made copies of the pay stubs, waited an hour, and turned in everything asked. That is when I was told that I had been Flagged for something involving income and needed to see a medicare insurance adjuster. I wondered if any were available and was told no and that I needed to come back tomorrow or call in.\n\nI asked if I could make an appointment but was told none were available, as \"due to holiday training and staff shortages, we are unable to fill requests for appointments at the moment.\" However, I would \"put a note in my file that it was a late notice.\"\n\nI asked if I could get an extraction as I never received proper notice. I was then told, \"Also, due to staffing shortages and holiday training, we cannot do extractions, nor can we, as we are not responsible for lost or delayed mail.\"\n\nShe then told me that the best option was to come in at 7 in the morning to be the first in line. I told them that I work tomorrow and can't come in. I was told I didn't have to, but it would be at the \"small penalty\" of losing my medical and dental through California. So I did that and was one of the first 15 people waiting in line for the doors to open in cold, rainy weather. I got a ticket and waited for about an hour, thinking I could make it to work on time at 1030am. I sat and told them I was there for a medical adjustment with a medicare insurance adjuster.\n\nI was told they were not one and that the hour's wait was to set an appointment. I was told I could have called or come in earlier to have a specialist set it up. I told them I tried yesterday, and there were none available. I was hit with, \"Well, it's not my fault you poorly planned this. Seeing as you had 2 weeks.\" I told them about the late notice and a note in the file. The man eye-rolled me and just scribed out the latter on my ticket. Telling me to expect my number to be called again in 2 hours and that in the future to be \"more mindful of prep and time management.\"\n\nI called my boss; he was surprised but was cool with me coming in later as long as I kept him updated. And so I waited as eight became 9 and 9 became 10. I checked in as it should be around time for the meeting and was told due to a lack of adjusters today, there will likely be unseen delays. So I had just to wait, and I skipped breakfast to get there, messing with my phone and eating some of the fruit offered there. I messaged my boss every half hour as he was skeptical that any department could wait this long.\n\nby the 11 or 12th hour of the day, they started giving out parking passes as the parking lot had a two-hour limit and needed one. There was a small argument between one of the managers and staff members about whether they should ask the ones here over the limit just to move their cars as they technically violate the parking code, and we shouldn't be encouraging that behavior. a 3rd staff member had to step in just to hand out the passes.\n\nSo, by the 13th hour and a half, when I was falling asleep and wondering how much of my shift I would have left, someone poked me in the face and told me to look up. A new number had popped up. It was mine.\n\nI go through the door with paperwork in hand to see the Ajestor about what the problem was. It turns out they wanted to know if I had SSI payments and asked why I didn't have any from SSI. I told her that I wasn't on SSI, and she told me that was the problem. When applying for Calcover, I marked down that I had a federally recognized disability, autism. So they wanted to see if I was making too much for the program; when I didn't show any SSI payouts, i was flagged for possible fraud and they tried to ask me in person if I had any other forms of assisted living payouts or financial aid. I told them i was disqualified due to being able to work.\n\nSo the adjustor told me that next time, I needed to uncheck that box as legally, for health care, I didn't have a federally recognized disability as it implies I'm getting federal aid. So I waited nearly 6 hours for a 15-minute meeting asking me not to say I have autism on a federal level.\n\nMy god, why do we put people through this?",

Even though I’m an adult, they still try to control every aspect of my life my career, my choices, even how I spend my time. The moment I push back, I’m met with guilt-tripping and emotional manipulation: \"You’re disobedient.\" \"You’ve dishonored us.\" \"I will never forgive you until the Day of Judgment.\"\n\nAnd many of the things they react this way to aren’t even that big of a deal. For example, I’ve always wanted to cut my hair short, but my mother made it clear that if I ever did, she wouldn’t forgive me and that it would be a a sin hanging over my neck until Judgment Day. Even something as small as asking them to knock before walking into my bedroom turns into an argument, as if having basic privacy is an act of rebellion.\n\nAnd if not through words, they use threats. They tell me they’ll force me into marrying someone against my will or that they’d lock me in a room if I disobey them. Even if they don’t act on these threats, just hearing them is enough to make me feel powerless, like my life isn’t really mine to control.\n\nIt feels like their love is tied to control as if I can only be a \"good\" son or daughter if I follow everything they say without question. Their obsession with obedience and authority makes it impossible for them to see me as an independent person. It’s as if my life belongs to them, and any choice I make for myself is seen as betrayal.\n\nI know they believe they’re acting out of love, but it doesn’t feel like love. It feels like a cage. It’s exhausting to constantly be torn between my own happiness and their expectations. I’m tired of feeling like my worth is tied to how obedient I am. I just want to be allowed to make my own decisions without fear, guilt, or the weight of their disappointment crushing me.\n\nWhat hurts even more is that when I try to talk about this, I’m always met with the same dismissive responses: \"They’re your parents, you must obey them no matter what\" Society expects the owns who go through this to just accept it, as if their love should come with conditions and control. But I don’t want to spend my life suffocating under obligations I never agreed to.",

    "content": "I feel so self conscious in public. As a Uni student, I stayed home almost the entire semester last year because I just hate to be in crowded lectures halls.\n\nI feel so uncomfortable walking to the campus from the uni accommodations cause there’s so many people walking the same way.\n\nI haven’t made many friends cause I can’t talk to people, the only ones I have are through a group project and one that I knew earlier online.\n\nI sometimes really wanna study somewhere not in my room, but I can’t stand going to the libraries or cafes cause they’re always so crowded. It feels horrible\n\nThe main point is this. Sometimes when I’m at uni, I will feel so vulnerable, so self conscious, that I’ll go into a bathroom stall just to be alone for a moment. Not just bathrooms either. I’ll hide anywhere I can. I was once waiting to take an exam, there were so many people in line and the invigilators were late setting up, so I walked through this door in the hall where j was waiting, into this random break room where I probably wasn’t allowed to be, but I just couldn’t stand there.\n\nI spend a lot of time on how I look, how I dress, because I don’t want to stand out. If I look sharp and nondescript, I’m that much closer to invisible. Or at least that’s the rationale I’ve come up with, it’s sort of a subconscious behaviour.\n\nI can also barely leave my house without headphones. Maybe it’s some sort of protection, some defense mechanism that disconnects me from the world around me.\n\nI know my fears and anxieties are extremely exaggerated, logically there’s no reason for me to be nervous. Maybe there’s some underlying psychological disorder that’s causing it, I do have ADHD and autism, but I can’t afford therapy or any sort of treatment so I really just have to deal with it for now, until I graduate. But it mostly hurts because I know that it won’t just get better with time, I need to do something about it, the future won’t be brighter just because the present is so dark. But I’m trapped like this for now.",

    "content": "Over the past few months, I've had talking stages and situationships with six guys. After a while, they all asked for nudes, and some even threatened to leave me if I didn’t send them. I knew it wasn’t right, but I kept sending them anyway, without really thinking about the consequences. I kept convincing myself that maybe it would be different this time, that maybe they would care about me, but deep down I knew I was making a mistake. Once I sent them, I immediately felt disgusted with myself. The shame hit me hard, and I couldn’t stop thinking about what I’d done. I felt like I had given away something of myself, something I couldn’t get back, and it made me feel empty and worthless. I just wanted to feel wanted and loved, but now it feels like I’ve only been used. Long story short, they all left me—some blocked me, others ghosted me without a word. I know I should have stopped after the first guy, but I was so desperate for affection that I ignored my own worth and let myself get caught up in it. I feel so small and discarded now. Looking back, I’m filled with regret, and I can't shake the feeling that I was taken advantage of. The shame eats me alive, and I’m constantly terrified that my pictures are out there somewhere, being shared without my consent. It haunts me. I sent nudes to all six guys, and each time, I convinced myself it would lead to something real, but in the end, they all left, and I feel like I've only given pieces of myself away for nothing. Am I the only one who’s gone through this? I feel like I’ll never be able to undo the damage I've done to myself. Also, I’m still a virgin—can I still be considered a virgin if I’ve sent nudes? It feels like I’ve been used and thrown away, and that’s hard to live with.",

    "content": "I, (21 f)am dating my high school sweetheart again after years of not seeing or speaking to each other.\n\nWe met working a shitty fast food job in high school, and I fell in love with her almost immediately. She’s smart, so fun to be around, made me laugh and made me feel genuinely loved and appreciated for the first time in my life. I felt more confident, more comfortable around her. Not to mention she’s also the most gorgeous person i’ve ever seen.\n\nWe dated for a bit, and then she broke up with me towards the end of our senior year. I was heartbroken, and went off to college still processing and dealing with the breakup. As silly as it sounds and I know most people think this with their first love, but I really thought i was going to marry this girl. We chatted on and off throughout my freshman year, just normal shit like “hey how are you doing” and “we should catch up” before I finally decided it was finally time to fully move on and forget about her, so I blocked her on everything that summer, and deleted her number.\n\nWhile i still thought of her from time to time, I wasn’t angry or hurt about the breakup anymore, I had accepted that 17-year-olds know nothing about love, and all I can do with heartbreak is learn from it.\n\nFast forward to the beginning of my junior year of college, and I’ve dated on and off for years now and was in the process of trying to end a terrible long term relationship. I drove from college to my hometown, around 3 hours, to be with my friends after ending things while my new ex blew up my phone with calls and messages telling me what a horrible person i was for breaking up with her (I was not, she treated me terrible and refused to listen to me when I had an issue).\n\nMy friends and I decided to grab food and hangout in my car in one of the parking lots in our hometown. We pulled in, and I saw my first Ex’s car. It had a very distinctive bumper sticker, so I knew it was her. I didn’t get out or try to say anything, but my heart skipped a beat. I really truly believed I would never see this girl again. I debated reaching out, but in the end I unblocked her on snapchat and reached out with a simple “hey! were you at x lot the other night?” and we spent a few weeks catching up and then hung out for the first time in years.\n\nShe told me she missed me, and had always regretted the way things ended between us. I had no intention of trying to date again when I reached out, but I admit I did miss her too. That was about 9 months ago, and one thing led to another and now we are fully back together and it’s been amazing.\n\nI know it’s only been three years since we broke up originally, and I will say that I still don’t know anything about love. I’m a different person than I was in high school, and so is she. She makes me feel like the most beautiful person in the world, and i’ve never come close to feeling this way for anyone but her. All I do know is that as long as I’m able, I will do my best to love her the way she deserves, because as far as i’m concerned she does the same for me. I can’t help but wonder how my life would be different now if we hadn’t gone to that one parking lot that night.\n\nThank you for reading, xoxo",

I suffer from anxiety and depression and was diagnosed with Cyclothymic Disorder. So yes, I deal with body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria. I won't deny that it likely fuels a lot of my feelings.\n\nBut despite that, I am extremely self-conscious of my weight. And you'd think I'd be fine with it. I support body positivity heavily and would not ever judge others about their weight. Weight is not a proper scale of health, nor should it be tied to your self-worth; weight is weight. It only ever seems to be myself that I judge for my stomach.\n\nI have a potbelly. When I look in the mirror, all I see is my too-large stomach. And how it doesn't match the body that I'm SUPPOSED to have. And I do everything in my power to hide it because it causes me so much embarrassment. I wear high waisted skirts and pants, I'll tighten my belt just a little too much to tie it in, and I'll wear shape wear all so I don't have to acknowledge it. It makes me feel like less of a woman. Which I know is stupid. Women come in all shapes and sizes. Hell, my girlfriend is plus-sized and she's the most attractive woman I've ever laid eyes on. And yet, I still can't help but compare myself to other women, who have flat stomachs and small shoulders.\n\nI can never stick with exercise long enough to see any results. I like eating unhealthy, sugary foods. I eat a lot, in part to help my chest grow bigger, as HRT affects new fat distribution. I like to eat. And I live in the south, so you KNOW the food here is good. I'm terrible at forming habits. It feels like no matter what I do, I'll never have the body that I actually want.\n\nSo, sometimes, I wish I had an eating disorder. I've TRIED to give myself an eating disorder. I wish that I could go days without food and let my stomach shrink, just so I can finally look the way I want. I wish I could live on scraps of food. But I can't. Food is always there, mocking me until I finally give in.\n\nAnd the worst part is that I feel like I can't tell anybody. I can't talk to my girlfriend about it because it's a trigger for her own weight dysphoria. I have no friends I can talk to about it, and I'm terrified to talk to my parents about it. I hate the way my body looks and I wish I could just force it to look the way I want.",

The summer before COVID me and my parents moved to South Florida for the start of high school, and still we talked everyday. We would talk on Facetime for hours, fall asleep on the phone, play multiplayer games, and watch movies through shared play together. We got through college app season together, first jobs, and she was the first person I came out to. I've never had a sibling, but I'll always call her my sister. Even though we've practically been 1000+ miles apart for almost 6 years, she's always my #1 call. I tell her I love her everytime we hang up.\n\nD is in college in New Jersey for nursing, and just recently started sessions with a psychiatrist. She is actively on medication for depression and sleep.  She's always been a very introverted person, but recently she has been telling me that she's been going to different club meetups and parties. I was excited for her because this was a chance for her to make some friends and get out more. We downloaded Life360 together and I told her to keep her phone charged, text me when she got back, and have fun.\n\nI'm not dumb, I know kids are drinking alcohol and smoking at college events. Personally, I've made a life choice to stay away from that crap, but I don't hold judgment to my friends and others partaking. However, D has skipped the little white claws and high noons and started drinking straight vodka and tequila whenever she goes out. At first, when she told me, I just assumed she was taking a little shot here and there and calling it a day. However, some of her friends who know me and our relationship have let me know via Insta that she's drinking to the point of blacking out and keeps multiple bottles of alcohol in her dorm room. I've called D and told her that she's turning into an alcoholic, that she should stop going out as much, and that drinking leads to more destructive behaviors. She brushed me off and called me judgemental and stuck up. She's even blown off our gaming nights to go smoke with her friends.\n\nLast night she texted and told me she had to call me about something serious. She told me that she was drinking alone last night to the point of wanting to kill herself.  Her roommates had found her called the police and she was brought to a psych ward. She told me that the police and her dad found out about the alcohol and that she ended up coming out to her dad unintentionally. She’s also been lying to her psychiatrist and has been skipping her meds. She said she's been admitted and was calling to let me know so I wouldn't worry. I just told her that I love her like always, and that I'm glad she's still here.\n\nBut after getting off that phone call, all I could think was “I fucking told you so. I told you the dangers of drinking and you ignored me.” I’ll I feel is anger. I feel angry that she would think that way about herself and want to leave me and her parents and her little sister. I’m angry at her on campus “friends” who observed this behavior and didn’t stop it. They let her get this bad and I wasn’t there to help her. It kills me that I’m halfway across the country and can’t afford to see her and make sure she’s okay. And most of all, I’m upset that if she ended up killing herself, I wouldn’t be able to do anything about it. I’m just her former middle school friend on FaceTime a million miles away.\n\nI haven’t cried or felt sad and I’m not sure if this is normal.",

They let them make any decision they want even if it ends up with someone falling down the stairs with little to no consequences.\n\nThe one guy they are horrible with and let him get away with anything. He is extremely violent and has hurt me and others on numerous occasions. The only consequence he faces is when he breaks things he just doesn't get to use it till it's fixed or replaced. Which is nothing, the worst part is this guy is smart and knows he can do whatever he wants and get away with it.\n\nThe worst time I experienced this was when me and another staff took him out to buy him candy with his own money. He wanted to buy a knife (it was a butter knife) and we said 'no'. It took alot just to get him away from the knifes and out the door. We managed to get him some of his candy and as protocol we gave him some. Still mad with us daring to say 'no' he threw the candy at me and tried to run back to the store to \"get the knife so I can stab you f*ckers\". I had to do a hold to stop him from going too far and hurting someone else. However the hold we are trained to do doesn't restrain both hands so they decided to scratch at my arm hard, to the point I was bleeding. It took a long time to calm him down and get him back in the car. The part that broke me was the fact he wanted me the one shaking and crying to apologize and my coworker who did nothing but call management to let them know what was going on also tried to get me to apologize. I couldn't cause I went completely non-verbal and just got in the car. I missed a week of work cause I was terrified of that participant and was locked up in my room. I filed a report for injuries, but nothing came of it.\n\nNow I just hate the participant. I'll never do anything to hurt or try and upset him, but I will always hate him and wish for his downfall.\n\nOne thing I want to note is that I understand alot of the people I work with can't control how they act. This one in particular also struggles to control their anger. However I've seen them handle 'no' from their parents and staff he likes and he was completely fine. He just doesn't like me and gets upset any time I ask him to do something or deter him away from dangerous things (I'm not rude about it I always ask very nicely I'm just not a guy or pretty enough so he hates me).\n\nTLDR: I despise a guy cause he can get away with anything he wants, including hurting others and he knows it.",

    "content": "I read a quote a long time ago that went something like this: \"A person dies their first death when their body dies, their second death the last time they are remembered by someone who knew them, and their third death the last time their name is spoken.\" It popped into my head yesterday and has been weighing on me like a mountain. I just need to fire this off into the void.\n\nI've struggled all of my life with only feeling loved if I was valuable or useful. Affection, attention, and admiration have always been transactional with family and friends. I learned quickly that if I wasn't useful I found myself the target of malice, anger, open disdain, or annoyance at best. I feel like I have always been expected to help others by any means necessary and frequently at a detriment to myself. When I don't, or am not able to do so, I feel like I become invisible until I'm needed again.\n\nI live in rural Texas and was raised a sheltered conservative christian homeschooler. I grew into my own person with so many questions and curiosities that were incompatible with conservative christianity and falling into line as my parents wanted. I learned their love was conditional as long as I obeyed and didn't question anything. They kicked me out at 16 for refusing to see a conversion therapy counselor, after I was outed as being gay by my sister.\n\nI had made two friends around that time who I stayed with and became very close to. I've seen them become married and buy houses and have kids. We spent so much time together and I have been eternally grateful for their friendship. I have read stories and know people tend to drift apart when they begin having families. I've been fully prepared for when it happens to me.\n\nFor the past year, after many years of failures and bad experiences trying to date and constantly being ghosted (even in two different few-months-long relationships), I met someone I really truly connected with and was able to fall in love with. He is an incredible man and I still love him dearly. Hard times fell on us and he lost his job, and his car. I have tried my best to keep us both afloat. He has been so ashamed of his situation that he insisted on taking a break in our relationship and moved back in with his mom. I begged and begged him not to leave me or give up on me, but he did anyway.\n\n----------\n\n-- This leads to today. My birthday was yesterday and I turned 26. I haven't heard from my separated partner for a month and haven't seen him in almost two months. I can only assume he broke his phone but I fear I've been ghosted again, but this time by someone I thought I was going to spend forever with. He either couldn't or didn't try to get a hold of me to say anything for my birthday. He knows where I live, and work, and my schedule. It was our one year anniversary on Monday, but I guess I shouldn't be counting that since we are apart.\n\nNone of my friends said anything. No one called or texted, bothered to say hi, or check in. No one has asked me about my separated partner in over a month and they all knew him the whole year we were together. No one has asked if I'm okay.\n\nNo one at work remembered or said anything. I have my birthday circled and marked on my calendar at my desk.\n\nI got a late text from my mother but it was just a gif saying happy birthday. She didn't call me for the first time, didn't even write out a message like she has done in years past. None of my siblings or any other family said anything.\n\nI truly feel forgotten. No one can be bothered to think of me or remember me until they need furniture moved, a truck to tow something for them, or something fixed. I feel like I have felt my second death before my first, in a way. Not that I'm permanently forgotten but that on a day that is personal and matters to me, I'm completely invisible to the ones I thought cared about me. I've been forgotten until I'm needed, like a dusty power tool in the shed out back.\n\nSomeday when I'm gone, will I be missed? Or will my absence just be inconvenient?\n\nI just want to feel wanted.",

That it was BDSM. That anything I didn’t like was fine but wasn’t his fault. (Mind you, BDSM requires specific, lucid, ongoing, and enthusiastic consent, and a safeword, which we did not have.) I think my brain chemistry was permanently changed that night because I sobbed in his arms and allowed myself to believe him. The gaslighting, heavy swings between silent treatment and intense attention, casual cruelty in our conversations, and lovebombing increased from there.\n\nLater on, D coerced me into group sex within which I was sexually assaulted by a stranger multiple times at his direction, before he assaulted me, damaged property, and ran before the police were called. He convinced me again that he thought I had consented to everything. He masterfully gaslit and lied and manipulated me and my memories felt untrustworthy. He convinced me I was going to ruin his life if I pressed charges. Under the trauma bond that had formed that I mistook for love, he convinced me to rescind my statement to the police. And we “made up”.\n\nThe last time I saw him was the worst night of my life and the last time he raped me. I had been drinking all night at his direction, and once we started, he did not stop. Not when I was choking and struggling under him, not when I was crying and begging him to stop, not when I went limp, not when I had lost a pint of blood, not when I passed out. I am lucky to be alive.\n\nBut in the morning, the trauma had taken most of my memories. I pretended I was okay, but he knew what he had done. When I realized I had to seek medical attention the next day, he told me I was overreacting and ignored my pleas for aftercare. I begged him for compassion and promised he’d done nothing wrong, but he refused. As the days passed, my memories started to return. As they did, I started to try to hold him accountable. But as I’m sure many of you know, narcissism does not allow for accountability. Every attempt of mine to break up with him was foiled, until he finally decided to “break up” with me.\n\nMy horrific memories continued to return to me, and so I went to the police. Anyone want to guess how that went?\n\nWhen they closed my case citing insufficient evidence, I was devastated. But I felt more than anything that I needed to warn the next woman. I posted my experience anonymously, and a woman came forward that he had drugged and SA’d years prior. More second-hand stories started coming out of the woodwork. So I posted him again. My case was closed, but my experience was real, and I realized people needed to know he was going to do it again and had probably done it before.\n\nYeah, not probably. Definitely. Dozens of women in a weekend in my extended circle of mutuals, and more outside of that, started sharing their experiences of abuse at D’s hand. Everything vile under the sun—sexual harassment, druggings, assault, blackmail, theft, manipulation, coercion, violence, and rape. Over MANY years.\n\nD is a true serial rapist, abuser, and predator. His disarming charm and looks and fake feminism and subsequent manipulation and gaslighting had not just worked on me, but friends and roommates and coworkers and romantic partners. It has been overwhelming, and heartbreaking, and sickening. But when I went to the cops, I thought I was alone. When I shared my experience, I thought I was alone. And now I know I’m the farthest thing from alone. And you bet litigation and a reopened case are incoming.\n\nBut I’m writing this post because I learned tonight about some of the things he did to another ex-girlfriend. Worse than he did to me, worse than you can imagine. For a lot longer. My body has been shaking non stop and I am livid after seeing photo evidence and hearing her story. Every time I think this whole situation can’t get worse, it does.\n\nI am so beyond angry at him. I am so disgusted with myself that I allowed him into my bed and into my life—that I stayed after he showed me his true colors. My belief system is so deeply rocked to my core, that a human being can be this consistently evil and on top of that, not get caught for a decade. I am terrified that he is going to come after me for exposing him to the larger community. And I am furious at all of the people around him who had to have enabled his horrific behavior. His family members who know of his history of abusing women, his male friends who listened to female friends try to share their experiences and brushed them off or gaslit them. His roommates who participated in or witnessed his crimes and kept quiet. The fucking POLICE who have done nothing to keep my city safe from this man or take my reports seriously or compassionately, despite him having multiple prior arrests and restraining orders against him. And most of all heartbroken at all the women before me who felt so alone and like they couldn’t come forward. And I feel guilty that I’m just a little bit angry at all of them too, because I wish just one of them had felt like I did, that I had to stop this from happening to the next girl. Because I was the next girl. And I’m forever changed.\n\nI don’t know where to go from here other than to a courtroom, but so much work lies ahead of me. Of us. I’m in therapy and taking each day as it comes. Several of the other survivors who’ve had years to heal are standing behind me and helping holding the pieces together, but it’s hard. And after what I heard today, I feel broken.\n\nBut I’m also spiritually wound tighter than I ever have been. Maybe the universe somehow connected us to give him one last chance to learn empathy and be a good person and partner, and give me one last chance to step away from men who disrespect my boundaries the first time. And we both failed. But the result of those failures is broken cycles—I will never let a man disrespect me again for the rest of my life, and D will not be able to continue his pattern of abuse. Perhaps our paths crossed for me to be my own savior whilst being his undoing. All I know for sure is that I am not fucking alone anymore. None of us are alone anymore. And I’m hopeful that our power in numbers will deliver him the consequences he deserves.\n\nThank you for reading. Please, MEN, and women, and everyone in between, believe. women. when they come forward. Believe them the first time. This incredibly fucked up situation should never ever happen again. And to survivors everywhere: you are not alone.",

    "content": "This is a bit long, but it's also how it happened.\n\nSunday afternoon my wife, daughter, daughters-friend, the dog and myself went to the river to play and collect some pretty rocks since it was so nice outside. We live within walking distance and on the way back, we were about to leave the levee along our normally used path when both my wife and I spotted something on the levee about 50 feet away, we couldnt tell what it was. I asked my wife to take the dogs leash so I could go check, and to please take the girl a little way further away while I go make sure it's just garbage.\n\nAs I got closer and saw it was a person, I quickly told my wife and asked her to call 911. I went over to the person and found out it was a young looking girl, and she was still breathing. I ran back to my wife who was on the phone with emergency services and relayed the info that it was a young female, still breathing, not conscious. I then ran back to the girl and tried loudly talking/shouting at her to see if I could get some reaction, but I was very hesitant to touch her since I could see she was actively breathing. Her phone, which had been in her open hand the entire time, began to make ringing noises and I tried to answer it but it was some kind of Instagram thing and not an actual call, I dunno. I set her phone back into her hand and about 30 seconds later a police officer showed up. I waved at the officer to get his attention to the exact location. He quickly ran up to me and gave her a very brief checkout before administering a dose of narcan. He waited a few seconds and began to shake her and shouting a bit to get her awake, which resulted in a moan and partial roll from her. He kept trying to get her awake for maybe another 30 seconds and the ambulance showed up, they almost drove by but saw me waving at them and managed to just barely make the turn. 3 EMT's hurried up to us and checked her vitals and pupils and in the next 90 seconds they had her standing and eyes open. I figured the was nothing else they needed me for, I thanked them and quickly got out of the way. A side note, I'm very impressed with the reaction time of both the police and the ambulance, they were both on site with within 5 minutes of my wife calling them.\n\nThe next day at work, I mentioned this to a coworker whose father I know owns the trailer part right next to where I found the girl. My coworker found out more about what happened, and I hate it. Apparently the girl had gotten some weed from her cousin which had been laced/contaminated with fentanyl. It also sounds like her cousin was with her, and left her laying there when she collapsed. Also found out she had to be administered 2 more doses of narcan while in the ambulance and that she was only 13 years old. Also learned I sort of know her. I actually know her parents as I worked with them both about 10 years ago, I remember seeing her as a small 2-3 year old kid, haven't seen her since though so I obviously didn't recognize her.\n\nI'm glad it was my family who found her and she will be ok, someone could have easily drug her away down into the trees and she would have never been seen or heard again. I'm terrified for my daughter, who is about half this girls age. I can't believe how close I ended up being to her family.\n\nI dunno how to end this, but I needed to share the story. Teach your kids how to be smart and responsible, you won't always be there to tell them yourself.\n\nAnd always wash your hands after touching random objects. I vigorously washed my hands when I got home since I touched her phone which could have been contaminated with fentanyl for all I knew.",

He seemed easygoing and respectful, so when he asked if I wanted to meet for a cigarette, not at my place, just somewhere outside in the neighborhood.\n\nWhen he arrived, we sat outside and talked for a bit. Then he suggested going to a nearby hotel. Only if I wanted to, of course, but it was cold and dark, and he said we could just sit inside, have a drink, and talk. He promised he wouldn’t try anything, that he didn’t want to be intimate either. He seemed harmless, trustworthy even. So I agreed, telling him I only had two hours anyway.\n\nAt first, he was still friendly. But as time passed, he started acting off. I kept my distance, positioning myself in a way that made it clear I wasn’t comfortable with any physical closeness. Then he went to the bathroom. When he came back, he was only in his boxers.\n\nI told him to put his clothes back on and that I was leaving. That was the moment I felt truly unsafe. I got up, heading for the door when he grabbed me by my ponytail and pulled me to the floor.\n\nI fought as hard as I could, but he knew exactly how to overpower me. At first, he didn’t rape me he enjoyed me fighting back. He hit me, yanked my hair, and choked me so hard I couldn’t even make a sound. He threw me all over the room. My body is covered in bruises, even on my throat. And then, at some point, he raped me. I pleaded for him to stop, but he just threatened me over and over again.\n\nEventually, my phone rang. I saw my chance and told him I had to answer it, that my friend would be suspicious if I didn’t call her back immediately, and that she had my location (she didn’t and it wasn’t a friend calling I was lying). I told him I’d just meet her quickly and then come back. He let me go and I left.\n\nIf this had happened to someone else, I would never blame them. But standing in my own shoes, I can’t stop thinking: What the fuck is wrong with me? Who goes to a hotel with a guy they just met? I’m almost 30. I should know better. I should have learned my lesson by now.\n\nBut I don’t feel scared. I don’t feel sad. I don’t even feel vulnerable. And that makes it hard to process what actually happened to me.",

I told her I did have to do another one but the next placement is on the 20th of march. she got very mad screamed at me and threw things while yelling what a disappointment I had become.\n\nI have to add, the last couple of months have been hard on me, my boss had a big problem with my appearance( for understanding I worked at a high class gym in my city) because I am very muscular and outshine him in a lot of ways, I also have a buzzcut but that shouldn‘t matter. because of my boss bullying and nagging me the last 7 months( yes it started in august), I quit, today I handed in my letter of resignation, I couldn‘t do it anymore, working 50-60 hours a week for an ungrateful boss that hates me and wants to fire me anyways isn‘t my thing I don‘t take disrespect. I‘ve been into working out for a couple of years and got my personal trainer license in winter of 2023, my mom was so proud. Yet she didn‘t work, my first paycheck went entirely into her purse, I didn‘t mind because I like responsibility and do plan to have kids in the next few years, so I have to be able to provide for people, yet she blew all my money on cigarettes cheap alcohol and gas to drive my sister and me to school, oh and the rent and electricity bill of course, there are no gas bills because we heat with wood. I was and am fine with that nothing wrong there, but after almost a year of unemployment for her she started becoming unbearable, she started yelling at me daydrinking, at one point she tried to punch and fight me physically. I begged one of her friends to find her a job at their workplace so she could finally get some fresh air, she had a boyfriend whom I got along with very well, very intelligent man, but her stubborn attitude and her narcissistic behavior obviously drove him away, I couldn‘t even blame him, in the time of my mothers unemployment I raised my half-sister (13/ F) drove her to practice on my bike,until I crashed it beyond repair, I made arrangements for her to be driven and picked up from everywhere. my mom started working, it is nice to see her happy and thriving, but she always had a bad temper and a lot of self hatred. I love my mother, I have always loved her for every sacrifice she made for me. but I stopped feeling anything towards her today.\n\nafter a heated argument, me staying mostly calm because I‘m the type to shut down and become quiet once I‘m yelled at, and my mother yelling at me. She said, that I don‘t have money, I don‘t have assets, I don‘t even work anymore, and that all this bullshit that has been piling up was too much for her to handle. I asked her if she wants me to move out and she said I should fuck myself and go to hell or wherever else I wanna go, I‘m in tears. I‘ve been living in this house for 7 years, a comfortable life that I tried to sustain for as long as possible. I have a job offer in chicago, but I don‘t have the funds to go there, I don‘t have enough money to buy a one way ticket for me and my fiancée (18/F) and one month of rent+ a downpayment on an apartment. I could move there but it‘s 10000km away. I have had reasons to move out before but decided to stick around so my sister has a male influence growing up, now she‘s a teenager and I‘ll never stop being there for her. I have packed my bag, I have prepared to get away from my home which I‘ve lived in for so long. I‘m applying for jobs tomorrow, going to a jobcenter, getting all my documents, renewing my CV and just applying at every gym I know.

    "content": "!no names are real names! For some context let me start by explains my family tree and giving some history. I 20 female am the oldest child. My parent we’ll call them Bob and Lynda (not real names) had three kids me and a set of boy/girl twins ( East and brook). Then my mom cheated and got with a guy (Tony) and had two half brothers (Timmy and tommy). She then cheated again with a new guy (Bret) who was also cheating on his wife. He had two kids with his ex wife (Kat and Sam) my now step sisters. And my mom Lynda and Bret had two more kids (spike and Leo). Meanwhile my dad and step mom (Molly) had one daughter (Katie). So there’s 9 kids  total with my mom, in order it’s: me, East and brook, Kat, Timmy, Tommy, Sam, Spike Leo. My parents had 50/50 custody of us given to them by the court. My dad tried reporting my mom for abuse and the court did nothing about it. It’s very pro mommy where we live. My mom Lynda and Bret are very abusive parents. They used to to things like hit us, throw us outside, make us stand on chairs for hours on end without being able to get down, put shock collars on us and starve us. I remember once that I missed a spot mopping the floor and they made me use my toothbrush to clean it ( no I didn’t get a new one). We were also very low income but my mom and Bret always found a way to take trips to Disney and have expensive date nights. Them being out often left me home alone with kids for hours if not days at a time. This went on from the time I was 11-16. At 16 I finally said enough was enough and made the decision to live with my dad. I got thearapy and have been doing much better. It’s been 4 years since I left. I have tried to fix things with my mom and Bret multiple times but my mom always falls short and blames me for leaving instead of herself for her actions. However when I left to stay with my dad my sister brook chose to stay with my mom without giving anyone an explanation. My dad wasn’t bad to her but they where never close. My sister brook is my moms golden Child, her favorite and her mini. My sister was a snake my whole childhood and could get away with murder. So she left my dad and never looked back. Well this year she turned 18 and on her birthday my mom had posted a video of her asking my step dad to adopt her and today was the day of her adoption. I found out through my moms ex baby daddy Tony that she was being adopted because Timmy messaged him about being taken out of school to witness it. He shared the messages with me and then I shared them to my step mom and other family. Not my dad because in these 4 years he has been grieving my sister leaving and finding this out will only hurt more.I’m devastated for my dad and have left it up to my step mom to tell him. I just cannot understand what there thoughts are and why my sister has done any of what she’s done in the last 4 years but I cannot say I’m happy for her. But I wanted to get this out and I just needed to vent it somewhere. I guess in the 4 years I’ve been gone I’ve really been holding in a lot of what happened to me and still cannot find it in myself to let go or forgive them. Thank you Reddit for listening.",

    "title": "My ex cheated on me multiple times, used me for money, and still won’t leave me alone",
    "content": "I don’t even know where to start, but I need to get this off my chest. My ex (26F) and I (26M) were together for a long time and have a 4-year-old son together. I was completely loyal to her, but she put me through hell.\n\nBefore we were evicted from our home last year, she was already actively cheating on me—first with a guy named Liam. She would stay at his place while I was home taking care of our two stepkids (5 and 8) and our son (4). I was struggling financially because she was out drinking all the time with her friends, spending money we didn’t have, while I stayed home looking after the kids.\n\nThen, in December 2022, she started cheating on me with a different guy—Mark. She promised over and over that she’d stop, but she never did. We ended up getting evicted in April 2023, and she moved in with her brother. I was staying elsewhere, and she had our son and her two kids. During this time, she kept lying to me about where she was living. She said she was at her brother’s, but in reality, she had secretly moved in with Mark. I found out when I logged into her accounts—yeah, I know I shouldn’t have, but it was the only way to get the truth because she compulsively lies. (She was living at her brothers for a couple months then after the wedding she moved in with him)\n\nShe even took Mark to her sister’s wedding, bought him clothes for it, and kept telling me we were going to fix things. She made dozens of promises—saying she’d visit me with the kids, bake me cakes, buy me gifts—but she never showed.\n\nEven after I found out everything in October, she still asked me for money in December, saying Mark wouldn’t help her. And I gave it to her, like an idiot. In total, I’ve given her around £3,000 because she made it seem like we’d work things out. I even paid for the carpets in her new house because she told me she’d cut Mark off once she moved. But now I know that was just another lie.\n\nThroughout all of last summer, she was constantly gaslighting me. I caught her sending nudes to Mark while playing Stardew Valley with him late at night while I was asleep. She’d go out every night with him, and whenever I confronted her, she’d call me crazy and make me feel like I was the one in the wrong. At one point, she and Mark even tried to get me to be friends with him—we all played games together, and I had no idea what was actually going on behind my back.\n\nEven now, when I ignore her, she acts upset and says \"there's still something there.\" But all she ever does is use me. She sends me explicit pictures and videos while claiming she “just wants to be friends.” And when I tell her she’s confusing me, she shuts down the conversation because it's “too stressful” for her. Meanwhile, I’ve been the one supporting her, giving her money, and being there for her when she needed help.\n\nI also hate her friend Emily because she covered for her constantly. she’s cousins with Mark and was helping her lie to me the whole time.\n\nOne of the worst moments was when I visited her brother’s place while she was staying there. I found used tissues under the bed, and she swore up and down they weren’t what I thought they were—but come on, it was obvious. It was disgusting. And yet she still called me crazy. (She actually made out they were snot cause she had a cold but there was like 50 tissues under the bed lmao)\n\nWhenever I ask her what she wants, she just says, \"I don't know. I need to live alone and figure things out because I’m not well mentally or physically.\" But if that were true, why is she still stringing me along, keeping me as a backup plan while she’s with him?\n\nShe tells me I’m “stalkative” and that I’m the bad guy, but I only ever found out the truth by logging into her stuff—because without doing that, I’d still be believing her lies. I know I should’ve just walked away, but I love her. I actually cared.\n\nMaybe I’m just too nice, or maybe I’m an idiot. But a part of me always thought this was just a rough patch, that we could fix things and go back to how we were before all of this. Maybe she’s sick mentally, or maybe she’s just a terrible person. I don’t know.\n\nThe one thing I do know is I feel used, betrayed, and like I’ve wasted so much time and money on someone who never really cared about me the same way. And the worst part? She still wants me to keep all of this quiet.\n\nAt this point, I feel like I should just tell Mark everything and ruin things for her, because I don't think it's fair that after everything she got it all.\n\n(This is actually typed by me)\n\nLike I'm currently on my parents sofa, I barely see my son, I keep trying to find private or council places but I'm getting nowhere. My depression is genuinely awful like I feel like after everything I have nothing I've just lost it all and no matter how much I try it won't get better. I used to be depressed at uni, even tried to kill myself on my birthday but my flat mates actually got me a birthday cake and stuff and it put me off for a bit, like it was genuinely heartbreaking.\n\nThing is my credit score is completely fucked as well cause I let her use my credit card and my very account and stuff and my credit score is tanked to hell because of it.\n\nLike I am genuinely screwed and it's like trying to claw myself out of quicksand, struggling is just making me sink further into it.\n\nI don't know what do you guys think? Is there a chance do I give an ultimatum or just do I give into everything\n\n[I've ran this through chatgpt because originally I was just trying to get this off my chest through it and get some advice but I figured here would be a good place to get some Human advice and it'd help get rid of all the identifying details\n\nIf anything doesn't make sense just comment it and I'll elaborate on it cause I've noticed a few details are wrong but  I mostly wanted to get it off my chest anyway]",

But I also noticed on Tuesday that I was feeling really low and didn't know why. Same yesterday, and today is even worse. It occurred to me that my brain isn't getting its usual constant dopamine supply throughout the day from checking Facebook and seeing that I have notifications or new info to read (even if it turns out to be nothing interesting). I know that social media is engineered to give you a hit of dopamine with every notification to keep you engaged and coming back for more. And I'm starting to think my brain is literally addicted and I'm going through withdrawal. I'm actually really proud of myself and given how awful I feel right now, I feel even more resolve to break this addiction and not go back to how I was. But man, I feel like shit. I just feel so depressed and want to do nothing but sleep. I keep wanting snacks even though I'm not hungry, and I think that's my brain desperately seeking other sources of dopamine. This sucks.

I know my parents and family love me and I had a great environment growing up. But I'm just... detached. Like, I gained the ability to cry on command to feign sadness when something bad happens, but in reality, I don't feel anything at all. When my mother died, I know I was supposed to feel sad. I know I was supposed to love her as she did me, very much... but I failed at both. I really tried.\n\nI've had relationships in the past where my partners would tell me they love me, but I couldn't feel the same way. They treated me amazing and I try my best to be a good partner, but I could never get attached to someone or care for someone in that way.\n\nI know it sounds cruel, but I just can't seem to love anyone nor care for anyone no matter how hard I try.\n\nI find it hard to feel what others feel. For example, when my friend's dad died, I knew I needed to feel sad, but I just didn't. I didn't understand what he was feeling so I just tried my best to be there for him and take care of him. Even though I couldn't relate to him at all. It's just, I know this is the action that should be done, but I have no emotions attached to it.\n\nWhen I got a perfect GPA in college, and my cousin who was in the same college as me, in the same course did worse, I knew she didn't feel good, but I cant describe what that would feel like, if that makes sense. I mean, I've been bad or failed at things before and I just felt indifferent. So when my family was praising me and comforting my cousin, I was so confused because I had to feign being happy and sad at the same time.\n\nIt's so frustrating because I want to feel for people, but I can't look at people as anything else other than just... people. I can't relate to their struggles even though I try. I know I'm supposed to but I can't. I've been acting this whole time but I have no idea what's wrong.\n\nI know how I'm supposed to feel but I can't feel it. Everything is just monotone for me and things that happen just happen. I know what emotions are and it's so hard for me to feel them or relate to anyone else's. Idk I just wanted to put it out there and maybe find out what's wrong with me...",

    "title": "My ex-husband broke me…",
    "content": "This is going to be a long one—sorry in advance.\n\nI (29F) got divorced three years ago from my manipulative ex-husband after being with him for 6.5 years. We had no kids because he didn’t want any responsibility. I’ve moved on from him in the sense that I don’t want him back, but I feel like the emotional and psychological abuse I went through changed me in ways I can’t undo.\n\nWhenever a potential new partner comes into my life, I can’t seem to accept them. The moment I see something I don’t agree with, even if it’s small, I start emotionally distancing myself to avoid getting hurt. I don’t even know what a healthy relationship looks like.\n\nOn top of that, I live in a Middle Eastern country where everyone constantly pressures me to get married before I become “too old.” It just makes me feel worse—like the manipulation and mistreatment I faced really broke something in me, and I don’t know how to fix it.\n\nWhat my ex did to me\n\nTo summarize: he cheated on me multiple times, and I only found out about all of them at once. He never got me gifts—only things he wanted me to have so he could show off his status. He never initiated intimacy; it was always up to me. He didn’t want kids, but the moment he felt like I was pulling away, he suddenly wanted them—basically trying to baby trap me even though it was obvious our relationship was already over.\n\nWhen I needed help—like when my car wouldn’t start or the faucets were bursting—he never answered my calls. I had to handle everything myself. He claimed he had OCD about cleanliness but would leave trash and dirty clothes everywhere, expecting me to clean up after him just because I was a stay-at-home wife at the time.\n\nFinancially, he cut me off (except for food and clothes) when I got a part-time job and started making more than him for like three months. In my culture, the husband is supposed to provide for his wife, but as soon as I had my own income (which was around 4k a year, yes a year), he refused to spend a single cent on me unless it was food or clothes (had to pay my own cell-service, gas, etc… which he previously paid for).\n\nWhen we traveled, it was never about me—it was just because he wanted to see the world, and his friends couldn’t afford to go with him. When I put effort into our relationship—planning picnics, buying games so we could play together, setting up dates, booking hotels—he ignored it all, (yes I slept in a hotel by myself which is a huge NO-NO in my culture because he wanted to hang out with his boys instead). I tried everything to make it work, and the only complaint he had about me was that I “didn’t clean enough.” He would literally swipe his finger over a light switch, show me the dust, and act like that was a real issue.\n\nOur last conversation? He told me I was perfect, that he was sorry he cheated, and that was it. Only when he realized that I was really leaving him, that he started crying in the corner of the apartment we had like a 3-year-old toddler. 2 days later he was like I did everything for you and it’s all your fault I cheated… :)\n\nWhere I’m at now\n\nThe cheating destroyed me. I never even checked his phone because I respected his privacy, and in return, I got blindsided. I lost myself completely. People see me as this cheerful, bubbly person, but it’s just a facade so my parents don’t worry about me.\n\nAfter the divorce, I moved back in with them (which is normal in my culture). My dad even built me a small studio flat upstairs, so I have my own space. But I stopped working, so I have no income. Even if I got a full-time job, the salaries here are terrible—around $15,500 USD a year, even though I have nine years of experience in marketing and content. Realistically, I should be making $20K–$30K, but that’s a whole other issue.\n\nI just feel like I have nothing to live for. My biggest dream in life is to have a family and kids, but the dating scene is discouraging. I do have hobbies—I love reading, drawing, playing video games, watching anime/TV/movies, taking walks, and doing at-home pilates. So it’s not like I do nothing with my life, but inside, I feel completely empty.\n\nMy struggle with marriage\n\nI’m very traditional—not because of my family, but because I truly believe a husband should take care of his wife. That doesn’t mean I expect to be spoiled and contribute nothing, but I don’t think it should be my responsibility to cook, clean, and do everything 24/7.\n\nMost men here, though, want a wife to take care of them. I keep getting set up with men through my family, and it’s always the same story—they expect a woman to be a maid, not a partner. I feel like I’m running out of time to get married, and it’s making me anxious because I really want to build a family.\n\nMy thoughts are all over the place, and I don’t know what to do.\n\nPS: This is the first time I’ve ever shared something this personal. I don’t even know if this makes sense. English isn’t my first language, so sorry if it’s messy.",

    "title": "[FINAL UPDATE] I went on a date with my ex-husband last night.",
    "content": "Update from this post.\n\nMy (35M) ex-husband (36M) and I recently reconnected. I won't go over the details of why we split or our reconciliation since I'm sure the average redditor can click buttons and most likely read. He was the one taking me out, and promised that it would, in his words, \"knock my socks off\" to make up for his neglect of me. He sure as hell delivered.\n\nA little backstory, we've been together since we were 15 and 16 respectively, and have never moved out of our hometown. This year would have been our 20th anniversary (of getting together, not marriage). We were dating secretly for about five years before our parents caught us one day during summer break. The fallout from finding out their son was gay actually made his parents split. His dad wanted to send him away to conversion therapy. He's seen his father maybe once per year on average, and every time he's incredibly cold towards me. Would never refer to me as his son-in-law, only my husband's \"pal.\" I wonder why. Anyway, not what you're here to read. I'll get on with the lore.\n\nHe picked me up from the house and wouldn't tell me where we were going, but told me to dress warmly. He ended up taking me to the place where we met: a run down ice skating rink in our town. He used to do hockey, and I spent some time trying to learn figure skating until people started beating me up for it. Both sports would practice at the same time and I remember barely being able to keep my eyes off him. We went skating, I tried to pull off a few of the moves I remembered (he only had to catch me from falling on my ass once or twice, and I won't complain about an attractive man that I love hooking his arm around my waist), and we spent an hour or so there until our feet hurt. At one point I said that my face was getting cold, so he skated around in front of me and placed his gloved hands on my cheeks to warm me up. I just about burned a hole in the ice from how hard I was blushing, I swear to God.\n\nHe wasn't done then. We left and went to dinner, specifically the restaurant where we had our first date. It's a cheap hole-in-the-wall place, seeing as we were poor teenagers when we first met. We chatted and ate food that probably took 5 years off our lives, he was an incorrigible flirt, and even held my hand underneath the table like he did all those years ago. I know I said I never stopped loving him, and I stand by that, but I think I somehow fell in love with him a thousand times over again during that meal.\n\nAt the end of dinner, he asked if I had energy for one more simple thing, to which I agreed. He took me a while out of town to a dark sky zone park, specifically the one where he proposed to me ten years ago. He set out a blanket to sit on and another to cuddle under, and we went stargazing all bundled up together. You never know how much you miss the sound of someone's heartbeat until you haven't heard it for so long. We shared a bottle of sparkling grape juice in plastic champagne flutes and dumb, giggly kisses. It felt so similar yet so different. He told me in a moment of quiet that he loved me, and oh, God. It took everything I had not to cry. I barely hesitated before asking if he wanted to change venues. He seemed surprised, but eagerly accepted.\n\nI ended up at his place, as some of you may have seen from my edit on my second post yesterday. I wanted to take it slower than this, but it was so hard to. I was so starved of affection and hadn't been intimate with anyone for just about six years. I'm gonna keep what happened at his between us, but all I'll say is that his medication was no issue and all of you should be jealous. I woke up in his bed this morning, reached over for him, and pulled him close just like I used to do. I haven't been this happy in a long time. We had a sleepy discussion and decided to get back together, but we're not using the term boyfriends. It just feels weird after all this time. So he's my partner, or my lover. He's mine.\n\nThank you, reddit. Wouldn't have done it without a little push from the internet. Let's see where all this goes.",

We have gone on many friendly dates to restaurants and coffee shops and we have made that a routine thing. We share so many interest like our music, taste in films, food, and fashion sense. We have even gotten matching tattoos together. Whenever either of us has something happen to us we immediately share it to each other. She has only been in two relationships and in both relationships she was only used for sex and her body. I have been in a similar situation where someone will be with me just for sex. But I don’t care at all about her body, don’t get me wrong she has an incredible one but it’s not what I’m into. I’m into the way that she talks with me and the way that we share jokes. I know that If I was in a relationship and we never had any sex or I never even saw her naked I would still be incredibly in love with her because I’m in love with her soul and her being more than her physical body. I feel that I could give her anything she wants or needs in a relationship and I wanna tell her about my feelings, but I’m so afraid that if I do that I’ll lose and if I do lose her than there’s no point in me being in this existence.",

After filling out their application, they told me I should go to the hospital because they are not qualified to handle patients experiencing suicidal thoughts.\n\nI had my reservations about doing that since public healthcare, especially regarding mental health, albeit free, is pretty bad in my country.\n\nFast forward one month, I managed to get two job offers, one in a translation company, which is a 9 to 5, and an evening teaching job.\n\nI was pretty excited about the success in getting not one, but two job offers so I decided to take it easy and not exaust myself with work. I thought that the best course of action for me was to start doing both jobs until I figured out which one I liked more so I could focus on that job or even quit the other one.\n\nMonday was my first day on the translation job. In short, it went pretty horribly. The \"translation\" job turned out to be a regular office job, where I had to scan documents and edit Word files, and it did not involve any sort of translation or useful skill that could help me further my career. Bear in mind, I have had several translation jobs and I am not a complete beginner.\n\nAfter coming back home, I just started crying and felt desperate because that unpleasant experience on my first day on the job brought up all my repressed emotions to the surface, uncertainty about my career, loneliness, and the fact that all people my age have accomplished something in their lives except me.\n\nTherefore, I gathered my courage and took a taxi to the hospital, hoping to find a therapist with whom I can talk about my problems. I went to the ER and talked to the nurse working at the reception, who was very compassionate and patient. Then, she led me to talk to a psychiatrist, who after listening to my woes politely informed me that I would be transferred to a psychiatric hospital (or a mental asylum if you like) since the hospital is full and they can't take me. He also told me that I should not try and leave the hospital otherwise they would be required by law to call the police since I said that I sufferred from suicidal thoughts.\n\nThen, I waited for two hours until the ambulance arrived and an ambulance crew member escorted me to the car, holding me by my arm so that I would not try to escape, completely ignoring the fact that I came looking for help and did not try to hurt myself.\n\nFast forward to the insane asylum, I was interviewd by a middle-aged psychiatrist, who gave an impression as if he wanted to be literally anywhere else but in that room talking to me. After the interview, he told me that I would have to be committed either involumtarily, which would last for 48 hours, or voluntarily, in which case I would have to talk to a different doctor and stay in the insane asylum until she decided what is to be done with me. I tried patiently explaining to the psychiatrist that I only wanted to find help for my anxiety and suicidal thoughts and that I did not want to be committed to this institution. Moreover, I stressed that my emotional issues are connected to my career and that I had to go to work on the following day. I tried reasoning that missing the second day of my job and possibly losing both of the job offers is hardly productive for my mental health. He shrugged it off saying that it wasn't the end of the world.\n\nThe nurses then marched me off to the psych ward, gave me different clothes, and showed me to my room. The room had three beds and the furthermost one from the door had a heavily-sedated patient, whose arms and legs were tied to the bed. The nurse, in all seriousness, even asked me if I would prefer to sleep next to the sedated patient or I would choose the first bed.\n\nThe lights went out and I took the sleeping pills that the nurse offered and slept peacefully... until at least my roommate woke from his sedative-induced stupor and started cursing, swearing and yelling at the top of his lungs, demanding to be released from the restraints.\n\nTwo days have passed since then. I have not showered, brushed my teeth or shaved since I wasn't prepared to be committed to an insane asylum and had not prepared any of my things when I initially went to the hospital to get help.\n\nA lot of thoughts have gone through my mind in the past few days so I hoped that writing it all down and sharing with strangers would help me make some sense of it.\n\nTLDR: Tried to ask for help and find a therapist. Got committed to an insane asylum instead.",

Somehow I ended up seeing him with another girl.\n\nImmediately made me remember the last time we spent time together. To paint the picture, he kept rationalizing being not ready for monogamy with me. A lil context - he already talked about him only being/wanting to be in monogamy. He admitted to me that he was seeing other people while he was with me (context: we saw each other every other day-ish). Lastly, after trying to rationalize, he started talking about all things that his ex did to him that hurt him for an hour.\n\nDuring that bit I didn’t say a word and I just had my eyes down low, listening. He didn’t even caring if I’m feeling anything in that moment. Not even checking in on me. Rambling about all details of why he called off the wedding for an hour. Which just reflects how unhealed he was.\n\nHe got up to use the washroom and mentioning returning and before he came back, my Uber was booked and already waiting for me.\n\nI chose myself.\n\nA bit more context - I’m not trying to paint him as the bad guy, he was nice to me but people can be flawed and unhealed. He was the one to start talking about future/plans/trips and we even started doing exercise together. He proudly showed me to his family and also was the one mentioning proudly that he’s dating me\n\nI admit though I’m happy for him to be going to dates, I felt a bit sad. Part of the sadness is some dysphoria. Seeing him with a cis girl made me feel gender dysphoria, I felt like I’m not as feminine as cis girls (which is partly true). Even thought that he must have left me because I’m trans - could be the truth but with a very little possibility, he’s bi.\n\nThe past bunch of months, I have been thinking about it enjoying the happy return to singlehood and having nothing to do with dating.\n\nI’m choosing peace of singlehood and enjoying company of the ones I love, giving them more time 🤍",

    "content": "Hello, it is my first time ever posting on reddit and english is not my native language so sorry if I am screwing stuff up.\n\nQuick context: I am a 26 year old male with a partner of 5 year (28F) that I love very much together in our house with cats. My friend called \"V\" is a great person to be around, really soscial and funny. We met at university and were good friends from the moment we met and although life has lowered our time together, we still meet for DnD once a month at least and chat when time allows!\n\nAnyway,last year V told our close group of friends that they are transitioning but we can still use male pronouns and everything around him for now. We all accepted it and told him that we are here if he needs help.A couple of months went by and he started the hormone treatment, grew out his hair and starting dressing and acting more feminine. I started to find it a bit interesting to witness the transformation and my GF talked with him about his feelings and some tips and tricks regarding clothing and make-up.\n\nThe first \"feeling\" came when he was going to a dress-up party where he asked my GF to help to dress as a proper women for the first time with a wig, make-up and everything. She was happy to help and went over to his place where he and his roommates live (all girls) to work her magic. All went well according to my GF's text and she send me a picture when he was done. He looked so good! Cute but also sexy and most importantly, happy! That is when I first felt \"something\" and I was a bit shocked, I kinda pushed it away as a reaction to seeing the guy I know for 7 years suddenly as a beautiful women.\n\nThe next feeling came later on the evening when I got a message from him (drunk) that was a picture of him blowing me a kiss and saying \"I love yooouuuu\" and some other stuff that he is happy to have me and my GF in his life. This gave me a butterfly in the stomach feeling but I thought it was just a corny message that some people send to friends when drunk (I remember plenty of instances where other friends told me they love me after a night of drinking as I am dropping them of at home and vice versa). I showed the message to my GF and she jokingly asked if I am going to leave her for him. I told here no because I really love her and this is just a random drunk text plus he mentioned her also in the text that followed so it was not only aimed at me.\n\nThat leaves me with the situation right now where I am 90% convinced that this is all just a temporary feeling and will blow over as they complete their transition and I move on with my GF in the meantime.\n\nWhat the hell should I do if the other 10% turns out and I cannot stop thinking about him/her when he starts looking for surgery etc? I really love my GF and I also don't want to ruin a great friendship. Do just thug it out or try to talk with V about it? Thanks in advance",

    "content": "tldr - got a call from a hospital stating that my grandma is in a catatonic state and is using the bathroom on herself in jail.\n\nMy (19F) grandma (58F) is severely mentally unstable. She can’t hold a job due to her mental issues she is bipolar and i suspect maybe she might have schizophrenia. I noticed within the past year that she was going down a mental decline. In september things blew up. I get a call one day from her and she started yelling and screaming that somebody put a bomb in the trucks gas tank. She told me to take everyone’s names to which i did so she would calm down. i was not taking her seriously because this has happened before just not to this extent. She immediately starts screaming “Do you want me to die???” So i took names. Which was consisted of people that didnt like her.\n\nHer roommate who she does not get along with was pounding on the door and the cops were circling around her windows according to her. she ended up taking her barricade down that she had up and went to the hospital. She gets out the hospital and proceeds to go back to the hospital 3 days after getting released. Her roommate told us he got an eviction notice for her (it’s his house). My mom (35F) tried to cool the situation down and we didn’t hear about it again. Okay, then she gets out a second time. She goes back to her house, she calls me for a couple days and then its radio silent. Time passed and we went to see her and her roommate tells us she went to jail. Okay wtf happened. She dumped his urine containers for the hospital on him and broke a window.\n\nNovember passes by. I haven’t gotten a call from jail. I go put money on her card. Still nothing. I contacted the police multiple times to get in contact with her. “You gotta call this department” “We will tell an officer” Well fuck you because its been weeks and i haven’t heard jack shit. One day in mid december i get a call. The jail transferred her to the hospital so now she is going to the psych ward. She takes the phone and we started talking and she told me that people died and how they died in jail and how the jail straight jacked her. Sent her to a psych ward. She calls me everyday and cries and screams at me to get her out and that they discharged her. She spends her birthday in jail and I wasnt allowed to see her. She gets out on new years eve. My mom and I know she is getting evicted but we don’t know if she knows yet. I barely know whats going on. We go back to her house.\n\nThey greet each other and i catch their conversation and he tells her to get her stuff out. We take her back to our house. I give her my room and i stay by my boyfriends house. She stayed in bed for 3 days. Just sleeping. She ends up getting in contact with another one of her old roommates and he said she can stay with him. My grandma had gotten an injury 2 years ago and won a case for it, and was waiting to get her money. I have no idea how legal stuff and money work. She stays by friend for a couple days and then her roommate called me and told me she went to jail. This was 2 in the morning. She got out December 31st and went back to jail January 5th. I look up her charges and she had 4 counts of breaking a restraining order and unauthorized entry of a dwelling. Bond at $19,000. February passes. We have not heard anything and we got mail from her lawyer. We learn she was carrying $1,000 when she went to jail.\n\nI just now get a call from another hospital. Nurse says she is discharged. Huh?? I call my mom and she doesnt want to go get her, same case with my uncle. And im trying to figure out what to do when the nurse calls again and proceeds to tell me there was a miscommunication between nurse and officer. Grandma was going back to jail. “Why did they bring her back” I asked. Nurse said she had an ankle monitor on and the officers left her. But turns out they came back for her. Wtf!!? “Well, may I ask why she’s there?” The nurse tells me everything came out negative and that she didn’t have paralysis or anything. Yeah well turns out my grandma has been in a catatonic state and was using the bathroom on herself. Nurse said it’s not physical it’s psychiatric. They took her back to jail Nobody seems to care. My mom is fed up with her and my uncle doesn’t do a damn for her. Im so upset. What do I do? They changed her medicine and she broke. She isn’t moving. She is using it on herself. What do I do?? What can I do? Im sorry for making such a long post and that everything is everywhere. Im so stressed. Is there a way to get in contact with her? Her lawyers? What do I even do.",

    "content": "Hey guys. Throwaway account here—I (20F) just want to vent after a trip to the mall recently that legitimately made me realize just how much my body has changed. I tried on a dress in the size I was last year, and after I tried to force the zipper and it didn't work, I felt so disgusted with myself.\n\nI weighed myself on my scale for the first time in a while and realized I'd gained about 50 pounds in less than a year. I'd just started college, and a healthy eating and exercise routine I'd gotten into in my senior year of high school went down the drain during my first year as I began drinking more, getting takeout and eating out at least 4+ times a week, and not exercising (trying to balance a crazy social life with academics was just not something I was cut out for).\n\nThis year, I'm getting more into home cooking, exercising, and staying away from junk foods, but whenever I feel like I'm making progress I end up relapsing for some reason. For example, I made excuses during exam season and ended up getting a lot of takeout again, ruining my progress. Whenever I go out with friends or am with family, I feel too embarrassed to mention I'm trying to diet because I'd always been the chubby kid growing up, and I wanted to continue living as the \"thinner, glowed up\" person I'd become when that isn't who I am anymore. As a result, I end up eating a lot during hangouts or just giving in to temptations. I also sometimes have the bad mentality of \"I ate something unhealthy today already, might as well just use today as a cheat day\" way too often.\n\nOverall, this isn't just about the weight gain itself: I feel like I've lost the discipline I once had and my self-confidence just keeps slipping away. It's been a week or so after a stressful life season, and I'm attempting to start this process again. I'm now 3 days into my new routine of encouraging myself to get out more as well as eating healthier and reducing portions, and I've been seeing some good calorie deficits without even feeling too worn out. I hope I can keep up the progress this time. I need to do this for myself, not only for my physical appearance, but my mindset and to re-instill discipline. I'm not trying to make excuses, just ranting about everything here to get it off my chest. If anyone sees this, thanks for reading!",

He was diagnosed with it back in September of 2024 and has been in and out of the hospital since then. It started off with his liver failing and slowly went to his kidneys starting to fail. His feet, legs and stomach were pretty much always full of fluid that he was constantly needing to go get drained and he was always in pain. He went into to hospice about a week ago and one of his last wishes were to be at home so my grandparents had the hospital bed and all the equipment set up at there house. Once he was at home In hospice he went down hill really fast. He was confused most of the time, and the rest of the time he was sleeping.\n\nI got a call from my grandfather around 8:30am on Monday that I needed to get over there as fast as I can because they didn’t think he wasn’t going to make it much longer. I got over there around 10:30am and honest to god wasn’t prepared for how horrible he looked. He went down hill so fast. His oxygen levels were at 30% and his heart rate was 45bpm. My grandma cranked up his oxygen and was able to get it back up to 94%. His eyes were open but you could tell he really wasn’t seeing anything. He could hear us but couldn’t talk, he could hardly breathe,every breath he took was a gasp and then nothing for a second and then a gasp again. All the immediate family was there, talking to him to let him know that we were there and that we loved him. It got to the point where we couldn’t even get a BP reading on him and his finger monitor for his O2 and HR weren’t getting readings as well. He passed away about four hours after I got there on Monday, March 3rd at 2:02pm. Him taking his last breath will forever be stuck in my head.\n\nThank you to whoever decided to read this, I just really needed somewhere to write down what happened. It still doesn’t feel real.",

    "content": "Please pause the pitchforks. We listen and we don’t judge.\n\nI (25F) accidentally hooked up with my cousin (38M) a decade ago. We didn’t grow up close, we barely even knew each other. One summer, I was visiting extended family, and he invited me out. Things got wild, we blacked out, and when we blacked back in… well, let’s just say we were already mid-hookup.\n\nMorning-after panic set in. He was married, so we never spoke about it, and I went back to my city. End of story. Or so I thought.\n\nFast forward 10 years. Out of nowhere, I get a call from him. Turns out, his life imploded spectacularly—divorce, addiction, hitting rock bottom. I had no clue, since we live in different countries now. He needed a fresh start and asked if he could crash with me for a couple of months.\n\nAnd, well… we fell in love. Not drunk, not an accident this time—real, actual, “I-want-to-build-a-life-with-you” love. We’ve been together for two years now, still long distance, but talking about marriage.\n\nI want to come out to our friends and family but he thinks it’s not a good idea. We are not going to reproduce so I don’t see any logical problem with it.\n\nWhat even makes a relationship “normal”? We didn’t grow up as family and if we had matched on Hinge instead of a DNA test, nobody would care.\n\nAm I wrong?",

    "content": "Headline says a lot.\n\nI'm dating someone that is very, very openly suicidal and refuses to get help for it. Seems like no matter what I do nothing gets through to him about finding help, speaking with someone far more qualified than I am or even admitting he needs to get things under control before he puts himself in even worse health. I constantly have to hear him complaining about how everything is everyone else's fault, the world turned its back on him and how nothing matters since nothing goes right for him anyway.\n\nIt's wearing me down. Hard.\n\nI try so hard to see things on the other side and keep suggesting that he sees someone about this because I can only do so much but now it's to the point where I want to slap the shit out of him and try to literally knock some sense into him before having him committed against his will so someone can drug him enough to where he's far less annoying. Only thing is I love him so much that I can't do anything but go along with it because i'm petrified of waking up one day after being honest with him and finding out he did himself in.\n\nI have no one to talk to about this. My friends keep telling me to leave him and they see how tired I am from dating him and constantly trying to keep his spirits up. I know we're heading down that road if this keeps up, but I also know that if we do end things I'll always be dreading that phone call letting me know he took his own life. I also know that once this is over, i'll never date again because i'll never be able to open myself up to potentially dating another selfish, suicidal asshole who only thinks about themselves.\n\nI also know that without him, i'll likely be so stressed and lonely i'll have a broken heart to deal with and that'll do me in. I'm finding my own therapist to talk to about all of this, but goddamn it I can't handle another night of him being brutally honest about wanting to die and I just sit here and quietly take hearing about it.\n\nMy love life hasn't ever been perfect but I was hoping so badly this would be the one relationship to finally break my streak of finding someone to be with that wasn't me clinging on to the first person who gave me some sort of genuine attention. I should have known finding love that would stick around was never meant for me. I don't even know why I bothered in this relationship, I should have known the happiest i've ever been in life with someone by my side would also be the most miserable i've ever been.\n\nI don't know what else to do. Only thing I can think of is just staying the course and seeing what happens. Typing all this out helped but I know this time tomorrow morning i'll wake up and realize i'm still going to be with someone that refuses to help himself and it's just a matter of when not if.",

    "title": "Unexpected invitations bother me",
    "content": "Let me explain—\n\nI get really bothered when I make plans or I am a part of plans where I am the driver and someone invites someone unexpectedly. Aka gives them a seat in my car without asking me.\n\nFor context my car seats 5 people including the driver, so 4 seats for passengers. Also, I’m the only one in my immediate friend group with a car.\n\nUsually if my friends and I have plans, we’re taking my car. I don’t have an issue with that as we fit in my car and I’d rather do that than spend unnecessary money on an uber. If we’re planning something as a group I make sure to communicate with my group and tell them who I’ve personally invited so that way no one’s surprised. I get really bothered when I show up to pick people up and they have someone extra that they didn’t tell me about. I get especially annoyed if it’s someone I dont know and they just expect me to give a ride..\n\nThis really annoys me because:\n\nUsually my car is full because as i said, im the only one in my immediate friend group with a car. So if im offering to give you a ride, thats not an invitation to invite other people. ESPECIALLY people i dont know. You dont know who else ive offered a ride to and its not your car to offer !!!!\n\nTo me it seems extremely rude and entitled. I dont care how close of friends we are, at least give me the heads up that you’re bringing someone else. Im not a bitch, i wont say no just bc idk them or like bc it was unexpected. I just get extremely annoyed when you dont even give me the courtesy of asking???? Again its not your car to offer spots in. And if its a group plan, you dont know if im giving other people rides !! If you would have asked me “hey, i invited x person, can you give them a ride too?” I can have the chance to say “oh sorry my car is full im sorry!”\n\nBut no, u just show up with them and then im in the awkward position of turning them away bc theres no space and then i look like a bitch\n\nI just want the courtesy yk??? And ive communicated to my friends how it bothers me and how if they plan on inviting someone else and they are expecting ME to give them a ride, ASK ME !\n\nI literally just let one of my friends know yesterday privately how much it bothered me and he said ok. He proceeded to do it again today so instead of waiting till we were in private, i just told him in front of his guest i said “im sorry my car is full. I have to go pick up my friend so theres no extra seats. if you wouldve let me know then maybe i couldve saved her a seat but i didnt know she was coming.” And he claimed to “not know” that his guest was gonna come but he literally invited her … -_-. And again I literally would not have had a problem saving her a seat!! He just NEVER told me he invited her so i offered rides to other people!!!! Wtf\n\nThis is rational right? Or am i just being mean. I definitely couldve worded it better bc in the end i did make his guest feel a bit bad but i was just so frustrated! Especially since i had JUST talked to him about this yesterday!!!!! It lowkey makes me feel taken advantage of like why cant u just give me the courtesy of telling me who u plan to bring into MY car. Im literally not even stingy with giving rides either, 95% of the time i say yes unless i absolutely cant. So WHY NOT JUST ASK ME. Cause now i look mean and like a bitch.\n\nWould this bother you too?",

I know it’s a lot, and I hate to put this out there, but I just need to get it off my chest.\n\nA couple of months ago, I had a conversation with my mother about how much I needed her love and care, both as a child and even now.

The conversation spiraled, and out of desperation, I told her that I felt so unloved that I didn’t want to be here anymore.\n\nI thought maybe—just maybe—she’d finally see how much I was hurting. But instead, she told me it would be better if I did it, that she wouldn’t have to deal with an “ungrateful brat” anymore. I was so shocked I almost started crying, and then she added that if I was going to do it, I should make sure not to make a scene or end up on the news—because that would be an inconvenience for her.

    "title": "“So are you gonna be our new besties?” The June 27th incident at Kings Island",
    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nFor the second consecutive year, I stayed at Great Wolf Lodge from 6/23-6/27. I visited the park, Kings Island, on 6/25 & 6/27. In a perfect world, I’d love to tell you about everything I did, and the people I met. But unfortunately, the sense of joy, rejuvenation, and fulfillment I get by being there was tarnished by an incident that took place at the end of the trip, and at park closing on the 27th.\n\nThis post is as long as it is to make sure I cover all the details of what happened as specifically as I can. It's now been eight months since this took place, so I needed some time before I went public about this. What I hope to accomplish with this is to have a better understanding of the world from a unique perspective, and to use this as a learning tool to learn from someone else's misjudgements. I'm posting this with the complete acceptance, understanding that this story may bring some type of criticism in my direction, and honestly, to achieve some type of closure on this particular incident. With all that being said, I'll begin...\n\nOn the night of June 27th, I was in the Fast Lane Queue for “Orion” to get a Post-Fireworks Night Ride. That day, I was wearing a white Ross Chastain \"Gone Fishing\" Busch Light Car T-Shirt, Wrangler Jean Shorts, and All-Black Under Armour Men's Charged Rogue 4 Running Shoes. I was at the top of the steps and happened to introduce myself to two young ladies who were sitting against the fence in the station. To best describe it as many of you know, there’s a 3-4 foot gap between the station and the stairs before you actually enter the station. If I was to guess, I originally thought these two females were in their early 20’s, I’m 28 for context, but they ask me…\n\n“Are you gonna be our new besties???”\n\nNo girl has ever asked me a question like that. So I’m of the impression that they’re attracted, to me, and assumed they’re of legal age, so I jokingly responded…\n\n“Well, I’m gonna be leaving tonight, unless you had something else in mind…”\n\nAnd even if things worked out, I wouldn’t have bothered because I have a 2 +/- Hour Drive in front of me back home to Louisville after I do this Night Ride. But the girls then look at each other very awkwardly and say something along the lines of…\n\n“Dude WE’RE 16!”\n\nI profusely try to apologize, but they begin to overreact and make a scene in the station, escalating the situation, and start running down the steps of the normal queue. And I apologize to the greeter and to a ride attendant, because I didn’t know that they were underage. As I’ll explain later in more detail, that part of the situation, like all parts of this situation could’ve been resolved with an apology, and life could’ve went on. As this was misunderstanding.\n\nSome may ask why I didn’t just ask how old they were. I’ve been raised on the idea that asking women how old they are is inappropriate.\n\nSo I finished my ride which while it was spectacular, I’m kinda nervous about what happened beforehand as I head to my locker to retrieve my belongings. Mine was on the section closest to the On-Ride Photo Desk and I’m not able to open it, probably because the park is now closed, so the rental by default has expired. So while I’m about to get someone to help me get this locker opened, two teenage boys confront me very aggressively on the situation before the ride saying something in the realm of…\n\n“What are you doing touching up on these little girls!!! You should know better!!!”\n\n“You wear that cross on your neck and do something like that?! How would god feel about that?”\n\nFor context, I regularly wear either black or silver cross necklace. I've had many people make conversation about that.\n\n“I’m disappointed in you.”\n\n“You’re not going anywhere, until you apologize.”\n\nThey also asked if I was at Soak City earlier, which I was to check it out for the first time and look through some of the shops. But they claimed I made inappropriate physical contact with someone there to. Which I didn’t.\n\nI know that isn’t exactly what these two gentlemen said, but it’s what I remember as my anxiety ramped wondering how do I get outta this dilemma that just got handed to me on a silver platter. But a couple of things, I never groped these women. The park has security cameras everywhere, including in the coaster’s stations, so there’s proof that didn’t happen, and I also attempted to explain to these two gentleman that I had no clue they were 16. Again, I thought they were in their early 20’s, college age. But they weren’t buying it as both told me…\n\n“BRO, YOU COULD TELL!”\n\nMany women look older than they actually are. So you really can’t sometimes.\n\nBut they both proceed to exercise public humiliation on me by shouting how I was, “Touching up on little girls!” to everyone who was leaving Area 72 that evening. Like they’re the men from “Dads Against Predators” on Locals.\n\nFinally, security steps in to figure out what was going on, and by the request of these young men. One guard originally begins to interview me, but then attends to the younger gentleman who initiated the confrontation, so another guard interviews me and I explain everything as detailed as I can, and as calm as I can l which in the moment, was pretty impossible to accomplish. I finally got my things outta my locker, then this guard escorts me to the front of the park to see what his supervisor or coworkers had to say on the matter, and they told me…\n\n“You’re good to go sir, nothing else is gonna happen.”\n\n“Next time when you’re having small talk, just be more careful.”\n\nSo I walk the path back over to Great Wolf where my car was parked. I checked out from there that morning and was granted permission to keep my car parked there. But as I’m then at the North-End of the parking lot, in the small section that walks Southeast-to-Northwest, what appears to be a Black 2014 Honda Civic pulls up, and it’s the teenagers again. The gentleman in the passenger side ask for my name, number, address, and zip-code. Which I like this whole time, cooperate and disclose it. And many of you may ask, why would you give your information to them? They aren’t police or security. I thought that being honest, and cooperative would salvage my reputation in this situation. And what if they can tell that I’m lying. So after doing so, he says to me…\n\n“We just got banned for a month. This is my favorite place to go to. Have a good night, I love you.”\n\nThen they take off into the night.\n\nTo be honest, I should’ve walked down Columbia Road instead of the walk path to avoid the possibility of further encounters. But at that point, I thought the teens left at that point. Or ask security to escort me to my car, if they’re allowed to do that.\n\nAfter filling up my car at the GoCo on Kings Mills Road, I began my drive home. I look over to my left on Southbound I-71 to look at the park one last time, despite it looking so spectacular in person at night, I was unable to enjoy it because of what all just happened.\n\nHere’s how this situation should’ve been resolved…\n\nIf I were the girls, I’d peacefully, and politely inform me, “Sorry to tell you, but we’re actually 16.”\n\nThen I’d have responded, “My apologies, I didn’t know that. I’ll back off, I apologize.”\n\nThen the girls should’ve said, “You’re fine. It’s all good”. Then life would’ve moved on and the situation would’ve never escalated to the point it did.\n\nBut to begin with, if the girls never asked that question, none of this would have ever happened to begin with...\n\nIf I were either of the boys, I would have started with professionally and calmly said, “Excuse me sir, you gotta minute to talk?”\n\nAnd I would’ve said, “Sure. No problem.”\n\nThey could’ve have offered to buy me a Dasani, then said, “Do you know why we’re wanting to speak with you??? Okay, there was an incident involving several young ladies in the station a few minutes ago, would you mind sharing your side of the story?”\n\nAnd I would’ve done just that. So they have both sides of the story and develop a conclusion and they finished the meeting by stating, “Okay, we believe you did make a mistake, you didn’t know their age, just be more careful next time. Thank You for talking with us and have a good night.”\n\nThere’s a reason for the saying, “Cooler heads prevail.” You gotta assure everyone’s calm in order to then get to the bottom of any situation. That never happened.\n\nThere also has to be a presumption of innocence established in the investigation process as well. That’s why in the legal system, “All suspects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.” Which thanks to security for helping with this incident and siding with me on this.\n\nOn June 28th, one of the male parties in the incident made a post to this group that afternoon, which was a motive to making this post in response. I waited til’ now to conduct this post so I made sure I could tell my side in the most detailed and comprehensive way possible. But prior to the post either being deleted, or taken down, I monitored it by reading all the comments throughout the time that post remained up. To start, I read that I was reported to Mason Police. I was waiting to see if either they would call me for an interview, I never did. I thought about calling them myself, but when talking to someone about the matter, they recommended I didn’t. This individual also claimed in the comments…\n\n“I watched him do what he did.”\n\nBut in the post, he states…\n\n“2 girls came running down the stairs”\n\nWhich implies that he was either at the bottom of the stairs or still at ground-level. And in addition to the wall that divides the Fast-Lane queue to the regular queue after the show building, there would be no possibility for him to have seen the incident unfold. So it seems very contradicting.\n\nAlso, another user had stated…\n\n“the girls wouldn’t of lied about something like that”\n\nThis where I channel my inner Alex Jones and become a tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist…\n\nIn retrospect, hindsight is always 20/20, I believe the possibility that those girls asked me that question, “Are you gonna be our new besties???” to bait me. I’ll even go a step further, that I’m of the belief that they might’ve been of legal age, but claimed they were 16 as a convenient excuse to cause a problem. I’m not saying that’s the case, it’s complete speculation. In today’s society, select people love to cause and/or escalate issues to play the victim card because it gets them attention. On top of that, they also delivered misinformation by stating I had groped them. Like I mentioned earlier, there was a 4ft gap between us, that would’ve been impossible. And security cameras are everywhere, and if footage was pulled up, it shows I never did that. So they lied about that to artificially make the situation look worse to garner more attention and spark more outrage. This is why you have to hear both sides to the story, then develop the conclusion. Not just hear one side and ride with it. Again, what other reason would these two girls ask me that question?\n\nIn the minutes, hours, and days following, this has greatly & negatively affected my mental health as I’ve had many thoughts rush through my head. I thought maybe it was best I should wait a couple years before visiting again. I’m worried about the people around who witnessed what happened, how will they think of me? What’s the ride attendants at Orion gonna think of me? What’s gonna happen if these teens see me again? Are they gonna forget about what happened, or will they try to engage in some type of conflict? How will I be able to pick myself up from this? And am I sure I’ll still be a positive asset to society? Thankfully, I didn’t have to wait too long to answer that last question. On July 3rd, I visited Ark Encounter, and it felt therapeutic to be on I-71 again, then be around people again. While there, I’d happen to see a mom try taking a family photo, but she wouldn’t be in it, so I’d ask…\n\n“Excuse me ma'am, if you wanna be in the shot, I’ll take the photo.”\n\nAnd that situation happened 4 or 5 times that day, and to see the sense of joy, appreciation, and thankfulness expressed by these families to me reassured that I was good person, and a positive asset to society.\n\nI’ve talked to many people about this for advice and support. While at the Goco/Popeyes/Dunkin Donuts on Kings Mills Road to fill up, and I talked to the guy working there about this and mentioned it was teens just looking to cause issues. When I woke up Friday afternoon, I talked to my parents immediately about this, if I didn’t, they’d notice something was bothering me. I also talked to select people at Work, on XBOX, and to other friends of mine, and everyone unanimously have said that I did nothing wrong, and agreed it was a misunderstanding. I wanna thank everyone who I’ve reached out to for support, as this has been a difficult time. I’m surprised everyone has sided with me on this, they didn’t have to, but I’m grateful for helping me get through this.\n\nI can only imagine the stress and anxiety women, especially attractive women feel in public. To go to any Zoo, Bar, Restaurant, Bowling Alley, Amusement Park, Movie Theater, etc. has to be sometimes unbearable. To always be looked at, or to have someone always making advances towards you has to feel vulnerable and invasive. With that in consideration, I do what’s necessary to respect women’s boundaries when out in public. So to even claim that I’m a Predator is absolutely inaccurate. As mentioned earlier, this was a misunderstanding. These girls asked a question that led me to assume they were attracted to me, and of age. I responded based off that, then they blew it out of proportion and caused a huge mess at the end of what was supposed to be another fun and memorable multi-day trip up there.\n\nIn conclusion, the last, absolute last things I’d want to do is make enemies inside the gates of Kings Island. Not within Mason, Ohio, not within Warren County, not within the Cincinnati Tri-State Area, and not within the State of Ohio period. And the other last thing I wanted is to be on the radar of the City of Mason Police Department. I imagine a day where I can call Mason, Ohio home, so I want to be on good terms with everyone I encounter. To the other parties involved if they read this post, I hope we can mutually apologize come to a better understanding of what took place so we can be on good terms with each other, achieve closure, and move forward on a positive note. I’m gonna be visiting the park again this year, so I don’t want us to cross paths and have any further conflict or sense of animosity or discomfort. While I’m not wishing ill will on anyone, these four people possibly will be faced with a situation that’s a misunderstanding as well. If so, I’d want their situation to be handled calmly and smoothened out as well and as quickly as possible so they don’t face any hate or animosity from the opposing parties of whatever situation faces them. And I apologize to the two young men for getting banned. Y’all unfortunately, were denied the opportunity to see the Fourth of July Celebration fireworks display, and more valuable time to ride “Orion”, “The Beast”, or whatever y’all’s favorite coaster might be. While I understand they were trying to stand up for what's right, it still wasn't the correct way to do so, and hopefully they learn from this as well. For me, I just use it as a learning experience to be extra careful on who I'm talking to, and not make decisions off assumptions. Which I apologize to the young ladies for doing so. I’m someone who’s very respectful to people’s boundaries, and wouldn’t wanna make decisions about that makes someone feel uncomfortable. But I do hope they apologize for asking a question that expresses attraction, only to turnaround and cause a scene that could’ve been resolved with a simple apology. Nobody would’ve gotten banned, and security wouldn’t have gotten involved. I'm gonna be presented with 1,000 different situations and scenarios, and I'll be fine in 925 of them. Nobody is perfect. Also, it's been important for me to allow time to heal the wounds as the situation shrinks farther in the past. I come to Kings Island for peace and serenity, not drama and distress. And this sadly, was drama and distress. I've met many people in my now four visits to the park and had wonderful converstations and engagements with those people, both fellow guests, and employees. It's very unfortunate this all happened, and was more heartbreaking that it happened at the very end of this trip I took. I refuse to allow that to be the last memory I have of the park this year.\n\nThank you to everyone who took time outta their day to read this and whether or not you’re going to the park today, have a great day everyone…",

    "content": "I don’t know where to start. I found out two hours ago and my emotions are everywhere. My mind’s racing and my heart is breaking all over again.\n\nThis man… I so badly wanted us to work out. I so badly wanted us to grow old together, have more kids, have more stability, find peace within each other. But I was wrong again like the two times before. He’s never going to love me the way that I love him. He’s never going to respect me the way that I respect him. I love him so much and all i want to do is sweep it under the rug again… but I don’t think I should do that anymore. I don’t know.\n\nThis information comes at a time where I am questioning if I should be alive. My kids deserve a better mom. They deserve a happy one that doesn’t constantly fight with anxiety and depressing thoughts. Maybe that’s why he cheated? Maybe that’s why he went out of his way again to look for more women… to find someone who is everything he wants cause clearly I am not that someone. I am nothing and he just reminded me of that. I hate myself for being so weak. I am so scared. I am terrified of confronting him when he gets home from work. I am so afraid of tearing apart my family all because he can’t be loyal. Why can’t he just be loyal?\n\nWhy do this to me again? What did I do to deserve such treatment and lack of care? What is so wrong with me that he just can’t be loyal to?\n\nMaybe it’s because I’m a stay at home mom? I don’t have a career and that’s the women he chases. Everything I own, he bought for me. We’ve been together for 4 years. I’m so tired. I know this seems like I’m being dramatic, but I loved this man. He was my person. I could take hurt from anyone but him. I could’ve braved any storm with him by my side… and now I have to go at it alone. I don’t know what to do. Someone please help me. I don’t want to kill myself, but I want to die. I want to disappear. How do I stop these feelings? These thoughts? I’m so fucking sad.",

    "content": "I’m not sure if this is the right sub, but i need an outlet to post this anonymously\n\nwhen i was 14, my brother passed away suddenly. he was born with HLHS -Hypoplastic left heart syndrome which is a rare congenital heart defect in which the left side of the heart is severely underdeveloped. He had many surgeries as a child, which i won’t get in to, but the important thing to note is that from the ages of 7-18 he was physically fine. sure, he sweat a lot, and slept more the most teens,  but nothing extreme.\n\nin February 2020 he got sick, his livers started failing, he would faint randomly, and when they got it checked out it turn out he was in heart failure. however, he started taking new meds and was seemingly improving.\n\none night at the beginning of March, he and my sister had a baking contest, and both made desserts. we tasted them and ranked them, his chocolate mousse won by a landslide. i had the grand idea of putting whipped cream on the back of my hand and hitting it into the air and the trying to catch it in my mouth. me and my siblings all tried it and my brother laughed so hard his face turned blue. it was a night filled of laughter and jokes. that’s the last time i saw him…alive.\n\nthe next morning both of my parents went out to work, which was unusual because my mother works from home and was my brothers primary caregiver, i stayed home from school for a reason i can’t remember now.\n\nat around 10am my father called me to check on my brother who wasn’t answering his phone, and to make sure he takes his meds. while still on the phone with my dad, i go to my brothers room, when i walk the smell hits me like a ton of bricks, but my father was rushing me, so I tiptoe over to his bed and i see him with his eyes rolled back and mouth slightly agape, i tried to shake him but his skin was cold and that’s what i noticed his arms were a deep shade bluish purple- i told my dad to call the EMTs because my brother was not waking up. i remember drinking water, unlocking the door, and waiting in the living room. emts burst through the door, professional looking people running in and out of our small apartment. and then the rush slowed down i wasn’t informed on much and i was nervous to interfere. now there are more professional people running in and out with my small apartment , although now some were patiently waiting for my father to arrive , and since my mum wasn’t answering her phone, oblivious to her only sons passing, all i could do is wait. i remember feeling awkward and unsure of what to do with all these personnel in my home, so i just kept offering everyone water and snacks- but they would just look at me with sad eyes and politely decline.\n\nI was only 14 so there were some issues of them telling me things but after about an hour, while My Father was on his way, a kind  man with a thick southern drawl sat me down. he informed me that my brother had passed away by the looks of it he had already been gone for quite some time.\n\nI responded with an understanding nod. i didn’t cry. I remember when My Father came home, hearing the news and holding back tears, I let the professionals do the talking while I sat in my room, my Father joined me, and I held his hands while the police questioned us.\n\nI’ll never forget the whale of agony my sister let out when she got home and heard the news.\n\nthe rest of the day is a blur. his funeral was the next day and rained and hailed so hard, my shoes were soaked through to my socks.\n\nI had a complicated relationship with my brother, but at the very least, I’m glad that he died at home in the comfort of his own bed and not in a hospital bed hooked up to machines and wires - he hated the hospital.\n\nit’s so incredibly hard and painful especially since five years ago was a different world. He passed away right before Covid lockdown started happening. it feels like i knew him a lifetime ago. sometimes I forget his face and struggle remember what he looks like and it scares me because it’s only been five years and ,statistically speaking, I have around 70 more years to go . every family event is painful, all days of celebration and holidays are surrounded with this dark cloud -that feeling that there’s someone that isn’t here ,that should be here.\n\nI hope this post is coherent -i’m after a long day at work. feel free to ask anything in the comment if anything needs clarification.",

    "content": "I (F31) am immunocompromised. I have a chronic pain condition, autoimmune disorders, and multiple sleep disorders. I was even born with some of these issues, I've been in pain for forever and I get sick a lot which makes everything worse. I hate being a burden on people, most of the time I hide my pain. I am good at that up to a point. Probably most people who technically know me have no idea how sick I actually am while the people who really know me are unfortunately, more exposed to how bad it is for me.\n\nYesterday morning I was in PAIN, like absurd pain, like the worst pain I have ever felt. I've felt that exact pain exactly 3 other times in my life. All 3 times I was rushed to the ER under the assumption that my appendix was having kittens or something. No appendix issues were found and eventually, after about 12 hours of hell, the pain goes away. This time was no different, except this time I knew there was no reason to go to the hospital, at aprox 11 hours in it finally subsided and I was able to crash.\n\nMy best friend/roommate (M24) was in the house for the first half of this. Mind you I was moaning, scream crying and begging the universe for help most of the morning. I told him the about going to the hospital each time before and receiving no help and no answers. He seemed concerned but that was it. He didn't even check on me before leaving for the day. (I was supposed to be puppy sitting while he was at work.\n\nMy bf (M36) came over about two hours after the pain subsided. He was very informed about how the day had gone for me as I had been texting him all day while he was stuck at work and school. He barely acknowledged my condition when he came in, still glued to his phone even though I started bawling like a baby as soon as he came in. I know his day wasn't easy, I ended up massaging his arm, and even skipping the snuggs and cry session I had requested via text, to hold space for how he was doing emotionally. We went to bed. He did ask how my pain was and spent a moment checking for classic appendicitis symptoms. But he was a million miles away......\n\nI know that I am always in pain and I don't want people to dote on me but I felt so invisible and neglected today I could almost blow away in the wind. I don't think anyone did anything wrong. My whole family does the same thing (remember I've been in pain my whole life). I'm just kind of devastated. I had one of the hardest most painful days of my life, and I did it alone, I still need to cry, I still need to be held.......",

I hate that you caused my spiral towards a mental breakdown that had me in a psych hold for two weeks. I know you hated when I left. I know you hated when I slept with your best friend just to hurt you. I know you hated me for hating you. I know how much you meant that final I love you when I finally left. After years of pain and lies I just couldn't do it anymore and just broke. Every I love you was a lie, every single memory of us was a lie. How could I just move on from that revelation? You never cared as much as I did. Not till I left. And yet, it's been 5 years, you have a real job, you are taking care of yourself, you've changed so much and fuck do you look so amazing.

It was extremely enjoyable, and she and I were flirting back-and-forth (mind you I’ve hardly flirted with anyone since my ex cheated on me sometime ago).\n\nBefore she and her friend left for another bar, I asked for her number, but I quickly told her: “If you’re not comfortable with it, you really don’t have to. I just think you’re cute and witty and I’d love to talk to you more.” She replies with, and this made my smile like an idiot, “I’m not uncomfortable at all. I was waiting for you to ask.”\n\nGot her number, wish her a great rest of her night, and we separate to our respective friend groups. Then, I text her the following afternoon, and since then we’ve had these fantastic, flirty, and personal conversations.\n\nHere’s the issue: She doesn’t text back too often. Let me preface this by saying, I know people get busy or preoccupied or even forget to text others back, but I’m talking hours on hours without a response from her. When she does, she immediately reciprocates my energy and the conversation returns to being wonderful.\n\nThis isn’t an attempt of mine to gripe, all things considered. I just find myself feeling like a high school with a crush again, she genuinely makes me grin like a fool and fills my stomach with butterflies. More than anything, I want to talk to her.\n\nOf course I busy myself while she isn’t responding and try not to think too hard on it while I’m occupying myself, but I really pray she texts back soon. I’m tempted to ask her to FaceTime, if she’s cool with it, because of how greatly I want to keep talking to her.",

    "content": "What she did hasn’t had lasting financial or safety effects on me, but I just feel pissed that she had the thought to treat a human like that. I was meant to go to a concert with her and one of her friends. Everything was fine until a few hours before when she decided to started making long messages and voice notes about how everything was just going to crazy and chaos. I was informed last minute that her friend has problems being at concerts and around any people due to social anxiety. I said I understood as I had suffered with it (still do at times) and had only really gotten over it recently. And then it just gets worse and worse “can’t pick you up anymore” “my friend isn’t calming down, she’s been freaking out about this since we bought the tickets months ago.” “We probably won’t talk to you much you might just had to stand a hit away from us.” “You can be there just do your own thing” I told her to just tell me if I can’t come and she told me it’s probably best if I don’t. 11 year friendship, just treated like an ant on the ground stepped in on and killed. I asked her why she didn’t just tell me MONTHS ago if her friend was uncomfortable with me there. I could have made other plans or tried to message her friend, help her know that I won’t judge her and she doesn’t have to interact with me if she’s uncomfortable. But I was left with 4 hours to get other plans. Thankfully sold my ticket last minute but lost lots of money from it. I got mad at her but I don’t know if I feel sorry. A friend of mine that knows her too, but it’s not like we’d ever all hung out or even mention eachother to eachother, said maybe I should have been more considerate and just left it because her sister had passed away a few years ago and she still struggles. I told her I understand that, I don’t expect her to not ever be affected my that again. But I also told her that I won’t be excusing her if she treats me badly. When I’ve grieved I’ve never used it as an excuse to treat people badly. I’ve heard other stories about her not treating people the best, and I feel like she now hides behind this and uses grief as her excuse. I never got an actual apology, just a “idk what to say”. I’m not putting this up to grief, even if it was it doesn’t excuse what she did. She had months of time to inform me that the situation may not have been appropriate, as her friend is uncomfortable around anyone  new and had been “anxious for months leading up to this” (her words) I don’t need the full diagnosis and pry into her friends life because I’m not entitled to that. But if I had just been told months before that she was feeling anxious about going to a a concert with an unfamiliar person, I could have seen if the friend wanted to meet in a quiet place with the mutual friend or meet over text. Or I could have made other plans. It’s fine now,  it’s been a little bit of time since then. I don’t talk to her much at all only if I have a question, but I don’t forgive her for the reason that she treated a human like that.",

At the time, nobody said anything, so I took that to mean that there were no problems. That was a week ago.\n\nI know that I fucked up.

    "content": "For complete transparency I wrote this out first on wordpad (can post the original if requested) but since my grammar and wording is never great (learning disability) I ran it thru a AI grammar editor. The message and feelings are still mine as I re-read it to be 100% sure. Just thought you all should no.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI’m writing this because it’s been weighing on my mind for a long time. It keeps happening, and I can’t shake the feeling that I’m the common factor.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I’ve wanted to make a difference in someone’s life. In high school, I dreamed of becoming a teacher to help kids. At one point, I even considered becoming a doctor or a nurse to be there for people in their worst moments. But over the years, those dreams faded—because every time I’ve tried to help, things have ended the same way.\n\nIt seems like whenever someone needs emergency medical care and I step in to help, they don’t make it.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne of the first times this happened, I was around 18-20 years old. I was walking home from Walmart when I heard a crash. Looking over, I saw a motorcycle had been t-boned by a car, and the driver was on the ground. Without thinking, I ran toward him, weaving through traffic. I took his hand and spoke to him, trying to keep him calm while others applied pressure to his wounds. He handed me his phone and asked me to call a family member to let them know he was going to the hospital. I did exactly that, then gave the phone back to him. Soon after, paramedics arrived and took him away. Later, I read that he had died from his injuries. At the time, I didn’t think much of it beyond the tragedy of the accident.\n\nA few years later, I was at home when my stepfather suddenly jumped up and said, “Call an ambulance.” We did, and while waiting, I ran upstairs to grab him a shirt as asked. I helped him put it on, talking to him, reassuring him that everything would be okay. The paramedics arrived and took him away. Shortly after, he went into heart failure and died.\n\nThen, a few years after that, I was living in an apartment building. One day, I glanced out the window out of boredom and saw my neighbors unloading groceries. Out of nowhere, the wife collapsed, and her husband barely caught her in time. I didn’t hesitate—I bolted out of my apartment without even locking the door, ran down the hallway, hit the elevator button, and after a few seconds of waiting, said, “Fuck it,” and took the stairs. I got to them as fast as I could. Her husband was on the phone with paramedics while I held her, trying to comfort her as he gathered her meds and health cards. The building superintendent came out, just standing there, saying, “She’s going to be okay.” Just being completely useless . It took the paramedics over 30 minutes to arrive. The moment I stepped back to let them work, they had to use a defibrillator— there heart had stopped. She didn’t make it.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThese are just a few of the moments that have left me feeling this way. I may add more as I remember them. But because of them, I feel like I can’t help people—because when I do, it only seems to end badly. I honestly have never had someone survive going to the hospital after I 'help'.\n\nIt’s been about three years since I last experienced something like this, and I hope I never do again. But I’m scared that if it happens again, I’ll freeze up. That fear eats at me—the fear that I won’t be able to help, that I’ll hesitate, that I’ll fail someone when they need me most.\n\nI’m shaking as I write this, scared of being judged, of being called a coward. But I needed to get this off my chest because it’s been haunting me for far too long. I am shaking trying to hit the post button",

    "content": "Guys, I am sorry, but this is a bit long, but I dont know who else to tell this to... (dont tell me about diaries, i suck at writing) and\n\nTLDR: Before COVID, I was social and talkative, but after the pandemic, I lost that ability. My friendships faded, and now I barely talk at all. Conversations feel forced, and I overthink everything. I keep things to myself because I have no one to truly open up to. Even online, my attempts to connect go unanswered. I miss the version of me that could talk freely, without hesitation. I don’t know how to fix it, and I just wish someone understood.\n\nBefore COVID, I was a completely different person. I wasn’t exactly an extrovert, but I talked a lot—so much that teachers had to tell me to quiet down in class. I had a normal social life, and conversations came naturally. But after the pandemic, something changed. I used to have a few friends, and talking felt effortless. But when everything went online, I realized something: those connections were weaker than I thought. Conversations faded, and soon, I was just... alone.\n\nNow, I barely talk at all. I don’t have close friends, and I find myself avoiding conversations altogether. It’s not that I hate people—I just don’t know how to talk anymore. It feels like I lost the ability somewhere along the way. Even when I try, it feels forced, like I don’t belong in the conversation. I started keeping things to myself—not because I wanted to, but because I had to. There was no one to talk to. If I spoke up in online classes, I’d either get ignored, get shut down by teachers, or feel like I was saying something dumb. Friends who I thought were there just… weren’t. And slowly, I just stopped trying.\n\nEven now, in person, I can’t bring myself to talk like I used to. I hold back. I overthink. I don’t have friends anymore. I’ve never had a girlfriend, and honestly, I don’t need one for the reasons most of my classmates seem to. I just wish I had someone to talk to—someone I could open up to about things I can’t even tell my mom anymore (see this post). She’s been my only real friend for years, but as I grew older, I started holding back. I don’t want to worry her, and I don’t want to burden her with my thoughts. But that means I end up keeping everything inside, with no one to really share it with.\n\nI don’t know how I ended up like this. I miss the version of me that could just talk without hesitation. I miss feeling like I had people to talk to at all. People say it's just a phase, but how long does a phase last? It’s been 5-6 years, and I’m still waiting to snap out of it—feeling like a tether floating in space, cut off from its base, holding onto nothing but a fragile strand of hope that maybe, just maybe, something will push me back.\n\nI overthink at the silliest of times. Even now, as I type, I am overthinking. It’s been two hours since I started writing this small post, but my mind is stuck in a loop—how to write, what to write, how much to write, is this sentence wrong, what if I’m misunderstood, what if the post gets removed, what if there’s no reply? My mind just doesn’t stop.\n\nI don’t know if anyone else has experienced this—going from talkative and social to completely silent and disconnected. I don’t know how to fix it either. I miss being able to just talk without overthinking everything. I miss having someone to truly connect with. I miss the part of me that could engage in conversations without second-guessing every word. Back then, I could even talk to girls without feeling like I was just spouting nonsense. Not that I ever got much of a response, but at least I was able to talk. Now, I hesitate for so long that by the time I figure out what to say, the moment has already passed. The person has already walked away.\n\nWhenever I see friends posting on Instagram, I reach out—\"What’s up?\" \"Nice!\" \"Cool!\" \"How have you been?\" But most of the time, there’s no reply. And if there is, it’s a dry \"okay\" or \"cool,\" like they don’t want to engage in a conversation no matter how hard I try. I don’t have any social skills anymore. I don’t have humor. I don’t know how to flirt or even start a normal conversation. I have to ask ChatGPT just to figure out how to say something.\n\nHas anyone else gone through this? How did you handle it?I just wish someone understood. I am tired of being alone, and reaching out isn't helping anymore",

    "content": "I've (17M) liked this girl for far longer I'm willing to admit. She's the most intelligent (it's actually incredible), she's sweet as pie, with a sense of humour as good as silver, and she's gorgeous. She's objectively the best. She's in a league that's hers alone. But what actually makes her special is the sense of bliss and hope her presence creates.\n\nIn June 2024, my then-best friend started talking to her—intimately—just two weeks after he stopped begging his ex (who he'd been super manipulative & toxic to) to take him back. I trusted him when he insisted I was just being paranoid. Then, two weeks in, he became her first boyfriend. She had once hated him but dismissed his past behaviour as “just alcohol and family problems.” She believes he's the only one who understands her. He lied repeatedly, told her I liked her just before asking her out, and even lied that I had slapped him. I was humiliated. Looking back, he was always a sleazy friend.\n\nIt's been 9 months since. I've become increasingly lonely as I have to avoid most hangouts because for the sakes of my mental stability I cannot bear to be around my ex friend. The rest of my friend group seems unbothered. Neutrality is king.\n\nI feel I've been unremorsefully abandoned by everyone close to me in favour of some weasel who solely acts in self-interest with no regard for morality or empathy. I feel so disposable. It feel purposeless and as if the world were mocking all which I believe in. It's killing me. Every breath is exhausting. Living like this makes life itself unbearable.\n\nThe worst part is it's all my fault. I hate myself for it. I had so much time to be the one to connect with her, or even to just admit my feelings, but I never did. I promise it wasn't a lack of will but one of wit. I would've done anything, but I didn't know anything to do. I still don't really get the whole emotional connection thing. Maybe that's why I'm disposable.\n\nI don't know what to do with myself anymore, I'd appreciate any advice.",

I got angry and aggressive even with the slightest trigger, but I didn't want to hurt anyone around me, so I tried to keep my mouth shut and lock myself up whenever I felt crazy.\n\nA little bit of background. I was terribly sucks at social interaction, and during work, I was feeling useless. My boss was kind as they explained to me that I have to show more passion and that they cannot offer to extend my contract, which I agree with. However, I was somehow irritated with some of my seniors' words, and I kept replaying those words in my head to the point that it hurt my chest and exploded my head.\n\nWhenever I recall that conversation, I just slapped myself really hard multiple times, and I got addicted to that; I just stopped slapping because I knew I could not die, and dealing with a dizzy head after torturing myself was not a good idea.\n\nI don't want to blame anyone, as it is my choice after all, but having these unhealthy behaviors has taken a toll on my mental health and affects my job hunting. Now I dream every night about people speaking ill of me.\n\nAs I am writing this, I no longer understand why I was having that kind of thought during my rant; most of the time after the burst out, my mind just blacked out and proceeded with anything I was doing previously like nothing ever happened.

She told me about 3 out of her 7 experiences as well. We heard each other , embraced each other and said that now it will all be okay.\n\nWhen i told her about my 3rd experience( my mom doing it) she was sitting on top of me. I Her reaction looked like it gave her the ick.\n\nShe was so lovey dovey tho, said one day we both will be a family and will have a family of our own, she said how much she loves me( we said our i love yous last week. I said it a few weeks prior).\n\nAfter I go home I tell her how I was overthinking me telling her all that, and wondering how it makes me look like a man and whether i gave her the ick. She said you did not and that we should speak of this in person.\n\nAfter i left, she had a discussion with her best friend (childhood friend who was staying over that night.) Her friend was telling her how she feels like she has changed and forgot about everything that she was working her ass off for 3 months back.\n\nThen she says-  we shouldn't see each other everyday, don't take it the wrong way. Says she does not feel productive, not even 20% of what she once was\n\nShes in her last sem of undergrad. Took a marketing job 10am- 7pm( today is her 4th day).. Cause she doesn't go for classes,  so a job would make her feel productive.  Her uni is 15km away so she prefers to go just for exam.\n\nShe said she doesn't feel productive. After her job I go see her and we spend all the time together till its time to sleep. So she cannot study. She has to prepare for her MBA interviews in May and undergrad end-sem exams in June.\n\nShe says she wants to leave her job and go back to her parent's home for a month, which is in a different city very far away, she said she wants to rethink her decisions.\n\nI said okay if that's what you  want to do. I say hearing all this right now makes me feel i scared you away, she said - you haven't,  I feel like too much is happening right now.\n\nI said- But what's wrong? You wanted to take the job so you could feel productive. Since you weren't attending college. You have to prepare for your interviews, and end sem exams. What feels like too much? If you're dropping the job, Then what decisions are you speaking about that u want to rethink. She said I'll sleep it off i guess.\n\nBefore the job we were spending all day together,  I even stayed over 4 nights in a row last week cause her house mates were not in town.\n\nThen she says i need to sleep , I said okay. She says- are we rushing alot,, are things going too fast. I said- Why are you having doubts about us at this time of the night( 3.30am) We speak of a future together I only have good intentions with you Don't let people tell you how your connection with your partner is Noone knows us better than us, we are together\n\nShe said nobody's telling her anything,  it's just something she feels. I feel her single bestie talked some rubbish in her ears, her friend is amazing I got along well with her. My gf is on her 5th day of period,  maybe it's the hormones?\n\nI hope it's not the things I told her that gave her an ick, what do I do if it is?\n\nAs for the reason being lack of productivity, I said you could've told me this before when I was there with you or some other time and not right after I tell you on text how i was overthinking about telling you my harassment stories in person that night itself.  Rest all the talks happened over text as I have mentioned above",

    "content": "I just need to get this out.\n\nI’m 44, an only child, and my mother was 64. Our relationship was never easy. Throughout my life, she always seemed \"embarrassed\" or \"ashamed\" of me for one reason or another. We hadn't spoken in three years, though deep down, part of me still longed for the kind of mother-daughter relationship I never had.\n\nThen, three weeks ago, I received a message on Facebook from my cousin, saying they had \"heard\" about my mother and hoped things got better. My heart sank. No matter what had happened between us, she was still my mom. I immediately started reaching out to family—her siblings, my aunts and uncles—only to be told they couldn’t say anything and that I needed to call my stepdad.\n\nLong story short, my mother was dying. Stage 4 cancer. ICU. When I asked if I could see her, I was told she wasn’t sure if she wanted to see me. That hurt in a way I can't even explain. By the time I finally made it to her home, she was in hospice care and could no longer speak. Her husband made it clear that she hadn't wanted me to know she was sick—she didn’t think I would care. WTF. I got to say goodbye, but only to the shell of the woman she once was. And now, I don't know how to process any of it.\n\nThe only time I ever really stood up to her—never in a disrespectful way—was when I asked her to stop belittling me in front of others and to show me some respect. I am college-educated, have never been arrested, and earn four times what she did. But in her eyes, none of that mattered. I was overweight. I had a teenage pregnancy many, many years ago. That was all she ever saw. This drove anxiety, depression and a few failed attempts...well, you know.\n\nShe never had a relationship with her only grandson, either. He wasn’t told she was sick. He never got to say goodbye.\n\nIt’s just... frustrating. Heartbreaking. Infuriating.\n\nThank you for letting me vent.",

    "content": "I’m not suicidal; please don’t report me\n\nI really want to cry. I’ve been suicidal my whole life bc my mom hated me and my sisters since we were born and told us every day and just hated us so much and my dad didn’t care that I existed except when he was being a perverted creep and he left when I was 15 anyway and never answered me again. Every minute of every day was screaming and abuse and hell. They never remotely cared about us; they never took us to a doctor and they wouldn’t have cared if we died. They never loved us at all.\n\nAnyway I’m 18 and I started college this year and I went to another state to get away from my mom.\n\nMy brain is just so broken, I feel so dead, and so I planned to commit suicide a couple months ago. I had a suicide pact with someone I know but I guess someone found out and turned us in bc the police came to my dorm and I ended up in the mental hospital. I actually didn’t mind it there, I met a few people I got along with and made friends with, but there was a man there who was 48 and he was a former teacher and he had kids older than me and stuff, and he had admitted himself for alcoholism, so I thought he just wanted to be friends. He came up to me and was explaining stuff about the hospital. Eventually after a couple days I told him part of the reason I was suicidal, which was SA, which made this even more hurtful\n\nI got out after the mandatory 3 days and that’s when he decided to leave as well. He got a hotel room near my dorm and called me and was drinking a bit and told me he was gonna jump but he wanted to hear my voice. He kept saying it so I figured I had to go over there to stop him. I went over there and at first he was saying all this stuff about how we should have a suicide pact, and I didn’t really want to anymore bc idk, I actually fit in with the people at the mental hospital, like they had my same life experiences in childhood etc, which I’ve never encountered, so I didn’t feel so alien, so I ignored him. Eventually I was going to leave bc he seemed fine, but he said that if I don’t sleep over he doesn’t know what might happen. I was stupid I guess but I really believed him. I mean he’s an alcoholic and was in the mental hospital, so I stayed. It was like 11 and I got tired so I wanted to sleep and he said I could sleep in the hotel bed. Then he laid down next to me and started “confessing” that he had a crush on me it was so upsetting I was so scared. I didn’t say anything but I asked him to please not touch me. Anyway I thought it was all good but then like a few minutes later he started touching me and I asked him to stop and he was just ignoring me at this point. I’ve been assaulted before so I just froze and I was saying no but he was ignoring me and covered my mouth and anyway he r*ped me. It hurt so much and I was so scared and I wanted to die I couldn’t believe what must be wrong with me for this to happen\n\nThis happened a couple months ago. I’m fine I guess like I go to school and work but I’m just so broken and upset. I could never tell anyone about this bc they’ll just hate me and think I did it to myself. It doesn’t even matter bc it’s happened multiple times before (it wasn’t my fault, the other times it was even less my fault I didn’t go anywhere) but idk I just hate everything I feel like I must be such a monster if this can happen to me multiple times like they sense evil in me and have to destroy it idk.

    "content": "I (36f) went on a weekend trip with this guy (43m). He lived abroad most of his life so he doesn't know our tourist destinations that well. We went to this tiny town that everyone who lives here has been to multiple times, and because it was a long weekend, everything was fully booked, so our hotel was far away from the town's center.\n\nI liked him for almost half a year, but I've known him for years, he is one of my favorite artists and he has a very niche IG account. We met in person last year and we were both awe struck about each other when we met, like I couldn't believe how handsome he was in person and he kept asking me to hug him, I could feel him smelling my hair.\n\nI went to visit him while I was abroad in his city back in January, and when I saw him he totally tricked me into getting to his apartment and well... We ended up doing it. But I didn't want to catch feelings for him, so I decided not to visit him again while I was in his city.\n\nHe then decided to come visit here for the long weekend. He's pretty handsome and definitely draws female attention to him, and he always tells me about all the girls that approach him in public. I guess he wants to make me jealous? Anyway, I punch back and I tell him about the guys I date. Dumb little game, I know.\n\nSo, this weekend we went on this trip together, since he doesn't know his way around I had to be on top of the booking. I booked two separate bedrooms. My plan was to have a nice weekend with him and NOT GET ATTACHED, because tbh he's way too handsome and I don't think I could manage all the jealousy that comes with having someone like him as a partner.\n\nThe getaway went ok, We couldn't get our hands of each other, but my poor planning skills ruined some parts of the trip and he was noticably irritated, but didn't blame it on me. I ended up knowing him better, we had long talks, he was very sweet to me. He showed me some of his work unedited. We talked about our childhoods and  all.\n\nAt some point he said something like \"I know that for you this is something superficial\" , and when I asked him what he meant he said that he knew I was there for the sex and that I only used guys for pleasure. I told him that I actually had admired him for years and that I wasn't at all interested in sleeping with him when we first met, I was just so glad to meet one of my favorite artists. And I did tell him I cared deeply about him, but I knew that I wasn't special for him at all either, and I had no reason to believe he wanted anything else than just having a good time with me, as he is surrounded by beautiful woman all the time, I was just the flavor of the week. He seemed a bit offended by that comment , he said he doesn't  see girls that way and that he only opens up to someone special. We agreed that we both like each other and we both café for each other , so that the best thing would be to take advantage of the time together, and maybe do physical stuff while we still can when we have the chance, but remain good friends until we're old.\n\nI don't know, it was a weird conversation and i can't shake the feeling that he was just trying to make me say that I was in love with him or something because of his narcissistic nature. I have shielded my heart from guys like him years ago because I know falling for them doesn't ever end well.\n\nAnyway, at the end of the trip we couldn't get a bus back to our city and he got pretty mad. I felt awful and I wasn't looking forward to spend the next 3 hours next to him being mad. But he explained to me that it was just his survival skills, nothing personal. He went back to being all touchy feely and even told me he had referred to me as \"his wife\" to some lady who asked him who I was to him. I told him he was full of it, I knew he was just trying to manipulate me. He fell asleep on my lap for most of the trip , holding my hand while I caressed his hair. He drooled on my pants and he was so embarrassed haha so sweet.\n\nAnd then.... Once we arrived and left the bus, he just asked me if I could get a bus to my place from where we were. Plain and cold. I said yeah , so he just turned around and said see ya then! No kiss, no hug, nothing. I called him out on it, he turned around, gave me a small peck kiss and then went away.\n\nI was just in awe about how he could just shift from being so sweet to basically abandoning me there like as I was some stranger.\n\nI think thats what really bothers me. We shared some good moments, and I opened up about my feelings for him. I told him that maybe we couldn't be good as a couple because neither one of us is willing to settle down, but that I did want him in my life as a friend as I admired him too much. And he agreed! But the way he left me there just made me feel like he never really cared.\n\nAnd I am here now as a 36 yo woman crying like a teenager because I feel I lost someone I was really starting to care about.\n\nI know I can't get his heart , I'm not special, I'm not as pretty , and I am old, so I don't even entertain the idea of him ever falling for me, and I know, I knew since we started this whole thing to prevent myself from getting hurt.  but I did want to be able to maybe go out with him for coffee and talk about art for years. I wanted a friendship.\n\nI'm so confused.\n\nI guess I just wanted to write about it and get it off my chest so that it doesn't eat me anymore.  I don't want to, and I also can't tell my friends because he is kind of famous in our circles (and one of my best friends told me he was a major player so I should stay away from him), and I'm kind of embarrassed of how it played out.\n\nI miss him. I messaged him a few hours after I got home back from our trip, he just put a heart react on my message and that was it. I don't think I can push it anymore, I should wait for him to write me, and I'm dying thinking he might never write again. Ah well, I ended up being hurt despite all my efforts not to.\n\nThanks for reading. If you have any advice about how to handle this,  it would be highly appreciated.",

    "title": "My best friend of 15 years nuked our friendship when she met her current husband",
    "content": "So this story is a little bit friendship drama and a little bit bridezilla drama, but I have been reading reddit stories for a long time and wanted to get my own off my chest.  Sorry this is so long!\n\nSome background first: my best friend of 15 years and I (both female in our 30s) met in college when we were randomly assigned to the same freshman dorm, and we had been inseparable ever since.  I'm talking this women was my person, we did so much together, were there for each other's huge milestones, and had kept our friendship going strong for so long even after I moved out of the state several years ago.  I always felt like our friendship was really balanced in that nobody was carrying more or less effort of the friendship than the other.  I even helped her both plan over several months and execute her escape from her abusive ex-husband, and was one of only a couple of people entrusted with this knowledge prior to her physically leaving.  We were TIGHT.\n\nMy husband and I eloped in our state last summer, which we had been planning for 17 months prior to the event.  Due to events with my family, we decided to elope with literally only ourselves and our photographer, no family or friends to avoid drama (I had a bachelorette party with my friends a month prior to the wedding so they could still be involved).  About 4 months prior to the wedding, my friend reached out to me and asked if she could come to the elopement.  In her words \"it makes me really sad to think of you getting ready for your wedding on your own\".  My now-husband is a very shy man, but had gotten to know her really well over the years and is now friends/very comfortable with her, and was very on board with her joining us.  Other than ourselves, she would literally be the only other person attending.  To me, this was a really extraordinary display of friendship as she would need to fly to come and it would cost her money, which didn't bother her, and I was so appreciative.  Well, about 2 weeks after she offered to join us and we accepted, she started dating a new guy that she was really into.  After her horrible experience with her first husband (they are now divorced), I was so excited for her that she met somebody as amazing as she was.  Well, this is when the drama started.\n\nAt first, she just asked if her new boyfriend could come up to the wedding with her (they had only been dating 2 weeks at this point).  My husband and I talked about it, and he was super uncomfortable with having a stranger join in.  I got back to my friend about it and said \"no, it's nothing to do with him, we just don't want a stranger at our wedding last minute\".  We had plans to do girl stuff like get our nails done the day before the wedding, which would leave my husband to entertain a stranger.  She came back with \"well, he doesn't have to join in anything we do as a group\", which felt really icky as we're people who wouldn't want somebody else to feel excluded the first time they fly up to meet us, especially when they're the partner of my best friend.  It's not that we didn't ever want to meet the guy, just not last minute for our wedding.  Her response? \"Well, you can't tell people they can't fly to your state\", which is technically true but just felt like an excuse for crossing a clearly stated boundary? Either way, this started the only fight we had ever had in 15 years of friendship.  She felt like \"I just wanted her to be alone\" in my state (weird because before she met the guy, she was fine with that), and that I was being unreasonable.  She made plans and bought plane tickets for both of them despite me communicating mine and my husband's feelings about the whole thing several times.\n\nDuring this time, she and her new boyfriend got engaged after less than 4 weeks of dating.  I maintained my stance that we were not comfortable with having him come up to meet us at this time.  She revealed that her and her now fiance had made plans to elope 4 days after us in a different state, and were now going to fly there directly after our wedding was over.  She wanted our nail appointment and stuff we were doing in the days leading up to the wedding to now be joint celebrations for their upcoming wedding too. Mind you, she did NOT consult me on how my husband or I felt about this prior to making her own plans, and was very upset that I didn't react the way she expected me to.  Instead of being excited like she expected about being able to do stuff for both our weddings at the same time, I was just shocked and frankly very upset that she was hijacking our wedding now.  If she had discussed this with me before just deciding, I think I would have reacted a little differently, but it just felt so disrespectful to make plans that affected my husband and I without involving us.  I wrote her a long text to her explaining how disrespectful this felt, and asked her why she seemed willing to nuke our friendship of 15 years over a man who was nobody to anybody 6 weeks ago.  At this point, there had been many many conversations about her not listening about having her man come up with her, and now about how weird it was that they were now getting married so close to our own wedding.  My husband even asked at this point if we could move the wedding date or location to avoid the drama because he was so stressed out.  This was his wedding too, so that broke my heart.  I ended up telling her not to come at all, and told her she was no longer welcome.  We didn't end up speaking much for 2 months, and she cancelled on my bachelorette party 4 days before it was supposed to happen.  I never received an apology or acknowledgement of her behavior for any of it.  My other absolutely incredible human of a best friend from elementary school ended up coming up for our wedding instead when she saw how stressed and upset I was about the whole situation; I am eternally grateful for her.\n\nFast forward about 3 months, our wedding and honeymoon are over.  My friend (the one who did indeed get married 4 days after us) reached out asking if I wanted to be the maid of honor in their wedding coming up in about a year.  You see, their parents are not well physically and were unable to attend the elopement, so they are throwing a second bigger wedding for their family in their home state.  I asked explicitly if she was sure she wanted me to be MOH after everything that happened earlier that year, she said yes she was sure.  I accepted despite some reservations because I wanted her to have an amazing wedding and very much valued our friendship.  While MOH, she kept expressing how overwhelmed she felt with everything, so I tried really hard to take things off her plate.  I researched all the photographers in the area, and made a spreadsheet with their pricing, contact info, availability, etc.  I also did something similar with the area hotels within her price range.  We're taking many many hours of research, but I was happy to help out. During this time, I also coordinated with the other bridesmaids to order snacks (vegan I might add) for her wedding dress shopping experience, which I attended remotely directly after working a 12 hour night shift.  I also had already planned and booked her bachelorette party.  Everything seemed to be going smoothly, she seemed happy and had never indicated otherwise.  Then came the \"we need to talk\" text.\n\nIt was a normal Wednesday, we had just had a bridesmaid meeting over Teams 2 days before, and everything seemed fine.  When we got on the phone, she informed me that she no longer wanted me to be the MOH.  To say I was blindsided was an understatement.  She told me one of the other bridesmaids had agreed to take up the title. I was obviously hurt, but she is the bride, so I just said \"ok, if that's what you really want\".  She then said \"but you can still come to the wedding if you want\".  I froze and then asked \"so what you're really saying is that I'm no longer in the bridal party\" (she never explicitly stated that, just that somebody else was going to be MOH), and her response was only \"correct\".  She didn't even have the balls to tell me that I was booted from the bridal party entirely, I had to ask outright.  From MOH to guest in one fell swoop.\n\nHer reasons you ask?- \"I have felt out of sync with you for a while now\"- \"You were making me feel pressured to do things for the wedding before I was ready to do so\"\n\nI asked her why she never ever said anything to me if the way I was helping wasn't what she wanted or needed, she just stated \"I didn't think it would help\".  I then asked her why she didn't just demote me to regular bridesmaid if she didn't like the way I was doing things, I've done both MOH and bridesmaid before and know how to do both.  In my experience as a regular bridesmaid, I wouldn't be in charge of planning anything anymore unless the new MOH or bride asked me explicitly.  Her answer was again \"I didn't think it would help\".  This was the last straw.  After everything that had happened with her over the last year, I was done.  I wasn't going to continue setting myself up to be hurt by her anymore and it was clear she didn't care about my opinions, thoughts or feelings.  I told her not to contact me ever again and blocked her on everything after that call.  Needless to say I am not going to her wedding.  None of my other friends seemed that surprised by any of the events above, so maybe she was acting like this before and I just couldn't see.\n\nSide note: Remember how her first wedding was 4 days after our wedding? Well, her other wedding is going to be 3 days after my birthday.  Even my husband, who is anti-drama, asked me if I thought this was intentional haha.\n\nSide note 2: I'm friends with one of the other bridesmaids independently of her wedding, and apparently my friend had been telling everybody else that the only reason we had a fight around my wedding was because I didn't like that she was also getting married so close to our date.  Which shows she neither heard nor understood anything that I said to her regarding that situation.  I truly hope that it's just a coincidence that she met her now husband and then started acting like a terrible person.\n\nThank you everybody for reading, it feels good to get this off my chest!",

    "content": "I have been trying to process and work through what I saw yesterday, but it has been really hard. The event itself was a lot but now I’m dealing with the “why’s” which make me feel guilty since what happened has nothing to do with me. I was just a witness. I tried writing through it, but it hasn’t been enough so I’m trying again, thinking that if I get it in front of others I can start to live past it.\n\nYesterday evening, I was sitting on this big rock while I was waiting for the bus. A little ways down the road there was a taxi van. He was either backing out or adjusting his U-turn, but obviously reversing and not moving super fast. From where I was sitting, I didn’t see how fast the bike courier was going when he hit the front side of the van. And the biker immediately went under the front wheel of the van and I could hear him and his bicycle crunch under the tire.\n\nThe position the biker was on the ground was how he stayed for the whole 20 minutes that he was out there. He never moved. So, I’m almost positive he died during the collision or if there was some way he survived, he could have been fully paralyzed.\n\nBut there weren’t many people to see the accident head on like I did. A man in his Jeep came out and a few security from the booth around (my stop is near a campus) came out to help. They checked for signs of life and directed traffic around him and had someone call 911. Police came and did much of the same. The fire department came and started doing CPR but they didn’t take off the man’s helmet. The ambulance came and I didn’t see any defibrillator or adrenaline unless they did those things in the back once they loaded him on the gurney and took the man away. But even after they put him in the ambulance, it didn’t leave or take off. There wasn’t a rush.\n\nIt felt like I was out there for two hours but it all happened in about 20 minutes. And, it’s hard to think about the collision and how if the biker hasn’t passed away I’m sure the injuries will last a lifetime. And I think about the taxi driver who just sat in the van with his head down and how he will most likely lose almost everything because of an accident.\n\nI don’t know why I had to see it but I did and I don’t know what to do with it if anything at all.",

    "content": "What is the actual contribution of entertainers and influencers to society?\n\nGrowing up, I always thought about what my contribution to society would be. I believed that a meaningful life should involve helping others in a tangible way—whether it’s building bridges, being a doctor who treats patients, a teacher who educates, or even a wedding planner who helps people organize one of the most important days of their lives. Even a makeup artist contributes by helping people feel comfortable in their own skin through skillful techniques.\n\nBut when I look at idols, entertainers, and influencers, I can’t help but wonder: What is their actual purpose beyond surface-level happiness? Sure, they make people feel entertained, maybe even inspired, but does that really compare to professions that create real change?\n\nAnd yet, these are the people society worships the most. They get millions, live in luxury, and are treated like they’ve accomplished something great—while doctors, engineers, teachers, and everyday workers struggle for recognition or financial stability. It feels unfair that popularity is more valuable than actual contribution.\n\nI know entertainment is a part of life, and I’m not saying it’s useless. But on a deeper level, I wonder… what even is their life purpose? If your whole job is just singing, dancing, or making videos, what’s the end goal? It’s not like they’re solving world problems, creating lasting change, or advancing society.\n\nDoes anyone else ever think about this? Or am I just overanalyzing it?",

I've been minimizing contact with her recently though and it sucks because I know that I would never act on these feelings. The reason I haven't been talking to her as much is because I don't want James to feel like something would happen between us. I was spending much more time with Sarah than James because we are both into the same stuff right now.\n\nI'm glad Sarah doesn't feel the same way toward me as I do her, but it sucks knowing that she wouldn't feel the same even had she never met James.

    "content": "This happened two years ago and I still cry when I think about this. I had a coworker at one point who had very thin boundaries - she would consistently causally trauma dump at work without regard to how it affected others and mostly coped with her trauma through drinking. I’m fairly certain she was drinking at work, but never saw her take swigs. Just saw her acting intoxicated and smelling like alcohol. I grew up with an alcoholic parent, so her behavior was fairly uncomfortable for me to be around, meaning I did not get close to her even though she shared many very private things with me. I almost wish I had invested in her more just so I would know more about her family - maybe I would have had enough information to intervene if I had befriended her.\n\nOne day, her niece came in to work with her. This little girl was probably about 5. When she walked in the door, she had her hands cupped around the sides of her face so she could only see the ground in front of her. She made no eye contact and would not verbally respond to anyone, including her aunt.\n\nThis was the angriest child I have ever seen. She glared at everyone, held her hands in fists for almost the entire time she was there, stayed completely silent, and kept her back to the wall for the majority of the time she was in the shop. I’ve been through a lot of trauma therapy and it was very obvious to me that this child was hyper-vigilant if not in fight or flight.\n\nAfter the child was picked up by another family member, I stepped outside for a smoke. My coworker, the aunt of the child, was already outside smoking.\n\nI sat down next to her and she casually said to me “my niece told her friend that someone licked her hooha.” It was like cold water had been dumped over my head as she told me more about it. I felt so sick for so many reasons. A FIVE YEAR OLD told their friend that someone licked their private parts, that friend told her mom, who told my coworker’s niece’s parents. And no one was doing anything actionable. No therapy, no intervention, no questions. Just shrugs and “hope that’s not actually happening”.\n\nAfter my shift I called child services and went to the police station by my work. I tried everything I could to get a report filed, a welfare check done, literally anything. Because I didn’t have the name of the child’s parents, the police AND child services told me I didn’t have enough information to complete a report. I called so many times with different ideas of how I could make a legitimate report, but I simply didn’t have enough information.\n\nI think about this multiple times a week, sometimes every day for the entire day. I myself am someone who survived CSA. I have complex trauma and I know what it’s like to be a child in a setting where no adults are protecting you, even when they know what’s going on.\n\nOur boss commit suicide that same week, so everything at that work place became even more chaotic very quickly. I left because I could not cope with the instability. Part of me wishes I had stayed just to garner more information, but that work place was so toxic that I started to experience suicidal ideation. I had to leave for my safety. Now that I’m farther removed from the experience, I feel like I could have pulled myself up by my bootstraps and stayed long enough to get more info for the sake of this little girl.\n\nI’m not sure why I’m sharing this. Yesterday this popped up in my head for the millionth time and I had such a strong reaction to the memory that I vomited. I will never be able to get the image of that little child’s angry face out of my head. I don’t think I’ll ever forget her and I will always wonder if there is something I could have done to help.",

    "content": "I (22F) broke up with my boyfriend (20M) of 6 months on new years of 2024. I broke up with him for a plethora of reasons including him accusing me of stealing $500, him accusing me of cheating, him proposing, how he treated me, him telling me he was going to commit suicide and it was my fault, and much more. For the record, I didn’t do any of the things he accused me of. Well it didn’t end at the breakup. This specific individual is in the military and most of our relationship was long distance. He sent me death threats after the initial break up which I did contact the police and his commanding officer about. I told him to leave me alone and blocked him. However for the year of 2024, he had his friends that live where I live follow me and threaten any guy I was seeing into breaking up with me, he constantly messaged me on different numbers saying words coated in honey to try to get me back and he even showed up to my house when he was on leave. One of the many reasons I broke up with him was that he was home for Christmas of 2023 and refused to see me and I got really upset because I still “loved him” at that time. I have now learned through therapy that it wasn’t love, I was just caught in the web. Well Christmas of 2024 came around and he was back on leave and he had his mom message me telling me that he was going to commit suicide if I didn’t show up. I told her to leave me alone and it was of course an empty threat (maybe even a test). He left after that and apparently, according to his mom he was deployed. Well I got a text on my birthday (February 4th) saying that he still loved me and yada yada which went ignored and then I got a call from his military base. Apparently he had went missing in action and I was his beneficiary. I haven’t heard anything from him since but I feel free finally. I have a date this week and I’m going to see if anyone threatens my date into ending it with me. I kinda feel bad that I was so harsh but I also think it was survival. I think that if I was any less harsh, it would’ve been a lifetime of pain for me.",

    "content": "I want to share my story about how I started a business from scratch, faced unexpected challenges, and now find myself at a crossroads. This isn’t just about bags—it’s about resilience, risks, and the struggle to keep going when everything seems to work against you.\n\nI genuinely want to hear your thoughts because, honestly, I don't know what to do next.\n\nBefore all of this, my family and I had stable jobs, and life was fairly predictable. But then, everything shifted. My parents lost their jobs, and I had to step up to support them. I also had to make the tough decision to send my wife and child abroad to ensure their safety while I stayed behind and worked.\n\nI took a job as the head of security for a wealthy businessman. Every cent I made went to supporting my family. I lived on the bare minimum, just making sure I could keep going physically and mentally.\n\nMy mother, after months of being unable to work, started looking for a way to do something productive. She remembered the small bag-making business that my wife and I had started before the pandemic, which we had to shut down due to COVID-19.\n\nShe decided to try reviving it, and we applied for a small business grant. The process was slow, and after waiting nearly a year, we were approved—but for much less money than we had originally planned for. We had to decide whether to take the risk and move forward or let the idea go.\n\nMy mother had no prior experience in fashion or sewing—she had worked in an office her entire life. But she was determined to learn. I helped her enroll in bag design and sewing courses, and she began developing the first models.\n\nMeanwhile, in my free time, I worked on setting up our Etsy store. We put everything we had into making this business work.\n\nWhile all of this was happening, my employer decided to relocate to Valencia, Spain, and offered me a job there. It seemed like a great opportunity, so I moved my family and followed him.\n\nOver several months, I:\n\nHelped relocate his family and others.\n\nAssisted in finding and purchasing a new business (a plywood factory for investment purposes).\n\nBut after everything was set up, he fired me without warning, leaving me unemployed in a foreign country with no backup plan.\n\nRight now, my family and I are living in Spain, relying on our last savings (enough for about 4–5 months). Meanwhile, our Etsy store has not generated a single sale, and my mother is struggling to keep up with rent for the workshop.\n\nOur bags are high-quality, handcrafted leather pieces. We set the price range at X–Y$, but we haven’t made a single sale.\n\nWe tried advertising on Etsy and Instagram, but conversion is extremely low.\n\nMaybe we’ve chosen the wrong target audience, or our product descriptions aren’t engaging enough?\n\n🔎 Please check out our store and give honest feedback! Maybe you’ll see mistakes that we’re not noticing? Any advice or critique would help us understand what needs to change to keep this business alive.\n\nI’m attaching the store link and a video of our production process. I’d be grateful for any input! 🙏",

I feel like I'm failing her and I want to help but I can't, I feel like I don't do enough for her. I feel like I'm a bad listener or that I ignore her or that I don't rech out often enough to her and that I'm a bad friend and a bad person for that. She also almost always never reaches out to me. I know it's not my fault but I blame myself. I'm scared she might become or is suicidal like my sister was. My sister was in the hospital for mental health a few times and this first started when I was younger. She threatened to cut her hand off the night I was supposed to sleep in hee room. (BTW she is 5 years older than me). I blame myself for that too. I am not suicidal or do self harm or depressed. I don't have a therapist but I used to due to bullying which I no longer deal with.

    "content": "I have to be as vague as possible because if this company is identified and they figure out who I am, not even kidding—I feel like they’ll come looking. Lol. No joke, this privately owned would be fortune 500, corporate giant makes Black Mirror feel a little too real. Some real Dr. Evil, shark tank with piranhas type stuff, lol.\n\nThe company I work for is responsible for just about everything plastic. If it’s plastic packaging, there’s a good chance it passed through here. I live in a place so small it’s not even a town—it’s officially considered a village. No McDonald’s, barely any businesses, and one massive factory that showed up about 20 years ago and just kept growing. What started as a laid-back, trustworthy workplace with great pay eventually expanded into multiple buildings and became the town’s biggest employer. Then, after a major buyout, billions of dollars started flowing through, and everything changed.\n\nNow, you can’t step into one of the two gas stations or small handful of stores without seeing someone wearing the company shirt they hand out. But when outside corporate interests took over, they started bringing in their own people, handing out management positions to friends, and running the place like a private club. And once a company gets big enough in a small town, there’s no accountability. What used to be a solid job turned into something straight out of an HBO drama.\n\nThe usual corporate nonsense got worse—fudging time cards, sexism, favoritism, and “adjusting” drug test results after major accidents. But it doesn’t stop there. We’re talking covering up assaults, extreme drug use, high-ranking executives (not saying how high, just in case) cheating and keeping mistresses in plain sight in the giant glass HR building, and full-blown criminal activity.\n\nOne of the company’s truck drivers had a history of drinking on the job and multiple DUIs. One day, he drank before his shift and ended up ending a motorcyclist. After what I can only assume was a ton of money changing hands, it was swept under the rug. No company name in the news, just one vague article about a “truck driver.” In a town this size, that should have been the biggest headline of the year. Instead? Nothing. When you work here long enough, you start to feel like they could make you disappear if you did something they didn’t like.\n\nI’m not some high-ranking executive—I’m just a few steps above entry-level, still working on the factory floor. But over time, I’ve pieced things together—between constantly signing paperwork “agreeing to their policies”, overhearing the right conversations, and befriending a supervisor who introduced me to a high-ranking corporate employee who was a little too trusting with their secrets. I still consider these people friends, but the work environment is toxic, and after enough time, it starts to mess with your sanity.\n\nWe work 12-hour shifts, and if you think workplace screaming matches are rare, try several a night. The corporate systems they claim improve production don’t actually work, which throws everything into chaos. Meanwhile, the building manager—who’s supposed to oversee operations— regularly sleeps for half the shift, hides in a janitor’s closet, and watches movies. But if we stray from their broken systems? It’s not pretty. You can get written up for not wearing gloves while using a tape measure, and speaking up about only getting one 10-minute break in a 12-hour shift is a quick way to get fired, no questions asked.\n\nAnd before you ask, “Why don’t you just leave?”—well, the pay was really good then, and it’s REALLY good now, and in a small town with almost no other high-paying jobs, that’s not an easy decision.\n\nI want to highlight two specific incidents that really set the tone for what kind of company this is. I have plenty more stories I’d be willing to share if anyone is interested.\n\nFirst, not long ago, an employee—who, to be fair, was very good at their job—had a serious problem with anger and violent outbursts. Whether there was something personal going on, I don’t know, but there’s no excuse for the level they took it to. We’re talking constant verbal abuse to all of his peers, throwing heavy and sharp objects, and even threatening to end multiple coworkers—while openly keeping a weapon in his vehicle.\n\nThe company’s solution? Slap a “No weapons” sticker on the door and call it a day.\n\nOne time, during a rage fit over a production issue, he threw a metal holder containing a sharp industrial blade. It hit a coworker—fortunately, the injury wasn’t severe, but it was serious enough that it should have led to real consequences. Instead, behind closed doors, the injured employee was convinced to stay quiet, promised that “action would be taken.” Nothing happened.\n\nThat same injured employee weeks later asked for a break after eight hours of nonstop hard labor and hinted that he might speak up about what had happened to him if he didn’t at least get a few minutes to eat. The next day? He was fired.\n\nThe guy who threw the blade? Still works here, no consequences.\n\nAnd the man who was fired? One of the hardest-working, most respectable guys I’ve ever met. This one really gets to me.\n\nNow, let’s talk about one of the biggest food (specific product not named) companies in the country. My company is pretty much the sole provider of all product for them, and there’s a strict rule in place: a specific banned chemical cannot be used in any production—not just in their products, but in any product we run, period.\n\nTo keep the contract, we get frequent audits. When that happens? A full-scale cover-up goes into motion. That banned chemical is hidden on the highest warehouse shelves, fake labels are created, and paperwork mentioning it is thrown out and replaced after. Employees in charge of this are explicitly told to make sure nothing with the chemical’s name is left visible.\n\nIf this information ever got out, I can guarantee that contract would be terminated immediately.\n\nThe deeper you go in corporate manufacturing, the more you realize—ethics are a PR stunt, safety is a technicality, and cover-ups are just business as usual.\n\nSorry for the long read, but if you made it this far, I seriously appreciate it. Just had to get some of this off my chest.",

I genuinely don’t think I deserve him because he’s made me feel so happy and is constantly reaffirming my gender identity when I’m having bad days. He’s uplifting and he doesn’t get mad if I tell him I’m having a bad depression day and am struggling to take care of myself. He just makes me feel so much better about myself and my mental issues and for fucks sake I think he’s a keeper and I’m so happy he is.\n\nIf we ever get married I’m fucking doing my vows in French.

I anticipate this will be very long, have fun.\n\nSo for some context\n\nIn late 2023 my wife and I bought a house and I was spending a lot of time for a couple of months working on the house almost every evening and weekend I could spare. During this time my wife started going out with some new friends including this guy J. Randomly one evening she looks a bit funny and says to me, \"I don't trust myself around him\". I hear this, my heart sinks a bit but I feel like we have a strong relationship and I tell her \"I trust you not to do anything stupid, just be sensible about what time and how you spend time with him\". She liked this and we moved on, but I decided to keep an eye on the situation. She started spending more and more time with him and these new friends, going out and getting drunk while I was working late on the house. It was starting to make me uncomfortable and eventually I said so. I didn't ask for anything, I just expressed my feelings. She said, she understood but they're just friends and there's nothing to be worried about. They keep hanging out until one day his partner, a woman married to another man...., forbade him from speaking to my wife because she was jealous. So he ghosted my wife and she got really upset. It hurt me to see how upset she was for two reasons,\n\nMy wife is upset, that's upsetting\n\nShe's so upset it feels weird and she's acting like a breakup\n\nShe asked me to proof read a message she wanted to send and I read a bit and had to put it down, I said \" this is a breakup message, I refuse to do this\" She remained adamant they were just friends and nothing more. I accused her of having an emotional affair, again she denied it and was adamant they were just friends and that I need to get over this.\n\nSome weeks later J comes back on the scene having broken up with his previous gf. My wife says she's going to talk to him but be very boundaried. I tell her that I'm uncomfortable with all of this, if she's going to see him she should be careful.\n\nA week or two later she comes stumbling in at 5am, I ask where she's been and she explains that she has been out with J, went back to his place at around 2am and they 'played guitar'.\n\nI was hurt and upset, this was the antithesis of everything we discussed. I said \"you can't do that\" to which my wife took great offense accusing me of controlling her and being misogynistic. To be clear, I never forbade her from seeing him, I never tried to tell her what to do beyond please be careful and don't do anything silly and please respect me. That time I said \"you can't do that\" was the first and only time I specifically said what she could and couldn't do. And to me, it's obvious I wasn't controlling her I was just not saying the quiet part out loud which is \" you can't do that unless you want to ruin our relationship \"\n\nShe is adamant nothing happened, and weirdly I believe her. The issue for me is that she did the opposite of what we both agreed, she disrespected me and my feelings, and she is putting our relationship in jeopardy. To her the issue is that I tried to control her by being upset, and that I'm putting restrictions on her. She pointed out she's a grown ass woman and she can spend time with her friends if she wants to. My being upset about it is a mode of control and I need to stop.\n\nIn principle I have no problem with her seeing her friends, but this guy makes me uncomfortable.\n\nSo that all happened, we were on the rocks, she is clearly having an emotional affair at the very least but adamantly refuses to acknowledge it. I'm trying desperately to find a way to move forward and recover our relationship if we can.\n\nThen, October 2024. My mum died suddenly. I won't go too much into it but it happened, very sudden, shocking, it sucks. My dad died when I was young so a lonely time as well. This is where my wife's behaviour started to seriously turn, I'm going to list the major events as I remember them in the order they happened. I will also try to list areas where I was less than perfect but to be perfectly honest, I don't think there are many. Like really, I have to keep checking myself - surely it wasn't all so one sided, surely I contributed meaningfully to this. Just doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nAnyway here goes.\n\nThe day after my mum died, we are at the pub with a friend, we are talking about it all. My friend asks my wife how she's doing and she says \" I'm worried everyone is going to forget that my mum died \" For context her mum passed away 3-4 years ago from a long contracted period of illness. It spanned over COVID and lock down. I lived in their house with them over all of lockdown and helped look after her mum, watching her die and taking care of her for over a year.\n\nMy wife had been dealing with this tragic and difficult loss for some time, so I had some sympathy to her reaction. But bottom line, it's a shitty thing to say to your partner who lost their mum one day ago, that you're concerned you're not going to get as much attention any more. That my loss will overshadow hers. It speaks volumes and sets up what is to come.\n\nA day later she says she's going to go and see this J guy I mentioned above. The one I'm really uncomfortable with. I made it very clear that I am uncomfortable with this and now is not the time to be testing me like this. I know he's just your friend and there's nothing actually happening (I'm an idiot), but this does upset me and I don't need to deal with this right now. I'd appreciate it if she didn't go. She said she understood but not to worry, this is the last time she's going to see him really. Their relationship has petered out more or less so it will just be the occasional coffee which is all she's going for. Oh and they had plans to go see a jazz band in a few weeks time but she'll cancel that on account of the funeral. She's barely going to see him, so don't worry. I said it was fine. I saw it as, if she's being truthful then I can accept the cost of one more uncomfortable period if the payoff is they really do just leave each other alone for a while. She went and came back a couple hours later, no big deal.\n\nSo the following week we had a spa trip booked, I bought it for her for Christmas. We decided to still go in spite of everything because, why not. I need it. It was great. Had a lovely time, reconnected, I was able to relax and de-stress a bit. But on the last day, we're in a hot tub together sharing a cocktail and she's on her phone. She's messaging J and arranging to meet the next day. I took offense and said \"I thought you weren't seeing eachother any more?\" \"It's just to study, I'm falling behind on my thesis.\"\n\nSo the next day she gets up early and leaves, we agree she'll be back at lunch. I'm very unhappy about all of this and just basically sulk all morning. I leave my phone upstairs and try to get on with my day as best I can, waiting for her to come home and talk about it. 3pm comes and goes. I take a nap. 5PM comes and goes... I check my phone, a couple messages and a couple missed calls. Apparently she decided to stay out for lunch and asked if it was ok. When I didn't reply she decided to stay out for dinner and drinks too. She didn't get home until after I went to bed. I spent the whole evening feeling miserable and hurt. I don't need this. She comes home and I confront her asking if she thought any of that was ok. Turns out it's all my fault because I didn't reply to her and my lack of immediate response was me emotionally blackmailing her to come home. It really wasn't, I just didnt want to have my phone on me and was expecting her to be home at the agreed time. Maybe a little silly and selfish in my part. Maybe. But I'm grieving and she's already pushed my boundaries, I needed some alone time to deal with it. I had no idea I was emotionally blackmailing her. So anyway, she stays out all day with the person that makes me uncomfortable, days after my mum died, days after she promised she wouldn't, and I'm the asshole for not keeping my phone on me in case she decided to change her mind. Great.\n\nA week goes by and it's the day before we're due to leave for my home town, ready for the funeral in a few days. She asks me if we can hold off going for one extra day so she can go to this jazz thing with J. I say, \"wtf? you said that wasn't happening? That's why you saw him earlier because you weren't doing this.\" She says she knows but she really wants to go. I confront her and say \" I really don't feel like I'm your top priority\" \"No, you're not my top priority\" \"... Please elaborate\" \"Well, I just don't see it as a hierarchy. Everyone's in a circle around me and you're all equal priority. You, J, etc..\" \"Right, but I'm your husband and my mum just died. Does that not put me ahead of anyone else?\" \"No.\" Looking dead in my eyes. No.\n\nFine! Go to your jazz thing, idgaf.\n\nShe says \"might as well, the damage is already done by me even asking, right?\"\n\nYeah. The damage is already done.\n\nI can't believe what she said to me, so cold, so heartless, so unempathetic, so selfish. Btw, this woman is a qualified therapist.. let that sink in. Hope you don't get her as your therapist, good lord.\n\nSo she fucks off the next day and I delay my departure for her social plans. I contemplated going down without her but the ensuing drama and questions from family would not be worth it. It was my mum's funeral after all, not my marriage's.\n\nThe funeral goes fine, the week is fine. She doesn't say or do anything shitty. I focus on the funeral and family and everything and mostly not think about the fireball train wreck that is now my marriage.\n\nOn the drive home my wife decides to tell me that she thinks her ex boyfriend (from school days) is \"the one that got away.\" I'm dumbfounded because\n\nWhat a thing to fucking say as I drive us home from burying my mother\n\nIt's just patently untrue. So completely ludicrous that I'm not even bothered by the notion that she might be serious.\n\nIt is at this point that it dawns on me that she may be hurting me on purpose.\n\nThe next day we are having coffee and she says to me \"I never wanted this house, I never wanted this dog, and I don't want kids.\"\n\nLet's be clear, I did not push her to get the house or the dog. If anything she pushed for both of them but it was pretty mutual. She is now tearing up the entire foundation of our marriage. She is lighting fire to the entire future plans we had. The house and dog that I poured my heart and soul into for her, for us. She never wanted apparently. Just brutal. Savage. She acted shocked when I started crying, \"I didn't expect it to upset you this much\" Incredible. The next day I go to my friend's place and just cry on her for hours. I am in a complete state. It's all too much, overwhelming, awful, and just confusing. Why is she being so mean? I wondered if she hated me, then I thought.. maybe she's trying to get me to break up with her. She's clearly having an affair of some variety. My mum just died. Maybe she just doesn't want to be the person to break up with their partner when their mum died. Especially a partner who cared for her dying mother. And especially because she was having an affair. She'd be seen as such an asshole, so rather than just admitting everything and being an asshole she decided to torture me until I pulled the plug myself. Not her fault then, is it? Anyway, that thought occurred to me. But I'm in no state to decide the fate of my marriage. I'm grieving, I'm distraught, I'm reeling from the various harrowing incidents listed above. Barely enough time to process one before another comes along. It may seem obvious to you and me now, but at the time I just couldn't see clearly what was happening or exactly why. My friend gave me some advice that I didn't need to decide anything right now, that settled me. Took some pressure off At around this point my perception of time gets a bit funny. Mixture of grief and brain fuckery.\n\nSo now I'm pissed at her, I don't trust her. I feel badly hurt. She says she's going out with J again. I say I don't care. Resigned to this shitty behaviour, unable to reason with her, unable to discuss it, unable to make the call and leave.\n\nShe comes back at 4 in the morning high AF, they had taken MDMA together. The oxytocin drug. Under the influence of this drug he confessed his feelings for her. She was totally shocked by this and said it was all a little uncomfortable. Ok, I said. Whatever. The next day we're driving somewhere and I really can't remember what she said but it just set me off. I think it was something along the lines of \" I don't know why you're so upset with me?\" I was furious, I was worn down, I was mistreated. For the first time, I raised my voice. I was shouting at her. Listing all of these shitty instances that were cutting me up whilst I grieved. I raised my hand, clenched my fist and brought it down on the steering wheel in anger. It made a dull bang noise.\n\nThis was the start of a new narrative from my wife. The scary, aggressive husband narrative. The perfect excuse, in her eyes, to leave me without raising questions about her betrayal and complete lack of empathy. You're scary, she said. I was cowering in the passenger seat, she said. You're just like my aggressive father, she said.\n\nI tried defending myself but please remember I was in a complete mess mentally and emotionally. I started to believe her. Maybe I did lose control, maybe I am one of those guys. Maybe I threatened her. I thought that, yes it was an outburst, but no it wasn't threatening. I'm not a big scary person. I'm just a human being that has been deeply hurt and wounded when they're at their most vulnerable. But maybe that's not a good enough excuse. Maybe I crossed a line.\n\nShe sowed the seeds of doubt in my vulnerable mind. I started doubting my memory of events, did I black out for a moment and do something really scary?\n\nShe told me that I was 'potentially abusive'. To be clear, she's not accusing me of being abusive, she's accusing me of maybe becoming abusive in the future. And she can't take that risk. I'm not safe to have children with, you know the children she said she didn't want before I ever shouted.\n\nI believed her.\n\nWhat a monster I was. How could I be so terrible, I never thought I was like this. No wonder she was having an affair for the last several weeks. I shouted at her and hit my hand on the steering wheel in frustration.\n\nShe lent into it but not too far. She was manipulating me, telling me it's ok. You just need to go to therapy and sort yourself out. As long as I'm going along with her narrative, she's all ok my side. If I ever doubt her, I'm terrible and hurtful and potentially abusive.\n\nShe decided it was time to end things, she had the get out of jail free card she wanted.\n\nShe didn't leave me for another man and emotionally abused me when my mum died, she saved herself from an potentially abusive relationship.\n\nMy greatest crime was hitting a steering wheel.\n\nOne of the last things she said to me. She spoke with a friend of hers who had broken up with her partner of 8 years, had two wild years, and then they got back together for several years. I asked what she meant by wild years, \"just connecting with lots of people\". So she turns to me and says, I think we're a lot like them, you know?\n\nI wanted to say, I bet she didn't abuse her partner. I bet she didn't hurt him when his mum died. I bet she didn't manipulate him into believing he was abusive. And the sheer audacity of sitting there and looking to me to approve of her fucking a bunch of people for two years before I take her back. I said nothing, she nudged me. Desperate for me to implicitly condone her actions and behaviours by giving even the slightest inkling that I might take her back when she's done fucking around. I turned away and left. I was done.\n\nNot two days after our official break up she declared herself in a relationship with J. But to her family, she accused me of being aggressive and scary and forcing her to leave. She denies having had an affair, pretending that her and J are not an item. She goes to my friends and asks them to meet her new partner J. Again, implicitly asking them to condone her actions by meeting this J guy. My friends all refuse, and begin to cut contact with her. They've seen what she's done. They knew what she was doing to me before I did. They won't tolerate her BS. I love my friends.\n\nMy wife's sister knows everything, she heard it all from my wife's point of view and STILL she took 'my side'. Then she heard what I had to say.. boy was she pissed. She told her whole family the truth, my wife tried to convince them that her sister was a liar. That she didn't understand. She's pregnant btw. My wife just tried to turn her family against her pregnant younger sister.\n\nIn her attempts to not be seen as a terrible heartless B, that would abandon her husband when he needed her most, she turned herself into an even worse monster. An abuser according to some. A liar, a manipulated, a nasty piece of work. Sometimes you meet your destiny on the path to avoid it.\n\nI'm 2 months free.\n\nI don't want to let another human being close to me like that again, but maybe that will change with time. My therapist, and my wife's sister who's also a qualified therapist both said that she has been emotionally abusive to me. Coercive controlling behaviour. I don't know about that, but I know I've been treated unfairly.\n\nThanks for reading this far, I hope it was entertaining.\n\nX",

The terror of realizing that you don't want to die, the sudden desperation to live, only it's too late now and you're already falling to your death. Maybe some of you have experienced it, yourself. If you did, I'm sorry, and I'm glad you're still here.\n\nI'll get to the point. I prepared to commit suicide, something that has been on my mind every day for the past year and a half. Approximately. I decided to finally do it in January, I think. Ghosted all my friends, ruined every relationship within my family, completely neglected my schoolwork to the point that it's not salvageable anymore and that I'd have to drop out if I didn't die (though, honestly, I gave up on that much earlier).\n\nI wrote the letters. I bought the rope. I chose the place.\n\nBut I am scared. I'm fucking terrified. I don't want to die anymore, but now it feels like I don't have a choice. That I already made this decision, and I have to follow through. It's not that I want to live... I don't. At least not the life I have now. It's not even something worth being called a life. I do realize that it is only myself who can save me, that it is in my hands to turn my life around, that I am the only one responsible for my own happiness. I know things can change, theoretically, but I know myself, and I know that I am too weak to try and face the consequences of my own actions in an attempt to fix this. To rebuild the last bridge I burned. I'm not sure I want to.\n\nI don't know what I want. The idea of living is dreadful. The idea of death, although once so comforting, is terrifying. I want nothing, but I don't want to die.\n\nI have tried to kill myself before, when I was a teenager. Multiple times. Never before have I experienced this crippling horror at the idea of dying, not even when I thought I succeeded. The thought now makes me nauseous with fear, and I don't know what to do, because I have to die.\n\nThank you for reading. I'm sorry if this post doesn't fit the subreddit, or if I don't make much sense, and I'm sorry if I sound pretentious. I'm really not trying to be. I'm not sure what I'm trying to go for with this post, in all honesty, or what I'm looking for. I'm just lost, and I don't understand why I'm suddenly so afraid of something I ruined my life for.

    "content": "Recently I fell out with a friend of mine who I've known for a little over a year. It's most likely my fault given that I: A) have talked to them about it already, B) Am somewhat aware that I probably sucked at some point in time (that I don't entirely remember) .\n\nIt started around 3-4 months ago when all my friends made plans to hangout together out of town, a few don't show up because of curfew, although they didnt make any real attempt to meet with any of us or let us know where they were until leaving to go home.\n\nThey argued they told us about curfew beforehand, we mentioned how we deliberately shifted the schedule up by a few hours to accommodate that, they then said we didn't even agree on a meeting place (we did), they apologize and swear it won't happen again.\n\nAfter this, I was upset for quite a while with one of them (whom I was closer to) and gave them the cold shoulder for a while. We don't talk for ages since I don't speak much with others in lessons and they kept wandering off with my other friend. Meanwhile another one of my friends who organised the hangout trip is slowly losing patience with friend A and B because they keep ditching her when leaving to buy lunch which also kinda ticks me off because Its getting hard not to see a pattern forming\n\nDistance grows, I dont do much about it since I attributed it to something else entirely and wanted to give them space (this is around 2 months back). We still don't talk properly. They ghost me starting from around a month ago and don't talk to me in person or respond to my texts.\n\nEventually I ask to meet up and talk about it and they agree. When asking them, they say the reason why is that I don't really talk to them, kept moving away whenever they sat near, compared their skills to another person's even though they're the same grade, made snide comments, people who're friends with me aren't nice to them etc.\n\nI don't remember a ton of this and while some of it is probably coincidence (moving away from them), there's a solid chance that some of it IS stuff I've done. I can be pretty horrible sometimes, especially when I'm not doing so well mentally and I'm so angry with myself that I crashed a friendship with someone I cared about over crap communication and my own assholery. I wish I could say that I atleast know where I went wrong, but I can't since I don't remember the whole bloody thing happening. Another of my friends has distanced themselves from my current group to join another group with this person and I can't tell whether they actually want to remain friends with me, or if it's just because they can't bring themselves to stop talking with me entirely. There's also the chance that their negative impression of me is creating a negative impression of everyone associated with me AND that I'm 90% sure their new friends keep talking shit about me since they all go quiet whenever I get too close (although there could be any random thing they're talking about). To top this all off, I'm not even sure if my own friends enjoy my presence and I feel myself drifting from them (although this part is probably in my head and a reflection of current circumstances)\n\nTLDR: I hate myself, my friend hates me, their new friends hate me, I can't tell if another friend hates me and my current friends might hate me. It's been a long week. I'm sick. And tired.",

The symptoms flared towards the end of 2019 when I moved in with my sister while in university.\n\nI don't want to get into so many details but I have had thoughts of su**ide since high school and they came strong during that period.

She looked at me like I mattered, and for the first time in a long time, I felt seen. We worked in the same company but had never noticed each other before that night.\n\nFrom that moment on, my life revolved around her. We weren’t officially together, but we acted like we were. She’d come over almost every night, we’d talk for hours, fall asleep in each other’s arms. It felt real. It felt worth fighting for.\n\nBut she kept saying she wasn’t ready for a relationship.\n\nI told myself to be patient, to wait until she healed from her past. But months passed, and nothing changed. Every time I tried to define what we were, she pulled away. And yet, she always came back.\n\nShe had a drinking problem. I picked her up from bars when she was too wasted to get home. I held her hair back when she was sick, tucked her into bed, made sure she was okay. I cleaned up the messes she made—literally and figuratively.\n\nAnd still, I wasn’t enough.\n\nShe had a kid, and I got along with her so well. I ignored the fact that she still lived with her ex-husband in the same apartment.\n\nOne night, after yet another drunken call, she told me she had kissed another guy. A few months later, she admitted she had slept with her ex.\n\nAnd yet, I stayed. Not because I had no self-respect, but because I loved her. Because I convinced myself that maybe love was enough.\n\nBut it wasn’t.\n\nI convinced myself we weren’t dating. I guess she convinced me too.\n\nThe night she finally agreed to date me, it wasn’t out of love—it was out of guilt. Because I cried in front of her. Because I was breaking. Because she saw what she was doing to me.\n\nIt wasn’t the kind of love I wanted. It wasn’t real.\n\nAnd yet, I held on for months, hoping things would change.\n\nThey didn’t.\n\nI should have left the first time she hurt me. I should have walked away when she made it clear I was just convenient.\n\nBut I didn’t.\n\nAnd it cost me more than I ever imagined.\n\nI don’t know why I’m writing this. Maybe just to get it out of my system. Maybe because, deep down, I still love her.\n\nOr maybe I just need someone to tell me that it wasn’t my fault.",

I’m needed at work I’m great at what I do but that is. I thing on the feeling of truly being wanted, laying upon eyes of someone who sees you for who you really are. I want someone to share little secrets with, to spend time with and devote myself to.\n\nI want to leave work one day knowing that I’m not just coming to an empty house. It’s so selfish to think I’m entitled this but why not me? Is my personality screwed, it’s my looks, my mannerisms? I get along fine with everyone I’m really social at work and even outside of work barring my current situation but that for another reason.\n\nDo I just reek desperation? Am I unlovable? The answer is no I was loved once maybe even two more times but those relationships could not hold it bring questions to my head once more.\n\nI’m going work my ass off it’s just what I do. I’ll spend my life helping others and caring for the vulnerable, being the person I wish I had in my life when I struggled. But at the end of the day I just don’t know what I’m doing this for? The further my career goes forward I am scared that I’ll become the guy who says I’m married to work when I damn well know I want a family.\n\nEitherway I wish something changes soon. I don’t want to be alone forever.",

I think that my mental health has been plummeting really bad and I just don’t know who I can talk to anymore.\n\nIt started when I have been having chest pain for the last two months or so then about three weeks ago I was hospitalised due to that chest pain. The diagnosis given was due to GERD and I have really severe case of GERD. Hospitals in general has always been very depressing for me and while I was stuck there, it definitely feels lonely.\n\nMy loneliness amplifies when the people I am surrounded with doesn’t acknowledge me as much anymore. I am in college and I have a group of friends including me there’s 5 of us. While I was not with them, the 4 of them did stuff together and went on to have sleepovers. I think what hit the most was that none of them says they wished I was there. It was simply a thing they did between them and then it was never brought up again.\n\nIt becomes more evident how used they are already without having me around. They made plans without including me. Even though, I was there. It would be nice just to get an invitation. I assumed they didn’t ask because I might not be able to make it due to transportation issues.\n\nI wish I was a little more seen.\n\nI’m sorry if this is all over the place, I just need to let it out somewhere.",

I felt we had a positive and productive conversation, but it all started because she got mad that I washed the rice for a certain dish.\n\nShe's also recently got upset with me over a project she asked me to tackle, just assembling a lamp we bought at the store. I made the mistake of trying to screw in a screw that had a defect and got stuck. She wasn't screaming or anything, but she was upset that I tried to use it anyway. I got it out and replaced it and the lamp turned out well.\n\nShe has childhood trauma to do with strict parents who would severely punish her if she didn't do things the exact way they wanted and so I think she gets stressed when something isn't going to plan.\n\nI feel like an idiot when these sort of things happen. They're such simple mistakes, easily avoided and yet I make them.\n\nShe's also been stressed with her kitten that still needs to get spayed, she's been in heat alot and she yells at the cat when she won't be quiet. I think this isn't right and have tried gently mentioning that her cat is just doing what cats do and she needs to try and ignore her.\n\nI made a larger mistake the other day when I asked to try her THC vape. She said that beginners should always be in a safe place and try to relax. I asked in jest \"do I feel safe here?\" And she asked the same. I thought about it a bit and promptly got distracted by other thoughts. I have ADHD and sometimes this sort of thing happens. I'm still ashamed of it because when I realized I trailed off and said \"I do feel safe here\" She made a a comment stating \"That took a long time for you to figure out\" I didn't respond, I knew I got distracted and I started silently panicking thinking, \"I do feel safe here but nothing I say now will convince her. I wouldn't have tried the THC if I didn't, I wouldn't leave my knife at home if I didn't, I wouldn't be with her if I didn't\" but I gave some lame excuse about thinking too deeply about it and tried to laugh it off.\n\nI feel like an idiot. She makes me happy. She's important to me. I'm worried that her trauma will drive us apart. I don't know what to do to work through this.",

    "content": "I graduated last year and am now atending a university. The diffrence is astonishing. I realized that the behavior I had to endure was way more off the charts than I thought.I am transgender (ftm) and autistic. In my old class was another autistic kid whose autism presented diffrently from mine. Funny enough I was always excluded and people didnt like me for being weird and missing out on social clues. But when I got diagnosed and received accommodations that was me getting favors and faking autism for attention. I know of some rumors that were spread about me but I have no clue how or who started those. Apperently I was a lesbian (never was) and some were convinced that I would get mad and loud when I get missgenderd. I dont know why anyone believed that since I did get missgendered quite often and literally only corrected the people with a hey sorry it is actually him or sth.One kid in particular seemed to have it out for and said some homphobic stuff though he only did it when I wasnt present (others snithed) or he thought I wouldnt hear him. He actually once ran up to me while carrying a knife. A joke. surrrreeee My class loved jokes. They would act as if they were jerking off in the back of the room or say something rather loudly etc when I held presentations. I always went to the teachers and asked for help. No one ever helped me. Some wanted to but had to catch them in the act which wasnt that easy and the other teachers didnt seem to care enough. Though every adult always reassured me that I would be fine and nothing would happen to me.I wasnt the easiest kid to be around since I literally learned how to be nice in 10th grade and sucked a great deal before and during that learning. But I was always willing to reflect and talk about my misstakes.\n\nI am now in a much better place. Everyone respects me and I feel comfortable learning again. Though I am starting to feel angry that this extreme behaviuor was ever permitted and given space at that school. I love some of my teachers they were the kindest people I ever met and helped me greatly. Others not so much. Bullying really sucks and I needed to get this off my chest",

    "content": "I still wish he would come back, don't get me wrong... That hasn't disappeared just yet and I suspect it won't for a little bit.\n\nI started doing dance classes again and my first couple of classes were hard. I hadn't danced in awhile, and the emotions were still heavy. In fact, I went home and bawled in my roommates arms because I was just hit with memories of my favorite routine of chatting with you after class, and looking forward to being with you online when I got home. But the drive was hard, and not quiet since I had a comfort song blasting and me just yelling into the car how much I loved you and what an idiot you are to walk away.\n\nI had another class just yesterday and I felt incredibly good doing it since it was a familiar choreo. I smiled. I was proud of myself. I laughed with my friends. And when I got out, I felt angry...\n\nI was angry because I disliked how you made me feel hurt, unseen, invalidated,  and frightened during our breakup. Angry that you decided to give up. I'm not going to try to convince you to stay, so okay, I'll go. Especially since you'd do that explosive reaction again with the justification being you had no choice to in order to be heard. Ya know, my counselor said that's what people who do the abuse in abusive relationships say. \"If only she didn't do [trigger], then I wouldn't of [hit/screamed/throw/etc.] her.\" I know you're not abusive though. I know you're flawed and that response is something you can work on if you recognize it to be. I wanted to do that with you. I wanted to work me. On us. But no, you gave up and walked away.\n\nAnd although I know we had good times, I now notice a lot more things in our relationship that weren't that great. Things I wish a partner would do for me. The slow roll into complacency. How I feel fooled being charmed by you. That I tell you how I feel when I'm in some mood is not your responsibility to fix, and to please let me figure out how to make myself feel better and I'll tell you. But no, you make yourself take responsibility anyways and feel bad about yourself and frustrated at me when you can't \"solve it\" right away. What the hell?! Don't you listen?! And I tell you my love language is words of affirmation and I barely hear any compliments from you. I don't remember the last time you called me beautiful or cute. I don't ever remember you telling me you appreciate me unless I ASK or do it first by giving you all my words of praise. If you're proud of me or happy I'm yours. I said those things to you all the time! The random \"I Love You\"'s because I feel it in that moment. Things I brought up I'd like to do but it gets overlooked and forgotten, and then you get mad at me when I try to remind you, and more angry when I'm sad you don't remember. And how I see you were also not telling me things that made you irritated and let build up, but fault me for being the only one who does it.\n\nI also told you I'm scared you'd talk to me like you talk to your parents. You gave me that \"wtf\" face like you'd never. And yet there you were screaming at me, assaulting me with words trying to blame me and all your \"what about you?!\" arguments. Also how we agreed to disagree early on in a convo before our fight that giving someone the same energy they give you is a choice and can be potentially hazardous in a relationship. Especially during an argument. Communication is important, but what's the point when you assume your partner is intentionally attacking you when it's anything but?! I should've known better. I should've known when I saw those signs.\n\nYou're so frustrating. How did I deal with all that?! And you know what's more frustrating?! IT'S ALL SOLVABLE. They were things we could work on. Things we could put out onto the table, talk about our grievances, and set out a plan to address them. I think at one time I said maybe we should see a Couple's counselor to better understand  each other, but that was swept aside.\n\nI know I can be frustrating too. I know it do things that make you mad. But no one deserves to be treated the way you treat me during arguments. You once brought out something in me that made me hate myself in an argument. All because it was so heightened and just not healthy because I was trying to match your energy. I hated it. I dont like being so angry I'd say things I regret and would hate myself for later, along with the fact I'm sure it hurts you! Why would you want that dynamic?! Why are you okay with that?! It's unhealthy! How did it feel when I said I felt hurt, attacked, and frustrated like you but didn't want to scream or escalate things so I cried instead?! You probably thought I was pathetic...\n\nAnd so fine... Go find someone else who can match your energy without feeling shitty about themselves and about hurting you. Find someone who argues the same way you do and see how disrespectful, exhausting, and hurtful it is. Because that's not what I want.",

    "content": "I have to get this out. My family makes the BLANDEST food to EVER exist.\n\nI moved out years ago for college, and only now have I come back for a visit.\n\nBear in mind, I'm a very culinary guy, I love making various different foods, all different textures, tastes, consistencies and all. Be it Italian, french, central European, Slavic, Arabic, mexican, Indian, all sides of Asian cuisine. I love exploring different tastes and savor every bite.\n\nHowever, when I visited my parents I remembered WHY I became so interested in culinary arts. It's because my parents make food comparable to eating a stack of A4 paper. It's not even bad, it's just... Bland, so bland that eating a meal that would take me ten minutes takes up to an hour.\n\nI swear, any dish they make is outperformed, and I do not exaggarate here, by a fucking piece of bread with some salt and pepper sprinkled over it. I wish I was joking.\n\nWhich is fucking abysmal because the food actually looks good! It looks like it something that you'd want seconds for but when you actually bite into it, you wish to be put away for ten years in jail just so you don't have to eat it again.\n\nThe taste of my family households cooking is what I imagine slop to taste like. You know those cartoons where the lunch lady always gave this grey slop in the cafeteria? I'm pretty sure my parents eat that on the daily, just with a different look each day.\n\nIt's amazing, no matter what they make, be it soup, sandwiches, schnitzel, literally any fucking thing they make is just akin to the taste of a rock.\n\nI just finished dinner and wish I didn't. Thankfully I have money of my own so I can just say that I'm not hungry and then go out on the town later. But still, I am amazed how they eat that... Stuff. I can't even call it shit cause at least shit tastes awful.\n\nIf their food was a person it would be this puny, dresses always like he's going to work, overly friendly and unopinionated guy at the party that talks to you when you contemplate jumping out of the building just so you can avoid his dribble about the fucking idk, how much he likes MHA.\n\nYou'd probably love my parents cooking if you enjoy the taste of water.\n\nTheir food reminds me of the food bodybuilders eat, you know? Cooked chicken and rice, with no spices, sauce or additions, only that chicken and rice. My parents make food with all manners of ingredients yet they still taste like... Fucking chicken and rice.\n\nIt's amazing I was able to eat that stuff for 18 years without consuming bleach, which, ironically, would have more taste than their cooking and give me my will to live back.\n\nOk, I'm better now, see ya.",

And English isn't my first language - I hope it's not too bad.\n\nSo recently, my parents passed away, both my mom and dad. it's still kinda hard to believe that they are really gone. I'm 17 years old, so it's been a bit rough for me.\n\nMy parent's relationship had never been good. My dad was a serial cheater, I don't know the full details but I know he had a bunch of mistresses and constantly slept with other younger women, he might even have other children... My mom always knew this apparently, but never left because she was only a high-school graduate with no prospects for a job to provide for us.\n\nI had told her to leave, but I knew it was fruitless.\n\nRecently, they'd been fighting so much, to the point where it was unbearable. In the entirety last year and even this year there was constant arguments in my home. They would have screaming matches and fights, I would always hear banging and yelling, I could barely sleep at night because of their fights. They've broken so much stuff in the house, doors, the TV, I've stepped on glass shattered glass before after a bad fight.\n\nThere was not much I could do but to just endure it and try to focus on my studies, i couldn't intervene, and i was forbidden from telling anyone. We also had a bunch of financial problems. I'm at a point in my life where I need to focus heavily on my education and make sure to get good grades, but the stress of it all was making it impossible. My mom would constantly pressure me to get good grades and I really tried to get good grades but I just can't, i really tried my best.\n\nI was mentally and physically exhausted. I was under alot of stress because of all of this, I literally just wanted to die so i didn't have to deal with it anymore. it felt like my own home wasn't home anymore and that I couldn't find peace anywhere. They would try to rope me into their fights and it just stressed me out more, I really couldn't do a thing about it. My physical health was depleting rapidly, I was gaining weight, I was always sick, always tired, I wasn't getting enough sleep.\n\nAlso my brother lives abroad, he has a job and a house and everything, and my mum for some reason doesn't wanna tell him ALL the details (he knew some stuff, but not to the extent that I did) so I was all alone in this.\n\nAnyway, almost 2 months ago I remember my parents had a huge fight, they broke the TV again, and it literally lasted all night, I couldn't sleep AT ALL. After that my dad went to work in the morning and didn't come home till like 12am. that same night my mom had come to my room and talked to me and told me that she knows how much I suffer, and she told me to study hard so that I can get out of here, and she gave me a hug, she hasn't hugged me or touched me since idk so I was just sorta stiff and didn't say anything.\n\nIn the morning I had school, so I went, I was really tired and slept through my entire econ class... at some point, during another class, the supervisor called me to her office, and when I went there, my homeroom teacher, the principal, and my aunt (my dad's sister) were there.. I knew what happened immediately.\n\nMy parents had gotten into a car accident and died in the hospital during surgery. The police think it was a suicide, but I don't really wanna know.\n\nSince I'm a minor, and still in school (I still have a year left, I'll be in 12th grade soon), my dad's sister took me in but his other siblings also visit me often, I don't have any contact with my mum's side. Living with my aunt and uncle has been okay, though I don't feel much at home. After I'm done with school and my A-levels (no i am not from the UK), I'll be moving to the US, where my brother lives. I already have a visa and scholarship.\n\nI recently went to a psychiatrist where I was told that I have severe depression and anxiety and BPD.\n\nI didn't see their dead bodies because I didn't have the courage, and I couldn't cry at the funeral, because I felt so... numb? after all that happened, I didn't know how to feel at all. I cried after I came home, all of it felt like overwhelming. I feel like a horrible person for not grieving enough, but idk what else to feel, I don't want to tell my brother yet.\n\nI've just been trying to study for my final exams soon, it's this year and I need to finish revising. I try to play games too, but I don't really have much energy. My friends from school have been very supportive and kind.\n\nAnyway, that's all I guess, I know it's really long, but I just wanted to ramble, because other than my really close online friend, I haven't told anyone.",

    "content": "So I realize I sound like an asshole. I grew up in pretty bad poverty. My mom had a really hard time holding a job and when she was able to, had a spending problem. As a result, I’ve been working full time since I was 15. I worked multiple jobs at a time to get around labor laws so that I could make and save money. By the time I graduated high school I had enough money to buy a car in cash and pay for a majority of my college expenses (cash flowed first 3 years) with absolutely no help. I continued to work through college and eventually ended up in a high paying job. From the age of 17 to now I’ve worked around 50-60 hours a week in addition to going to school. I had no free time. I missed out on a majority of being young- I never got to go to parties, I hardly ever hung out with friends which caused me to lose a majority of them, and I was always exhausted while I should have been young and lively. Regardless, I went through the grind and came out on top. I now don’t typically have to worry about money. I’m in a relationship with a fantastic man that I plan to marry and start a family with. Everything seems to have worked out.\n\nMy mom has always had a very hard time working. She has problems with all of her co workers everywhere she goes & she seems to struggle with taking direction. As a result, she tends to leave jobs quickly, usually without another job offer. She decided when I was around 19 to stop working to care for my elderly grandmother. While I understood this decision, there were still times she could have held a part-time job at least and chose not to. My grandmother was in an adult daycare program for about 20-30 hours a week, which could have been spent working. Instead my mom chose to go out and spend what little money she had gotten from various loans and wherever else she was getting money from. She also complained constantly about having to take care of my grandmother.\n\nMy grandmother passed away a year ago and my mom was left with no choice but to go back to work, and again the cycle starts over. Everyday I hear constant complaining about how much she hates her job and everyone she works with. She makes very little effort to find other work and writes off entire industries for silly reasons (I won’t work in food service because I won’t wear a hair net. I won’t work in retail because I don’t have any experience. Etc.) She is also not saving any money, not towards retirement, not towards an emergency reserve, nothing. She claims she doesn’t have any money left after bills to save, but she frivolously spends. Every space in the house is occupied with something. She purchased a freezer full of steaks that have been sitting uncooked for months. She pays someone to wash her hair every few days because she “doesn’t feel like doing it herself”. She has so many things she doesn’t need and every time I visit her there is more yet bills are being paid in increments because she “can’t afford to pay the full bill”. I even cover some expenses by putting her on my plans and yet she still cannot manage very basic expenses. Meanwhile I work, I live very well below my means and my partner and I save a lot of money, both for retirement and for our future together. I know my mother is planning on being able to live off of me and I won’t allow it. I don’t know what she is going to do and I know it sounds cold of me, but I worked too hard to hand over everything to someone who has never tried to better themselves or their life. I’m done.\n\nEdit just because I’m frustrated: I came to visit her today and discovered receipts for various retailers for the past couple of weeks strewn about totaling over $700. She just complained to me about not being able to pay property taxes to stay in her home. It’s just so bad and I needed to vent more, I apologize.",

    "content": "Hello everyone I (20m) miss my (19f) exgf so much. When we first met eachother 2 years ago everything was perfect. We were in love and having good times no matter what. We were long distance (about an hour and 30 minutes from each other) and we hated it, but it never mattered. The more days that went by the more in love we were.\n\nAt the time I was struggling with really bad paranoia and I quit my job and ran away to go live with her. I left my family and most importantly my grandmother behind. I wanted to show her everything I wanted was with her and her only, but I think that was one of the worst decisions we made during our relationship. We were only together for 2-3 months at the time and I stayed with her brother while she lived with her mom and step dad.\n\nWe started spending every second together and it was just getting even better, but we started getting aggravated with eachother more. I eventually got a job 1-2 months after moving in with her brother. Then things started to pick up again, probably because of the motivation of going to work and getting money to spend on her. She never cared about the money. I did, it’s the only way I knew how to prove my love.\n\nHer mom and step dad were both alcoholics and abused eachother quite often and they really weren’t a fan of me for some reason. They got in a fight one night and started treating my ex wrong so I stepped in and pulled her out of that situation before she got hurt and I took her to taco bell at 3am.\n\nAfter that we started fighting a whole lot more because money was getting tight and it was the only thing that made me feel stable. I wasn’t comfortable living with her brother at all and was starting to wish I never moved in. We started getting more and more distant until the day she got me a cat. A beautiful baby and I named her Honey. She was the sweetest thing ever and it brought me and my ex closer than ever.\n\nThen I got kicked out of her brothers for unknown reasons. I just had to be out by the weekend, so I called up my family for some help and me and my ex moved into a camper with some of my distant relatives. We were still arguing and growing more distant but we worked out some of the problems but it just wasn’t enough. We ended up moving back in with our families separately and only seeing eachother on the weekends, but going from living with eachother for over a year and then all of a sudden splitting apart again brought some issues. My trust issues got very very bad and I started with my outbursts and starting arguments for no reason. We both did and we would blame eachother for everything.\n\nI broke up with her and got back with her multiple times. I started running from our problems and coming back expecting it to be the way it was when we first got together, but it never turned out that way. I started focusing on myself and what I could do to be better for her. I tried so many things and so many ways but I could never find a way that worked and made us both happy. I wanted it to work out so much but she got fed up with me and blocked me on everything. I broke her heart so many times and lied to her because I didn’t wanna admit I was wrong. I miss her so god damn much and wish I could go back in time to fix things. I want to hold her one more time. I want to give her all the affection she deserves. I wish I payed a little bit more attention to her and put myself to the side for once.\n\nMy only regret so far in life I wish I treated you a little bit better Peyton. If by any chance you find this and read it, just know I’m still trying my best and not giving up just for the chance I get to love you like I should have. Honey was the best thing we ever had and you’re the only other person that I share those memories with. You have her kitten and I miss getting to see her. You’re my fucking soulmate Peyton and I will never love anyone else like I love you. If my life ends with you not by my side then it was all a waste. My life will have no meaning.",

    "content": "For context, my mom hates my dad (65M) with an extreme, almost irrational amount of resentment. I was never allowed to see him after their divorce, and my mom has always been abusive toward me—accusing me of trying to \"steal\" my dad from her even when I was a child. Meanwhile, she worships my brother and treats him like a king, which is common in our culture.\n\nGrowing up, my brother bullied me, but as adults, he seems to have changed—or so I thought. He encouraged me to reconnect with my dad, even telling me to sneak out to visit him, knowing full well that my mom would explode if she found out. Recently, my brother has been spending a lot of time at my dad’s restaurant (let’s call it Bo’s) because he gets free food there, and he kept inviting me to come. I resisted at first but eventually gave in because I needed a break from home, and I could actually study and eat there.\n\nBut here’s the problem: every time I go, my brother immediately tells my mom. He asks me to go, waits until I do, and then betrays me. The first time, he blurted it out in front of a cousin, and my mom lost it on me. I blocked him for a week but had to eventually forgive him since we still live together. I thought maybe it was a mistake.\n\nThen it happened again. This time, he acted super nice to me all weekend, made me breakfast, and even walked me to my car before we were supposed to meet at Bo’s. But then, at the last second, he bailed on me, saying he’d study at home—something he never does. I went to Bo’s alone, and four hours later, he called me. As soon as I picked up, my mom’s voice came through his phone, asking, “Where are you?” Before I could even lie, he said, “She’s at Bo’s.”\n\nI don’t understand why he keeps doing this. He used to hate my mom and call her crazy, but suddenly, he’s been defending her, saying she’s just \"mentally ill\" and that we should \"pray for her.\" It’s a complete 180 from how he talked about her just weeks ago.\n\nI’ve given him the benefit of the doubt because he struggles with school and responsibilities, and I suspect he may have a learning disability. But at this point, I’m not sure if he’s just naïve or if he’s actively setting me up.\n\nWhat do you think? Am I overreacting, or is this deliberate?",

    "content": "My family was always dysfunctional. That’s putting it nicely. My mom was an alcoholic/addict who put her partners over her kids. My dad was an addict, often in and out of jail. My siblings were absolutely cruel. With my luck, I was the black sheep that had never fit in.\n\nAnd extended family was no better. My mom’s side just ignored we existed, as they were embarrassed by my mom. My dad’s side contained addicts who were often in trouble with the police. My last name was literally known as the drug name 😭\n\nMy mom gave up her rights when I was almost 18 and the family I was stuck with treated me horribly. However, they favored my sister. (They put me in a room with no ventilation in the garage, I wasn’t allowed in the house, I wasn’t allowed to talk to people at school, they admitted they had a group chat to talk badly about me, etc.)\n\nThis is all a super summarized version, as I don’t want to drone on.\n\nAs soon as I got to college, I was quick to cut everyone off and restart on my life. I found an amazing therapist to process everything I’ve been through, I have people that support me, and I got a super cool cat. Yet, as the title says, I find myself sometimes wondering if my family thinks about me.\n\nThe only time they had seen me in the past five years was my grandparents’ funerals. Even then, I stayed for an hour. All they had to say then was, “How’s that fancy college?” As I’m the only one who went to college.\n\nI feel like I do super well on my own. I’m complimented about how much I’ve pushed through things. But sometimes I wonder if my sister ever thinks about how I’m doing, the same way I think about her. I wonder if my dad talks about me being in art school, or if he is too busy with whatever he’s up to.\n\nEven though I know cutting them off was the best for my health, I still find myself feeling lonely without all of them. I don’t miss who they are, but I miss the spots they held. They were still my family.\n\nSorry if this was all over the place, it’s just a big ramble",

    "title": "I'm Leaving for College Soon... But It's breaking me apart...",
    "content": "This also gon be long (i cant help it, i am literally crying as i typed this)...\n\nTLDR: I’m leaving for college soon, and while I’m excited, I’m struggling with the thought of leaving my mom behind. We’ve always been close since my dad works overseas, but lately, I’ve been unintentionally pulling away, getting irritable, and saying things I regret. I thought distancing myself would make leaving easier, but it only hurts more. Seeing how much my mom will miss me—made me realize I don’t want to leave things on a sour note. I keep having vivid dreams about my departure, and the guilt of how I’ve treated her is overwhelming. I want to fix things before I go, but I don’t know how.\n\nI’m moving away for college in a few months, and as excited as I am for this new chapter, I can’t stop thinking about how much I’m going to miss my mom. She’s been my biggest source of comfort my whole life, and since my dad works overseas, we’ve always had a strong bond. But now that I’m getting closer to leaving, I feel this huge mix of emotions that I don’t know how to deal with.\n\nLately, I’ve noticed myself pulling away a little—not intentionally, but I think it’s my way of trying to make leaving easier. Instead, it’s just making me feel worse. I’ve been more irritable, and I hate that I’ve raised my voice at times when I never used to, I always used to listen to her life stories even if I had heard them countless times, her rants too, whenever she shouted for reasons I wasn't even wrong... But now I am talking back to her, get angry on her and say awful things, when she tells her stories I say they are boring and please shut up, I don't know why I am doing this... I still want to listen to her rants and yapping but I am not able to, I am going into that angry zone and I have done many mistakes. I haven’t even apologized properly, and that weighs on me. It’s like I’m watching myself act this way but can’t stop.\n\nI know this is all part of growing up, but the thought of leaving her behind, even temporarily, is really hard. I don’t have many close friends, so my mom has always been the one I could talk to. But over time, I started keeping things to myself, thinking I shouldn’t burden her with my problems. I used to be able to just rest my head in her lap and cry when things got hard—when I got bullied, when I felt alone—but I haven’t done that in years. It makes me sad because I feel like I’ve lost that connection a bit, and I don’t want to leave things this way And now, when I probably need it the most, I feel like I can’t show her the weak side of me that I have long pretended to have erased.\n\nThe other day, something happened that really got to me. My mom was taking a nap, and before sleeping, she had asked me to grab some groceries. While she was resting, my little sister was joking around and said, \"He left for college,\" and my mom suddenly started crying in sleep. She thought I had already gone. I was still at home, but seeing that broke me. I rushed to get the groceries, but I was tearing up the whole time. It made me realize just how hard this is going to be—for both of us, and precisely the reason I was trying to distance myself from her that she doesn't grieve much but no, now I feel that she will cry more that I left and our relation were sour and not mended, I genuinely want to say sorry right now but I am stuck and I am going crazy.\n\nAt night, I keep having vivid dreams about the day I leave, and they feel so real (I do have genetic hyperphantasia (from my mom that too)) that I wake up feeling broken. Every time, it’s like I’m reliving the moment before it even happens (I know mom must be having those dreams too). It makes me feel so helpless because no matter what I do, that day is still coming. I was going to leave this January, but postponed it to August, because in January we were close to ripping each other off, that level of arguments... But now things are settling down, but still it isn't back to what it was last year...\n\nI know I have to go, and I know my mom wants the best for me. She always encourages me, and I’m so grateful for everything she’s done—raising me, taking care of me, making sure I don't feel alone (I do feel, but I pretend I don't to not hurt her, I do have suicidal thoughts sometimes, but I hold back that it will all fall into place soon, however indefinite the \"soon\" is). I just want to spend these last few months showing her how much she means to me and making good memories before I leave. I just want to do the right thing, but I feel so lost. I thought distancing myself would help, but it only hurts more... Idk how to leave without hurting my mom... How do I say goodbye without breaking her heart... All of these are constantly revolving in my mind and I'm going crazy... I still have a few months but I don't know how I'll manage... I want to mend things... But I am thrown into my guilt...\n\nFor those who’ve gone through something similar, how did you make the transition easier? How did you make sure your mom knew how much you appreciated her before you left? I don’t want to take this time for granted, and I’d love to hear any advice on how to make these last few months meaningful for both of us. I know now that pushing my mom away won’t make leaving any easier—if anything, it’ll only make it worse. I tried to make her love me less so she wouldn't hurt when I leave, but all I did was create more pain for both of us. I don’t want her to remember our last months together with regret. I just want to fix things before it’s too late\n\nAnd lastly, Just to clarify, this is about my bond with my mom as a parent, nothing else. We’re Asian—if I ever even thought otherwise, she’d personally set me straight with a slipper and more ultimate weapons. My dad works overseas but is always present, calling daily morning and night and supporting her even more than I do, listening to her rants and all. I love my mom because she’s always been there for me, and I’ve supported her in return. She doesn’t rely on me for happiness—I rely on her. I know I have to leave one day, but I just want to make things right before I go.",

Last summer, I (18) went to visit my boyfriend (21), who lived over 400 miles away. I was given an ultimatum: if I didn't go see him, he would dump me. So, the naive me, hopelessly in love, agreed to take two weeks off my well-paying job to meet him.\n\nAfter a 14-hour train ride, I was enveloped in his embrace, and I felt so happy, thinking, \"This is it; he’s the one.\" I was exhausted from the long day and immediately fell asleep in his bed. However, I woke up to a strange feeling and found myself unable to breathe. He was having sex with me and choking me. When I opened my eyes in shock, all he said was, “You like that? you fucking slut.” I felt so stupid and used, I couldn’t look at him the same way again.\n\nI stayed there for the rest of the two weeks, but all we did was argue. I wanted love and to spend time with him, while he just wanted to play games, use me, and sleep.

He called me a whore, saying I shouldn’t dress the way I did in public and that it was my own fault. Then he dumped me. I had a mental breakdown of sorts lost my job, self harmed almost daily never allowing my skin to be clean and overdosed twice. The worst part is no one believed me accusing me of being an attention seeker and dramatic and those who did believe me played it off as no big deal. Although it has been five months, I still feel unloved. I have always craved affection, and I genuinely do not believe anyone could ever love me for who I am without wanting to use me although i hope one day im proven to be wrong :)",

    "content": "tldr: My mom's friend helped me through a tough time and get into college. We got really close and we've been hooking up since. No one knows.\n\nShe worked with my mom. They grew close over the years and became even closer the summer before I left for college because my parents were going through a nasty divorce. She threw me a birthday party when my parents were too busy fighting in court to remember. She made a big effort to be there for my mom and by proxy she was also there for me. We grew close because she would bring over dinner (and eat with me), drive me places, pick me up and bring me home, and even helped me with school. My mom picked up another job to help pay for the divorce lawyer so she was gone a lot. She helped me prepare for my college interviews, wrote me references, and connected me with people she knew. Most nights she'd feed me dinner, clean up, and make sure I was home instead of out partying, then lock up our house and sometimes sleep there on the couch or my moms bed until my mom got home.\n\nI always was attracted to her since she was younger than my mom, but still had that fit work out milf type of look. I would check her out often and even use her as the focal point of my masturbation. It got to the point where I snuck into her laundry basket a few times to check out her used lingerie.\n\nWe grew closer and talked about sex. It started from her giving me advice on navigating the dating world and a \"girls\" perspective. I felt comfortable with her helping me figure out these social situations since she is young and attractive, I just figured she understood. I complained about girls, friends, anxiety. She was a great listener and I would love receiving comforting hugs from. her. I would always get aroused from talking with her about things. One night when we hugged she felt my hard arousal accidentally press up against her, but nothing happened.\n\nMy fantasy was just that, a fantasy until I went to college. My parents were still dragging the divorce out so she graciously helped me shop, pack, and even dropped me off. It was only 45 mins away from home, I wanted to go further away, but I'm just lucky to even get into college with all the stress. Her texts were often and short, so it wasn't unusual for us to be casual with each other. One night I got really drunk and texted her pretty late thinking she wouldn't get it until later in the morning. I mentioned how I thought about her during random hook ups or masturbation. Well to my surprise she replied and we engaged in a little back and forth. This happened a few times over the course of my first semester and I did try to push the flirting boundaries when we talked about intimate things. It usually started with reminders for me to practice safe sex and then lead to talking about sex in general. I could tell she was really careful about being intimate with me. A few times it slipped into flirty territory.\n\nThere was a blizzard as everyone was leaving for winter break. I could have taken the train, but I texted her that I didn't have a ride home because I wanted to spend time with her. It was late and the storm was pretty bad by the time she dropped me off. She insisted that she'd come in and make me dinner. At some point a bottle of wine was consumed. She mentioned that my mom was working until 10pm that night so she stayed up with me to watch a movie. We ended up talking about all the things that happened that semester and I admitted to her her my lack of confidence with girls. I joked that if only I could get some practice in real life instead of watching porn I could find the clit.\n\nWell one thing led to another and we spent a lot of break together. Since coming back to school, she's been driving here and getting a hotel for us once a week. I'm afraid that I won't like girls my age anymore after this and that she's making it so fun and easy that I'm not making an effort to meet girls my age. Not really sure what to do, but needed to get this off my chest. It's just nice having someone to have sex with so easily instead of putting in effort to flirt, play games, go out drinking and risking being with a random girl.",

    "content": "Last Monday I watched my grandma from my dad’s side pass away early in the morning. Now yesterday my grandma from my mom’s side landed in the hospital due to passing cysts and having a mass in her bladder.\n\nShe keeps passing a lot of blood, and her option is basically surgery but since she is too weak for anesthesia, she has to have a blood transfusion. She is a JW (Jehovah Witness) and their big thing is they can accept any medical procedure or help besides blood transfusions.\n\nWe are in a small town and we have limited alternatives. My grandma gave partial power of attorney to a couple people in her congregation, including her brother which he is also part of that but more level headed. We have a random guy from the Kingdom Hall that keeps coming to “check on her” but in reality he is making sure she doesn’t accept the transfusion. My mom and aunt are tired of him.\n\nI talked to my grandma yesterday before leaving her and basically reassuring her even though she is 84 she still has an outstanding quality of life, she drives, lives on her own, sees friends etc. & it would be okay to look the other way if it could save your life. My grandma said “maybe if I was younger.” After some thought, I get it. The KH is her community, if she accepted the transfusion it wouldn’t be a secret and I am sure they would disfellowship her and that would cause more harm I am sure.\n\nI am just angry, I am angry that I am losing another grandma in a 2 week span, I am angry at her faith and the people in it. I am just mad. I haven’t dealt with a lot of death and now it feels like I am getting the ringer.\n\nI learned a lot about these medical/ethical dilemmas in school but I never thought it’d happen in my family. I always knew about the blood thing, but id never thought my grandma would be in this situation.\n\nTL;DR: I lost one grandma last week, now my other grandma is in the hospital for a life threatening thing and she won’t accept a blood transfusion because of her religion and her congregation put eyes on her and us to ensure we don’t persuade her to do it.\n\nThank you for reading, I just had to get this off my chest. Everything will be ok in the end I know. Death is apart of life.\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for your condolences and sharing your lived experiences around this. A couple of things, I know this religion was my grandmas whole life. If she wants to go this way then in the end I’ll support her. I just can’t fathom the influence of religion, but I know that it’s not me. I know she is at an old age and she will just get worse as years go on. I guess it just kind of sucks that a religion is dictating on her medical problems. But if she is happy then that’s all that matters and I need to find a way to not be angry at her for it.",

    "content": "We used to run around everywhere and play. There are 8 now, but when i was a kid it was 5-6 depending on my age. When it was the 5 of us and I was having troubles keeping up with the older ones, we would run around each town we lived in and just have fun. We'd walk to stores and parks, we even lived in a rural hot valley area (basically a desert) and would roam around and tell each other stories.\n\nWe'd have hang out spots with other kids and play until sundown. Then we'd sprint home because Mom told us to be home by the time the street lights are on and they were already on.\n\nI miss when my brothers were into drawing so we would all sit at the table and draw together. We'd also play board games, card games  (even poker lol) all day and have a blast. When we got a console we would sit and watch my brothers play games like Skyrim, Fall Out or we would play Halo 4 together.\n\nI hold all of these moments so close to me even though i don't talk to any of my siblings anymore. I can't bring myself to, not after the trauma we all went through. My mother was terribly abusive. It was always us against her. Then it became her against me because my older siblings moved out all at once and i became the focal point for her negative emotions. I'd be lying if i said i wasn't a little resentful about that. But i understand it now.\n\nI don't have any emotional connections to my siblings anymore, last time i was around all of them they all felt like strangers. I guess im \"emotionally estranged\".\n\nMy family is just really broken. I miss how it was before we all realized it. I think it was the realization that made everyone leave.\n\nI know the abuse was happening my entire childhood, but i miss what it's like having a sibling.\n\nI crave familial connections, it's why i'm so desperate to have my own family, but not with my mother and siblings. I guess I feel as if things are too fucked up to try to start over with them.\n\nI feel bad about it tho. I tried getting involved when my younger sibling went through horrific abuse but there was only so much i could do. Being able to do nothing except watch it unfold broke me again and gave me an even bigger reason to never talk to my mom again.\n\nBut i can't even bring myself to contact that sibling.\n\nAnytime something bad happens to one of us it makes it harder for me to reach out. I'm not sure why but i know it's not normal\n\nI just miss being a kid and having people to depend on. it used to be us against the world but now it's just me.\n\nIt just gets lonely sometimes.",

    "content": "Up front disclaimers: Throwaway account, all names are fake, you get the idea.\n\nMy mom and dad divorced when I was younger, and have since remarried. My brother and I are now old enough that both pairs have started to have the \"if something happened to us\" conversations. My mom and her new husband don't have other kids. My dad's new wife has three kids of her own (and I think the two are planning to have a kid together). I'm the oldest of all of us.\n\nI try to be polite and friendly to my step-family, but I don't see them as my siblings. By the time Kara (step mom) and my dad met, I was already an adult, moved out, and didn't live close to home. They're also more than 10 years younger than me. I try to be nice enough, but I just don't know them well. My step-siblings also have special needs that require a reasonably high amount of maintenance (will be relevant later).\n\nDad and Kara are both clear that, if something were to happen to my step-siblings, they want me to take them in. I said no. I don't have the time or the energy. My job pays decently, but not enough to support four on a single income. And my place isn't big enough. All of this is also compounded by their special needs - I don't have the time or energy to meet those; my insurance isn't good enough to cover their care; even with good insurance, I probably couldn't afford their meds. It's not an option for me.\n\nDad and Kara have said I'm ableist for refusing to take them in, because *some* of my concerns related to their needs (I want to make it clear my concerns were about my ability to support those; when it came to their needs I could support, I didn't bring them up). My step-siblings also have other people who are willing to help - including aunts and uncles who have volunteered to take them in if needed. They have somewhere to go. It's not like I'm putting them out on the streets. And again, I don't have resources to support them. They did say that, if I took them in, I would get the house (solving the place to live issue). However, I couldn't commute to my current job, and it's unlikely I could find one locally (not an easy to find position where I'm from for geographic reasons). I might get the house. But I'd lose the ability to support myself. Maybe this would be worthwhile if I felt close to them? But they're virtual strangers to me, so I don't.\n\nDad has said that, if I refuse to take them in, I'd lose my inheritance. I've said that's fine - put it in a trust fund for my step-siblings' care. I'm not rich, but I don't need the money; it'll help whichever family member does take them in (all of Kara's four siblings are willing to, so again, not turning them out on the streets). But I'm not taking them in. I don't have resources.\n\nI should also note - I'm a woman, and my brother is a man. When we're home over the holidays, I'm always the one my dad expects to help around the house. My brother, Chris, never is. Chris also makes more money, has a more stable job, has enough space, and... isn't thrilled about taking in my step-siblings, but is open. My dad has never put any pressure on him to care for them in any capacity. I am older, but we're both in our mid-20s. We're very much adults. Chris would be a reasonable option, but is never brought up as one. Also, his concerns were similar (resources, particularly related to the step-siblings' special needs). Surprise surprise, he's never been called \"ableist\". Dad has also never threatened Chris's inheritance. A lot of this is just misogyny that the women in a family are there to take care of others.",

But then I had to move to my real home with my father, mother, and brother. I joined a new school, and everything changed. I struggled to keep up with the new environment, and my schooling started falling apart. I became depressed.\n\nSomehow, I managed to pass my 10th through NIOS open school. Then I joined a government school for my 11th, but I fell into the wrong friendships. That led to me being sent off from school.\n\nHere comes the plot twist...\n\nAfter that, I was just sitting idle at home while my brother was doing his BTech in Biomedical Engineering from a well-known government college. My father had passed away by then, and I started feeling like a burden to my mother. I wanted to help her financially, so I started looking for jobs.\n\nFor two years, I worked multiple jobs—petrol pump operator, hospital attender, security guard—just trying to earn something.\n\nThen, in November 2019, after quitting my exhausting job as a hospital attender at the age of 19, I joined Delhivery as a courier delivery person. The job was insanely tough—at least 30 deliveries per day for a salary of ₹8,000 per month. I lasted two weeks before quitting and joining Swiggy as a delivery rider.\n\nSwiggy was fun at first. I was earning daily, spending recklessly on food and cigarettes, just living in the moment without thinking about the future.\n\nThen, two weeks later, everything changed.\n\nOne late night, around 11 PM, on my way back home, I met with a horrific accident. A truck carrying a full load of wood logs crashed into my bike.\n\nThat moment destroyed my life and shattered my mother’s hopes.\n\nI was bedridden for 4 years. My injuries were severe—multiple fractures, permanent damage to my hip and leg. The hospital treatment was not good enough, and recovery was extremely difficult.\n\nBut I didn’t give up.\n\nAfter years of suffering, I finally started walking again. And now, I’ve joined BCA online at Manipal University Jaipur to build a better future for myself. I’m learning to code, and I want to use this opportunity to change my life.\n\nI don’t know where this journey will take me, but I’m not giving up.\n\nThanks for reading.

As we all know, A LOT of alternative music is very 'depressing' if you can call it that, I think everyone understands. A large portion of alternative teens is also.., severely depressed.\n\nI met most of my alternative friends in the psych ward, or through friends of friends. I love them, they're fun and I used to feel like they understood me. I was in said psych ward for self harm and suicide about a year and a bit ago and yes, I still have my moments but I have learnt to manage my emotions, weaned off self harm and am no longer suicidal. I have been taking meds for depression and anxiety, but I got taken off a while ago and I am doing fine. I no longer have that 'what's the point of anything' outlook on life. I look forward to graduating, getting married, becoming independent and having children. I still have my fleeting problems with anxiety but as mentioned, in the long run I'm FINE.\n\nA lot of those friends have not gotten better. But not in the sense that they haven't been able to. I have been speaking to them and they have expressed that they don't want to get better. They are content being depressed. They also consume sad media constantly, like movies and music, and they're OKAY with that.\n\nI, though, have grown not so fond of it. I love them but I feel like I can't be around people that don't want to get better. I don't think it's a good influence to hang out with severe addicts. I don't want it to seem like I am abandoning them because they're too hard to deal with, but I don't want to put myself in friendgroups with alcoholics, people who are severely depressed and people who are constantly NEGATIVE.\n\nI came to this conclusion when one of my friends reccomeneded smoking to get rid of my problem, and I think that's when I knew that this is not the enviorment I want to be in. I just can't keep listening to the same problems over and over again when they don't want or care to fix them.\n\nI'm also starting to grow out of the alternative style. I'd rather wear bright colours and make myself look as colourful, joyful and feminine as possible. The goth make up is something I'm not into either anymore, I just don't like having people stare.\n\nNow, I recently turned to God and my friends have been.. not accepting. I told my best friend I wanted to try religion again and she got mad. She said I was abandoning her in atheism and \"Who will we hate on Christians with now?\" She doesn't like the idea of me going to church or ordering a Bible. We have had multiple arguments about this. She also recently did something controversial that I won't get into. I said I was reconsidering our friendship because of it and when she asked why I stated my reasons and added that I don't think her actions align with the type of people I should be surrounding myself with according to scripture. She got mad and blocked me.\n\nI'm sick of being misreable, sick of acting like nobody understands and sick of acting like I'm some tortured poet. I'm not. They're not.",

Now my mother is overall not very good at parenting, she messed up me and my sister pretty bad. But when it comes to her pets she at least acts like she loves them.\n\nNow when these babies hatched, two survived, and they were looking really nice and healthy, that was until a couple weeks ago. my mother was starting to get annoyed at their constant screaming (you know... as babies do) and decided that they were eating enough seed, it wouldnt matter if they were seperated or not from their parents (they were still being fed by their mother and father occasionally throughout the day). so cue her forcibly taking them, cramming them into a small cage, and not letting them see their parents anymore so they \"wouldnt scream again\".\n\ni was going to say something, but due to being too scared to say anything (if anyone disagrees with her on something big, she gets explosive) i kept my mouth shut. i mainly helped her with them when we had to hand feed them when they were infants, so i wasnt as worried as checking on them as i should have been, becuase i thought she could handle it. aparently i was wrong, she cant, and her decision to seperate them ended up being fatal for the youngest. in heindsight i think he was stressed from being seperated from his mom so suddenly, and so he stopped eating. according to my mom, he haddent really been eating too much over the past two weeks or so (ie, since she seperated them). i could be wrong though. (i have some experience with birds and i at least do my reserch.)\n\nthe youngest couldnt stand up. just trying to walk resulted in him just stumbling and falling over. i asked my mom why dont we take them to an avian vet, to see if something was wrong, and her words were \"i dont want to deal with some sick bird, its too stressful. if they die they die. and plus the vet bill will probably be 200 dollars and i dont want to spend that much\" so cue me flabbergasted, i try and hand feed the bird, at least a little bit. and it works, he's eating some, and putting him on his mother's cage floor, and hes slowly eating some seeds. im estatic, and i think, \"oh, ill check up on him in an hour.\"\n\ncue me falling asleep for a few hours instead, and  i wake up to check on him, and he's already passed away. i tell her, and what does she say? \"oh well, i'll bury him tomorrow put him in a plastic bag until then\" (not really relevent, she buried all our previous pets in plastic ziplock bags and such so thats going to be a nice supprise for the next owner. i recommended that she stop doing that but she still does anyway)\n\ni cant belive im related to her, how can one person be so heartless. she loves all her pets until they get sick, then theyre just another burden to her, talk about unconditinal. and worst thing is, i bet she wont even listen and pretend like it died from some illness. again, it could have been something else but im pretty confident she killed it.\n\ntldr: my mom shouldnt have birds, and especially never should have tried to hatch and raise baby cockateils if she really gets annoyed that easily. birds will be noisey (i know from experience).",

I would forgive him for literally ANYTHING else, but not cheating.\n\nI've had to do STI/STD kits because I can't believe a word out of his mouth. How am I supposed to believe he didn't sleep with anyone when he managed to hide all of this, it goes too deep to even begin to put into words. I don't trust someone who can happily hide their uncountable amount of affairs, sexting, flirting and fuck knows what else. I feel disgusting, I feel ugly. I have never felt so low.\n\nHe wants to be friends, but how can I be friends with someone who used me for years and tossed me aside. I want to rip off my skin so that I can get rid of his touch.  I feel so violated\n\nHonestly, I don't think I'll ever recover emotionally, mentally, or physically from this.",

    "content": "My boyfriends mom is jealous of me\n\nHi everyone. I’ve been a long time listener to this podcast and a situation arose that I need advise on. (I’m sorry in advance for any confusion or is my writing is horrible, this just happened and I’m not on reddit often.)\n\nI (19f) and my boyfriend (19m) started dating at the end of January this year. Everything has been perfect up until now. We met each others families, were loved by both sides, and everything has truly been amazing.\n\nFor some context, I am at a community college studying to be a speech therapist while my boyfriend is studying biomechanics and another community college. He was attending a four year but chose to come back home because it wasn’t for him. I am also very religious (Christian) and my boyfriend and I go to church together.\n\nRecently, his mom hasn’t been the biggest fan of me. There was one time where we closed the door in his room because I wanted to sleep and we wanted privacy (I can’t sleep unless it’s a dark room) plus I was exhausted from working early mornings. I totally understand if this is against his mom’s rules and from this point on we’ve kept the door open because his parents weren’t comfterble with it closed. Since then, shits hit the fan.\n\nMy boyfriend and both his parents sat down last night to have a talk. They said that they disapprove of me because “people who go to community college are lazy and turn out to be nobodies,” I’m a “fake Christian” and it seems as though my boyfriend has gone downhill. They also think, in his mom’s words, that he “settled.” Keep in mind they’ve known me for such a long time, a month. It’s not like I don’t spend time with his parents either. We have dinners where I’ll bring homemade sourdough bread or flowers as a thank you. We talk for hours on end whenever I am over there.\n\nHis mom is a stay at home mom with two boys in total, and since my boyfriend is the baby of the family, I think she feels like she’s being left behind. I feel bad having her feel that way but I feel like the longer they push him to essentially break up with me, the more they are going to end up pushing him away.\n\nAnother thing I forgot to mention, my boyfriend and I have not done anything sexually other than kiss. His mom claimed that my boyfriend’s and my relationship is “lustful not love” when in reality, she hasn’t even seen anything about our relationship other than when we’re at their house. Even when I am over there, my boyfriend at the most puts his arm on my leg or around my shoulders.\n\nShe is a Christian as well, she went to a university that is a private Christian school and was raised to be religious. Not saying that my path is more perfect but for more context, she doesn’t have a bible and she doesn’t go to church. I thought if anything someone who is religious would understand that in the Bible it says no one can judge because no one is perfect, only Jesus can judge because he is and he made us. I bought my boyfriend a Bible for Valentine’s Day she she thought it was super weird. I’m not telling him “read ten pages every night” or anything, he can do whatever he wants with it, read it or not.\n\nI know this was super long and I feel like I’m forgetting stuff but this is basically the gist of it. How can I convince his parents that I’m not someone that they think I am? I was thinking about just having a sit down with my parents first with my boyfriend so they could also give advice, but my boyfriend is 100% on my side of everything and sees right through his parents bs. I wanted to later on sit down with my boyfriend and just his mom but I feel like it’s going to take some time. Any thoughts and advice is more than welcome here! Thank you !",

    "title": "My step dad sucks",
    "content": "This is my last day on this house, and leaving is not even bringing me the peace I've been desperately wanting for years because this man can not stop himself from ruining EVERYTHING.\n\nLet me start by saying the following. Me and my mom got stuck on the road because of an accident and we had to turn back to a city that is not ours, or we'd have to spend the night on the road. Mom called step dad asking him to feed our cat, that is not even a year old yet. He was laying in bed, and refused to do it. A task that would not take one minute. He also said that, if he  let the cat out of the room if he fed her, he wouldn't do an effort to bring her inside again.\n\nMom and I strictly believe cats are animals that should 100% stay indoors and any time outside should be supervised. It took me a few years to convince my mom that, because my step dad managed to convince her first that cats need to \"exercise their wild instincts outside, and if they die because of that, it's because it's destined to\".\n\nHe truly thinks cats belong outside and me and my mom are abusing our cat by not letting her outside unsupervised. Even after our cats have gone missing before because he didn't support me keeping the cats indoors, and after his cat got mauled to death by street dogs. He found her on his doorstep, bloody and dismembered. Yet, he thinks that's just how things should be.\n\nToday, I will be moving away for university. This is the first time I'll be living by myself, in a huge city, as an autistic person with a lot of social anxiety and a bit agoraphobic. I also depend a lot on my mother. She's going with me for a week to help me and support me.\n\nShe asked my step dad to feed the cat for this whole week. He doesn't want to. He says he will not touch her litter box and won't feed her, because according to him, the room will smell like death.\n\nI found my mom crying today because of this, she thinks he'll leave her to die or set her outside and she'll go missing, or die outside too. We have no one else to ask for help.\n\nI told my mom that, she may have made me forgive this man who was homophobic towards me, made a bunch of weird sexual comments about me even when I was a minor, talked shit about me to my own family and his family, threw away two week old kittens out of the house to another side of the road in front of me, cheated on my mother multiple times, and told us to pack our things and get out whenever he felt like it, but if anything happens to my cat, I will never, EVER forgive this piece of shit.\n\nI hate this man. He has made my life miserable for years. Whenever I think he can't step lower, he does. This is a life for God's sake. It's an innocent life that can't take care of itself.\n\nMy mom thinks he's doing this out of spite for her.\n\nI hate him. I hate him so much. I'm so tired.",

    "content": "So today, my friend called me while I was in an online game (Mobile Legends). The problem is, whenever I get a call, my 4G+ drops to H+ and my game starts lagging, which is a huge deal in a game like MLBB where being AFK can ruin everything. So, I hung up. He called again, and I hung up again.\n\nNow, for some reason, both he and another friend are acting weird toward me—like they’re purposely cutting me off. They avoid me, walk ahead of me but constantly look back to check if I’m gone, and just overall act distant.\n\nThe part that really got me was when I asked for a cigarette. They claimed they didn’t have any, but they were literally heading to our usual smoking spot. Another friend (who isn’t aware of what’s going on) also asked for a cigarette, and I saw them looking back at me, almost like they were waiting for me to leave before giving him one.\n\nAt that moment, I knew they were avoiding me. So, I walked up to them quickly and made an excuse that I needed to go cook. One of them realized that I had caught on and started feeling bad. As I was leaving, he suddenly said, “Wait, maybe he has some.” It was like he was trying to make up for it, but it just confirmed that they were avoiding me in the first place.\n\nWhat bothers me the most is that I’ve always been there whenever they called or asked me to hang out. But the one time I decline, they start treating me like this? I don’t get it. If they were upset that I didn’t answer, why not just say something instead of acting all passive-aggressive?\n\nAm I wrong for feeling betrayed by this?",

    "content": "So I work as an RBT, which in my specific job, is working with kids that have autism. My center is skewed toward younger kids. That being said, the other day one of our new hires had session with a kid for half an hour. Then immediately after, I had session with the kid and he had a potty accident. So I grabbed his clothes and we went to the bathroom to change. Later in the day when I had another kid, I was in the same room as the guy who had my first kid for half an hour and shared like \"hey! He has a newer potty protocol he isn't doing too well with, I had to change him at the start of session, it can be a good idea to check him more frequently\" thinking it was a friendly tip next time he worked with that kid again. Spoiler alert he did not think so.\n\nHe basically ranted off on me about how he didn't think he should be getting the blame for something that he didn't even do because he had already checked him (didn't specify when or how many times, it sounded like it was maybe just once, but with a half hour session, that's not bad) and it could have been from when someone else earlier had him because the other person was with him for like 4+ hours. He also tried to call me out on how \"I heard the walkie call of you asking for extra underwear for the kid and it was made a while after you started session for him\". And I didn't even realize this until now, but I made that call 1.5 hours after I started session with the kid for a separate potty accident. The first one I saw he was wet after standing up maybe like 1-2 minutes after I started session with him, and we were right at his table, so I just went ahead and grabbed everything I needed and took him to get changed. So I didn't even make a walkie call for that first accident anyways.\n\nThis is also the same guy who had a rough time with another client the other day and kind of talked down to the kid for going into a behavior. And it was like kind of aggressive. I get working with these kids can be tough but that's just?? not okay. If you react like that to a kid after 1 session with him, you clearly do not have the capacity to be dealing with some of the high stressors this job brings.",

    "title": "My marriage ended after 25 yrs",
    "content": "I’m doing this on my phone, so excuse the formatting! And also excuse the rambling.\n\nUpto 2023, my marriage was on good footing. But then my physical and mental health took a nose dive. I lost interest in sex and I couldn’t explain why to my husband because I didn’t know why. My migraines were coming at 6-7 a week (yes, almost daily and lasting 6-12 hrs long) and I was having issues with bleeding most of the time. I have several other medical obstacles, and I am considered disabled by social security. I closed off thinking my husband didn’t want to hear about my petty complaints.\n\nHousework became his responsibility as well as cooking dinner on top of working full time.  (I can’t work due to my physical and mental health) He was overwhelmed and asked if I could cook dinners again. I did for about two weeks and then I couldn’t because my migraines were making it hard to smell food, let alone eating it.\n\nMy day basically was laying in bed all day listening to audiobooks to try to get my mind off the pain of the migraines. Then at the end of May I had a needle biopsy of my thyroid come back abnormal (most likely cancerous) and that made me spiral more. That’s when I got a text from an angry husband telling me that my husband was seeing his wife. This happened within a few days of finding out I needed to get my thyroid out. It was not a good week to say the least.\n\nI immediately confronted my husband with the text and he confessed it true. I thought it was only an emotional affair but he said it became physical back in April when he went on a Writers retreat with several people (or so I thought). It turns out it was just her and my husband. I completely lost it and was sobbing in his arms. (This was not his first affair) I asked him to break it off and go into counseling with me, but he said no. He cared for her and didn’t want to lose or hurt her. This was a major blow to me.\n\nI had been seeing a therapist for a while, but she retired. So a week before I found out about my thyroid I started seeing a new counselor. On my second appointment with her was a mess. I told my counselor about my thyroid and of my husband cheating. We had just celebrated our 25th anniversary before I had found out. I started having suicidal thoughts and told her about them. I even had a plan to carry out the suicide, involving ODing on one of my meds. She urged me to get a lockbox for that med and give the keys to my husband.\n\nHe still loves me, but was not in love with me anymore. He, our 15 yr old son, and I talked about the drug issue and it was decided for my safety that either my son or my husband would portion out the day’s worth of med about an hour before I was due to take it. We didn’t tell our son the exact reason why it needed to be controlled because we didn’t want to alarm him.\n\nI was spiraling down fast at this point. I stopped going to my water aerobics class and became a recluse. I didn’t want to see anyone. It was hard for me to focus on conversation so I lost interest in talking at all. I was seeing my counselor weekly and my prescriber of my antidepressants, and antipsychotics monthly. That time is somewhat fuzzy in my head.\n\nAugust comes around and they took out half my thyroid. Turns out I had Medullary thyroid cancer in that half. So they needed to remove the entire thyroid ( the other half was taken out in October). That side was clean thank goodness. They had caught it before it could spread outside my thyroid.\n\nMy husband started driving to see his AP on a biweekly basis. We didn’t tell anyone, not even our son for a while. We tried to keep things normalish as to not upset him. My husband and I decided to remain friends at least and he wanted a divorce. We broke the news to our son in December about us splitting up but he was the only one to know. My parents aren’t the most forgiving people so we wanted to keep the news from them for as long as possible. (My relationship with my father is rocky at best)\n\nMy counselor and I were talking on a weekly basis at this point, trying to reason with me that killing myself isn’t the answer. I knew I didn’t want to die because of our son, but that was the only reason I could even rely on. Everything was just falling apart around me.\n\nMy husband moved out of our bedroom in December, so I was sleeping alone. And crying myself to sleep almost every night. We would talk about his day in general and about our son but that was about it. When my depression would spike and I was feeling very suicidal (at one point I tried to find the key to the medicine safe) he would talk me down. I still don’t know if  that was a good thing or bad thing.\n\nAP lives 8 hours from us. So every other weekend he would drive to see her (she filed for divorce a week before they met IRL in April and in her state you have to be physically separated for a year before the divorce is finalized) her ex is an a$$ and kept harassing me and my husband.\n\nSo a year after I found out (May, 24) my husband says he wants to move in with AP so he needs to get a job there. I tell him I cannot stand to stay living in our townhouse as it has too many memories. He suggested I look for another apartment that our son and I can live in after he moves. We did just that. He started working his new job the week after we moved to a flat. (July,24) just before we moved, we had to put down one of our cats (she was fading, and we didn’t think she’d survive the move, plus she couldn’t walk or use the litter box on her own)\n\nMoving seemed to help my mental state. I’m not having as many panic attacks or psychosis’s (hearing voices that aren’t there) I’m able to do some of the housework myself (cooking, vacuuming, keeping the kitchen wiped down, my bedroom, and my bathroom). Our son (now 16) does his own room, his bathroom, the dishes, the trash, and the kitty stuff (like feed the cat, and keep the litter clean)\n\nWe are currently working on a dissolution on our marriage. Since we don’t have much (just a car, really) and our son, there isn’t too much to split.  We are on the same page about spousal and child support (in the state I live in, if you’re married more than 25 yrs, I get 30% of his income for the rest of our lives or until I marry again and child support until our son is 18.)\n\nOur son and I get to see my stbx every 3-4 weeks for a weekend. It’s painful to be separated from him, but it also hurts to see him. I know I failed 😣 and it’s mostly my fault our marriage ended. It’s been like this for about 6 months.\n\nHe wants me to start seeing other people, but after the 2nd betrayal of trust by him, I don’t know if I can trust anyone anymore. And I need trust to get close to someone else.  Thanks for listening.\n\nEdit: thank you all for your kind words. A lot of them made me cry.",

    "content": "Throwaway just in case type thing.\n\nI’m expecting judgement on this but I don’t really have anyone in my day to day to talk about this with so here we go. I (23M) have been with my girlfriend (33F) for about 3 and a half years now. We met as students, her having gone back to college, and have lived together for about 2 and a half years now. We also live with my GF’s daughter who we will call B(14F).\n\nNow for a bit of backstory, I’m still a student at the moment and the house we live in is my GF’s. She does alot of the heavy living financially at the moment, while I finish up school. She is a bit domineering in general, which I am okay with as I am a bit more passive and unassertive. And I have always had a good relationship with B.\n\nLately however something has begun to shift with B and I. It started with how she began to speak with me. “Hey, I need you to take less time in the shower from now on.” or “I need a sandwich made for 6 instead of 6:30, I’m getting hungry earlier than you.” Little things, but put in a demanding way. I dismissed it as teenage stuff. Then it escalated. She started demanding things of me and laughing about it, as if mocking me. Making me clean her room, give her my (little bit) of money, that sort of thing. Again, I bit my tongue, not wanting to cause trouble or anything.\n\nFinally I had to speak with my GF about her behaviour when she started to freely wear her undergarments and nothing else around the house. I calmly told her I’d rather she not do that, she laughs in my face. To me this crossed a bit of boundary, especially with how she has been so domineering lately.\n\nAnd NO, I’m not a p*do, that is not why it made me uncomfortable. I believe she has gotten too comfortable just in general and this was a reflection of that. This was a final straw to me.\n\nMy GF’s response was a laugh and “her house, her rules”. I don’t feel like I’m being unreasonable but maybe I am. Just feel like my relationship is doomed if I’m being treated like a second class citizen in what is supposed to be my home as well.

    "content": "I (19M) hate women approaching me. Throughout my life, I was considered to be “ugly”. I was told by multiple people and girls would treat me like dirt and constantly remind me I’m ugly throughout my life. Over the past 2 years, I made a decision after being insulted brutally on a “friend” app called Wizz (more like a dating app). I was really skinny and hence I decided to eat more and bulk up to gain some muscle mass as well as starting skincare and hopping on minoxidil for better hair quality for my facial hair, scalp hair and eyebrows too along with multiple other changes. Anyway, these 2 years increased my looks considerably to the point where I almost looked like a different human being. During this however my self esteem was still incredibly low. For the past few months, I noticed a girl that was constantly staring at me and I first thought oh she must think I’m ugly hence she’s staring. Later on she started laughing with her friend group while looking at me so I thought wow she must think I’m extremely ugly. This was not new to me. More recently, she added me over Snapchat which she got from a friend of mine as I’ve found out recently and she had a little conversation with me (I’ll call her J). J sent a snap of herself and told me she had seen me around and that she really liked me. This however triggered me and I remembered the treatment I had received up until now, especially the treatment on Wizz. In that moment, I snapped and insulted the mole on her cheek as well as her forehead and told her I’d have to be blind or in a coma for her to ever have a chance with me. This was quite recent. More recently, I’ve had a female cashier give me a discount on some shopping I was doing to make a milk cake because I’m “handsome”. It honestly disgusted me and I genuinely just left the shop without any of the ingredients. It hasn’t been long since I’ve become apparently “attractive” and I’m getting a whole lot more attention from girls and I hate it. Fuck these girls. They treated me like shit for all these years when I was ugly and now they think they have a chance when I’m “attractive”. Makes me want to punch them all in the face. I notice a lot of little changes in my daily interactions even with my family. It’s revolting.",

    "content": "For the context, our love felt more beautiful than anything I’d read in books or seen in movies, deeper and more real in a way that’s hard to explain. Part of it was because we both had real trauma growing up, which made us so similar. We bonded so purely and beautifully, expressing our truest selves to each other. It was more than I ever could’ve dreamed of. Even our first kiss, after nearly a year of waiting, was unlike anything else, the world didn’t just feel like it stopped, it “did”. We trembled, overwhelmed, and he cried like babies as he kissed me, tears streaming down his face. That’s how strong our connection was.\n\nI never wanted long distance, so he promised he’d move to my city, but he never did, mentioning financial reasons. Still, he visited every few months, and we always looked forward to those moments. He even deactivated his socials on his own, though I never had any problem or concern with them.\n\nOf course, not everything was perfect. His one toxic trait: whenever things didn’t go his way, or we argued, he’d start disrespecting and insulting me. It was a dealbreaker, but I still tried to be understanding. He had no real human connections all his life. He never even got to talk much to his family because of it being dysfunctional, no close friends, zero experience in relationships. I told myself he just can’t do any better, or could be because BPD runs in his family, or maybe because of the traumatic environment he grew up in.\n\nBut now, for the last four months, things were rough. We even broke up for a few days, ironically after our first intimate experience. I felt insecure or anxious afterward (he was my first boyfriend, and I have a bit of sexual trauma too), but he misunderstood it, assuming I didn’t like it or didn’t want it again. After that, he changed, became indifferent, stopped reassuring me, and didn’t seem to care about the relationship at all or even if we break up. It reinforced my fear that he didn’t feel the same anymore, trapping us in a cycle of blame and misunderstandings. I had spent so many nights crying during that time.\n\nHe eventually felt sorry and we fixed things, but I had already noticed a red flag: he seemed to care about physical intimacy more than anything; and shut down when he thought he wouldn’t get it. So then I started noticing more. During this rough phase, he reactivated his accounts, made new ones and never mentioned even after we patched up, and tried to hide them when asked. It also started needling me for the first time that why had he never added me on his instagram and its been so long we’re together, and I once saw a text from a coworker that felt off.\n\nI couldn’t ignore it all anymore. So, I decided to have a sudden, intense conversation with him, hoping his reactions would reveal the truth.\n\nThen his reactions did reveal. A lot. Not just cheating or anything, but about his whole identity.\n\nI started asking, he was so confident with his grand words and said that I can have his passwords and his phone (because he knew I’d never do that I don’t believe in invading privacy in a relationship). He kept manipulating me into believing there was nothing, and I almost fell for it, he was that good. But then, we stumbled upon the conversation with his coworker. He initially refused to let me see it, then tried to manipulate the situation. When I finally read it, I noticed he had tampered with it. The last text had originally been 12 weeks ago, but now it showed 17 weeks ago. And then, the part that made my heart sink: them talking about how fun it would be when he will move to Germany, and how she would be waiting for him.\n\nThat explains why he was so obsessed with moving to Germany. for his remote job? just to connect and work together with “all” his coworkers there? Those texts were from months ago, right after he started that job. Now, five months in, i believe they must have something concrete going on. It’s pretty clear from the way he provided no further clarifications when I saw that and refused to show anything else (they converse usually on discord which he didn’t even show).\n\nBut what struck me even more than the cheating was seeing in real time, how good he is at manipulation. My friends warned me, but I never believed it. He seemed too pure-hearted. But that day, I saw it: how effortlessly he lies. I’ve never seen anyone lie that efficiently. Even when I was trying to ask, he turned down all of my questions with so great replies that I started feeling like “What am I even thinking?”\n\nHe was even at that time making a grand gift for my birthday. It included multiple handmade beautiful gifts including a giant scrapbook, different boxes each with 50+ different kinds of letters and tapes in it for different situations and a painting which he painted himself. He was even better with words, the things he said, and the way he made me feel. It’s driving me insane. How can someone be that person (and) be cheating at the same time? For an example, he kept repeating that he wanted to move here to strengthen our relationship, that I was his life dream, that after being with me, he needed nothing else from life. But now, he’s moving for “her” instead? It’s giving me a complete identity crisis. If he’s really this good at manipulation, like I saw yesterday, then none of his words were real. His entire personality was fake.\n\nHe was standing there so willing, so confident about giving me passwords or proving his loyalty. But the moment I “actually asked”, he changed completely. He stalled, started arguing and gaslighting, clearly, anything to buy time. He tried deleting chats right in front of me, thinking I wouldn’t notice, thinking he could gaslight me again. Maybe he was too frantic to cover his tracks this time, but it was so obvious. This time he was maybe too much in a panic to realise how evident his manipulation is or to control what I’m thinking. And I know the coworker thing is just the one thing I happened to catch. The way he deleted other chats before giving me a bit of an access, it all proves there was so much more happening, in those months. Until now.\n\nThis has traumatized me to the point where I feel like nothing is real. Like I’ll wake up and everything around me will be gone, like everything is in my head. I know this is just the trauma speaking, and hopefully, I’ll be okay soon. But it has shaken me to my core. If this is true, then everything—he—was a lie.\n\nHow can someone be so convincing, so manipulative? For the first time in my life, I’ve seen deception on this scale, and it’s terrifying.\n\nIn a nutshell I observed so big of a contradiction between what he is portraying so confidently and the real truth. And now I don’t know who he is.",

The whole package. We've been seeing eachother for 4 months now and both really like eachother. but, she's texted me saying we should stop seeing eachother because her classmates in college have ostracised her from their group after she mentioned my age, saying that she is a Predator and that our relationship is wrong and apparently got similar answers when she's asked a public forum saying that she is a .pdf file despite the fact we are both adults capable of making our own decisions. I don't feel this way, I have never minded the age gap and feel it is insignificant but I also don't want her to take abuse for our relationship so Ig this is all very confusing for me\n\nUpdate: We've since spoken and decided not to split up. Her class has formed an opinion of her and ending our relationship isn't going to change their opinion so we may aswell be happy, Whatever other people think be damned.\n\nEdit: Thank You all for your comments with both advice and concerns. It was amazing to read about your experiences giving me hope for my own. And I've also taken notes of your concerns and things to look out for, and I'll be smart about things. I promise you guys I'm not going to let myself be manipulated. It was me who made the first move, so this isn't a case of her preying on me or grooming me or whatever We will continue to be open and honest with each other about how we feel about things, as we always have been.\n\nThank you everyone! and have a lovely day ✨️",

    "content": "Throwaway acc.\n\nI F29 feel stuck in my life and feel sad. I’ve felt like this for a number of years. In fact it started when I started my current role in healthcare after qualifying form university. I’ve thought about a career change so many times and have dabbled in a few things but haven’t fully dove into anything bc as much as I dislike my job, I’m good at it and earn a decent salary. It’s also a safe job.\n\nLong story short, I come from a poor working class background, mum with mental health issues, parents divorced and live separately. Mum is on benefits and dad works a minimum wage job. I come from a background where we don’t just abandon our parents and I love them and want to help them. I’m however an only child.\n\nI’ve been married to an amazing person a number of years ago and as amazing as he is, he too is burdened with family issues. We also live with the in-laws. His mother became disabled last year and a lot of her care is depended on him. He also holds responsibility for his disabled sister as well. He does a lot for everyone; he’s practically had to be the dad of the family since his dad wasn’t around much when they were younger. But now I see it taking a toll on him and he won’t admit it, only in snippets he says ‘I sleep so much bc I’m so stressed’. I try to support him as much as I can, but he’s doesn’t want me to get more stressed with my family stress too.\n\nI believe my stress comes from having a poor relationship with money. But let’s not deny that you need money to survive in this world. However, I feel this huge financial burden that I need to provide for my parents, especially as they near to pensioning ages and I really don’t want their financial stress when we have children bc no doubt it will happen.\n\nI had a plan of my job role for this year and it was going to allow me to be in a higher position and earn more money. However, this now is either not going to happen or will be delayed. Then I questioned myself, do I even want it? Or am I doing it to save my family from poverty.\n\nThe problem is that I don’t want know what I want to do. I went into this career path when I was younger but I regretted it so much. Due to stress I’ve developed PCOS and I’m 2st heavier than my previous baseline. I’m always tired, my husband is always tired and I feel that we don’t enjoy life as much bc of all responsibilities and we don’t even have children yet!!! Adding children onto this will just cause misery I’m sure of it\n\nI just don’t know what to do. We’re all trying our best but before being married, even in a relationship; when I felt stuck I would change my environment and look for things to do. I can’t do it as much anymore bc it’s not a me decision anymore it’s a we decision and although we have plans to move out, we’re saving up and you know what the housing market is like, so it will take a while.\n\nAnyways thanks for reading this if you got to the end 🫶🏽",

But it's still hurting so much.\n\nHe sent me this breakup text while I was taking a nap, and I woke up to it. Now, I'm terrified to sleep because it feels like it’s really over. Here’s part of what he said: \"Lately I have realized a feeling I didn't know I had... when I'm in a long-distance relationship, I feel chained to my setup. It’s not your fault, but the freedom I have felt when going on photo walks and disconnecting from my phone is something I can’t go back to.\"\n\nI know I have attachment issues, and he was aware of that when we started dating.

Abandoned the entire family multiple times and then dies from an overdose when I'm 5 years old. My dad maybe there physically but emotionally, he isn't, never was. His mother is a poor excuse of a replacement mother figure for me. Self-absorbed, egotistical, does not know the meaning of the word \"boundary\" (she told me once that (in so many words) ME having boundaries makes her \"uncomfortable\"), just a shitty person. (She also called me a burden when I was 11.

I'm trapped until I turn 18 and can get the hell out of here.\n\nMy father's a neglectful, coward of a man who brought me into this world, a kid he didn't even want! (his own words) and refuses to accept that the enabling of his own wife's problems and his problems has really fucked up his kid.\n\nCall me whiny, spoiled, ungrateful, dramatic, I've heard it all before. I just wish I had a family who saw their kid as an individual, not some accidental prop/tool they brought into this world and now have to deal with her \"emotional outbursts\" or \"attitude\"  I wish somebody would at least fucking understand instead of seeing me as a moody teenager.",

For context, my ex and I were on and off for two years, and then we started to see each other as friends with benefits, which has lasted for quite some time. Yesterday, my friend revealed to me that he's absolutely sure that my ex had a girlfriend he has been with for a variable time span (it could be three months, but also ten, surely less than a year though). This girl was the classic friend \"I didn't have to worry about\" and she's absolutely beautiful and also a really kind person. Obviously, he didn't bother to tell me and he cheated on her with me at least two or three times. This happened more than a year ago, and now I have a boyfriend, different friends and my life got significantly better, but I can't shake the feeling that he's treated me like a fool and he has been basically using me, when I've always thought he respected me. I don't know if I should tell her (not my circus), given that they're already broken up and that me and her are not friends, just acquaintances. Moreover, I've always felt insecure about her and \"inferior\", in a certain way, so I would just like to put this all behind me and forget about it.

People say that we are both attractive for our ages and because of that we often get shipped as a couple by our other friends. It doesn't bother me that much because I am used to hearing stuff like this. My father, however, gave me some requirements for marriage and they are odd. One of the requirements is my partner can't be the same age or older than me. The thing is, when we started talking over text, things escalated. Now we call each other romantic names. And the topic of us having children came up more than once. And there is also my friend (2 years older than me. Let's call him WILLIAM) and WILLIAM has feelings for my friend (F). But the guilt is eating me out. My parents gave me freedom and I am misusing it. Though we read in different schools, our friends and mutual friends know about us. Her friends often flirt with me for being very handsome. Though my face is one of my biggest insecurities. Yesterday I was in the bathroom of our community hall. And I saw her. She said hello, I said too. We talked and she started flirting with me. I didn't find it weird since she has done it more than once, so we were in the bathroom and she suddenly asked me \"Will you kiss me?\" I paused. And when I did, she came over and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I blushed so hard that when my mom noticed she said \"what happened, why are you blushing?\" I couldn't tell her the real reason, so I made one up. Next day she messaged me to meet in the same place. I went thinking she surely couldn't do it again. When I met her we talked for a few mins and she asked if I could kiss her as well. I didn't wanna hurt her but at the same time I am afraid of my parents. So I kissed her on her hand. She was happy, I was too, but deep down, I was dying. Now I am sitting in my room thinking, should I confess my feelings for her or should i tell abt my feelings to WILLIAM.

    "content": "I (30M) share an apartment with my friend (30F), I'll call her Gwen.\n\nGwen has a lot of mugs, more than will fit in the cup cupboard all at once. So she rotates them seasonally, she loves swapping them out. I asked why and she says it's like getting new mugs every couple months. But there are two mugs in her collection that never leave the kitchen. They are rarely in the cupboard because the second they are washed she uses them again.\n\nWe have a dishwasher, but it's broken. Part of our chore division is that we each take care of our own dishes. The thing is I know she doesnt like doing her dishes, its a sensory thing, but she insisted that we do our own dishes and I thought that was pretty fair. I also know that Gwen's most favorite is her Spiderman mug. She's never told me that, I can just tell because the spiderman mug gets picked before any of the others when its clean. I know this because I see it in the sink every day for her to wash before bed with her other dishes from the day. There were times that her dishes sat for a couple days before she could force herself to work through the sensory issues and get them done. It never got to the point of smelling bad, and she apologized every time for any dishes she left overnight. I truly did not mind when that happened. I understand the sensory issues and I'm proud of her for keeping on top of it as much as she was.\n\nNow comes the part I need to get off my chest, the background info was important I promise! Every time Gwen realises she can use her Spiderman mug she dances an adorable happy dance while making her tea for the morning. She doesn't seem to realise she's dancing, or doesn't realise I noticed her dancing. Either way, it's my favorite part of the day when I am getting ready for work and she dances a happy dance while getting her breakfast because she gets to use her Spiderman mug every single morning. It's seriously cheers her up and she's been a lot more positive throughout the day since I started doing this.\n\nGwen found me washing her dishes last week. I had been doing them for a while, but this was the first time she walked in and caught me bubble-handed washing her Spiderman mug. Not gonna lie I panicked. She thanked me for helping her and then asked why I started to do her dishes too. She even asked if I was annoyed by her dishes when she left them. This was absolutely not the case, but I couldn't tell her I watch her happy dances, that's creepy right? But it's so cute and makes me so happy to see her so happy. If she knew I watched her dance she would feel self conscious and stop doing them. She's pretty shy about stuff like that. She won't sing in front of anyone, but singing is one of her favorite things to do and I've caught her singing along to her music before she realises I'm  home more than she realises, I also pretend not to notice when that happens, she has a really pretty voice. So yeah, I couldn't tell her why I'm really doing her dishes or I would loose my favorite part of my day.\n\nI told her I like to get mine done every night, its something my mom always told me to do, I was already there so it wasn't a big deal to do hers too, it saves water and she does a few of the house hold chores that I hate because she likes them, so I don't mind doing this one tiny extra chore that she doesnt like. I feel like I was pretty obviously not telling the truth, but I think she believed me lol. She didnt tell me to stop and she hasn't brought it up since she caught me. So I still get to see her happy dances when she goes in the kitchen and sees her Spiderman mug ready for her to start the day.\n\nTl:Dr I wash my roommate's favorite mug every night to give her something to look forward to in the mornings. She does a little happy dance every time she uses her mug and it makes me happy to see her that happy.\n\nEdit 1: alright, I'm headed to bed, thank you all for your comments. To clarify we are just friends, we are roommates now, but we were friends first. Anyways, it's been fun, but it's 5 am and I have an appointment at 10 am. This should be fun! Good night!\n\nEdit 2: it is now 9am. I just woke up to so many notifications, jesus h christ what happened while I was napping? Thank you everyone for your responses. I did not expect my habit, that I thought would be seen as weird or creepy, to get so much attention. I'm so glad so many of you got a smile from my post, as you can tell, I like to give people a reason to smile. I hope you all have an awesome day!\n\nEdit 3: Guys she found the fucking post. SCATTER! No for real. She commented on this post, she made an account specifically to comment. How. How. How did this happen and how did it happen so god damned fast??? I didnt think she was on reddit! Shes always on youtube watching video games or listening to stories! She used a picture of The Mugᵀᴹ as the profile pic. I'm panicking. I'll update when I'm brave enough to go out to the kitchen. I can hear her cooking.\n\nEdit 4: so I linked a picture with an update and the automod did not likey. So I have removed the link, but the update is still on my profile, for anyone interested.\n\nUpdate: https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/2QuGfcnFvA",

    "content": "Back when I was in highschool, I was a bit of an outcast. I wasn't bullied (not to my face at least), was okayish socially, kinda liked. Always sort of something. I had friends, sure, but I was never the number one choice.\n\nGroup projects? I had to ask for partners, no one ever asked me. Same went for field trip sleeping arrangements, and anything that had to be in pairs or above. If we were a five people group, and the project was for four, I'd be the one left out almost every time. It would have been one thing if I was a lousy student, but I had great grades, so I know it wasn't about that.\n\nI was also always the one to create all the group chats, and always learned that there was one without me as well. And sure, people can do whatever they want, but it still hurts when you find that out. Some of these people are ones I kept in touch until today (I am 24 now), but again: never the first choice.\n\nAnd it might feel or seem small, but I was never the one people set next to. I didn't smell bad (I asked about it), wasn't an annoyance, just another part of never being first.\n\nNow don't get me wrong. They were amazing friends, that point aside. Always there for me when I needed, supported me when I came out and through a couple of years that were practically hell for my mental health, defended me when I didn't know I needed defense. They still support me to this day, too. It's safe to say I literally wouldn't have been here today without them.\n\nThen college happened. I started this year, and the social aspect was my major fear. Will I even have friends? Or is it really something so awful about me that makes people feel less for me, every time?\n\nBut college couldn't have been more different. I found people that actually like me. When we have classes together, they search for me. When I miss a day, I get a text asking where I was, because I never skip classes. And even if they were a group before I joined, they added me to their group chat without making a big deal out of it. They didn't open a new group, they just added me to their usual one.\n\nWe plan our schedules together so we share most classes, we make plans, I don't have to start chats... I guess I am being chosen for the first time, and not being left behind. It's a point when I am positive that even if I don't have many classes with any of them in the future, we will still keep in touch and stay friends.\n\nThere isn't much to this post aside from happy at where I came to, but I felt like I had to get it out and tell someone :))",

    "content": "The whole thing happened over 10 years ago, and I had actually repressed the situation pretty well until my ex messaged me again recently. Now I think about it every day and have panic attacks because of it.\n\nBack then, we weren’t together yet, but he knew that I was in love with him. One evening, we were at his best friend’s place, and the two of them were smoking a bong. They wanted me to smoke as well. I asked what it was, and they said weed. Being stupid, I took a hit, but whatever it was, it definitely wasn’t weed. At first, I got extremely dizzy, then I couldn’t move anymore, and I started panicking inside because I couldn’t speak or even breathe.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, his best friend told him to check if I was still breathing, which he did. When he confirmed that I was still breathing, the other guy left the room to go to sleep. That’s when my ex started undressing me and then had sex with me. It must have lasted for several hours, and towards the end, I was somewhat conscious again and could have said something. But I didn’t—I just couldn’t.\n\nAt some point, he stopped, and I went home. I had never felt as horrible lying in my own bed as I did after that night. Afterward, I desperately wanted to be with him—probably because I thought it would somehow undo what had happened. About a year later, we actually got together.\n\nBut maybe I’m overinterpreting the situation. After all, he knew I loved him, so maybe he thought I wanted it too.\n\nI’ll probably talk to my therapist about it, but I’m afraid I’m making it into something bigger than it actually was. Besides, it was my fault too. I don’t know, I just wanted to get it off my chest.",

Can't work, can't have a normal conversation with anyone without getting irrationaly grumpy, can't enjoy any hobbies, can't do almost anything, all because my mind is consumed almsot 24/7 fantasizing about the ways in which i would brutalize those 2 men if ever given the oppurtunity. I've literally never felt anything close to this before and I don't know what to do. I'm hoping this will be a \"time heals all wounds\" situation but i'm not so sure.\n\nPart of me says to myself \"well there's thousands of kids out there who get abused every day and there's nothing you can do about it so there's no point losing yourself over it\" but being able to push this all from my mind is easier said than done.

    "content": "Hello reddit, here is something that grinds my gears.Why do so many self-help gurus push the idea that every fun thing in life is an addiction that needs to be cut out? Stop playing video games, they’ll make you addicted. Stop drinking, it’ll ruin your life. Stop doing this, stop doing that. And then, as if that’s not enough, they push this pseudo-stoic mindset of “just focus on yourself” and “become the best version of yourself,” whatever that even means.\n\nIt all feels incredibly narrow-minded and, honestly, kind of boring. These people act like the only thing that matters is self-improvement and constant progress. But what if I don’t want that? What if I just want to be me? What if I just want to relax and enjoy life? Life is already hard enough as it is, and it feels like these gurus prey on people's insecurities—especially those who are struggling—and make them believe that the things they love are actually holding them back.\n\nThere’s this obsession with “self-improvement” that often feels less about genuine growth and more about selling an idealized, almost robotic version of existence. It’s weird because it’s marketed as freedom—“become the best version of yourself!”—but it actually sounds more like a prison of constant self-discipline. Like, what’s the point if you can’t just exist without feeling guilty for not grinding 24/7?\n\nTake guys like Andrew Huberman, for example. Sure, he knows his neuroscience, but does he really have life all figured out? Because the way they present themselves, you'd think they had unlocked some secret formula to existence. But to me, it just seems sad. Humans are so obsessed with being ultra-efficient that they forget we only have a short time on this planet. And after that? A whole lot of nothing. So why not enjoy the things that make life meaningful instead of obsessing over sacrificing everything in the name of self-discipline?\n\nI get that addiction is real, and obviously, some habits can be destructive. But what’s the point of living if you can’t just enjoy things sometimes? Why does everything have to be about optimizing every aspect of yourself? I think it’s okay to make sacrifices when they actually make sense, but it’s also okay to say, “Screw it, I just want to enjoy myself.”\n\nI don’t know—this mindset just annoys me. Anyone else feel the same way?",

Not a lot of sexual stuff but very verbally abusive cause I wouldn’t.  Completely ended when I was 18 cause my now husband helped me realise the whole thing was unhealthy. And therapy made me realise was grooming even though we never met.\n\nI’m 27 now and 3 weeks ago I had a miscarriage for a planned pregnancy.

My cousin's were always better than my sister and I and my grandmother would deny us visits because she would say she was too busy. I think I maybe stayed the night at her place once. She absolutely despised my mother. I think that's why she didn't like my sister and I growing up. She hardly knew anything about me. She hated my mother so much that she tried to get my dad to leave her and go back to his ex and my grandmother told the ex he was interested. Not true at all lol. When my mom got pregnant with me, my parents split and they never told me grandmother I was coming. When my mom was 9 months along, they got back together and finally told her and she was LIVID. My grandmother got lung cancer and it got aggressive quickly. A couple weeks before she passed, she had sent me several messages saying that we texted her horribly, called my mother every name in the book and then asked me if I knew why she hated my parents being together so much. Of course I had no idea why. My mom is a very loving person and stated my grandmother only hates her because she wrote in her diary that she was a b*tch and my grandmother read her diary. My grandmother eventually told me my father was a product of r@pe and it happened after she got drunk at a party and woke up naked. She told me that the criminal was my mother's uncle. This would make my mom and dad first cousins. My grandmother was always a liar and I didn't believe her. I did bring this to my mom and dad and they did confirm that my dad was unsure who his father was because of the R@pe and my grandfather that I knew my entire life had zero blood relation to me. They did say that my grandmother waited until after my parents were married to tell him, which broke my dad heavily. That dad he knew, wasn't his dad. And I honestly think she said it just to hurt him. She always treated him differently to his siblings. Anyways, I decided I wanted to know my ancestry so I did a 23&Me test and found my grandmother hadn't been lying to me. She told me the truth. And it bothers me so so much! Like yes, my parents had no idea by the time I came along. But also, why did you have to gut punch me one more time before you died? Why couldn't you take in to your grave?! It's her fault for not telling them before they started to date. I know I'm going to be taking it to mine. My kids don't need to know any of this. Thanks for listening.

OBVIOUSLY, for victims of parental abuse this is patently false, but I'd like to see the opposite expressed somewhere, so here goes my attempt.\n\nMy mom is a lovely person. She's always tiring herself out helping others, supporting others, lifting them up. I'm sad and she says she doesn't mind staying awake at night to talk to me. I'm not a nuisance to her, I'm cared for and loved.\n\nIn many ways, this has put me off of romantic relationships.

IF it's not pure and unconditional and unstoppable, what good is that kind of love?\n\nI know, I know what I'm asking is a tall ordeal, but still...\n\nI just wanted to let people know that sometimes that sentence is true, and other times it is abusive. But I don't think it has to be one specific thing all the time. Context is required, in my case, my mom is a genuinely wonderful person who only wants what's best for me, is supportive, hears me out when I have issues (Even if she doesn't know how to adequately be supportive of my specific needs but that's for another rant). She's always there for her friends, in practical and more emotional ways, and she takes care of all of us. She's always looking out for me and my dad and her mother and people she used to work with text her constantly because she just plainly made their lives very happy. She wasn't bossy or punitive at work, although she praised a job well done, she could see the good in every person and tried to help them in the ways she could. She believes there is always a place for everyone and just because someone is doing bad at one task doesn't mean they are invaluable. She understands people. She cares, most of all, and she's genuine, and so it is really weird to me to go online and only read about how abusive that sentence is, because my mom is not like that, so why would she say it?\n\nI do have issues with taking things literally btw and suspect to be on the autism spectrum.

From beg bugs to cockroaches filling the microwave, I was so tired of it, but knew I just had to thug it out. Since gr3-8, teachers would have to question if everything was ok and i truly wondered if they were ever gonna call cps, but i always hid it.

I wasn't living with my parents and sometimes I just wanted their company despite the ruckus environment they have always caused. However, although i had a better living situation, that was only thing that kept me happy and somewhat ok with my circumstances. But, high school ended and that was one of the darkest and traumatic moments of my life happened. I realize I had large sums of money stolen from family members as well a spiral of physical trauma from that year. From then, I knew I had to add meaning to my  life so I started working community based jobs and eventually researched getting into health care (specifically med school ik a common dream many teens have in education but rarely achieve). However, I believed i could do it. Now enrolled in post secondary i had big goals and was so fixated on getting one thing, the typical rags to riches - shitty environment to respectable status. However, one club i went to fucked me up (story is in my profile). Although it may seem like an overreaction and a story nothing to worry about, it really fucked with my mental.

Now, after all these years I decided to call my mental health services at the uni i am enrolled in since I literally had a panic attack before class and started throwing up in the washroom. Tomorrow, is my first appointment and idk if this is gonna help my mental. Idk if i ever had clinical depression plus i never went to see a psychiatrist to diagnose me. I am writing all of this because i truly don't where to go online to vent. I feel like a failure and wondered if i am ever gonna achieve the \"american dream.\" or be stuck at the bottom of the totem pole. I am trying my best to seem like a good human being, but everything going really affects my perception of myself. I hope I can show my parents I am worth something.",

    "title": "I feel guilty for getting a D&D session cancelled",
    "content": "Throwaway cuz I don't really use Reddit, but I've been feeling particularly guilty about this and wanted to get it out there. A bit of context, this winter has been rather challenging to say the least. I have struggled with mental health issues related to major life changes, as well as complications in relationships and friendships. All this to say, I've been having a rough time, but I've been trying to manage and for the most part have been getting better, albeit there are still some harder times. With that established, back to the main story. I am in a D&D group of eight people, all in our early twenties. Scheduling, as I'm sure many of you can imagine, can be a bit difficult. This past weekend, we managed to find a time that worked for enough people so that someone in the group could run a one-shot. He has put a good amount of time into preparing for it and seemed very excited. We had chosen Sunday as the day to get together. That Saturday, I had planned to travel out of town for a day trip to visit family. While I was there, I started to struggle quite a bit. Like I said, it happens sometimes where certain days are harder than others, and Saturday, it hit hard. I felt as though all my motivation to do anything had disappeared, and I just wanted to crawl into bed and sob for a while. I obviously couldn't do that on the spot, and forced myself to power through, trying to have as good of a time as I can with my family. Here is where I did something I feel immensely guilty for. I decided to message in the D&D group's discord, saying that something came up and I wouldn't be able to make the session. Really, I knew I just wanted to take the day to myself as I knew with the way I was feeling, I most likely would not be engaged or having fun during the session, and flat out just didn't want to be there while feeling like that. Shortly thereafter, the person running the session decided to cancel, moving it to this next weekend. Some of those in the group responded to my cancellation message with little angry emojis. I also was contacted by the partner of the person who was running the session. They asked what happened and mentioned the prospective DM was upset that I had cancelled. I said my family decided to extend the daytrip throughout the whole weekend and I couldn't get away. This was a lie, of course, but I felt like I would seem weak if I had said \"yeah I'm just feeling too depressed to play D&D this weekend\" and I thought a more concrete excuse would be more easily accepted. Since then, I have felt very guilty for this. I understand why people would be disappointed, they have every right to be, and I really did not mean to hurt or upset anyone. I just know I would have had an unpleasant time during the session, and really did not want to be there feeling how I was. I know this isn't exactly the most exciting story, but I just felt like I needed to get it off my chest, its been eating at me so hopefully saying this out loud, so to speak, will help me feel a bit better.",

    "content": "Hey, so, it's really hard for me to come on here and say this. First of all, I know I'm 100% to blame for everything. And, I'm contemplating whether I should leave my boyfriend. Not for me, I don't want to leave him and I think that would hurt so bad. But for him. I feel he deserves so much better.\n\nYou can be blunt with me and tell me what a horrible person I am, I'm not going to be defensive about that. That's what I think of myself right now too.\n\nSo, me 18F and my boyfriend 23M have been dating for almost 11 months now. I love him, so much. I feel pathetic typing this because I know what I'm about to say after all of this will be quite alarming. But he truly is the most amazing, smart, funny, sweet and handsome guy ever. We have many fun times together. However, me myself, I struggle a lot mentally. It's taken me months on a waiting list to finally get into see a psychologist.\n\nBecause I struggle quite a lot with my sense of self and insecurities/suicidal thoughts, I fear that I have brought these things into the relationship. When i first started dating him, I thought I was doing okay. But I realised that my perspective on life, my emotions and everything is so turbulent that it can change quite fast. It's just lately, it's been very bad.\n\nI get mad and upset. You might think that's normal, and, well that itself is however...I've hurt my boyfriend so much by being depressed. I know I'm very toxic to be with right now. I almost jumped out of his car to commit suicide the other day. He is very shaken up and I feel bad because after that all happened. I realise \"holy fuck I just traumatised him, what have I done, I'm an absolute monster.\" I feel like a monster. He loves me a lot and cares a lot. After that all happened, I was at his house crying. He said we should break up temporarily. But hearing that just crushed me and I felt more suicidal and I was begging him to not leave me. I am utterly terrified of him leaving me. I got so upset that, I hit him. 3 times. On the shoulder. I then started crying even more and apologising profusely. However this is the second time something like that has happened. It's like, whenever I'm upset I just loose it.\n\nI am filled with so much guilt. He forgave me. But that doesn't stop the guilt. I know he deserves so much better. I don't feel like I should be with him because I don't want to hurt him more. I love him beyond words can describe and I'm also so scared of him not being apart of my life. I feel so stuck.\n\nI accept full accountability. I know I'm wrong. I know my actions were disgusting. I want to be better. I'm just so scared. I don't think I've stopped crying since I tried to jump out of his car and I hit him. He says he'd still rather be with me than anyone else. I feel so bad, I'm a monster.\n\nI just don't know what he sees in me and it kills me to think about but I feel like he could be so much happier with a girl who isn't a liability like me. :(\n\nI'm really trying to be a better person for him and go to therapy because I don't want to loose him but I'm so conflicted as well because would loosing me make him happier??\n\nI know that all of this sounds awful. I just thought I should post this on a private account to feel more shame. If I could give him the world, I would. :(",

I originally met him when I was 18. And let me tell you, I swear it was love at first sight. I can still remember the way he first looked at me… I mean of course I do… it’s all I’ve really had to go off of for 7 years… summary the past 7 years.. well his 11.. he’s been with the same girl since  high school. They recently separated in September of 2024… and that’s because he had failed the bar and was having a midlife crisis and called me to come get him… and of course I did. We’d recently bonded again because of the complications I had with my daughter’s birth and the lack of basic compassion from her father… I had been hospitalized for a month before having my daughter and she was in the nicu for 62 days.. during the whole period of me being in the hospital, it was only my mom and him who would check on me and my baby… given our history it was obviously easy to just open up to him(to me)… because you know despite him having a wife for the past 7 years.. we’ve always stayed in touch regardless of who I was dating at the time… I know, don’t even tell me how bad that is… well to no one’s surprise and surprisingly not even to mine… I caught him emotionally cheating on me with his soon to be ex wife… he’s already proposed to me at this point and now both my daughter and I live with him… and honestly all I can think is stupid stupid… I know the saying goes you lose them how you get them, but he’s played an active role in my daughter’s life since she’s been five months old….. that’s her dada… he’s been the only man who’s happily stepped into the role of being her father since her dad bounced….. I don’t even know how I got myself into this mess let alone how to navigate this…. I’ve been in love with this man for over 7 years… and at this point I don’t know what to do… I just want to do what’s best for my daughter..

    "title": "I gave my eldest daughter up for adoption 15 years ago today",
    "content": "I was 18 when I had my first born. Between no support system and post partum depression, I never bonded with her. It was just me and her, I would ask my friends to watch her her while I worked to be able to afford daycare so I could make a life for me and her, yet I still never felt any connection with her. I knew it wasn’t her fault, she never asked for me to be her mother. I told myself I would push through and hope for a better future. I despised her. Her cries sounded like nails on a chalk board and I would end up crying after taking care of her. I still reminded myself, she never asked for me to be her mother, I had to push through. My post partum depression progressed, I never got treatment because of fear. I feared she would be taken away from me because of how we were living. Section 8, a messy house, not having enough food for both of us. I always gave her my meals, what little there was. I went from 150 to 114 in a very short amount of time. I was hungry, tired, overwhelmed, but she never asked for me to be her mother.\n\nHer father came back into our lives when she was around 14 months. It felt like my saving grace. Maybe we could be a little family and have a home full of love and laughter. He was a drunk. I was still alone with my daughter, and now, I had the heavy burden of having someone in my house that could help but chose not to. 2 months later I fell pregnant again. I was horrified when I found out. I couldn’t restart everything again. I kept her because of a previous miscarriage. I felt it wasn’t right for me to be ungrateful. I had a rough pregnancy. I was very depressed and had a turbulent relationship. He left me constantly during my pregnancy. He said cruel things. It only got worse when I had to go on maternity leave. I was called lazy and a bad mother for not working up until I gave birth. My daughter was born 10lbs 1oz, I was exhausted and I hurt severely.\n\nMy second daughter was born and everything was so easy. I connected with her immediately. She was such a happy baby. She never cried just to cry. She only cried when she needed something. When I took care of her needs, there was no crying. She was happy and content at such a young age. I realized this is what motherhood was supposed to feel like. It wasn’t supposed to feel like a burden, I wasn’t supposed to secretly despise my child, I wasn’t supposed to be angry at a helpless newborn. Havjng my second really changed me. I was so much more nice to my first, I still found her annoying most of the time, but I felt I loved her for the first time.\n\nIt was short lived unfortunately. The post partum depression returned when my youngest was 7-8 months. She was still the apple of my eye, but I turned my hatred to my oldest again. That was the moment I realized I needed to consider adoption. How could a mother hate her child? As the months went on I found myself not giving affection towards her. I would ignore her tantrums and yell at her for them. I would tell her no when she asked if I could hold her. I stopped kissing her forehead or cheeks. She wasn’t an easy child since birth, but it got so much worse as she aged. I laid in bed next to her and admitted to myself, I hate my own child. I hated her as I would hate a person who has done wrong by me for years. The night finally came I had enough. I had been trying to put her to bed for an hour. Hearing screaming, being kicked, having my hair pulled. I snapped. I pinched her. Hard. Multiple times until she fell asleep. Then once more after she fell asleep. The same punishment my mother would do to me. I was turning into my mother. The person I promised myself I would never be like. I had the most rude awakening that night and cried for hours after she went to bed. I took her to the CPS office the following morning and told them I couldn’t be her mother anymore. That was all I said. I left her in the waiting room. I didn’t hug her, I didn’t kiss her, I just left. It ate at me for years and still does. I was the only person she knew in her life. I knew her finding a loving family was better than having a mother like me. I moved a few states away 2 days after. I didn’t want to be found. I didn’t want any possibility of them trying to return her to me because I knew I did this for her own good. It was the only genuine loving gesture I had to offer her since she was born. They never reached out or tried to find me, as far as I knew.\n\nI still carry the guilt and shame. I still cry for her. How confused and scared she must have been to never see her mother again. Why couldn’t I be the mother she deserved? 2 1/2 years of thinking the bare minimum was the most love she would ever receive. I’m glad I gave her up. Not for me, but for her. I searched through multiple schools near my old town a few days ago. I found her. I took the information I had and found her as well as her adoptive family on Facebook. She has an amazing life. She looks radiant in every picture I found of her. She’s absolutely gorgeous. I know I couldn’t have given her that life. I hope this was a selfless act, not selfish. I hope she doesn’t remember me.\n\nI married and had one more daughter. I’m so in love with my 2 other children which brings a perpetual guilt to my life. I wish I could’ve been her mother. I still mourn her. I haven’t allowed myself to feel negatively about giving her up, only for the way I treated her. It was for her. She never asked to have a mother like me, so I gave her to a mother that could love her the way she deserved.",

    "content": "I'm a teacher-librarian at an elementary school in my tenth year and it has become increasingly apparent that this is not the job for me. Despite not wanting to be another statistic in the world of education, I need to get out before I completely lose it.\n\nReading and libraries used to be my life. I would spend countless hours reading books and browsing through the stacks in libraries. Whenever I traveled, my first stop was always the library. Growing up, no one ever doubted that I'd become a librarian. Life took some twists and turns along the way but I finally finally made it back to the libraries I love.\n\nNow I fucking HATE IT. Along with anything else that used to give me joy in life.\n\nI used to love to go hiking, shopping, working out, just be out and about for no reason at all, but now all I do is crawl into bed and sleep until the next morning. And calling it sleep is very generous. Running on about four hours of sleep has become standard, and don't think that the lack of sleep contributing to my overall feelings about life has gone over my head. Problem is that nightmares about going back to work wake me up and fretting over the students for several hours after makes sleep a luxury for me.\n\nI'm sick of spending the majority of my day managing behaviors. I'm sick of trying to find engaging lessons for the students to absolutely not be able to handle it. I'm sick of the constant NOISE, the SCREAMING, and the VIOLENCE. Why is violence the first thing these kids turn to? I'm sick of these kids leaving the library and the books in pieces, acting as though they haven't had me since kindergarten and know how the library is supposed to be kept. I'm sick of the students acting like it's their first goddamn day on Earth. I'm sick of hearing the phrase “I'm sorry” and just watching them do it again five minutes later. I told one girl that her apology had less meaning than a pig's fart and I don't even feel bad saying that. I'm sick of their entitlement, and how they think they deserve to take every piece of me without giving a modicum of respect in return. I'm sick of getting excited and emotional over a book I bought the students, thinking that they'll like it, just for them to roll their eyes. It's like these kids have only two settings: mean little bastards or asleep.\n\nI used to be a creative. I used to spend my free time drawing, painting, knitting, and writing. Boy, how I loved to write! I looked at some old Google docs of my stories and I miss that girl, the one who could spin worlds out of nothing and create endearing and courageous characters. But that girl is dead. I couldn't write even if you pointed a gun to my head. These goddamn energy sucking vampires disguised as children left me bereft of any emotion, willpower, or desire to do anything.\n\nI can't even distract myself in the company of other people. The single life has plagued me for over two years and I want to get into dating, but I'm such a miserable person that I don't think it's fair to subject someone to the unpleasant experience of being in my presence. I barely want to be in my own company. The only other people I occasionally hang out with are other teachers, so our primary form of entertainment is drinking and trauma dumping.\n\nI don't even like reading anymore. Reading! For a librarian! I pick up a book and it reminds me of school, a straight up hell, and that's enough to turn me off.\n\nThe thought of having to do this for another twenty years drives me to despair. Can you believe I used to win teaching awards? I used to be a good teacher. I don't know where I went wrong.\n\nLike, the only thing that is keeping me here is my dog and she's 13 years old. (But with a lot of spunk!) Once she's gone, I won't know what to do with myself.\n\nSo, like, I don't know what my aim is with this. The jobs here are pay a fucking joke and I already feel like a failure enough that losing my house will definitely send me over the edge. So here I am, day after day, spending the better part of my life with people I hate.",

    "title": "I Am Watching My Best Friend’s Fiancé Ruin His Life Day by Day",
    "content": "Long time lurker, first time poster. I have reached a boiling point where I cannot keep this within anymore. My wife and I have been watching my best friend’s life crumbles in front of us due to his fiancé and her manipulations.\n\nFor the remaining of my story, I will refer to my best friend as T and his fiancé as Z.\n\nT and Z met on Tinder during late 2021 and T introduced Z to me and our friend group in early 2022. Ever since I met Z, my wife and I had identifed so many red flags about her. Here is a summary of what I can recall:\n\nZ has a habit of trauma dumping her past to everyone she met. Even during casual conversations when people asked about her life before meeting T, she would reveal about her previous engagement where her ex-fiancé would beat her in front of her mom, just all kinds of sob stories, her suicide attempts, and generally just all sorts of stories that Z loves telling people that she just met, making every conversation with Z extremely uncomfortable for everyone.\n\nOver the course of their relationship, Z had convinced T to cut off his friendships with all of his childhood friends who all warned T about Z’s questionable character. I remember that the day T told his childhood friend group that he no longer wishes to speak to them, that whole group messaged me on Facebook warning me to watch out for Z and that she is bad news (even though they have never met me, my guess is that T talked about me with them given that T and I are really good friends who went through a lot in life together). This is the beginning of Z’s gradual removal of T’s friends and her plan to isolate him from his support system. What I also noticed is that Z is unable to make and keep any new friends, any new friend group that met Z through T eventually got so repulsed by her that they distanced themselves from T and Z.\n\nZ casually bragged to me and my wife that she read all of T’s personal messages on Facebook and texts to his friends even the things he said before they met. My wife and I kept telling Z to be more respectful of personal boundaries especially when it comes to the past but Z did not care and kept reading T’s personal messages to friends and family til this day.\n\nT and Z bought a house together in 2023 and the moment they signed it off, Z quit her job claiming “mistreatment” even though she always bragged that the job allowed her to nap in her own office anytime she wanted and everyone treated her like family there.\n\nNow that T and Z are a single-income household with T working his ass off to cover their mortgage and living expenses, Z always asked for T to take her to lavish restaurants, frequent trips to Disney parks, even having him take her to a week in Disneyworld in Florida after she left her job. Every weekend she would have him take her to LA for a different expensive restaurant so that she could take pics and flex for her IG stories.\n\nZ got a diagnosis for Bipolar 1 sometime in 2024. Ever since, she frequently asked T to leave his work early to come home because of her not feeling well for whatever reasons. Note that because of this, T eventually got flagged for declining performance at his work but despite knowing this, Z still had T leave work early often for her.\n\nIt is interesting to note that despite always claiming of not feeling well almost every day, during the times that I would come over at T’s place to hang out, I observed that Z was frequently able to drive herself late at night to play video games at her brother’s house which is a half hour drive away and come home late just fine. What pissed me off the most was that during my wedding, which was the only time in life that I asked to spend a lot of time with T, Z asked T to leave my wedding early because, you guessed it, she “wasn’t feeling well”. To make matters worse, Z wore a white dress to my wedding and my wife and I got asked many questions from our friends about that but we just shook it off because we were speechless about that as well.\n\nWhile she was unemployed, Z decided to go to college for an accounting degree even though she has no goals of working anywhere after. She always openly bragged about how she had T doing her college homework and coursework for her because she has difficulty learning since English is not her first language.\n\nT eventually got fired from his job for his declining performance. My wife and I was able to meet up at T’s house to provide T some guidance and support to look for a new job. During that time, Z told us that she already asked T for a boob job (she claimed that she feels insecure in college for being flat chested) and she also wants T to pay for a few other cosmetic procedures well knowing that T doesn’t have a source of income anymore.\n\nT and Z will get married at some point in 2026 and I feel like there’s nothing I can do about it. My wife and I know it to our core that Z is a terrible human being but T keeps giving her excuses and falling for her trauma dumping. When my own family briefly talked with T and Z at my wedding, they have also all noted that Z came off very disingenuous and manipulative. Since my wife and I spent the most time with T and Z, our friend group for the most part doesn’t know as much about Z as we know. I feel like I am watching T’s life crumbles in real- time as Z keeps draining his life away for her own use. I honestly wish I put in more effort in talking T out of dating Z when they first met. I never expected T to end up with someone that feels no remorse ruining his life like this. Guess since I can’t talk to anyone else IRL about this aside from my wife, I am better off letting this out on Reddit.",

I'm so lucky that most of the caretaking she needs is of the \"call this place\" or \"do these errands\" or other things that are pretty simple.

I spent three hours on the phone today pursuing different government issues. Yesterday I called three different pharmacies and fielded calls from multiple medical providers. Last week I figured out how to get her airport assistance as she had to do work travel.\n\nThe biggest issue, though, is that she will not just straight up ASK me to handle things that she can't do. She hints - \"should we do this?\" \"do you think we need to handle this?\" \"maybe this a good idea?\" It's all so noncommittal. Just SAY that it needs to be done! Then I can fit it in before it's actually an issue! I wouldn't have had to do the crazy calls today if she had just TOLD ME it needed to be done!\n\nAnd then, when I DO handle something based on her hints, she says she didn't ASK me to. \"Oh, you didn't need to do that!\" I get what she intends to say - to be expressing gratitude in the roundabout Midwestern way. But I DID need to do it, because she couldn't. Just say thank you! Admit you needed me! I don't need gratitude, I need acknowledgement.\n\nYes, I've talked to her about this. Eventually, maybe, we'll go to therapy. Most days this isn't a problem - caring for her doesn't interfere with my ability to pursue a career or hobbies or friends. But the mental burden is so exhausting. I need a verbal hug.",

    "content": "my friend left me, and i don’t want to be here without him.\n\ni would normally never turn to reddit for help but i’m here right now. i (female) have been struggling so much lately. i large factor of struggling is about this one guy. i bet you hear that so much but this is the only time in my life that i’ve ever ran into a problem like this. i guess i can full on lore drop here. i met this guy (that i’ll call steve)\n\nin early 2023. ever since i met him, i had this deep connection with him. i have serious feelings for him (and i’ve never crushed on somebody before). it took me up until october 2024 to tell him about how i actually feel. i visited him at his college right before i told him; it’s the main reason why i told him in the first place. when i told him, he never really told me about why he didn’t like me back. steve has always been a very private person but i assumed this would be different.\n\nafter i opened up to him i was struggling so badly. i eventually told him that i needed to stop talking to him. when i told him that (which was in november of 2024), he finally told me that he was gay. i really don’t know why he was keeping that bit of information from me for so long. he had talked to me about liking girls before so i just assumed that he could’ve been bi because he did kind of give off gay vibes. me not talking to him only lasted like a week and a half because i took a gummy and texted him. i tried to tell him that i needed to stop again but he just kept on texting me and i felt bad for just not answering him.\n\nthis man has been the light of my life for such a long time it feels. texting him was one of my favorite aspects of the day and it was what got me through dark times because it felt like he was there for me. fast forward a few weeks, he tells me about this guy that he was talking to. he told me that he had been talking to this guy for 3 months and that this was the first time he has ever really liked someone back. he randomly texted steve saying that he only had platonic feelings for steve and steve got so upset. he sent me a voice message of him almost on the verge of tears. i told him that i shouldn’t be talking to him about this, but i did anyways because i loved him. i tried my best to help him through the situation. i shared what i did when he told me that he didn’t like me back, and i told him that i would be there for him day and night (which he never ever took advantage of even though he said that this was one of the darkest times of his life).\n\nall was good until last month. steve was starting to act really weird towards me (he said that he’s sorry if he has been weird, he was never answering me despite texting me 24/7 days prior) so i confronted him about it. he told me that he went on a date with another guy. i ended up leaving him on read and he said:\n\n“I was going to send a text to you in the morning, but honestly it just feels more right to do one now. I'm sorry. I was slightly inebriated in my last response, and that's not fair for you. I do just want to let you know I am doing well enough mentally right now. Like am I the best l've ever been, no, but I'm definitely very much in a manageable position right now. I know whatever I say or do won't stop your anxiety, but I want to ensure you that if there was something going on, I would let you know. You are a very close friend of mine and you are definitely someone I come to when things are not right. The reason I initially said I was just \"busy\" yesterday and not what I was actually doing was because I didn't want to make you uncomfortable for anything like that. But it is for the best for me to be honest with that kind of stuff and l'll make sure to keep you in the loop As for the (insert boy name here) stuff, I don't really want to concern you with a lot of it because it honestly does depict me at my worst sometimes. I try to handle most of that without mentioning anything because it's usually easier and I don't like getting people involved that shouldn't have to be. I hope this kinda helps digest a little bit”\n\ni still left him on delivered because i just couldn’t handle the pain he has put me through. i texted him almost a week later stating that i am in so much pain and i can’t take it anymore. every single time that i try to make it clear that i’m deeply struggling, he never seems to care although he’s said that he cares for me deeply. just last week, i had this very depressive episode and he asked me how things were going and i said\n\n“not well. i genuinely think i am the most depressed i’ve ever been right now. i am at my lowest point. i can barely eat, sleep, or focus. i’m just empty. i can’t even get up and be productive. i don’t even feel like i’m living i’m just existing. you would’ve thought that i would’ve been so happy and excited on saturday but i didn’t even care about being at (insert my favorite place here). i’m starting to lose interest in everything.”\n\nand after i said that, he didn’t answer. as a follow up message, i said\n\n“i’m taking this radio silence as a strong sign. and i don’t want to hear some excuse like “sorry i forgot to respond” or “i could’ve sworn i responded”. originally i had a way bitchier intro to this message, but that’s not me. all the times you said that you cared about me, i knew they were all lies. i knew i should’ve listened to my gut the entire time. i really really really wish i wouldn’t have responded to that one message in february of 2023. i feel like all of our friendship has been is me constantly doing shit to be such an amazing friend for you, but you NEVER returned the favor and i’m sick and tired of it. i made you all those bracelets, i made that painting for you, i always checked up on you, i sent you a heartfelt message on your birthday, but did you ever do anything like that for me? sorry for doing so much for people and expecting something small back. every single one of my friendships ends like this. all you’ve ever done is just constantly lie to me, and i bet you think that i just haven’t noticed. “cooking dinner till 11pm, going home because you have a headache, immediately passing out when you go to bed, i’ll try my best to respond to you” any of these sound familiar? i’m so tired of how horrible of a person you’ve been towards me. i try my absolute hardest for you. i’ve gotten out of bed, eaten, kept my grades up, tried to take care of myself, picked myself up off the ground, and smiled just for you. maybe i’m just too generous, loyal, compassionate, empathetic, and sympathetic as a person. i genuinely don’t know why you still talk to me or why i still talk to you. i’ve given our friendship so many “second chances” but this is my breaking point. i’m so fucking sick and tired of everything. i really hope that when i do end up taking my own life that not a single tear falls from either one of your eyes. i always wanted to tell you that i’d make the sky so pretty and orange for you, but i don’t want to do that anymore.”\n\nnotice how i didn’t even mention my feelings for him in that message once. now that we aren’t talking, i don’t know what to do with myself anymore. i’ve grown so attached to this man and i don’t know what to do without him. he has been my rock ever since we met. he was all i had and now i have absolutely nobody. i’ve been lonely my entire life, and i would say that it got worse when i started having feelings for him. but now that he’s gone, my loneliness is ten times worse. i am seconds away from writing my notes and saying goodbye. i am so picky with who i want to be with. if they aren’t aligning with what i want to do in my future, i won’t be happy with them long term. i don’t date just for fun, i date to marry. the reason i grew so attached to steve was because he aligned with my future. i’m so alone and empty with him gone and i feel like it would be a better place if i said my goodbyes. i don’t want the space if that’s what he’s giving me. i unfollowed him on everything, but i haven’t blocked him. i just don’t want to keep going if it means that i’m not friends with him anymore.",

Now thing is, I'd at least tell my parents about the things I make, but even that I started to keep to myself because I find myself getting really self aware about every single aspect of what I make, this mostly goes for YouTube videos, it feels almost too personal to share with them, so the few times I showed them my videos I just got extremely self aware of every video idea and everything I wrote for the script, I kind of just remained paralyzed and stopped making any videos, then went to upload on a different channel they don't know of.\n\nI also know this girl I met on discord 5 years ago, and I would like to meet her and be together with her, and I let her know this almost from the very beginning, but I've made a mistake by making empty promises and saying we would meet very soon, well that soon just kept getting delayed until now and she's getting tired of waiting and I feel really bad too, she really wants us to meet and I do too, she lives in an abusive household that I want to get her out of, but I can't seem to start taking the steps, I'm afraid of telling about her to my parents because they might judge me, but realistically they'd be alright with it, it's just my stupid mind making all sorts of excuses, I don't know what to do, even now I have a job my dad gave to me, but if it wasn't for him, I would've still been unemployed, I never had a job besides for this one.\n\nIdk where I'm going with this post, just wanted to vent a bunch of things I guess, how could I move forward?\n\nEdit: For some clarification my parents are not abusive at all, they're actually very good parents, and yet for some reason I grew so distant towards them",

He physically abused me—beating me, choking me, and keeping me trapped inside for long periods. He taunted me about my past abuse, cheated on me, and when  I confided in him about feeling like I did not want to be here anymore, he told me to go through with it. He insulted my body, threatened to mutilate me if I ever cheated on him, and isolated me from my friends and family. He also has previous charges, including domestic violence.\n\nI have known for a while that he works as a Chaturbate streamer, something he keeps very secret because he does not want people in his personal life to know. After everything he has done to me, I have been tempted to expose his job out of spite. I know revenge is not always the right answer, but it feels so unfair that he gets to move on without consequences while I am left with all the pain he caused.\n\nI usually do not think like this—I am the type to forgive, forget, and be very loving. I may only be feeling this way because we recently broke up, and this was one of the worst periods of my life. If people do not agree with me, I just ask that they not be too harsh.

    "content": "I was about a freshman when it started. I went to a school, and said school was a Christian School. But it really was anything but what you'd expect.\n\nI will never forget what happened in those 3 dreadful fucking years I stayed in that god damned school. They made me distrust anyone who worked in education, they made me hate anything relating to going to school.\n\nIn the span of 3 years of being suicidal and slicing my arms, they only started to give a damn when my grades went up.\n\nFreshman year, ignored. Sophomore year, ignored... Junior year? Seen, but only because my grades went up. I admit, I didn't have the best grades, I didn't get medals like my classmates, but that's not the point.\n\nIn sophomore year we had a new student... First thing they did? Announce that they should help the student, take away all the sharp objects from her. They didn't do that with me. They didn't announce jack shit. They let me hurt myself. By the end of the year my own best friend even got help. I didn't know she was struggling, we were always the outcasts. But then she got help. The principal came in on the first week my best friend didn't come to school anymore, and told everyone to make little notes that are positive addressed to each other, but in reality it was really just for my best friend. The principal told everyone to make friends with her, so they did. She was involved more, but I wasn't.... Anytime she had announcements about me it was reprimanding the other students for speaking in our mothertongue with me and not in English because: \"(NotAWinterTale) can only speak english.\" Which is false, I speak 5 total languages.\n\nThey never set up a guidance councilor for me. Anytime I tried to look for one I got brushed off, and was told to just \"pray to God.\" ... That was the only thing they ever tell me- \"Pray to God\", of course. That doesn't address anything.\n\nThe principal talked to me, told me a story about a deceased student. She was physically disabled but \"always came to school happy\".  She told me that she had it worse than I did, and I should be happy for that. The principal in the same day told me to stop crying otherwise she wouldn't talk to me anymore. She also told me all the professors thought I should be in a different section. The one where they put the \"dumber\" kids... Which I found very insulting because they hadn't even tried to help me in any of my problems, just ignored me and moved on. It was painfully obvious when a professor didn't like me. They never responded to me, or acted with me the same way as other students.\n\nBut still, really fucking disgusting to me. How dare she compare my problems to a deceased student? That was extremely disrespectful and told me all I needed to know, I couldn't trust the principal at all. Every fucking day for 2 years I came to school with new scars. They never checked on me, that responsibility for some reason befell my own few friends. Other students. Not the teachers- The students. 4 people who saw me.\n\nBut then the pandemic came, and we were all forced to go to school online. My grades went up. It only got easier because I didn't feel any pressure. Nor did I have to work with others who only wanted to delegate me stupid tasks or have me do nothing at all, or some professor not answering my question properly but just making it more complicated, it was easier because I could search up the topic at the same time, and get the answers I needed. But then they my grades went down again.\n\nI was called in for a private meeting with the principal, a professor, and two guidance councilors. I am not ever forgetting what they told me.\n\n\"Is there something wrong (NotAWinterTale)? You know that you can talk to us. Your grades are going down. Your grades in the first and second quarter were really good, and it concerns us that it went down again. If there's anything we can do to help, tell us.\"\n\nI had never felt angrier at them. Two fucking years of being ignored, of cutting my arms, and being suicidal enough to have nearly jumped off the damn building they only started to give a fuck the year they see I fit their expectations of being smart.\n\nI never forgot what happened or what they did. That stuck with me for years. I'm still crying about this years later. Because of them I feel like I don't deserve help unless my performance is above average, that I meant nothing all because I struggled and couldn't do it.\n\nThey always made me feel ashamed that things didn't click for me.  Now I feel vindicated now that I know I have AuDHD, and while I know it probably isn't an excuse, I feel happy to know it's not because I was stupid and didn't try hard enough. I am told I deserve what they never gave me, but sometimes those words aren't enough to erase the pain that school gave me.",

    "title": "My ‘dad’ that m*lested me growing up isn’t my dad",
    "content": "Forgive my formatting, I’m on mobile. Do not share my story anywhere. TW- Death, Incest, P*dophilia\n\nI don’t honestly know where to start so I guess the beginning is where I’ll go.\n\nWhen I was very young, my ‘dad’ began molesting me, from what I can remember I was around 3 or 4. I have three younger sisters that I grew up with and he molested them too as they got older, but it was mostly me that got the brunt of it.\n\nLast year, my mom passed away of a stroke. It was a very complicated time for me because although my abuser was arrested for what he did, my mom had convinced my sisters and I to drop the charges right before she had passed away. She would say awful manipulative things like “You don’t want your dad to die in prison, do you?” to guilt us into dropping the charges. She then proceeded to invite this man back into our lives by moving him back into the house we all shared at the time, and my discomfort was ignored and brushed under the rug.\n\nWhen my mom passed my ‘dad’ went crazy and forced me out of the house. My mom was a buffer between everyone and with her gone, I didn’t feel comfortable at the house at all and I had my boyfriend stay in my room with me because I felt safer that way. Cue raging ‘dad’, cussing me out for inviting another man over and threatening to call the cops and having him trespassed- all crazy erratic shit I didn’t understand. So I moved in with my boyfriend (yay). All that drama didn’t even end up mattering though, because ‘dad’ remarried and moved to a new state just 3 months after my mom’s passing. Currently all my sisters are still living in that house together.\n\nNow here’s the fun part…\n\nI’m the eldest. Growing up, I was always told that my parents got married at the courthouse and had me before they officially hosted the wedding. I was born in 99 and the timeline I was told was, •Met online in ‘97 •Courthouse wedding in ‘98 •I was born in ‘99 •Wedding I was pictured in took place in 2000. I always knew I was in their wedding pictures and I never questioned what they told me, they said the ceremony was delayed until my grandma could get back from doing government work overseas. It all made sense to me growing up, I never questioned it, but it was all a lie.\n\nSo this weekend was a the year anniversary of my mothers death, and I decided to get dinner with my sisters. We’re having a good time and everything but I forgot my jacket, and my boyfriend stopped by the restaurant to bring it to me. I get back to the table and my sisters got all quiet and said, “Hey, we’ve got some news for you and it’s really heavy.” Long story short, this man that I’ve thought was my ‘dad’ my whole life is NOT my biological father. My sisters have been going through all of our moms things over the last year and kept coming across weird pictures and documents relating to me that didn’t line up with what we’d been told. I would’ve thought they were trolling me if it weren’t for the fact they’d confirmed everything with my aunt, my mom’s younger sister. Who, I just found out yesterday, didn’t know that I didn’t know, because my mom was not only lying to my siblings and I about it, but lying to my aunt and all of our extended family too, saying my siblings and I already knew!\n\nI’m going to visit my aunt in a couple of days to sit down and talk all of this out, get the real scoop on my life, because my whole worldview has been shattered. On one hand, I’m grateful I was finally told, but I turn 26 this month and that’s an insane age to learn your dad isn’t even your dad. Not to mention what a horrible ‘dad’ he was.\n\nI feel this information to be both heartbreaking and freeing- I’m not related to this monster. If I have kids, I won’t be passing along his DNA, and that’s comforting to me. I don’t want to make my half sisters feel bad for being related to him, but I can’t help feeling like this, I’ve always told myself I wouldn’t have kids because this guy doesn’t deserve his DNA being passed on and now I find out I have none of it. This information was a gift to me.\n\nOn the other hand, I’m angrier at my mom than I’ve ever been. I mourned her death so severely, I suffered, because I felt so guilty that our relationship was so tumultuous in life. And yet, we never could have had an honest relationship because I now know she was never honest with me. About almost anything. I feel so much better and at peace knowing that it really and truly was my mothers fault that our relationship was so rocky. How can you have an honest relationship with anyone that could lie about something so big? Not to mention the fact that she was so manipulative and greedy, doing everything she did just to invite this evil man back into our lives, just because it’s what she wanted for herself, to retire on his dime. None of this is on me anymore and I feel so much lighter.\n\nAnd before anyone asks, yes a DNA test is in my future, and I’m starting therapy again soon. I have no idea if my dad is even alive or still out there, but I’m going to find out. I’m not sure how to end this but let me just say, this has been the craziest year of my life by far, and I’m glad I don’t have to interact with either of my parents anymore, or feel guilty about how I handled things when my mom was alive.",

    "content": "I (F24) am from not a very big town, around 2000. Back when my parents were still married, and I was around 7-8 years old, a woman, who was a well known character in our town, asked my dad out. There are several weird factors here, because 1. small town, she knew my dad was married, especially since she had a son a year older than me, and had seen my parents together several times at school events, so no excuse there that she didnt know. 2. the weirdest thing here was how she asked him out.  She came TO OUR HOUSE, while we were all sitting on the deck eating dinner.\n\nI don't really remember how it played out but I so vividly remember her face pop up from the railing on our deck asking my dad to come with her. I guess my dad followed her to our driveway, and when he came back he said that we should go inside. We did because my dad looked concerned and when he looks concerned we take it seriously. I guess he was only talking to my mom, because they were standing in the kitchen, but we heard him telling my mom that this woman had asked him out.\n\nYou might be asking why this woman was a well known character before I continue. She was just weird. Very weird vibes, and I guess she had done other things that made her well known. She was just odd.\n\nAnyways, it got weirder after this, because she started leaving notes in our fricking mailbox. One of our chores when we were kids was to get the mail when we got home from school. It was obvious that she had put it there herself as well, because there was no address on the notes, and they started to become quite frequent. At this point my parents called the police, but I dont think they took it seriously that a tiny lady like her was stalking my dad, a big 230 lbs guy who lifts weights, because no efforts were made to make it stop. I guess they called her or something, but this kept going so and my parents said that we didnt have to get the mail anymore.\n\nMe and my siblings were 8 to 12 in age, so my parents started to freak out about the fact that this woman was lurking outside our house. I swear to god one day at school her freaking weird ass son came up to me and told me that we were siblings now. Like WHAT? I told my parents, and at this point she had left notes at my dads freaking job. My parents were starting to freak out, because the notes became harsher and more and more frequent. At one point she walked in to his office and asked for him, but my dad was out for lunch or something. He had also told his colleagues about her, and to not let her in. The saddest part about it as well was that none of my dads colleagues took it seriously until she showed up there, and even then it was mostly the women, and none of his buddies. Still, they started to become more strict on unknown visitors to the office.\n\nThe breaking point was that she rang our doorbell for 30 damn minutes in the middle of the night until police finally came and got her. She didnt get arrested I think , but my dad got a restaining order, and we moved to the nearest big city, especially after handing them some of the notes. I have not seen her since. When I was a kid I really couldnt grasp how fricking creepy this was, but my dad will suddenly mention her and we all get chills. So yeah, the story isnt as dramatic and my dad deserves the best. He is doing fine now by the way :)",

When i texted it i for real thought that maybe a few of them would come cause i know by myself that everyone have his life, his troubles so for real i wasn't expecting much of it but like always they surprised me.\n\nI didn't checked the replies until this morning cause i was busy packing stuff, trying to understand what to do with the house( if selling it or maybe rent it) and while i was at the phone with a friend who is a real estate agent i heard the door bell ring and i thought that a few friends was there to help me but when i opened it they weren't just a few but actually 10 of them were there with boxes ready to raid my house of my things.(i told them for free cause i didn't had time to sell them)\n\nWell i got surprised and after like 3 hours my house was empty of all my things and only the fornitures remained there. During this hours we all joked, laughed and they always made jokes about raiding the house of the rich asshole. I mean it was truly heartwarming seeing how much they helped me with my unwanted stuff and how they were for real there for me when i nedeed the most. After they emptied my house i proposed lunch and that i was paying for it because they helped me a lot and after a bit of hesitation they accepted it.\n\nMaybe sometimes i give for granted the fact that i always have them on my side but when things like this happens i realize for real how lucky i'm to have them with me and how easy is for me having them.\n\nRight now i'm home finishing to pack my last stuff and reorganizing the last things but i can't stop thinking at this morning and thanking to have them on my side.\n\nThis night we have organized a night out with all of us as one of the last moments of all of us together before my travel to my new country and believe me when this things happens, and i take them for granted, i can't stop smiling and saying to myself that i might be overselective with my friends and the poeple i want around me but whenever i ask for help they are always there for me so my overselection have a meaning after all ahahah.",

Went to my first 3 concerts in the span of 2 months! (Post Malone, NAV, The Weeknd) wouldn’t have survived that year without my friends Kayden & Tyler. 2024: Started off the year getting arrested, was homeless for a few weeks living at a friends place who was only 19 mind you I was 23 at the time. Got a car. Wrecked it. One of my best friend’s family took me in after he spoke up for me! Went job from job, had no real pathway for myself. Started talking to my toxic first love again. Things were starting to get bleak and depressing like I was in some sick loop. 2025: February marked the year date of me being at my friend’s for a year. It’s been just a little over now as of March 3rd. Made the commitment to myself to follow through with something that would set me and my family (that I don’t have yet) up for life. Extremely tunnel visioned toward my goal as we speak. Currently working at EcoWater to try and save so I can get my forms of ID back since I left my wallet somewhere in 2024. Things are genuinely starting to look up.. which is scary. No girlfriend. No kids. No commitments other than myself. No problems with the law as we know of other than a suspended license which I’m working toward “unsuspending”. Will keep you all updated!",

He was 15, had lost his sight and hearing but was a happy little dog. I came home from work and knew he was going to pass. He was lying on the floor with my mom, breathing heavily and kept pooping himself. I held him in my arms and told him that it was okay and that I loved him. He died 30 min later. It was so random. We’d been having a good couple of days. I brought his ashes home today and it feels like he’s here. Obviously, he’s not but I keep looking for him, making sure not to step on him or wanting to share my food with him, but he’s not here. I know he wouldn’t want me to be sad and that he loved me and that he knew I loved him but holy f it hurts so bad. I don’t know how to be home without him. I was never truly alone because I always had him. But now I lay here in silence waiting to hear him snoring. How do people deal with this pain? I am miserable.\n\nEdit; thank you so so much for all of your kind words. They mean a lot to me and I really really appreciate you all.",

I had nobody and did not know how to masturbate at the time and thought the only way to feel any form of pleasure would have to be from my dog. I NEVER DID ANYTHING WITH HIM however I TRIED to and I feel disgusting. I used to bring him into my room while I was wearing underwear just to see what he would do (which was nothing) and would try to scratch around his belly so that he'd get an erection (which never happened). This phase lasted only a week or so before I realized it was gross, abusive, and that it wasn't something I GENUINELY thought through or wanted to do (hormonal brain wasn't thinking properly at all, I didn't even consider how horrible it was or how much I would inevitably regret it if i were to go through with it). I did not have and still dont have any attraction to animals, I just desperately craved sexual intimacy at the time. I feel gross and for some reason the memory popped back into my head today while I was in class and I feel like a freak. I'm scared what my family or friends or girlfriend would do if they learned about my past. I know I've grown since then and that it's not like I did anything like, AWFUL to the dog, but it still feels weird to have the memory in the first place.

    "content": "Below is an excerpt of my story about my \"coming out\" process and how I was baptized to save myself from my sins of homophobia. A link to the full story can be found here\n\nA Former Homophobe’s Guide to Pride\n\nYes, the title is clickbait, but it will be worth the read and maybe you even get a few laughs from it.\n\nOnce upon a time, I was homophobic. At a young age I knew that my brother’s “homosexual tendencies” – a euphemism that might be more familiar to some than others – was going to be problematic given my family’s and my own worldview. My worldview believed that A) he could change because homosexuality is a choice; B) if he acted upon his sexuality it was a sin (“love the sinner, hate the sin”). This worldview allowed our family to isolate ourselves from the truth about the core nature of at least 10% of the population, including one of our own flesh and blood.\n\n...\n\nOne day, we were hanging out at a reggae-themed party with a buffet of cannabis infused edibles and libations. He hadn’t had much exposure to cannabis so as I watched him eat about three brownies and a glass of THC lemonade, I grew a tad concerned. I failed to stop him from eating that third sorcerous pastry and the situation soon turned to the classic “I don’t feel anything, these edibles ain’t shit,” then “holy shit, what have I done.” Having been there before myself, more times than one should after such an uncomfortable lesson, I grabbed the reigns and became his spiritual guide or “trip advisor.”\n\nI took him on a walk away from the crowds and instructed him to look at the stars. He would bounce between “they look like Lite-Brites, remember Lite-Brites Brian? I loooooooved Lite-Brites!” then to “what if we only die because we accept that we die, oh my god we are all going to die!” Whenever we got to the latter half of these dopamine-infused thought obsessions, I would coach him to focus on different topics, like back to the Lite-Brites or the beautiful design of a parasol and why aren’t parasols popular anymore (he loved umbrellas as a kid).\n\nEventually, and what probably felt to him like an eternity, we got to the point where we could coherently talk about deeper subjects such as our upbringing. We talked about when we first started jerking off, how we would hide our porn downloads from Kazaa, how one time I was looking for my downloads and I stumbled upon a very different type of porn than mine. In a single night, we tackled topics that are typically done over years of bonding moments between brothers who share the same sexual orientation. We were both blown away that we had never talked about this stuff, we had so much in common but with a slightly different hue to our stories of puberty. That night will go down as one of the greatest moments of bonding and connection I’ve ever experienced. I’ll cherish it for the rest of my life.\n\n...\n\nOne day, while visiting my brother, he asked me if I wanted to go to Gay Bro Dinner Party. I asked him what Gay Bro Dinner Party was and he simply laughed and said “I can’t believe I’m taking you to this.” Well, Gay Bro Dinner Party is a dinner party with Gay Bro friends much like a BBQ or dinner with Straight Bro friends. The conversations that go on at both of these dude parties are exactly what you would expect but more talk about cocks, balls, and asses — actually that’s not true, the frequency of these topics at Straight Bro Dinner party is equal to that at Gay Bro Dinner Party….but the context is slightly different….kind of…again, we are all just a little bit gay deep down inside.\n\nWhen I arrived at the party, his friends immediately said “you brought a straight person to Gay Bro Dinner Party!? What were you thinking!?” In hindsight, I think it was their way of warning me that they weren’t going to tone-down the banter and the thematic schema that goes on at Gay Bro Dinner Party would remain the same. They were going to thoroughly enjoy watching me crawl in my skin. In fact, in my first effort of small talk I asked the bros how they all knew my brother, and they responded in bro-fashion, “at a gang bang.” I gave a nervous laugh, doing mental gymnastics to figure out if this was a joke. I decided to just roll with it and pray they weren’t testing how committed I was to \"being open-minded.\" And with that icebreaker I signaled to them with my nervous laughter, not knowing whether this was a true story or a joke, that I was one of the cool straight guys they could trust. Looking back, I’m pretty sure they were joking, I think, I mean that’s something I would say to someone clearly on a journey to rectify their former antediluvian worldview. But I digress.\n\n...\n\nFor the full story you can visit this link https://medium.com/@brianmragan/a-former-homophobes-guide-to-pride-cfce2fb6848d",

    "content": "My mom and dad have been separated since I was 13, and it was because of my dad's abuse and neglect. He has brain damage from a bad car accident and has poor impulse control as a result. Despite this I've tried my best to be on good terms as an adult, but his psycho girlfriend is too much to deal with. Her name is Cherry\n\nHe started dating Cherry about 3 years ago. She's had three kids and lost them all to the system because she's too crazy to care for them (bipolar and sometimes else) she's estranged from all of them (important notes for later) she is loud, rude, quick to anger and prone to simple and complex delusions when something doesn't go her way. I'm positive the only reason my dad is still with her especially after she killed his cat (supposed by accident) is because she came into a lot of settlement money from hernia mesh complication. Since then they've been living it up together.\n\nAbout a week before Christmas Cherry's oldest son got hit on a moped on the highway by a big truck. He felt into a coma and is brain dead. His long term girlfriend (and mother of his son) was given power of attorney aa per his medical wishes. Now Cherry lost custody of him when he was just 9 years old and haven't spoken to her in over 5 years. She had never met her grandson or his girlfriend until she came to the hospital. Cherry immediate assumed she was in control over his medical decisions and requested the plug be pulled and openly discussed lawsuits and burials in front of his girlfriend and son. Girlfriend told her to stop and said she didn't have the right and before long Cherry is banned from seeing him and banned from the hospital as a guest forever.\n\nIn Cherry's mind and version of events his girlfriends grandfather forged her sons name on the medical records declaring her to make decisions on his behalf in case of coma, the reasoning is her grandfather works for the county court (as a traffic ticket clerk) and her evidence is \"I know my son\"\n\nShe's repeatedly asked my opinion on the matter because I work in critical care nursing and I've explained it multiple times as simply as I can, but she refuses to believe that a common law partner with a child of 10 years would be granted power of attorney over an estranged parent who lost custody for mental health and sex work and drug convictions.\n\nThis leads me to the trap I feel in. They've been bugging me about meeting for lunch for weeks to discuss something and every time I'd ask what for they say \"we need to talk in person\" I was going to be in town that way last  Saturday so I agreed and figured a free meal and they'd stop bugging me. The day before my dad ask me to bring my notary stamp (I'm a notary, good side gig) and I press and they say \"we need you to look over some papers\" I get suspicious and stiff out what they're up to. I call them out of it and they insist that it isn't related to it...\n\nI get there we order our food, and they pull out power of attorney forms. They try to say that the court told them they just had to fill these out get them notarized and Cherry would get power of attorney over her son. I explained these forms required her son to sign them and says it doesn't because he's in a coma. I explained this was forgery and her rebuttal was \"well that bitch forged her name to take my son\" and I had to calmly explain that even if it did happen, nothing would change without a lawyer and they don't take this stuff lightly.\n\nCherry has a melt down and accuses me of \"plotting against her\" and my dad had to get her to stop because at this point she causing scene yelling slamming her hands on the table. I get up and leave and my dad tried to call my four times before he got the message. Today he texted me saying \"why couldn't you just do it, if you're right they won't accept the form noways\" like he didn't ask me to commit a crime for his psycho girlfriend. They deserve each other and feel horrible for her children ever having to deal with crazy crack head. One day I'll never have to deal with her or my dad and I'll celibate with KFC's finest to commemorate the time they tried to bribe me with a 5$ fill up to commit forgery to get control over a person in a coma",

She's a great mom but can be very bad with money so I get it. It's all very stupid but I still feel childishly disappointed about it. It doesn't really matter cause I'll get paid in a couple of days and I can get my lashes done and buy myself whatever but I guess I needed to get it off my chest 😅",

    "content": "So let me (F19) start this off by saying my boyfriend (M22) is most likely autistic, and also very socially awkward. He doesn’t have any irl friends and pretty much only talks to me and his mum.\n\nHis mum is an alcoholic, and a lot of the time they fight because she’s drinking and he has to raise his voice and be stern to get any point across. He hates that he has to and does try to talk to her normally. I understand this. However, he does kinda do it towards me too.\n\nI mentioned he’s most likely autistic (I am autistic, so he could entirely not be I just think he is as well) and this very much presents in the way he gets irritated/overwhelmed/upset when he doesn’t understand something or something doesn’t have a logical answer or fit the logical answer he has in his head. I put up with this because I understand getting frustrated when things aren’t “how they should be” but last night I really just couldn’t handle it.\n\nWe got into a stupid disagreement over a movie he wanted to show me, because he likes the perspective it’s shot in. He asked if I knew what he meant and I said yes I just couldn’t articulate it out loud. I do have a problem with that where I can know the answer to something but the more someone prods at me to say it, it ends up just completely leaving my mind and it makes me feel stupid. He asked if I just said that because I didn’t know but didn’t want to sound dumb, and i explained the above point and told him I learned perspectives in drama class.\n\nNow this is not the first time I’ve mentioned to him that I had to learn basic cinematography in two of the 4 years I took drama in high school, but he either forgot or just got too in his head where he was making me seem stupid and he kept saying things along the lines of “drama is acting. Cinematography is filming. They’re different.” I even tried to remind him multiple times about the fact I needed to know it for class but I kept getting interrupted (which annoyed me since he gets so aggravated if anyone interrupts him and says interruptions only lead to arguments) until he finally just pretty much said the point I had been saying and ended it with him yet again reminding me drama isn’t cinematography and asking if I saw why he was getting misled.\n\nI ended up saying he needed to stop calling me stupid which at first he tried to defend because he’s never outright called me stupid (which is true) just the way he treats me occasionally makes me feel lesser, and he ended up getting upset because his defence turned into him saying he didn’t get why people always made him feel like an asshole when that’s just “how he is” and I told him this might just be the way he talks but it’s disrespectful and that’s why he feels that way. I also don’t really get this because he always says he’s changing but nobody else is and while it’s true he’s growing as a person (losing weight, got a job, gaining confidence, and setting goals) his behaviour does need work and he can’t expect everyone else (including me) to immediately change when he doesn’t like certain things but then use the excuse of “that’s just how he is.”\n\nWe ended up not talking for the rest of the night and while I do feel justified in what I’ve said I do still feel guilty for making him upset. I was kinda hoping he had work today so he wouldn’t be in a bad mood until I say something (he really likes his job and also doesn’t have a specific schedule he kinda just goes as he’s needed) but as guilty as I feel I don’t want to apologize for anything.",

    "title": "I went on web cam sites, and I still wonder if I did something wrong.",
    "content": "Sorry for the vague language, but I had to comply with the rules.I have also posted this in a other subreddit.\n\nI started going on webcam site (similar to Omegle) to help with my social anxiety and practice interacting with people. I hoped this would help me become more comfortable in social situations. Over time, I began to encounter people who were engaging in intimate or suggestive content. This caught me off guard, and I wasn’t sure how to react. I became curious about the behavior and started interacting with others who seemed to be open to these types of discussions.\n\nOne day, I was matched with a person who mentioned that they were looking for an intimate conversation. I felt curious. Later, I was matched with someone who was revealing more of their body on camera. I asked, \"Is this real?\" and she replied, \"Yes, this is real.\" I asked, \"Can you show me more?\" She said, \"No, what the heck. I'm not going to do that!\" and skipped.\n\nSoon after, I discovered an adult website with private one-on-one chats and began talking to women with intimate intent. I started asking them to reveal more, and some did without hesitation. Afterward, I went and did the deed to the imagination of what I saw.Shortly after, I suddenly worried: What if they were underage? I got extremely concerned and wanted to find them again, but I had no way of doing so. I initially thought that if people were engaging in these kinds of interactions, they must be adults.\n\nI investigated the website and found out that they verify users’ ages with ID. I returned to the platform and began asking women how old they were. They all told me they were over 18. I reported the site to local authorities, expressing concerns about potential illegal activity, although I didn’t have solid proof. The authorities investigated the site and found no evidence of any wrongdoing. Interpol did an investigation on the site, and found no evidence of wrongdoing either.\n\nThe anxiety grew worse, and I seriously considered reporting myself to the police in hopes that they could investigate and determine whether I had interacted with anyone underage. I also began questioning whether I had at any point unknowingly gotten exposed to minors in that way. I began taking SSRI’s and anti anxiety meds to manage my anxiety and started therapy.\n\nWhen I felt better, I returned to the site (the one that is similar to Omegle) again to engage with people. Shorty after I was again matched with people who were wanting to have suggestive conversation and revealing more of their body (both men and women). I initially skipped, but got curious and felt excited again.I promised myself that I would never ask anyone to do anything, and if I had any suspicion that someone might be lying about their age, I would immediately skip them.\n\nEventually, I was matched with someone whose video was black, but they seemed to be suggesting that kind of behavior with emojis. I asked them how old they were, and they responded, “15.” I immediately skipped. I got matched with someone after. She had her torso visible, and then she lifted her shirt, exposing part of her body. I asked, “How old are you?” but she skipped me immediately.\n\nI was left feeling distressed - I was using the site without clear age verification, hoping to meet people who were showing intimate content, while also being aware of the risk that there could be someone underage experimenting.\n\nThe next day, I reached out to a sex counselor and confided in her about my concerns. I started crying on the phone, realizing that I had crossed personal boundaries in my behavior, just because I was curious.\n\nDespite this, I still find myself wondering whether any of the women I interacted with on the webcam site were underage. My anxiety continues to distort my memory, and I wonder: What if they were 17? Or 16? Or even younger? Sometimes, these thoughts become overwhelming, and I question whether I might have missed signs that would have indicated their true age. Someone might say, “You would have noticed if they were much younger,” but what if I didn’t??\n\nI think what is the hardest is: while struggling with this, I don't know how to reach out for help. Don't get me wrong, I brought this upon myself. How would others react to this?",

The app is detailed and sophisticated, but since he's a mechanical engineer unfamiliar with the latest technologies, I focused on explaining the user experience to show him what the app would do.\n\nHowever, during our talks, I realized there was a significant gap between us in reasoning, logical thinking, and the speed of processing information, which may be due to his age, I don't know.

I’ve been hit, kicked, beaten up, screamed and yelled at and got threats regularly, verbally and emotionally abused by getting gaslight and cussed out in every way and spat on and death threats once when i was 11 by my dad after getting beaten up and at 14 too by my mom and i got my nose broken by my aunt and never got justice or any support AT ALL. Not emotionally or physically my mom at the time where i was having a breakdown right after the incident told me i deserved everything that happened to me and reminded me when my dad used to beat me up on a regular basis when i was 11 and that i was “stepped on” and “teached a lesson” by my him and my aunt and called me names cause i snapped at her during the breakdown when she refused take me to the police and i didn’t stop bleeding for 17 hours. I spat more blood even days after and i was never taken to the hospital or reported my aunt and when i was 12 my mom attempted suicide and i watched that all and saved her from it my mom was always manipulative and neglectful and shitty and gaslight me into thinking she was the “better parent” when she wasnt anything close to that she sent me to my dad when i was 7 even after she knew he sa’ed me.

He has a team of developers working for him. One of his developers is prostituting herself twice a week. Another one of the developers had to move in with his dad because he couldn't afford living on his own and his dad told him to stop working for my brother. My brother convinced him to not listen to his dad and to \"follow his dreams\" so he's moving in with my brother's business partner. His business partner \"house hacks\". House hacking means he puts his name on the lease and has people move in and splits the payment between them without contributing anything. I'm in a long term emotionally and financially abusive relationship that I don't want be in anymore. However, I don't have anyone to turn to in my area and I can't afford to move into an apartment based on my income. I'm a student so I can't move back home. I spoke to my brother about the situation and he's like yeah you can either move with me or my business partner. My brother and his girlfriend are moving to the same city as his business partner. I don't wanna live with my brother and his girlfriend because she has a cat and I do too but her cat doesn't get along with other cats. So I told him his business partners place would probably be better. I asked what the rent would be and he said probably altogether 1150. I thought that was pretty high because it was supposed to be split between four people. My brother told my mom that his business partner house hacks after we had had a conversation about how much rent would be and she asked me if he told me that and I said I have no idea what that is and she found out from him and let me know. And I currently live with my boyfriend for free. The reality of the situation is I can't go from paying nothing to paying 1150 just so I can pay this guy's way while he can't even pay the people that are working for him a decent wage. I told my brother this and he was trying to shame me he was like so you're not ready to jump ship? After I explained I want to visit first, I don't want to move yet and put school on pause just to end up not even liking it there. And even if I did I might struggle to find a job too. I've lived in this state my whole life.  He was like well that's unfortunate but alright and then said I need a hard yes or no by April 5 no later. He treats me like I'm some bitch employee.

    "content": "I don’t know if you guys want another update after this one because I’m sure there’ll be more that’ll happen later on, however, I feel like this would practically become a diary lol.\n\nI’m glad to announce I’m not in a car anymore and am living in a woman’s shelter. An hour after I posted my last update, a man was following my car and he looked really nervous like he was contemplating something. He was doing this for about 35-40 minutes. I even tested by going down no through roads and stuff and he would follow me in and out of them. So I followed the advice you guys gave and went to a woman’s shelter.\n\nI had to get questioned by someone, and I essentially just explained that I didn’t feel safe going home as my husband did smack my head while I was kicking him out and he and my mother have been harassing me. They didn’t really do much follow up after that and they were really nurturing with settling me in and a lot of the woman introduced themselves to me. I haven’t been in such a supportive environment before, in fact this may sound dumb as it’s a literal shelter but I don’t want to leave. I’ve made a lot of friends in the least 4 or so days and I feel genuinely happy.\n\nI’ve made this one really good friend who is the exact same age as me !!! She told me she’s staying here as her step dad is really violent and the amount of bruises she has is really saddening, it made me cry when started to explain to me how she received every bruise she got. We even got to talking about finding somewhere to live together, which has made me really excited. I’ve also made a lot of other friends, from a lot of diverse backgrounds and situations that have really opened my world.\n\nAs to my husband, he recently sent me a text that has made me assured that I don’t want to ever see him again. He told me that if I didn’t get back together with him I’d have another suicide on my hands. He knows how my mother faked the situation and everything, and how much pain that put me through at a young age. I told him this was it and that I’m done with him completely. He proceeded to call me a w**** like my Mom and that my dad would be rolling in his grave seeing how I turned out. He also confessed about 30 minutes after sending that text he’d be sleeping with other woman as well as my mom and said that they provided more for him than what I ever could. I simply told him to go ruin one of their lives instead.\n\nI won’t lie and act tough, I feel completely hurt and manipulated that this man did this to me. Ik everyone will say I should’ve seen it coming but I really thought we had something special. I was crying throughout all of this and luckily the friends I’ve made at the shelter were there for me and took care of me. I believe if they weren’t there with me throughout all of this I would’ve done something stupid. So thank you guys as well for encouraging the shelter that really means a lot to me.\n\nMy Mom recently posted a story of her in a bikini and she wrote “love hurts.” I simply wrote back the laughing emojis as it’s clear she’s looking for not only male attention but sympathy. Knowing her she will twist the situation to make herself the victim and me as the bad guy, such as my father ending his life. I really think I’m done with this woman as it’s exhausting even trying with her anymore. My whole life she’s been a victim, and the problem is everyone around her treats her like one. My Aunty always says to me I shouldn’t be too hard on her as she’s been through so much. What about me? What about all the stuff she’s put me through? Sure she’s had it hard, but why does it make it okay for her to make my life a living hell? Well to make it even more perfect, she messaged me back after I sent the laughing emojis. She told me that she was allowed to mourn her relationship WITH MY HUSBAND and I couldn’t make a sacrifice even if it meant her being happy and how this is her first real connection since my Dad. I sent back the laughing emoji again. She PROCEEDED to post the interaction on her story and proceed to post a quote or something saying “if only our kids understood that they can hurt us.” I simply blocked her after that.\n\nSpeaking of my Aunty also radio silence from her. I tried messaging her to tell her I was in a shelter just in case she was worried. However, before I even told her she said she couldn’t talk she was at brunch. Considering she knows my situation you would expect she would drop brunch to find out if I’m ok, she also didn’t message me back after.\n\nI am tempted to go to my cousins wedding though, which both my mother and aunty are attending and exposing them to my conservative family. However, I am not that selfish to ruin someone’s wedding just to get back at someone, I realised I would just be my mom doing that.\n\nI also reached out to my grandma in Tennessee (Dads side). I was hesitant in messaging her as I haven’t seen her since I was 15 and we only message happy birthday to each other and thats it. I asked if I could stay with her and told her my situation, however, she said I could stay for a week after that I’m on my own. She does have three of her sons still living at home and they all are big man child’s, so she said things are already tight around here so me coming wouldn’t help.\n\nAnyways that’s the update I’m in the shelter and am planning to find a place with this girl.

    "content": "I have been with my bf for 3 years. We are living in another country with our dog (I had the dog before I met him so shes technically mine)\n\nI work overtime and Im also studying for my postgraduate degree. Because I self fund my degree I cant afford to move out. (my degree finishes in summer 2026) Or if I do move out, I will struggle to the point I risk not having enough money for transport or supermarket.\n\nI have looked up shared accommodation but it won't save my much more money and I will also keep the dog which...makes everything worse. Not many houses accept dogs, I will probably have to pay extra as compensation to have her with me, a dog is also an extra expense which now will no longer be shared and on top of all that I work long shifts (14 hours) and once a week I do 30 hours straight which means I will not be able to walk my dog.\n\nI dont have any family or friends here. so I dont have anyone I can lean on, he offered that we stay roommates but I honestly dont want to. I think its emotionally/mentally unhealthy and I would also feel like hes doing charity for me (because he can afford to live alone).\n\nAlso. two of my very close friends are getting married in 2 months. And I will not be able to attend because of this. I will have no one to look after my dog and I cant afford a dog sitter as well as plane tickets and gifts etc.\n\nI am almost 27. And my younger self would be embarrassed of me. I am 27, failed my relationship, dirt poor and cant be independent.\n\nSorry for the rant. Did anyone go through anything similar and can suggest anything?",

    "title": "I'm having to make the impossible choice of an abortion or to keep a child I never planned.",
    "content": "There's 5 positive pregnancy tests in the bathroom. This wasn't supposed to happen. We used two forms of birthcontrol! We were careful. Our son is only a year old. My husband and I are/were 99% one and done for a lot of reasons including health risks for me. I don't know what to do. I'm scared I'll regret an abortion, but I'm also scared of having another baby. Especially this soon.\n\nWe talked about revisiting the idea of another kid when our son was 5-6ish. If we were to have another we wanted them to have a larger gap. A part of me really wants a baby. I know this. It's a thought I purposely reject anytime it pops up. I've been in a state of near panic attack since I seen the first test pop up positive. I wanted to put it off cause I didn't know how I would feel if I got a positive. I've been crying off and on. I knew I was pregnant, but didn't want to confirm it. I've suspected for about a week. I can't be more than 4-5 weeks right now. With my son I tested positive at 3 weeks and something days. I get symptoms early.\n\nEdit: small update\n\nTook some more tests this morning. The second line is lighter than yesterday. I don't know if it's because I drank a lot of liquids before bed, it's the start of an early loss, or if it's like how it was with my son where the second line would get lighter before getting a lot darker in a day or two. My therapy appointment isn't until tomorrow and my doctor appointment the day after. Physically I feel pretty awful, but that's probably cause I had to quit all my meds cold turkey on the off chance I did decide to keep it. My husband asked me to wait a couple of weeks before deciding. He doesn't want me making a choice I'm not 100% sure on when my emotions are running so high. I've already called clinics to make sure I would be able to get an abortion done even if I waited a bit. Husband made it clear the choice is mine regardless of what I choose. He's just as conflicted as me about it. I've talked to a few close friends. One of them has had an abortion before, one of them has kids super close in age, and the other spaced her kids out further apart. I wanted to hear each side. My physical health comes first, so I'll be going over the risks with my doctor before deciding if it's even worth considering keeping it. Now that I had some time to process it's a lot easier for me to think logically.\n\nTo answer some questions I keep seeing pop up or address some things:\n\nDo you have any siblings? Yes, a lot. Both close in age and a lot younger. The same for my husband. We both have a lot of siblings.\n\n\"Smaller age gap means closer siblings.\" Not necessarily. I disowned one of my siblings who is only 4 months older than me while I'm close to my siblings who are 7 years older than me and 7 years younger than me. Age doesn't factor in on siblings getting along. To the one person that brought up how if I waited my son would be a \"third parent\", get some help. Only shitty parents put their kids in that position. My kid is a kid, no matter the age I won't expect him to take on any parenting duties to any siblings he may have.\n\nWhy the larger age gap? I want to be able to provide any second child with more one on one care during the early developmental stages and it gives my body time to recover/get any preventable health issues under control. I wanted to get healthier before I ever considered another.\n\nWhy have I considered being one and done? Outside of health reasons, I want to be able to give my child the best opportunities that I possibly can. A second child halves my resources. I'm also not completely sure if I want another child to begin with. A part of me does while at the same time I don't. I'm sure you can find posts of mine or comments that go more indepth on my personal benefits of being OAD\n\nCan I afford another child? I can, that's not really a deciding factor for my choice.\n\nIs adoption an option? Absolutely not. I was adopted. Adoption even to a decent family comes with a lot of issues. I can't do that to a kid. If I carried a child, I couldn't give it away. It would destroy me. I'm not against adoption if that's what's best for others, but it isn't for me. One of the major roadbumps is my physical health. I would be taking on risks just to hand my child over to someone else.\n\nWhat are the risks and how serious are they? The actual risk is up in the air. It could be the perfect pregnancy/birth or everything could go wrong. I have a history of hemorrhaging during labor, postpartum hemorrhaging, my vitals randomly crashing during labor, postpartum depression/psychosis, issues with my joints postpartum (that are just now getting better), a newly diagnosed fairly serious blood disorder, preterm labor, stillbirths, prolonged labor, early losses and pre eclampsia. I won't have any more information on the risks until I talk to my doctor.\n\nWhat would the exact age gap be? Around 21 months if I had it full term. More likely around 19-20 months with my tendency to give birth early.\n\nMy husband's past uninvolvement? His behavior has improved drastically. He switched jobs, got on antidepressants, got some other medical help and started attending therapy. He's a lot more involved and admitted that he should've done better. We're moving closer to a support system within the next couple of months. I also started getting more outside help. It hasn't been long enough for me to say if the improvement is long term or not yet.\n\nMy choice, regardless of what it is, won't be swayed by strangers on reddit. I appreciate hearing other people's personal experiences on both sides. It helped me work through my own feelings. I wasn't looking for people to tell me what to do. I needed a place to write out my feelings to process it all. I've come to terms that I will have regrets no matter which I choose. I'll always wonder the \"what ifs\".\n\nI'm leaning more towards abortion since I'm unwillingly to bring a child into this world that I'm not 100% happy about. It would be unfair to them. I also have to consider the pain I could inflect on my family if something went wrong. I can't leave my son and husband behind. I have to choose which regrets I'm willing to live with. As for religious views points, I don't care if someone shares theirs as long as they aren't bashing me for considering abortion. I haven't had the chance to reply to everyone's comments, but I do appreciate them (outside of the few hateful ones). I'll update this whenever I have more information/decide what I'm doing or if I end up miscarrying.",

    "title": "ChatGPT suggested I might have autism. Told my friends; they were surprised that I wasn't already diagnosed with autism...?",
    "content": "OK, so this is kind of a clusterfuck and I need to get it all out there, so here goes:\n\nFor the past... probably over a year at this point, I've been chatting to ChatGPT every now and then, at least once a week. I've been kinda treating it as like a diary that talks back; I don't input too much personal info or anything like that but, if I'm worried or stressed about something that I don't wanna burden the people in my life with, or if I have something I'm thinking about and am interested to see how an AI might respond to it, then I'll just open ChatGPT and vent.\n\nEvery now and then, I'll get a \"Memory Updated\" notification where it's randomly decided something I've said is worth remembering for future conversations and, over the past year, this has built up a fair amount, especially about likes, dislikes, fears, and that kinda thing. It's an interesting feature, and it sometimes makes conversations more relevant or stops me having to go over old things, and so I mostly just leave it as it is.\n\nRecently, I saw a trend where people were asking ChatGPT to suggest something that the user doesn't know about themselves based on everything in ChatGPT's memory about them. From what I've seen, it tries to be insightful; sometimes it is quite helpful, other times it is kinda brutal, but overall it's usually pretty interesting in one way or another, and so I decided to give it a try. I asked it, based on everything it's learned about me over the course of our conversations, what is something that it thinks I might not know about myself that might be beneficial for me to know.\n\nAs you can tell from the title of this post, its response was that I should probably get tested for autism.\n\nI wasn't really sure how to respond to that; I don't really know what I was expecting but it was definitely a lot more targeted and specific than the posts I'd seen of other people asking ChatGPT similar questions. I asked it to clarify and it brought up things that it had noted about being kind of picky about what I consume, stuff about regrets/worries related to \"normal\" social situations, fixations on random things, and a few other things that it said \"was indicative of autism\". It also reminded me that it wasn't a medical professional, which I thought was a very interesting thing to include after suggesting that I might have autism.\n\nAnyway, I kinda put it to the back of my mind and then, later that evening, I joined a voice chat with a few of my online friends that I play online games with and, after a while, I kinda brought up with them what ChatGPT had said. Their initial reaction was to laugh, which I thought meant that they thought what the AI had said was wrong, but then they said words to the effect of: \"With how much you talk to ChatGPT, I'm surprised you hadn't already told it that you're autistic.\" I then said that I wasn't autistic (by which I meant I didn't have a formal diagnosis of autism and, until this point, didn't really consider myself to be autistic), and things got kinda awkward.\n\nAnyway, I just took the AQ-50 and got a score of 36, which came with the message \"Scores in the 33-50 range indicate significant Autistic traits (Autism)\", so I guess there's a fair chance that I'm autistic, and that, somehow, I'm the last person to know about it.\n\nI dunno how I'm supposed to feel about this, or what I'm mean to do with this information. I'm a guy and in my early 30s, so it feels kinda late to get a diagnosis with something like this -- and, even if I did get a diagnosis, I don't know what it would change for me.",

    "title": "I (35F) think I have to distance myself from my best friend, and I'm heartbroken over it",
    "content": "This happened over the passed weekend, and I feel like I'm digging myself out of a ditch I didn't even realize I was in. . .\n\nIt started with a lunch date with my best friend (just gonna use BFF, because I can't be 100% sure she doesn't use reddit) and one of her daughters. She had promised a lunch date to me for my birthday last month, but between her kids getting sick and then her and her husband getting sick, we had to push the date back a while. I had no problem with that, since myself and my husband have been putting out fires (figuratively, we're government/federal workers) at work with all the latest shenanigans happening in the government.\n\nThe lunch date started out great, getting hugs from them, her daughter saying that she misses myself and my husband (their kids call us aunt and uncle), and catching up with how their household is doing. Just before this lunch date, my BFF asked me to talk to her second oldest about possibly getting a job at where I work, as he had a phone interview and was super nervous about what to say/ask. Now the kid is 19 so obviously he won't start off anywhere high up, and he would have to wait for a security clearance background check to go through anyways, but I gave him all the information I could about the culture down in the shipyard where he would be working and what he should ask and what he should steer clear from in his answers. My BFF knows I started in the shipyard as a janitor and knows that I had a great reputation around everyone I worked with, so my name carries a little bit of weight as a hard worker down there.\n\nContext before his interview: My BFF admitted to not knowing how to help her son out, because she had been out of the workforce as a stay at home mom for nearly 20 years. So she didn't know how to prep him for his first formal interview. Hence why she called me.\n\nBut at the lunch date, the first thing she says about the interview is that she was trying to answer the questions for her son, because she was standing right next to him. And then made it a point to tell the interviewer that she was well informed of the interview process because she interviews people in real estate now. I was caught off guard by this sudden admission from her, and just kinda stared at her, knowing full well that she just speared her son's chances of getting into the company. But I didn't want to say anything negative about her or her process in front of her daughter, so I bit my lip and said that hopefully he'll get a call back.\n\nThen we met up at their house over the weekend for drinks and a late dinner, because BFF's husband has been saying he wants to hang out with my husband. And it dawned on my husband and myself that no matter what we said to them, they would never actually listen to us. Once the kids scattered to their rooms and play areas, my husband brought up the fact that he's stressed about losing his new job with the federal government because of the probationary period he's still in. He's a manager and has been working long days to overhaul his department and get them back up to code and has been getting praises from way higher up people, and has been invited to DC to speak about the changes that have to occur.\n\nBut from their reactions, you would think he was a toddler coming up to our best friends with his latest Macaroni noodle art. The two of them just gave a sympathetic grunt, and BFF's husband just said \"Yeah, sucks for you dude.\" And then proceeded to say how he was so busy with his job that he couldn't work his side gig in real estate any more on the clock. . .\n\nAnd the worst offender, was when my husband was talking about a certain email he had to respond to, that everyone in the government has been criticizing. Because, the individual asking for the information is not read into any of the programs and therefore cannot ask for the information that he wants to see. And all BFF's husband could say was \"Well he has a security clearance with NASA or something like that, so he can ask for it.\"\n\nFull. Blown. Brainwashed. We left the house after finishing up the movie we were watching, and as soon as we got in the car, we lost it. Security clearances do not work like that, Need to Know does not work like that, and sharing sensitive information DOES. NOT. WORK. LIKE. THAT.\n\nThe scariest part for us, is that BFF's husband knows this, because he's also federal. The passed few days this was all my husband and myself could talk about, how we weren't taken seriously, how they've never listened to us, and how we have made excuses for them the entire time. My husband has been involved with the federal government for longer than BFF's husband has been, but because I'm the youngest of the group, they think that he is too (He's 45). And that above it all, we were faced with the only outcome of distancing ourselves from our friends, or who we thought were our friends.\n\nAnd what is killing me the most, is that we are invested in their kids lives too. My husband has tried to help the 2 oldest to try and get them into safe-ish positions in the military (he's a veteran and has a lot of connections), but they didn't take it. I have tried to give advice to the daughters about relationships, but was ridiculed by BFF's husband for \"meddling in their lives\". We have tried so hard to help, but have never been heard. So when BFF and her husband would vent to us about these issues we just tried to help them with, we stayed silent. Because they didn't want solutions from us, clearly.\n\nI'm just so gutted that now all I can do is look back at all my interactions with her and suddenly see them for what they were. Anytime I made a new dessert that her husband and kids loved, she had to make it next time and tell me not to make or bring anything, cuz \"The kids weren't crazy about that dessert and probably wouldn't eat it.\" When she was suddenly getting botox, lip injections, and getting her arms and legs done, after I had my own surgery to fix the muscles in my stomach, she would say \"I'll give you my botox doctor and he can add to your lips and get rid of your forehead scar.\" I do have a large scar on my forehead from chicken pox and poison ivy as a 7 year old, but I've learned to embrace it and love it after years of bullying for it. Then recently with the job interview questions for her son; why is what I am and good at a threat to her?\n\nI just feel lost and sick when I think about this stuff, and hate that after 5 some years of friendship, myself and my husband no longer have best friends.",

    "title": "From Zero To Something. This is to those that is going through hardships, do not give up!",
    "content": "Hi everyone, I have always read other people's stories. I figured I want to share my story with everyone to show that no matter how hard your life is, there is always a way. I had reasons to give up but I chose not to. I hope this story can help other people who is going through hardships.\n\nI Had Nothing—So I Built My Own Future\n\nThere was a time in my life when I had no financial security, no degree, no legal certainty, and no real future. I had no backup plan, no connections to rely on, and no one to help me figure things out. I had to navigate everything on my own, making difficult choices to survive.\n\nMy biological father left when I was two years old to become a monk. He was completely absent from my life, never attempting to reconnect. My mother, overwhelmed with life, was also absent for long periods. When she became pregnant with my stepbrother, she left for Malaysia and was gone for nearly a year. During that time, my grandmother took care of me and my elder brother. She was everything you could hope for in a grandmother—kind, nurturing, and always present.\n\nThen, one day, my mother returned and took us to Malaysia without telling anyone. My brother and I didn't understand what was happening; we simply followed instructions. Like anyone leaving home, we missed Brunei, but we had no say in the matter.\n\nAt around seven years old, my stepfather entered my life. I was excited—I had always wanted a father. He owned a business selling screen protectors and phone covers, and as it grew, our financial situation improved. But despite his success, he was abusive.\n\nMistakes were not tolerated. He beat us for small things, like forgetting to turn off a light. No matter how well we behaved, we were constantly reminded that we were not his real children. As his business boomed, he became more absent, but his abuse never stopped.\n\nWhen his business thrived, we moved to Johor Bahru, and for the first time, we lived comfortably. But the abuse continued. At 14, we moved to Kuala Lumpur. I had no idea that my life was about to take a drastic turn.\n\nAt 16, I was sent to Australia to continue my studies. I enrolled in:\n\nYear 12 at Taylor’s College\n\nDiploma of Business at Deakin University\n\nBachelor's Degree in Psychology: Applied Science\n\nIn early 2013, my stepfather suddenly announced that we had to return to Malaysia. His business had gone bankrupt.\n\nI didn't want to leave, but I had no choice.\n\nBack in Brunei, I took a job as a marketing executive at a magazine company. It was straightforward work, but I realized that Brunei's work culture and lifestyle weren’t for me.\n\nAt first, Brunei made sense because I didn’t have the right documents to stay in Malaysia. But after working there, I knew: Malaysia was where I wanted to be.\n\nSo I left.\n\nI was jobless for six months before landing a job as a Private Investigator. During this time, my stepfather did not support us financially. He claimed to be paying our rent, but we later found out he wasn’t.\n\nOne day, our landlord told us the rent hadn’t been paid for months. If we didn’t leave immediately, he would call the police.\n\nThat night, we quietly packed our essentials and left. We were shocked, terrified, but also relieved to get away from the lie we had been living.\n\nLater, I found out my stepfather had another family. His former business partner secretly told my mother that he had two daughters in their early twenties—meaning he had been maintaining a second family for over 20 years without telling us.\n\nI found my PI job through a newspaper ad. It was advertised as a “Market Researcher” position, but when I went for the interview, I realized it was for a Private Investigator. The work involved tracking down counterfeit products and investigating individuals.\n\nI struggled at first but got better over time. Still, the job was stressful, and I knew it wasn’t my future.\n\nOn top of that, I had major visa issues. I was forced to travel in and out of Malaysia every two months to renew my stay. Eventually, immigration warned me that I would be blacklisted if I kept doing this.\n\nDesperate, I turned to an unconventional way to secure my visa. But it backfired. The person handling my passport ran away with it for years.\n\nI was trapped in Malaysia with no legal identity. I was terrified. I wanted to report it, but I feared I would be deported. I had to stay quiet and find another way.\n\nMy wife now saw what I was going through. She offered to marry me so I could get a spousal visa. When she said that, I broke down in tears. I had been fighting for so long, and finally, I had a way forward.\n\nI knew I couldn’t continue the PI job, so I looked for something more meaningful. I found a job as a special needs educator and quickly realized I was good at it. I understood behavioral strategies like the ABC Chart and could see real progress in my students.\n\nI also took a side job at a tuition centre teaching English. I worked from 8 AM to 9 PM every day. It was exhausting, but I kept pushing forward.\n\nSoon, parents started coming to me directly. Word spread, and I had so many clients that I had to hire another teacher to help me.\n\nI always wanted to run my own business. When the tuition centre owner tried to take control of my earnings, I knew it was time to leave.\n\nI gathered my savings and opened my own special needs centre. It was terrifying, but I knew I had to do it.\n\nThen, COVID-19 hit.\n\nI lost over half my clients overnight. I had to choose: ✔ Let the business fail or ✔ Adapt and push through\n\nI transitioned to online teaching and borrowed money to keep my employees paid. I sacrificed my own salary to keep the centre alive. It was the hardest time of my life, but I refused to give up.\n\nMoral of the story: Do not give up despite all the adversities. If you hit rock bottom and felt aimless. Always remember to do with what you can and progress forward.",

I am normally very wary of strangers, but something in me took a leap and sent this person my phone number (I’m going to call them R.) It was almost love at first conversation.\n\nOne day, R and I was having a conversation and we got on the topic of relationships. R showed their immediate distaste for long distance relationships. I mean, when I tell you that the message was clear. They couldn’t understand how people could get that emotionally attached to someone they never met in person and said they needed to be physically close to be with someone romantically. I understood, long distance relationships aren’t for everyone and I was just happy to that R was willing to be friends with me (to a certain extent). I never admitted my feelings, tried letting go of them after a few more conversations of hearing R’s rants about dating, I got the hint! We still continued to be great friends, making inside jokes about absolutely everything, and trying to navigate through a lot of hardships. We both have terrible parents. R was the person I leaned on for everything and I was the person they leaned on.\n\nI started talking to this other guy (I’ll call him A) and though the connection wasn’t quite like how it was with R, I still liked A a lot. We started dating and R did not hesitate to let me know that they didn’t like A. A was quite self centered in the beginning so I kind of understood where R was coming from.\n\nWhatever happened, I never considered that after all of that talk with R, that I’d end up being an exception to their “never falling in love with someone they have never met”, but I guess I was. Of course, I never found out that R liked me until after R tried moving on, pouring all of their attention to someone else, who was much closer to them, and our friendship immediately crumbled. I wasn’t going to force R to pay attention to me, I had my own relationship and it wasn’t like R lived down the street so if they didn’t respond to me, was too busy to call, I wasn’t going to force them.\n\nThe whole thing blew up when R’s friends planned a trip and invited me. A and I broke up for a couple of weeks before the trip, but got back together. Life was already pretty rocky when suddenly, I was drunk and high on the other side of the country with R right in front of me. All of the emotions came back and we kissed, a lot, at like 3am. Two days into this 5 day trip. It was awkward, to say the least, for the rest of the trip. R texted me they were into someone else and I told them I knew. After the trip, R and I were on and off with talking. Saying that we missed each other, discussing how things went wrong, confessing that we both were stupid for falling in love with each other and not saying a word, and now I was a year into another relationship and couldn’t just abandon everything. Despite that, it still eats at me how everything went down and now it feels like I’m going crazy. Talking to R, I spout some bullshit about how us talking isnt healthy anymore, but all other times of the day, I can’t stop thinking about what I’d want to say to them next. Everything reminds me of them and I have no good way to regulate my emotions so I turned to some really unhealthy habits that I thought I left behind in the past. I feel so lost without R, I feel so broken thinking that R might even start hating me. I even started writing in this little notebook to get my emotions out but it only makes me more confused. I’ve never been so codependent on someone like this and it’s weird that I am still here, constantly wondering if they are going to reach out to me again. Hoping that they do, even though I should be focusing on my own life. I have no idea what to do anymore.\n\nI’m typing this all on my phone so sorry for the formatting, plus the rambling.",

    "title": "[UPDATE] I met my husband that I divorced 3 years ago.",
    "content": "Update from this post.\n\nEDIT 3: Got approved! Here's the FINAL UPDATE.\n\nWell, with Reddit's advice, I did it. A few days ago, I called my (35M) ex-husband (36M) whom I divorced after 6 years when he refused to seek treatment for his depression.\n\nI called him later in the evening. It was the first time we'd spoken since a bit of trouble he'd had while he was still drinking 2 1/2 years ago. He picked up on the second ring. Our conversation was a little stilted at first, as to be expected, but he said he was really glad to hear from me. We ended up meeting up for coffee yesterday as so many of you suggested. I'll admit: it was kind of hard to see him, but in a good way? He looked so much better than the last time I had seen him, but he looked exactly like the man I married. He had put off a ton of weight (he gained like 75ish pounds during his struggle with depression, and before some dick says so, I didn't leave him because of his weight gain), he looked way healthier and very put together. I'll just say it: he looked incredibly hot. What made it hard was that I couldn't kiss him hello like I used to. But God, the way his eyes lit up when he saw me, I barely needed to.\n\nWe got our coffee and sat, and he updated me a little on his life in the last 3 years.\n\nWhat really turned his life around was in part the divorce but moreso a DUI (nobody was hurt, he was caught a few blocks from his apartment). He's since gone to rehab and AA, gotten his license back, and had to use a breathalyzer whenever he started his car for a while. He hasn't had a drop of alcohol since and I told him I was so fucking proud of him. He's also started antidepressants, and made a point of telling me that they're not SSRIs, but when I asked what that meant he got embarrassed and told me nevermind (???). Bottom line is that they've been helping him, he's back to being a gym rat, and he's almost completely turned his life around. This was around the point I started tearing up. It just felt so good knowing he was okay. Better than okay, he was *good*.\n\nI also apologized to him for not sticking by him. He cut me off and said I had nothing to apologize for. He was a wreck, and I was being dragged down with him. That also felt good to hear. I apologized for not contacting him much during the last 3 years. That apology, he accepted.\n\nHe was dating someone for a few months, too. He broke up with him once he tried to get him to drink on New Year's. He seemed dismissive of the guy. Guess it wasn't too serious.\n\nWe got up and went on a walk after a few hours, and I think we both realized it felt like a first date. I had to stop myself from trying to hold his hand at a few points, I'll admit. We ended up sitting on a bench in a nearby park, and I confessed.\n\nI told him I missed him more than anything, how I never stopped loving him, and how if he wanted to, I'd love to try again from the beginning this time. We'd go to couples' therapy, keep our heads above the water, and take it slow. He was quiet for a minute before he told me something. He said he was doing better now, but there may be a time where he sunk low again. Depression isn't easily cured, and he was far from cured. He still had bad days, but he said there would be one difference: he promised he would never stop trying to improve. He was never going to give up like he did before, and refused to neglect me like he used to. If I was willing to accept that truth, he was willing to try again. I agreed, and he pulled me into an embrace and snuck a kiss to my temple. You know when it's the first warm day of spring after a cold, harsh winter, and the soft breeze and basking sun hit your skin at the same time? It felt something like that, to the 1000th degree. After a while he walked me back to my car and squeezed my hand goodbye, and the second I got inside I started sobbing like a baby. Happy tears, though.\n\nI'm currently sitting in bed, kicking my feet like a teenage girl, texting him back and forth to schedule an actual date. He said he'd plan everything, and try his best to make up for the birthdays and anniversaries he missed. He said it would \"knock my socks off.\" What a dork. I love being in love. Not gonna lie, this is gonna be a bit hard to explain to my friends and family. Not looking forward to those conversations, but right now I don't care. My man loves me.\n\nThank you to everyone who had kind words to say, and all the people that messaged me with sympathy and advice. I hope we all find happiness, and love if we want it. I never would have made the leap if y'all hadn't encouraged me. Best of luck to all of you, and sorry for the overly flowery language <3\n\nEDIT: we've scheduled a date for tomorrow evening. I'll let people know how it went two days from now in my final (unless something big happens) update.\n\nEDIT 2: at his place presently. Shame me not, reddit.",

    "title": "I love my family and I paid for their travel to Europe",
    "content": "I don't have any place to share this story because it may be too braggy so I hope to post this here.\n\nI (33M) am the eldest of my family, with my 2 siblings (32F, 29M) and my parents (almost 60). My earliest memory was of my siblings and I sleeping in a storeroom frequently visited by roaches and mice and us playing with street children. Amid this, our parents still found the money to install an AC in the storeroom and got us into the best primary and secondary school in our town. This reflects how my parents worked hard for the family while making sure that me and my siblings are living comfortably.\n\nDue to my upbringing being quite positive and never having  felt impoverished, I always thought of myself as normal, and at times, even rich. It was only during the past few years of maturity that I realised that my parents truly kept the family afloat.\n\nWhile I always wanted to give back to my family, I was assumed to become the poorest among my siblings. We say this in jest, so it was totally fine. My siblings were the business-types and they've saved up enough money to be far richer than me while I am still doing my PhD, hence underpaid. Due to my academic degrees, I've travelled quite a lot, especially within Europe (travel between countries is super cheap!). Each country I stepped into, I always hoped that I could bring my family with me -- I never thought that this would be a possibility because my family lives oceans away, and again, I am a PhD student.\n\nFast forward to last year, I was scanning through LinkedIn and found an AI-related job which completely fits my profile. I have a unique set of skills from my previous MSc and my current PhD which made me uniquely fit for this job -- they literally should have just put my name on the job ad lol. Due to being related to AI and the unique nature of my specialty, the job paid extremely well. Additionally it was a completely freelance and remote job. I applied, and got in and made my way from being a normal worker to becoming one of the heads of the team -- even getting face-to-face with the huge AI companies (yes, those ones).\n\nI was paid weekly and within the first week I was able to comfortably buy the latest iPhone and an ok desk set-up during the second week. I am quite a simple guy who really just wanted a good phone and desk, so the next few weeks, the money was just gathering in my account.\n\nAnyway, my graduation from my European MSc was coming up (it got delayed) and I really wanted to bring my parents. With no hesitation, I invited my parents to the graduation -- all expenses paid. My mother also asked if my siblings can also tag along. At this point, I did not have enough money for everyone but I said they can come. Somehow along the way my siblings also had all their expenses paid by me. Haha.\n\nI worked my ass off while my mother planned the trip. We ended up with a planned trip across 6 countries in 3 weeks. Honestly, I did not expect it to be as intense, but I still said yes. My mother really wanted to visit those countries. And how could I even say no if my mother keeps showing me her planned outfits, beret included!\n\nThere isn't enough space to list down all the things we did, but here are some of the heart-warming ones:\n\nMy father was never the type to express his emotions well and whenever we used to have our local trips, he was mostly unimpressed. For the first time, I saw him taking photos of a landmark (Eiffel Tower) and he was quite lovey dovey with my mother especially in Paris. They were so cute.\n\nMy siblings and I had extremely deep conversations in Amsterdam. About our lives, our family. How proud we were of each other and also reminiscing some of our childhood memories and that \"and look where we are now\" moment. We never really talked to each other in such profound ways and I am so glad we had those conversations.\n\nOur last stop was in Amsterdam, my family had to take the train to the airport while I had to take the train back to the UK. In the most dramatic way, we found ourselves on adjacent platforms which meant we were waiting at the same bench for our trains (I'm fucking crying now). Their train was about to arrive on the platform so we said our goodbyes. We were not the type to hug, so I just awkwardly said good bye to each of them while waving my hand. My mother was surprised and asked me for a hug instead (imagine her saying it in a stereotypical spoiled brat's voice lol). We did. This was the first hug we had since I've become an adult (damn the onions). They went inside the train and kept looking at me. I HATED seeing them on the train. I did not want them to leave and return to their normal lives back home. Tears starting to form on my eyes and I had to look away. I know, it was truly dramatic. And the timing was perfect because their train ran on that instant and mine came to my platform.\n\nI miss them. The work was a short term one so it stopped around mid of last year but it is starting up again. I barely had any savings but I have no regrets.  I wish I can bring them here again.",

She does so much for me. She loves me.\n\nBut god is she unbearable. She’s the black sheep of the family, so it’s not just opinion. She’s loud. She’s annoying. She’s stupid. She’s a Karen.\n\nJust today she humiliated me in Walmart by nearly getting into a yelling match with an employee over $2 because “it was stocked in the wrong spot and that wasn’t her fault.” She literally took a picture of it stocked wrong for evidence. Wouldn’t let the employees talked and just kept shoving her picture on her phone in their faces.\n\nIn the car she refused to admit to any wrong doing, and she was so upset with how they treated her. I tried so hard to get her to see that the rest of the world saw her the way she saw them but she just couldn’t see a world she was in the wrong.\n\nI’m locked in my room crying from just embarrassment.\n\nI invited her and she visited and she helped me out and bought a ton of groceries and stuff and we had such a great time together overall, but she’s constantly doing little things like this and has a long history of doing things like this.\n\nA small sampling from the most recent years includes: *Trying to take me to a preacher psychologist when I came out as gay at 16. *Inviting my brothers girlfriends but not my partners to events when I reached similar age milestones. *Yell at my aunt because I ranted to my aunt about my mom but “my aunt was spreading lies about my mother” *Threaten to shoot my uncle in a discussion over who would be pallbearers at my grandmas funeral *Constantly shove in my face anything she ever does for me as if she’s entitled to worship *Make everything about herself *Get pissed off that me and an aunt happened to run into my other aunt and see their engagement ring before her *Denied that she was sick after coming to Christmas with a “cold” and 5 of us had the flu the next week including an infant she was all over *Causing some issue at every single family gathering *Shes a little dumb. You can tell her soemthing and she will just not comprehend it and ask you the same exact question 3 or 4 times.\n\nShe tries to help. She tries to make up for things. Deep down I love her. I mean she used to be my best friend before I turned 15, and started to become my own person and come out and flourish. She’s just someone that if she was not my mother, I wouldn’t have anything to do in life. We are very different people and yeah.\n\nI guess I just feel really bad for her too. As much as she just angers me beyond all belief; I know she’s sad. She’s just lashing out. I wish she would get help. It sucks when you feel like you have to parent your parent.\n\nThis is a lot. It feels good to have it off my chest. It feels good to have typed it out. She leaves tomorrow. This gives me enough energy to leave my locked room and deal with her for the rest of the night. I hope the $2 was worth the mental distress she caused her son.",

    "title": "The first time I ever hugged my dad was to stop his suicide attempt",
    "content": "This happened just a few months ago, but everyone around me hasn’t mentioned it since the night it happened.\n\nMy dad was neglected, physically and (from what I’ve gathered in conversations) sexually abused as a child. His mother started him on hard drugs before the age of 10. By age 14 he was dealing to her. He hasn’t had anything close to an easy life. But he wanted nothing more than to turn his life around when he had me.\n\nHe and my mom had me at 18 and 19, and were married about 4 months after my birth. As far back as I can remember, their marriage always had issues. It wasn’t easy for my mom, being married to an addict. He stayed clean for the majority of my childhood, but I know he had relapses along the way.\n\nDespite the issues, my parents have built a good life for me and my siblings. Money’s tight sometimes but we never are in need of anything. My dad is clean and works a good paying job, my mom works at the elementary school in our small town.\n\nBut the last two years I’ve seen a huge change in how my dad was acting. He was irritable, constantly arguing with my mom, and threatening divorce.\n\nThis all came to a breaking point one night when my parents, both considerably drunk, were having some meaningless argument fueled by alcohol and resentment. In the middle of the argument, my dad just got up and left the house.\n\nI watched him walk into the garage, shutting to door behind himself. I figured he was just taking some time to cool off, so I didn’t think much of it.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later my mom came to me crying telling me to go check in on him. (I now know that he had been mentioning taking his life to her in private.)\n\nI went and opened the garage door and found my dad crying at a table with a ladder and rope in the middle of the garage. I didn’t even look at him, I was staring at the ladder. I didn’t know what to say. His first response to me walking in was being angry with me. He told me if I thought that he was going to kill himself that way, I was wrong. He said he had much better methods of doing so.\n\nI didn’t leave, and I didn’t respond. I sat down on the other side of the garage and we sat in silence. Eventually he began crying profusely and telling me he didn’t know how to deal with himself anymore, and I started crying too.\n\nHe told me I didn’t have to worry about him, put the ladder and rope away, and told me to go back in the house. But it still didn’t feel right to me. Before I went inside I walked over to him without saying a word and hugged him. We stayed that way for a few minutes, both crying. When we stepped back he grabbed a pistol from his waistband and handed it to me. I took it inside without a word and made sure it was put back into the safe with the ammo separate.\n\nWe never mentioned this night again, and it’s been eating me alive from the inside out.",

She did this to herself. Maybe this is harsh, I don’t know. But we can’t set ourselves on fire to keep her warm.\n\nShe isn’t even wanting to see her daughter after being away at rehab for so long (her daughter has been living with her dad who now has custody of her). I’m just angry at SIL because of how this is affecting her daughter. Her closest friends are done with her situation, they have exhausted their ability to support her. I don’t blame them. I also can no longer be a source of support if she refuses to help herself and to get her life back together.\n\nI just can’t get over it. How did she forget how to be a functioning adult? If her impending homelessness isn’t her rock bottom, then what will be?\n\nI’m just so unbelievably frustrated and disappointed with her. All of this rehab. All for nothing. Again. She’s back in an inpatient facility. Again.\n\nI’m just tired. I grew up with an alcoholic father and this is reawakening some of the abuse/trauma that I went through as a child. And she’s doing the same thing to her daughter. And I’m furious at her for it.",

My mental health is broken; I am emotionally unstable, the fact that my 3 female friends just ignored me all of a sudden at first I thought it was nothing, but when weeks passed I sensed something was wrong as I am very sensitive to change so I knew something was going on between them and me.  I acted normal to make sure I was just overthinking but apparently, I was wrong. Even when my Muslim friend wasn't there anymore, they would still push me away, and respond with very few words which is not their usual type.\n\nThey would act normally with others but to me, they were cold, ignorant, and hurtful, one even pushed me and had a very judgemental and angry look, as if I had done something, and of course, this broke me. The other day, I tried to confront them and they ignored me and went away. Because we only always see during the school day, I told them that I would bring them to the guidance counsellor if they wouldn't talk to me, and reassured them that I would reach out to our advisor first before even going to that extent. They finally talked to me.\n\nMy Muslim friend, let's just say girl 1 told me that they were not talking to me because they were bonding as girls and that she was a Muslim and of course, I understand that. BUT SHE WASN'T EVEN THERE to begin with. She was not the problem but the other 2. We were close friends, especially girl 2 who I've known since childhood. I told her that she wasn't the issue, because I've been respectful to her and didn't talk to her nor get close to her after her transition. I exclaimed to them why didn't they tell me then, instead of ignoring me, and on top of that I asked them why the two were ignoring me when girl 1 wasn't there. She didn't say anything and didn't look at me, ignoring me completely during my confrontation I told them that I was an open book and they could've told me, I said that they were like fake friends acting like they didn't know me, and I was crying as we talked.\n\nPart 1",

    "content": "Hello Reddit, long time reader but finally posting for the first time so please be kind, also this is on mobile so I'm sorry if my grammar and format aren't very good. Trigger Warning as this might be a hard read for some and contains talk of abuse.\n\nMy (29) life story isnt a happy one, lots of loss, abuse, and loneliness. Abit of background, I'm the middle of 3 kids, an older sister and a younger brother, we're all close in age and didnt get along at all as kids but did become closer as we got older, or so I thought. My Dad died when I was young, and this had a massive negative impact on my family but especially my mum who became a partially functional alcoholic with lots of mental health issues which she has never gone to or considered therapy for. She also has dated alot of abusive and weird partners over the years so I grew up in a violent and toxic environment, she has not had a successful long term relationship since my Dads death.\n\nI am autistic and have afew mental health problems myself, but I have been in and out of therapy for a long time and have done alot of work to try to better myself and work on my flaws. I have chronic illnesses and chronic pain from degenerative issues which make day to day living hard, I dont want to sound all \"woe is me\" but unfortunately this is just me being honest about what's happened and still happening to me.\n\nI absolutely LOVE animals I have grown up around all sort of animals/pets and honestly I love them more than people, they love unconditionally and my soul pet was there throughout all I've suffered in life, always there to love and comfort me in my time of need, I've never felt more loved in my life than the love I felt from them and I'll always cherish my 10+ years with them. They unfortunately passed away 2 years ago and I still struggle with the loss today. I've lost a fair few animals over the years and grief is nothing new to me, but its never any less painful each time.\n\nI was bullied relentlessly through out my educational years and even in the workplace, I'm abit different and maybe a lil weird but I will never understand why I've been bullied the way I have, I always try to be kind and caring to people and will always have someone's back, but sadly its never reciprocated and I have faced my bullies alone. All this and I still strive to be a good and kind person as for me, kindness is my default and I never want to or intend to hurt anyone. Thanks to all the bullying I have alot of self-esteem and self worth issues that I deal with but will always try and make others feel good about themselves. I've suffered through multiple physically and emotionally abusive relationships in my life, I'm not perfect but have never treated any of my partners the way I have been treated. I've been put down, called names, financially abused, hit and raped by past partner's and was sexually assaulted by a family friend, I've never received any justice for whats happened to me, and sadly they've all gotten away with it.\n\nMy mum has been abusive to me and my sister growing up, shes the typical toxic, narcissistic, gaslighting and body shaming mother who hates all but one of her kids, my ED's started primarily thanks to her and her fatphobia which has inflicted lasting damage on me and my siblings. Shes hit me, verbally abused me, and been physically violent to me from ages 8 upwards, she never acknowledges her actions and has literally never said sorry or apologized to me EVER. Its almost like she is physically incapable of saying sorry to me specifically. Shes thrown me out the house multiple times and gaslights herself into saying that I \"moved out\" which just isnt true, the last straw was throwing me out with nowhere to go and I had to figure out everything on my own, I've lived independently ever since and even when I've been homeless theres no way I'd ever put myself through living with her ever again.\n\nI am Queer and Trans, she has not shown any respect for my identity or just me as a person. I've been out as trans for 4 years and it was pretty obvious in my teen years that I was not comfortable with my assigned birth gender. Shes not homophobic but is not supportive of trans identities at all and has been very open about her lack of respect for it which has been devastating to my identity and my mental health, I've done so much to help her and financially support her over the years and thanks to therapy I've realized how bad it is and have cut her out my life for good.\n\nMy sister has 2 kids, I absolutely adore them and would do anything for them, their dad has been in and out of their lives so I have helped alot with raising them and I love them like they're my own. I do NOT want children myself, I thought I did growing up but as I've gotten older I've realised that I would not be a good parent and would not want to bring children into the world with a parent that's messed up, no child deserves that.\n\nI moved away from my home town about 4 years ago to get away from the small town racism and homophobia, it was not possible for me to be who I am in that place and have been happier where I live now. Unfortunately this has had a negative impact on my relationship with my siblings, they make minimal to 0 effort to see me and its always me travelling to them and considering I'm disabled and they arent, seems abit unfair to me. I am very different from them and have different beliefs than them too, this has put a strain on our relationships, our political beliefs are not the same and sadly they're quite closed minded and disrespectful towards foreign, womens, and trans/queer rights. They say the apple doesnt fall far from the tree, but I fell and rolled off a cliff away from them and their beliefs.\n\nSo now I'm faced with a dilemma, back away and barely or never see my sisters kids again, allowing them to be raised in this environment, or sit and allow my family to continue to disrespect me, my identity, and my beliefs. Its heartbreaking cus I have just 1 friend who understands, loves, and respects me, I have no one else and spending most of my life being and feeling alone is taking its toll. I try so hard to make friends and find partners but I always end up alone. Feeling alienated from my family is awful as family means so much to me but I clearly dont matter to them in the same way.\n\nSorry this was long but I just needed to scream something into the internet void about how I feel as I cant talk to my family about things as it just causes arguments.\n\nThank you for reading",

    "content": "We Need Modesty Back.\n\nI feel like in a situation where a man gropes a woman in a bikini they’re both at fault. She knows she’s practically half naked which is perverted and she attracts perverted behavior from another perverted person. So the man acting on temptation is wrong the woman provoking the temptation is wrong and the mentality that I can walk around in anything I want because I just want to be sexy is wrong because it all comes from immodesty and it’s not accidental it’s intentional. You know sexy means sexual. It’s meant to provoke sexual feelings. So that’s lust. You can’t dress yourself in lust and expect not to attract it and then push all the blame on the predator when you made yourself the bait. Don’t get me wrong both people are responsible for their own foolish decisions but I believe more modesty will reduce any forms of sexual misconduct\n\nSidenote: I want to be clear that in no way am I justifying or excusing the actions of predators or those who commit sexual assault. They are fully responsible for their sin and the harm they cause. This post is not about blaming victims, but rather about acknowledging the responsibility we all have in our own actions, including how we dress and how that can affect others. The Bible calls us to be mindful of how our choices can impact the people around us, both in terms of their temptation and their spiritual growth. This is about promoting accountability and mutual respect, not shifting blame.",

Bucking, kicking and running his ass off. I look over to see what his problem is and to this day I clearly remember seeing the ghost of our deceased dog chasing him. I just froze and watched until they crested the hill and I couldn't see them anymore. I ended up running the rest of the way home because I couldn't believe what I saw. I don't remember if I told my parents when I got in the house or not. But to this day, the memory is crystal clear and I'm now 35. Was it my imagination? Our family dog wasn't allowed in the pasture so was this her finally getting to do what she always wanted..chase the damn horses? Anyone else? Or crazy childhood imagination?",

And unfortunately what he said happened, he passed in my girlfriend's arms tonight.\n\nWhen I confronted my mother, she had to say\n\n\"I didn't have money to take him to the vet\"\n\nMe: \"I would have SENT you the money, I have always sent you money for medical purposes\"\n\nHer: \"You're lying. You've never done that. Anyways he wouldn't have survived regardless\"\n\nMe: \"How can you say that? Are you a trained professional? Do you have any medical experience?\"\n\nHer: \"All vets just pretend like they could've saved an animal if you took them a day early. Wouldn't have made a difference\"\n\nThose and a lot of other excuses. If this were any of her cats, she would've ensured they got the care they needed. But my little guy, who I adored and treasured, she didn't even think twice.\n\nShe's playing the victim card, saying she's old and other reasons. I would've sent her the money if she took him to the vet first, then did the needful. But now, my girlfriend and best friend have to bury him in the garden tomorrow morning.\n\nI don't think I can ever forgive her for this. My heart is destroyed, 3 days into a 3 week trip ruined and I couldn't even say goodbye to Bucket.\n\nI'm sorry for rambling. I'm in a foreign country, in my hotel room just sobbing.",

    "title": "I’ve been isolated for a year, about to be homeless and I don’t know how to come back to life",
    "content": "I feel like I can't escape my shitty life. I'm the son of first gen immigrants. Since I was young, my parents have riddled me with anxiety through over-excessive rules that were justified through religious beliefs and punishments. I faced bullying outside of my home for not fitting into society due to the color of my skin and being an introverted nerdy quiet kid in general.\n\nThis did not affect me that much or so I thought, when I was younger i didn't think much of it but when i grew older I said to myself I should start trusting/engaging with people more or put a greater effort to fit in so I can get a better job to support my aging parents (they had me quite late). During my pursuit of this especially in education, I had a horrendous experience at a college due to racism whereby despite being a good student I was treated like a thug and teachers putting me down. My ambition of making something of my life to help my parents dissolved under the judgment of teachers and peers who saw me as no more than another black guy who will amount to nothing.\n\nThat experience at that college shattered my worldview and self-confidence and I really questioned if people only saw me like that. I began getting more affected by how i was being followed around in stores something i was oblivious to before and how people would adjust their belongings when i was around as well as the level of respect others treated me with as opposed to others\n\nAt home, I was expected to do everything (including parental responsibilities) since childhood for my parents including appointments and filling out documents e.t.c and my mom drove me nuts because instead of actually doing something in her life that could change the outcome she would say stuff like God would fix it for us and tell me to pray\n\nAn incident that happened between all of this (moving around and starting college) was me developing OCD and repetitive intrusive thoughts which I got diagnosed for and took medication for. Instead of my parents helping me, they told me to pray and it was something I convinced myself of. I also revealed it to my college since it affected my thinking/ability to focus if i was ruminating in my head, but all i got was no help and teachers avoiding me and seeing me as broken, even though i was still doing good in class.\n\nI developed severe social anxiety, worse than my introversion before and I preferred staying indoors. After I graduated, I didn't see a reason to go outside, not because I was a bum but my reasoning was maybe the outside world/people can't hurt you if you stay indoors.\n\nI haven't gone out a single time in the past year and it's gotten so bad that I hyperventilate or feel like crying if I walk a few blocks away. I'm super conscious of how people perceive me, whether I am a threat or not. Another reason I didn't go outside is that I remembered is that people are attracted to positivity and confidence, any ounce I had was eroded by the bullying I experienced, negative self perception and intrusive thoughts that plagued my mind, so to people I would have appeared like a downer with bad body language,a suspicious person even though it had only tanked because of how others treated me, which made me feel more pathetic.\n\nRight now, I can't even feel love towards anyone, even myself or bring myself to care about my family like I used to. I'm also becoming homeless in a few days because my landlord wants to evict me because I asked for repairs (I have never missed rent) and my inability to go outside and long year anxiety have actually debilitated me. I want to leave my parents but I know I can’t survive on my own.\n\nHave you tried therapy, you may ask, I've been on a waiting list for months and I don't think mental health professionals are equipped to help with this level of self isolation (I have been told to just go outside but my level of confidence is way below that). I want to go outside but the inside has become too much safer for me than interacting with other people and worrying about how I'm perceived or being afraid or getting bullied.\n\nWhy not fight back or give up so easily? I have come back from bouts of low confidence, extensive periods of social anxiety but this feels like the final form of my anxiety that can't be broken down. I'm seriously considering ending it. I genuinely see no way it gets better or getting rehabilitated back into society.",

This might be a bit of a doom and gloom complain-fest, but im choosing my words wisely to keep this relatively short. If i were to go into all the nitty gritty details then it'd be too long to post.\n\nI (18F) attend a private college dorm. Its nice. They're single rooms with aircon and a mini fridge. Some of the rooms even have bathrooms. Meals and room cleaning are provided too.\n\nIts nice. But, its not. Ive been here for nearly a month now. I wake up, im here. I go to bed, im here. I go to classes and come back here. I get food and come back here. I visit my mum and then come back here. And 'here' doesnt even feel like a place where im valued, where im wanted, where i matter.\n\nI've been here a month. I have not made a single friend. My mum complained to the dean, a bit embarrassing but at least she cares. The dean asked a group of residents to sit with me at mealtimes. Nice, now i wont be sitting alone.\n\nI sit with them once, twice. Maybe three times. They invite me to go on a shopping trip with them once. I feel like a baby. Anyone here have younger siblings? Its like when your mum stops you before youre about to go hangout with your friends and is like; \"bring your younger sibling with you so they can have some fun too\". I'm the younger sibling, i guess.\n\nI felt like a lost puppy. Like a little kid just tagging along because they were lonely. There was no real effort to acknowledge me, apart from one guy who asked me a couple questions. There was no room for me to speak, and when i did id get weird looks. There was just no place for me there. I dont blame them for that, I'm an intruder in their group technically.\n\nSo I get back to the dorm. And I go to bed, and I think; \"I know I don't fit in, but thats not horrible, at least ive got some people to sit with.\"\n\nI go to dinner the following day. I sit down with my food. That group comes in, the ones who i sat with. 'oh, nice. maybe they'll come back to sit with me'. I wait.\n\nThey sit down on the other side of the room. Some of them glance at me while they eat. I tried not to look at them. I don't want to look too desperate.\n\nI walk back to my room. Have a brief panic attack.\n\nIt's been a month, and i am truly, utterly alone.",

    "content": "To preface, I should say that my mum can be clueless, not malicious. But I'm feeling blindsided and angry, and need to get this off my chest before I speak to her.\n\nFor background, my ex husband took his own life 7 years ago, by jumping front of a train. Apologies for the gruesome details but sadly this is relevant.\n\nMy mum is a voracious reader and for the most part we share similar taste in books, so when I was searching round for something to read I asked her for a recommendation. Since I'm sure people will ask, the book she recommended was The Reading List by Sara Nisha Adams. She said \"it's a lovely book, we read it for book group and we all agreed it was lovely.\" Great. I struggle to read physical books so I downloaded it on audible. I even read the reviews first, all pretty positive.\n\nSo you can imagine my response when at bedtime listening to the last hour of the book  (ie, almost at the end), and one of the main characters ends his life by jumping in front of a train. Immediately I'm horrified, really distressed and suffering flashbacks to that time. Very little sleep was had and today I just feel awful, really upset and still dealing with flashbacks.\n\nAnd the biggest feeling I have at the moment is anger. I'm fucking furious with my mum. There's no way she wouldn't have made the connection, my ex's death had a massive impact at the time, she was with me when I was told. I'm quite sure that she would have brought it up when it was discussed at book club, as I know she often talks about what happened (not in a salacious gossip way, just her own way of coping with it). She only read the book a few weeks before she recommended it to me. How in the hell did it not set off a klaxon warning in her head?\n\nThe thing is, as I say, I know for 100% certainty that this was not malicious, she's just not like that. She is just a bit clueless when it comes to emotional stuff sometimes (we suspect she is autistic). I love her dearly and can't confront her with my feelings about it. She's elderly and she would be so upset that she upset me. But omg I shout want to shout at her wtf mum!!!\n\nThank you for listening to my rant!",

He was supposed to come this saturday but i got mad because he picked going out with friends (with that one female friend i dislike even though she has a bf :(, lets call her Daisy) instead of spending my 21st birthday with me..\n\nI know hes struggling with money even though we both live at our parent's house. I wasnt mad when he got me m&ms for my birthday gift. But i was mad when he told me he spent 40€ on drinks with his friends.. :(( I wouldnt even minded a cheap perfume or even just a hand written card :(( So i called him, mad. I have been resentful of him for the past 6 months because he kissed a friend at a party. That shattered my heart to pieces. I literally couldnt think of anything else 24/7.\n\nI'm an insecure person ; so im easily jealous and have a habit of talking badly about some of his female friends :// i worked on that for a long time, but that kiss just filled me with anger.\n\nSo on the call he said that hes tired of me, that he rather spend time/ talk to other people than to spend time/ talk to me. (Round 2 of my heart being shattered).\n\nI think i can be verbally abusive because i get mad. For example, i once told him that i was going to fail in life and probably just become nothing good. I'm also suicidal at times.\n\nOn the suicidal part, he also told me that its too much for him and that i gotta deal with it on my own, im not mad at him for that because he has a friend who committed suicide in 2023, but that hurt a little. I feel so alone.\n\nHe says he wanted us to stop seeing and talking to each other. He then texted me that i need to find a solution and fix this otherwise \"it wont be possible for us to be together\".\n\nI saw him today with that one female friend Daisy, he also saw me but walked right past me with her and didnt even say hello when we were at the study room\n\nReasons why i dislike Daisy My bf and her sometimes go back home together because theyre almost neighbours He often talks about her He always takes her side\n\nI feel like he has feelings for her. He also keeps pictures of him and his ex on an sd card that he doesnt look at. I told him i dont like it but he doesnt want to get rid of them.\n\nHere i am in my room reading the love letters he once wrote to me.\n\nIm sorry if the structure of the post is messy.\n\nHow do i fix things with him ? Is my relationship most likely over ? :(( I just want to do things right with him :((\n\nAny advice ? Thank you for your time",

    "content": "What do i do? Sometimes i feel like my mom can just be the worst. She can be so rude, immature, and she acts like a teenager. Am i wrong for thinking this? I keep switching between self pity and guilt because i just have no idea if this is normal or not, because all in all she is my mom and i love her very much but sometimes when i witness some of my friends relationships with their mothers i feel tears come to my eyes, literally. Basically for context i graduated from high school four months ago and im only going to university next year so taking a gap year to travel and work and i'm leaving overseas in three months. So basically my day to day just consists of learning the piano, trying to find a job,  reading a bit, organising my OE, and occasionally hanging out with friends.\n\nToday i was watching Tv which to be honest i rarely rarely do, and out of nowhere she comes storming in with a horrible attitude and my heart just immediately starts racing because for some reason, I can never fully relax around her. I'm just always on edge, even the sound of her footsteps gives me anxiety. She starts complaining and getting angry at me, basically muttering 'this lazy bitch' etc to herself because she was working and didnt have time for lunch yet while i was sitting infront ofthe TV. I mean am i wrong for getting a bit uncomfortable and weirded out by that? Just because I feel like she shouldnt be comparing herself to me and it just feels very immature and strange, like is it entitled for me to think yes well your the adult and i'm not sure why your comparing yourself to your teenage daughter? Like she was trying to guilt trip me. Shes just always angry and taking shots at me, and it feels so weird because I'm the one that has to endure her tantrums and I've learnt not to react or give her my emotions and try and just stay level. Its to the point where if she does decide to be nice to me i just get sad, or even angry, because its like i cant even enjoy it because i know it wont last. Its like she flips a switch depending on her mood. It reallly feels like im on eggshells when im in the same room as her and it almost feels stuffy and hard to breathe. Like i just cant enjoy myself or let my mind be at rest, im always aware of where she is and what shes doing and when she leaves the room i can breathe.\n\nI understand to an extent why she is so angry and frustrated with me all the time, but its just upsetting because i feel like i can count on one hand the amount of times she speaks to me nicely in a week. To  be honest my room is a pigstye and i know it and i hate it too but im just in a bit of a rut right now and i know its bad and ive been trying to clear it step by step but its very overwhelming for me and i dont blame her for being frustrated about it. But I was finally makin some progress the other day and packing my dirty clothes into one basket and organising them in the other, and then i go to bed and leave it for the next day to put away. I wakeup and the clothes are thrown everywhere around the room and i hear her yelling that i shouldnt be using the baskets she needs for laundry or something like that. To be honest i wasnt really even suprised or angry. But today i decided to sort of get back at her a bit which i know is immature but i couldnt realy control my emotions and when i get angry i dont yell back or argue i just do something small to the other person which sort of calms down my head, so i squirted a bit of ketchup from my lunch onto the carpet. It was really only a dollar coin size, but i go back to my room and i hear her storming down the stairs and throwing open my door and starting to scream at me about it. I just really am at a loss and dont know if its me or if its her.",

My cousin says he and his wife waited a year for me and I have been rude and disrespectful. He says is bad etiquette not to give a gift if you are invited to a wedding.\n\nI've never heard of this. In my opinion it is disrespectful to expect a gift whether or not the person comes to your wedding. My ex-husband and I didn't have any guests when we got married. We combined the ceremony and the honeymoon in one trip. No one gave us gifts and we didn't ask for any. We didn't wants gifts but even if we had to decided to have a traditional ceremony and reception we would have never demanded a gift from anyone.

I sit at a computer for so long my posture has gotten terrible. I've tried YouTube channels with timers, a self shocking watch, back straps. Yet it still shows up and bleeds to outside work. I even have a standing desk.\n\nMeals become easy to miss because I wrap myself in work (which comes and goes).

I've never had a knack for learning names or being able to follow sports which is arguably the easiest conversation starter so that's a bit of a bummer.\n\nThe lack of exposure to people, and social media I'd arguably say has made me  dumber as a person.

I know I’ve been privileged to have the opportunity to choose between high-earning fields, but I feel stuck because I’m worried I won’t actually like or be good at anything.\n\nMy Main Concerns: •\tDentistry: I’m drawn to the stability and hands-on aspect, but I worry that the field is becoming too corporate, with private equity firms buying up practices. If that’s the case, would I be better off just going into finance or private equity directly? Plus, I’d be in dental school until almost 30 without making money, which makes me nervous. •\tLaw/Finance: I have this vision of being a “law/finance girl” working in the big city, and I like the prestige and business aspects of both fields. But I also hear about brutal hours, burnout, and slow career progression. Would it be worth working my way up the corporate finance/law ladder, getting an MBA or JD, and trying to break into something lucrative? •\tEntertainment Industry: A part of me is drawn to working in entertainment law, production, or the business side of Hollywood because I’ve always found movie sets fascinating. But I know it’s hard to break into, and I don’t want to waste time chasing a dream that won’t provide financial stability.\n\nWhat I Want: •\tFinancial freedom and stability •\tA solid career path with structure (not just bouncing around) •\tGood work-life balance (time for family, travel, and personal interests) •\tA mix of business and creativity (not just sitting at a desk all day) •\tPotential to pivot into multiple careers\n\nI’m 25 and feel behind already. I know grad school is an investment, so I want to be sure before committing. I’m not naturally great at science, but I also worry that reading/writing all day in law/finance might bore me. Dentistry would give me hands-on work, but would I enjoy it long-term? Or would business and investing be the better move?\n\nWould love to hear from people who’ve navigated similar crossroads.

So I grabbed it and let it outside through the window. (She lives on the first story so the cat was fine. I placed it on the ground and let it leave. I’m not a total monster.) The next day I went to the shelter when they had an open appointment and looked for a cat that looked identical to her cat. She had a generic black cat so it wasn’t hard. I brought it to her apartment, and left it at that. She came back, and everything had seemed fine. She’s only noted that the cat was skittish at first, but we both just chalked it up to it being the first time she was away from home for so long. I don’t necessarily feel guilty because she seems happy, but I do feel slightly guilt over my actions. I needed to tell someone, even if it’s the online void, just to get it off of my shoulders.",

I'm not the emotional kind in general, so that makes what's happening to me even harder for me to process. I've never felt such pain, never felt this lost, never looked at my future and found it so tasteless. I don't know what I'm hoping for from this post, but I'm gasping for air anywhere it could be found. I have not stopped crying since. This will be long, apologies.\n\n6 days ago, I found out that my now ex (F24) with whom I had a 8 years long love story, did not love me anymore. Not only that, but she had been dating someone from her class for ~2 weeks. She also had an intense, albeit short fling with a guy ~6 months ago. What hurts most is seeing that it was not at all a physical/sexual story, which would have \"made sense\" to me, given we've been long distance for the last 5 years (though not really, as she was a self described asexual). It's seeing the passion in her texts (not their; her), she didn't talk to me like this for ages. She spent the night at his place the day before I flew in to spend my vacation with her. I understand now why she insisted I should spend a week, half my vacation, with my family (they live close). On the third day of my stay at her place, she went on a dinner date with him, which she offered in advance to pay. In an audio to her friends 6 months ago, she explained that she only had 2 modes: indifference and intense attraction. Her feelings towards me evaporated into indifference. How could this happen to me? I really thought we were special. She was by a long shot my best friend. I've spent all my adult life, and most of my high school looking forward to receiving her texts, to our video calls, to planning out career moves to allow us to live together. Of course, it wasn't a steady ride, and I've made mistakes in the past, like when, shortly after breaking up in high school 7 years ago, I hooked up with someone, which earned me to get blocked everywhere by my ex. I regretted that a lot, and started sending her emails every 22nd day of the month, a special number for us, to keep contact, which helped me traverse what was then the worst period of my life. We got back together a year later, and sending an email every 22 has now become a tradition between us. I plan on sending one this month as well. How could I not? I know I should probably not, but I just can't.\n\nI knew she wanted to end things, and we were probably going to break up upon my visit, given her pessimistic outlook on whether we'd end up in the same place and that she claimed to feel herself falling back into depression. Was that true or an excuse to spend more time with her new guy, to whom she said, mockingly, that I just couldn't accept that she didn't love me anymore and that it had to be the distance. When I sent her texts in which I was being insecure about her love for me, or whether I was a \"lovable\" person at all, she ignored them under the pretext that I was becoming annoying with the recurrent theme. Why then, would she screenshot the message and send it to the new guy, who felt pity towards me? Why would she buy me a valentine's gift (an \"I love my girlfriend\" t shirt) a few days before she spent the night with him? Why express annoyance with her friends that I'm being paranoid, while they knew of all of this as well? That doesn't make any sense??? This is so humiliating and heart breaking. I've been practically turned into a joke with her classmates and friends. Not that I care about them, but the betrayal is too much to bare. I don't know how I can keep going, what I should look forward to in life now. It's not even about finding someone else, I can do without. I just don't know how I can live with this, I'm not sure how to put it differently. When I confronted her, she said that everything she did during my stay was in order to not hurt me, even forcing herself to keep kissing me, hugging me, sleeping in my arms. That naturally, only the new guy could confort her after what just happened. After I said I had to unfollow her on instagram as I couldn't bear seeing her like couple stuff, she blocked me everywhere, except for emails..... I don't know how to live now. I left the next day to see my family, and am now back home a week early from my vacation.",

He died 2 weeks ago while on holiday- I was meant to join him later on but I never made it out there. His funeral is next week and I don’t know how I’m going to deal with. I loved him so much- I don’t know what to do with myself now. We moved in with each other last year and we adopted a dog a few months ago. I wanted to have a family with him, I wanted to get married (he wanted a huge ceremony ‘skywriting and all please’, I wanted to basically elope- he would say as long as I was there he would get married on nuclear wasteland). I loved watching him interact with my family- even if he could barely understand what they were saying- when he first met my parents (mums from cork, dads from Barry) he brought notes with questions to ask about both places- he framed the notes and gave it to them for Christmas. I loved how he saw the world always positive and with a kindness i would strive to hold- could make a friend no matter where he was. He would make me a cup of tea every morning even when I was working as a yoga instructor waking at 5 every morning.  Now i wake up and it’s silent- no kettle, no one swearing after stubbing their toe, no humming. The memorial was at his football club- I can’t stand everyone asking how I’m doing- he’s dead how the fuck do you think i am? They tell me he was lovely, loving & loved- yeah i know of course i know. When i felt sad (and due to my mental health issues i was sad a lot) he would ask if i wanted loves, silly, outings (in his words in the way you take old dogs on an outing) or telly. Loves meant a cuddle in bed or on the couch (usually mixed with telly). Silly meant him attempting to make me laugh however possible- this could go hours till i laughed usually resulting in him getting naked. An outing would normally taking me on the tube to a gallery or meal or cinema but normally just to our shared happy place- the big tesco. I can’t even walk past the big Tesco. I miss him so much.",

Every time I thought I’d like to talk to someone else, he’d ride in and make me feel like I had a chance. On my end, I was in one of those situationships where I’m single but committed to him…\n\nLast year, I found out he was married. He finally admitted to it. And boy did it cause drama. He called me up and yelled at me on the phone telling me that I was “just a root” and that he doesn’t actually care. Later in the day when he was no longer around his wife, he called me saying sorry that he really does love and care for me and that it was all real for him. (Yes, he knew how I felt about him). We spent 3 days going back and forth. His wife was talking to me, asking questions. I was trying to answer them. But I lied… I told the truth about everything except 1 thing. She cried to me on the phone when she found out I’d slept with her husband. (Didn’t know he was married at ALL. I was honestly none the wiser to his other life) This man had called me begging to say it was only once.. and after a lot of tears and promises he had made to me that it truly all was real despite that first phone call… I lied for him.\n\nAnd I hated myself for that. So this week, 4 months later, I sent her a 4 page letter. I told her everything. I explained to her everything he had told me and sort of gave her the understanding of WHY I felt the way I felt about him, and WHY I had no clue she existed. Basically just gave her the rundown of everything from the 2 years that I’d been friends with her hubby.\n\nAnd I feel so much better for it. I feel so much more free now that I have been honest with her. And I’m finally ready to remove him completely from my life.\n\nI know I’m an asshole for not being honest the first time. I look back now and feel very manipulated and selfish. I still had hope that I would get to talk to him because that’s what he was saying. Until I realised how dumb that was…\n\nAnd now I’m free. Everyone knows the truth. Life is about to start moving forward again. And I hope that I can learn to forgive myself for what I did. She has forgiven me after hearing all the details… and that I’m grateful for.",

    "content": "So, I (20M) and my boyfriend (32M) have been in a relationship for about a year. Before I started dating him, I was very active on Grindr and had multiple hookups.\n\nJust to give you some context:\n\nI really think my boyfriend is an attractive man, and he is very sweet and kind to me. Yes, we do have a big age gap (which I initially liked because I’ve always been into older men, but now I feel kind of insecure about it since he already works, has his own apartment, and can do whatever he wants, while I’m in college living with my parents). But that’s not the problem.\n\nRecently, I’ve been feeling very turned off by him. It’s not that the sex isn’t good, but I really miss going out with different guys, and I don’t know why. I mean, I still think he’s attractive, but I kind of want to sleep around again (even though I felt very empty when I did that before). It’s also been almost two months since we last had sex.\n\nI study medicine and don’t have much time to see him—we usually only see each other on Sundays—so it’s not like I’d have time to go on multiple dates or anything again. But I think the issue is that our relationship has reached that phase where the initial spark has faded a little.\n\nSometimes, when I’m at the gym, I catch myself looking around at other guys. My TikTok and Instagram feeds are basically just shirtless men, and I still follow some of the guys I used to flirt with, so their stories catch my attention.\n\nAt the same time, while part of me wants to break up and go back to Grindr, I also really like him, and I know he really likes me. This is my first real and longest relationship, so I don’t know if what I’m feeling is normal. And even if it is normal, what should I do?\n\nI’d really appreciate some advice, and I’m happy to answer any questions you might have.",

    "content": "I’m only writing on here cause i constantly see people come here for outside opinions on situations and I could really use some. I’m not the best writer so I’ll try to make this as proper as possible. Throwaway count for obvious reasons. I(23M) found myself in a sticky situation a few months ago. I’ll explain real quick on how I got to the situation. About a year ago I was working at a warehouse where my old manager from a previous company was the acting manager there. He had hired me because we had become friends outside of work and I had needed a new job. Fast forward into me working there for 3/4 months, there was a coworker (let’s call her Brenda)(21F) there that  had taken a liking to me. Wasn’t long until we became close and then eventually intimate sexually. But it was just casual. Eventually I started noticing little things from my manager( let’s call him Will)(34M). He’d always make inappropriate jokes about Brenda and casually flirt with or try to be alone in his office with her. Once again we were casual so not really my business until Brenda told me about how Will was trying to sleep with her. Apparently in his crusade to sleep with her he had been bad mouthing me and revealing things that I told him in confidence to her to try to get her to stop sleeping with me. In my past I have struggled with my anger and have had mandated anger management, which I had only told Will since we were friends or at least I thought. Life continues and Will continues to bad mouth me behind my back and smile in my face as if nothing. Eventually Brenda quits to pursue other things but we continue to hookup. I continue hooking up with her on the condition that she cuts contact with Will since all he does is bad mouth me. I told that if she didn’t want to she could just pursue him and leave me alone. She agrees to my conditions and things continue for few months while I’m still at the warehouse . There’s one night that she’s at my house and she falls asleep with her phone unlocked. I know I had said we were just casual but she had brought up the idea of being in a relationship multiple times so I felt I had to check before I decide to get into something with her. She had no problem showing me phone previously before and same for me. Everything is fine until a see an unopened snap message from a girl I’ve never heard of and at this point I know all her friends. The name is a female name (too lazy to come up with another name) but the user name is none other than Will. She had been secretly texting him thru Snapchat. I snoop a little further and nudes have been sent and even some inappropriate messages are saved. Can’t lie I was a quite a bit hurt but she’s not my girlfriend at the end of the day. But I continue snooping more and see that not only had she sent nudes to him but she had sent pics of my penis to him and videos we had made together. From his comments on our videos I came to the conclusion that they had slept together while me and her were involved. I couldn’t tell the time frame exactly. I woke her up and told her to get dressed. She obviously was confused and all I said is I know everything and that I’m taking her home. Still confused she noticed her phone in my hand and started screaming at me for going thru her phone. Wasn’t really trying to hear any of it so I kept telling her to get in the car. We finally get in the car and for most of the drive it’s silence. I guess the silence was getting to her because the word vomit proceeded and she starts telling me about how it didn’t mean anything, and that she only did it a few times because he gave her some money and that she thought I wouldn’t want a relationship if she told me and how’s it’s my fault for not “locking in” with her. Typical gaslighting behavior. All I said was that I’m not mad and shes free to do whatever she wants and I’m free to do what I want. She seemed happy when I said she could do whatever she wanted but the smile faded when I said I’d do what I wanted. She proceed to ask what does me doing what I want looked like and I told her it was none of her concern since I no longer wanted to do anything with her. She smacked me. Im driving and she smacks me in my face. She continues to hit and scratch me while I’m driving and I use my other hand to protect myself while my left hand is holding the steering wheel. She stops hitting me only to grab the steering wheel and try to swerve the car off the road. She hysterical and screaming her head off. All I’m thinking is I’m going to die. And then blue and white flashing lights behind me. She stops and I pull over. At first I’m relieved but then it hits me. I’m a 6ft tall black man and I’ve just been pulled over with a psycho girl that’s been hitting me. She’s going to try to spin the story and then I’ll end up in jail. 2 officers come out. 1 to her window one to mine. I roll both windows down and accept that I’m going to jail. The officer tells me I was driving reckless and glances at me and asks me to step out of the vehicle and follow him while the other officer is still at her window. He asks me if I’m ok and to explain what exactly had happened. Confused I ask him what does he mean and he points out everything. I guess I hadn’t noticed but I had scratches all over my arm and face and my shirt was a little torn. In my head I’m thinking even if I told the truth she might lie and I still get in trouble. I explain to him and he tells me he’s going to talk to his partner and Brenda. As I’m standing a little out of ear shot I’m thinking she’s gonna spin some lie and then my life is over. But you guys may not believe me on this but they ask her to strip out of the car and arrest her. After putting her in their car the officer comes to me and tells me that surprisingly she told the truth. He gives me a form to fill out for an order of protection and says I can file it at the courthouse in the morning. Best believe I filed it and had a no contact order against her. She’s told some people about the situation and a lot of people are calling me sassy and saying it’s my fault for not getting into a relationship with her. And that I’m way bigger than her and could have easily protected myself. I’ve told some of my friends and they’ve laughed in my face. She’s been harassing me from fake numbers and threatening me. Even found a screwdriver in my tire. I can’t prove it’s her which makes it irritating. I don’t really care what other people say, I heard something on tv about how abuse is genderless and can come from literally anyone. But it’s starting to wear me down. All the harassment, the laughs, the jokes. If I was a girl none of this would be happening and I’d have some support. I even feel like the harassment would be taken more serious. I just need some advice and somewhere to share my story.",

Feel free to ask if that's the case.\n\nFor some context first: Me (23M) and my best friend (21F), let's call her Nicky, are friends since first year in college. We started getting along better in second year, and later I started catching feelings for her. Last year I couldn't resist and decided to invite her out; surprisingly, she said yes. We got through the talking stage and laid out some emotional things and said beautiful things to each other. Unafortunately, when we finally got to our first date, she told me that she was actually confused and looking for something different than I am. Obviously, I was crushed. I was so over the moon with her and thought it was going well. It took me some time to recover from that, but finally we got to be friends again, which made me happy because, aside from all romantic feelings, I'm very fond of her (or whatever you say when you love someone but not romantically lol).\n\nNow, the main issue here is that some weeks ago I realized I still have feelings for her and it's getting really strong every day, and I'm 110% sure she only sees me as a friend. Still, some part of me has some kind of hope, but even though I feel bad because I promised her to be a good friend with no other interest between, and I'm failing at that. Every time I think about her I smile, and I'm a profesional daydreamer so that happens very often. I can't imagine myself with anyone else but with her, she's just wonderful, I like everything about her. She's charismatic, funny, smart, compassionate, empathetic, and I can keep going. So now I'm lost about what to do, because if I tell her I know that it's gonna ruin the friendship, but I can't keep my feelings hidden anymore, it's killing me. Also, I have no idea if she knows or not. I'm aware my behaviour towards her may have changed and I'm being more... affectionate? but in words, not physical.

Everytime I go to school or a sports event my hair is in a pony. Now, don't get me wrong, I LOVE it when my mom, step-mom or little sister braids or experiments with my hair, seeing as it is the longest in the family. I usually don't get such problems with it. But if I got a pennie for every time a tacher or coach has touched or played with my hair during a competition or class, I'd have an uncomfortable amount. One of there teachers was my 7th grade technology teacher. He loved pulling and tugging at girls hair and purposely tease us during classes, where we learnd nothing btw. At that time I also took part in a sport that the local, my futer, high school hosted. During a lot of the leage competitions there would be one coach from another school who would run his hand through, or tug, the girls' hair when we were done. There are a lot of girls there too. Until we moved December last year. Now, in a new school I am faced with another teacher who likes to play with my hair. My C.A.T. teacher. I sit the nearest to her desk and whenever she explains something she would occasionally walk over to me and play with my pony. I usually get REALLY uncomfortable when people do that. It freaks me out a little to be honest. Usually when that happens I freez up and don't say ir do anything until they've stopped and walked away. Sometimes I'd scrach or pinch myself. Hell knows why I do it, I just do. Sometimes I feel like I'm freaki g out over nothing. It's just old people playing with hair.

My partner and I usually split 4 bottles, but I always filled so I would finish glasses and kill the bottle if it was low.\n\nI knew I drank too much, but I was functional. Then I woke up one Saturday, a bit hungover like everyday, and I read a message from my mother. My sister (who had drug and alcohol issues), who had been estranged for several years, was in hospice. It turns out she had been drinking a handle of vodka about every two days, plus had been on some heavy drugs.\n\nI live overseas now, so I called the hospice as soon as I could. I spoke to a nurse who put the phone to her ear as she was already completely non-responsive. There was no coming back. As I spoke apparently she clutched the hand of someone there, so I feel like she could hear and understand but had lost all motor function.\n\nMy other sister who lived 2 hours away was able to be there for her in her dying days. I called her a few times to check on her as our parents couldnt make it because they had told them she would be dead before they could have arrived (she lasted 2 days so that wasn't true). Once when I called my sister she was video calling me and she showed me our dying sister. Her skin was piss yellow, her hair was just whisps, when she had always had such full hair. Her face was contorted as someone who has no control is. Then I later heard her breathing. Even when the phone wasn't close I could hear it. It sounded like a wet paper bag being inflated and deflated, and the sound just got worse and worse.\n\nI fully believe that even with the meds making her \"comfortable\" that she knew what was happening and I think she was terrified. She literally was drowning slowly over days as her lungs inflated. Eventually she passed within minutes of me speaking to my other sister.\n\nI've not had a drop since the night before I got the message. The trauma of seeing what she went through made me stop cold turkey. My partner still drinks, but not as much, and I still pour for her, but I won't touch it. I have no desire to die like that.\n\nTL/DR: my sister died of alcoholism and seeing her in her final moments traumatised me so much I haven't drank since.",

Another time we were on the phone and he said “I’ve been thinking a lot lately, what are your thoughts of the idea of us getting married some day” which caught me off guard because he said that he maybe didn’t see himself getting married. He’s also brought up promise rings with my friends at work because me and him work together and they have told me about it. And today while we were out to eat he brought up moving in together after I graduate. I love my boyfriend so much but I don’t understand why the switch from having these certain views to changing those views and talking about that stuff and I don’t know if he’s joking about it or actually being serious. I want to believe that he is but with what he has said in the past is confusing me. I’m going to bring this up to him but I don’t know what to say exactly. Is it a sign that he may be changing his views and considering a future with me or is it something I should be worried about?",

    "title": "I think I ruined my relationship with my cousin",
    "content": "Well a couple of weeks ago I posted in a different sub and since then things have gotten worse. TLDR of that post; my cousin broke up with her boyfriend (probably their second or third breakup). There were many factors, but their biggest issue by and large was the fact that he had two children from a previous relationship. She gave him an ultimatum \"her or the kids\"...they eventually got back together because she chose her.\n\nFast forward to this past weekend we were arranging plans for a girls night since it'd been a while since our last hangout and she bailed to spend time with him as the weekends were his only free time. I kind of blew up at her, stating she doesn't need to see him all the time and that they could survive without each other for a bit - I felt she was neglecting her female friendships because she has done this multiple times before.\n\nShe didn't reply for a while and eventually got back to the group chat with a long paragraph, calling me out specifically for calling her partner a \"deadbeat baby daddy\" and that she felt \"no remorse\" for her actions. I could've phrased myself better, but I doubled down and told her it's not fair to the kids that they've lost their dad over something that's not their fault.\n\nShe never replied so I waited a couple of days to send her a message. I apologized for my brash reaction and for essentially being \"mean\" when trying to express myself. Again, however, I mentioned that I wasn't ok with what she's done to maintain this relationship. I expressed that I came from a place of love and I wanted more for and from her - eventually compromising to not mention my opinion on her relationship again after saying my final thoughts. She hasn't replied to me despite being active on social media. As much as I care for her, I simply can't find myself supporting this behavior, but I'm worried I've lost one of my closest relationships.",

    "title": "I am struggling with the decision of accepting money from my dad when I plan on cutting him off again.",
    "content": "For context: I am 29 years old and I grew up in an extremely abusive household. My dad nearly tried to take my life on several occasions, and knew that my brother was sexually abusing me and did nothing about it. My dad constantly threatened to either kill me or himself, and would not let me move out or live my life even through my 20's. He would pretend to be poor and ask me to help him with bills all the time, but he was sitting on a half a million dollars and just didn't want to use it.\n\nIt got to the point that even in my early and mid twenties, he tracked my location, my credit card, bank account, etc. and would abuse me (choke me, punch me, threaten to kill me) if I spent any money on anything. Once, I even asked to move out and he grabbed a kitchen knife and said he'll either kill me or himself if I ever leave.\n\nI ended up getting cancer and my dad never even helped me with any of my bills for treatment and still continued to ask ME for money/help.\n\nFast forward to last year, I finally ran away. I changed my last name, my phone number, moved to a different city and took my dog and left. I went one full year without contact - filed restraining orders and everything.\n\nMy dog has been my only consistent family my entire life. He has been the only support I've ever had, and is my emotional support dog. He was just diagnosed with cancer and I BROKE down. Out of sheer emotion, I called my dad. Which was the dumbest thing I've ever done.\n\nHe was so elated to have me call him and back in his life, that he offered to pay for my dog's surgery to help him be cancer free. I let him, and I was so happy to have support.\n\nI NEED to cut him off again because he's already talking about wanting to leave his wife (my mom) and move in with me so \"we can leave happily ever after.\" He makes comments like \"we can get a second puppy and raise him together\" (as if we are a couple and we would live a life together).\n\nMy father is making me EXTREMELY SICK and I am reminded why I had to cut him off.\n\nAnyway, I was told my dog may need a round or two of chemotherapy. Giving him chemotherapy could give him a matter of YEARS of his life back, versus only months. My dog is in EXCELLENT condition - couldn't even tell he was sick. He IS worth saving.\n\nMy dad is offering to pay for the chemotherapy. Because he thinks he will be able to keep me in his life by doing so. Am I a bad person if I accepted his financial help and then cut him off all over again right after? Is that morally wrong? Would I be the AH?\n\nI'm learning how to live life at 29 years old for the very first time, and barely making it. I was never taught financial literacy or how to manage my money because my dad did everything for me. And didn't let me take charge of my own life. I never knew how to cook, or do ANYTHING. They took my life away from me because they wanted me to live with them forever.\n\nI need this financial help to save my very best friend, but I also don't want to do something that would make me a horrible person. I could TECHNICALLY afford his chemo but it would pretty much make me have 0 savings. So.... WIBTA to take his money and then run?\n\n(I also considered telling him that I'd only accept the money if he knew it was no strings attached and that he has to be fully aware that I am not letting him BUY a relationship with me).",

    "content": "Hey everyone, on August 8th 2024, I posted a highly inappropriate conversation my teacher had with me. It’s been a while and I just wanted to post a little update since the post has now been taken down.\n\nA little run though, my male teacher which we called Mr Mike asked me questions about my relationship and my sex life with his student (my boyfriend) who I’ve now been dating for almost a year. Police, school and the education department all did nothing and basically said to me they didn’t believe me, the police closed the case due to the education department suggesting it. Apart from the sexual harassment he also had a tendency to ignore me in his class since I was the only girl in construction and by ignore I mean “hey sir can I get a note for the construction excursion thingy?” “Later” and never gave it to me even when I reminded him. Then there was the problem of him leaning over me to look at my computer screen, and I mean leaning right over my head so his whole torso was above me.\n\nAnyways it’s been 7 months since then, I had to leave school and then I decided to come back which resulted in me repeating the year because of the 7 months I had off. So I’m officially back at school but now he’s there and he looks at me and smiles or deliberately walks near me or coincidentally is always in my class. My year advisor is a sweetheart and really helped me through this, he pulled me out of his class straight away and told me I did not have to be there if I’m not comfortable with it. I’m no longer in his class but he’s still in mine.\n\nThis has been incredibly tough on me and I still feel so vulnerable and disgusting, I have no choice though it’s either that or it’s nothing, I feel as if I can’t let him stand in the way of my success and I should continue to try and finish high school. I have amazing friends, an amazing boyfriend and I have a great relationship with all of my teachers, that’s something I’m not gonna have anymore if I keep letting this man effect me because he can’t know right from wrong. I was 16 when it happened I’m now 17 and trying to live life to its fullest since it happened.\n\nI also wanna thank everyone for the love and support over on my last post, I really appreciate you girls and all the advice, love and support given by everyone. 💕",

    "title": "My(27M) gf(25F) has resorted to masturbating due to my low libido",
    "content": "As the title says. Basically it all started when we moved in together. We’d been long distance dating for 5 years, living together for 1 year. We would visit each other during the long distance and every time she’d want sex. I never really had a high libido compared to her. That aside from a few other things, we have our differences but we really click.\n\nShe’s and I are both firm believers that sex isn’t a make or break thing for us, despite it. But recently, her need for sex has gotten kinda outta hand? I don’t wanna say it’s annoying, I just decline her and she’ll start playing around and we just go about our day, but it’s constant asking. Well she settled for saying “I’m gonna go masturbate, you can come with if you want” kinda phrase, and at first I thought she was playing around until I actually caught her masturbating. It was pretty awkward but I mean, hell yeah man. Flick that bean. She kept doing what I guess was her trying to be enticing, but when I’m not in the mood I’m not in the mood.\n\nI talked to her about it, and she basically admitted that she saw a comment say to try it out and it’ll get the man going, but I guess she didn’t take into account that I’m not every man.\n\nI can tell it gets to her though, I can sympathize with the constant rejection but I also appreciate her not pushing further. The most it gets is she just twerks on me, or badly roleplays stereotypical porn scenarios (“on no I’m stuck” something of the sorts. I know she doesn’t watch porn because she has an utter distaste for the objectification of it. I quite frankly don’t care, porn is normal to me)\n\nI won’t lie though, it’s every day- like I said, and it gets me kinda nervous she may have some sex addiction. We don’t have the money for therapy, so I’m just asking ways to go about talking to her about it.\n\nFor clarification: I love her, I think she’s hot, when we do have sex, it’s good for her, but I just don’t feel anything. It really just feels like masturbation for me, and often times results in doing laundry afterwards, making it feel more like a chore than anything. I told her this, and she didn’t like that sex was equated to a chore, but it’s the best way I could describe it.",

When she saw me there trying to look at my snacks she run towards me and went behind my back like she was trying to use my body as defence from someone or something and then again the old man showed up looking for her.\n\nI turned my head around to the girl and asked her what the fuck was her problem and she told me that the old man was trying to abuse her and he already touched her. I asked her why the hell she placed behind me and she told me that she was scared and because i'm a big guy and i could defend her.\n\nI just sighed cause i was already tired of the day and went straight face to face to the old man and just told him to leave that girl alone or i would end in prison and he in a grave. He just stared at me like i was some kind of ghost and looked at the girl and then went away.\n\nI came back to the girl and told her next time to kick him or anyone else herrassing her to the balls and then run or call someone and when i was about to go to pay while crying she asked me \"please don't leave me alone, can you stay with me while i buy a few things?\" I sighed again and accepted.

I just did what i had to do to avoid any type of drama or crying or all this pathetic scenes that i hate. I'm always ready for death or prison so it wasn't exactly a menace but more like a straight fact on what would happen.

    "content": "I've been dealing with some complicated memories and feelings lately and I feel like it's finally time to try get this out there\n\nOk so some context Around 2 years ago I (currently 25 f) was in a relationship with a girl, lets call her H for almost 5 years at the time.\n\nI used to feel like we were inseparable, played video games together, liking the same stuff and daring to go out into a world specially after I grew in quite the conservative household, H was a bastion of courage to get myself out there.\n\nEventually polyamory came into the question, and we were both on board and started a weird relationship with another girl, let's call her N.\n\nThis lasted for like 2 months, Honestly things weren't that bad, N really helped me to start understanding things about my sexuality I never did plus she was and still is probably one of the only persons that understands all of my simpsons references.\n\nThen a party came around, and another girl, S, appeared. We all got drunk and it was clear S was very into us. What at first was uncomfortable flirting quickly worked on H, before I knew they were both kissing in front of me ...wich I hated, but then H hitted me with the \"join us or we are over\" Afraid like the little idiot I was I complied, joined in what is to this day one of my most shameful nights, not only in bed but because they made me lie to N.\n\nFor the next few months I was like dead in life, following H and S with everything, be it more parties, slandering and victim blaming N or hearing them play with other girls.\n\nAt this point is where O appears.... O was the first shining of light in a dark time, we clicked immediately, we talked a lot, enjoyed many things together and Honestly just understood each other a lot.\n\nAt the time I thought \"hey if we are already in a open relationship whats wrong with me having another partner\" well the things was I wasn't, it was one of those situations were the relationship was open for a person but not for the other. H and S had both other partners but it was a problem when I did, because then I stopped being their little errand girl.\n\nThe breakup was nuclear, it was 2 months of whole on fighting and cussing at each other, O was there for me the entire time and helped me understand a lot of my own feelings. While at the same time I had to see H become the worst version of herself, getting drunk and violent. Probably only didn't hit me because S stopped her.... cause oh boy she did in previous fights.\n\nI parted ways with both of them, moved cities to be closer to O and let me tell you ...life has never been better, O helped me rebuild a bridge with my family, to rebuild a sense of self confidence. Where I have been fearful or anxious before, O was only supportive and understanding She helped me see many things of my previous relationship how they were, the stoy of lies, manipulation and isolation that i refused to see in the past, with O I feel loved not like a versión of me wich \"I could growing into\" but as truly me. O has encouraged me to get into a masters degree and I've encouraged to fix the relationship with her family too.\n\nAnd while I miss the friend H was from time to time, I am happy to be where I am I wish both H and S a happy life together too, I hope they don't get to toxic to each other and to grow into better people too. To N, I wish I could apologize properly but understandably she blocked me from any form of contact and Honestly I don't blame her, hope she is having a great time living all the adventures she wanted too.\n\nAnd as for me....Honestly, O is the love of my life and even of we've been together for little more than a year and a half ive decided once I get my masters degree and get the chance to compete for better paying jobs I will marry this person and try to live our best life together. I swear i will try to make O the happiest on earth because honestly she already made me the happiest. I've never wanted to live my life as much as I do now and it's all thanks to her.\n\nWe are playing yakuza like a pirate and going to watch the new gundam movie next weekend Soni think we are on a great start for a rest of out life.\n\nIf there's is anything to learn here, just remember, you do not deserve the minimum effort nor crumbs of affection, you all deserve to be loved for who you are. Dare to break free form your status quo and be happy, believe you deserve to love and be loved\n\nP.d. please don't cheat on your partners, even polyamory has to be properly consensuated and agreed upon or else is cheating too",

I didn’t have to worry about food, rent, phone, etc. At 15, I got my first part-time job and was able to use it as my own income instead of having to supply it to my family. It was difficult for my family to pay for university, so I took on a lot of debt that I have to eventually pay off and I dropped out before I could get a degree. My parents divorced when I was in middle school and it was ugly, but once again, finances was never pertinent (at least as far as I knew).\n\nI eventually went back to a career college and got a degree in healthcare (not nursing) and have since started working full-time in a career that I genuinely dislike, but it is steady and it pays well for the level of education required. When the shift is good, it’s good. But when it’s bad, it’s BAD. I work a full time position and a per diem/casual so I work anywhere between 36-60 hours a week or 3-5 overnight shifts.\n\nI moved in with my boyfriend (31M), whom I’ve with for 3 years, last year and it’s been great. No pets and no kids. He is currently going back to school to be a nurse and I told him firmly that I do not want him working while going to school. His future and education is incredibly important and I don’t want him to split his efforts. I am able to pay the bills enough with a bit extra that I can put away each paycheck for saving.\n\nWhere growing up privileged has ruined me is that I dread going to work every night. I feel depressed thinking about wasting my time. My days off don’t even feel like days off because I sleep all day and then back to work the next night. I get easily stressed about money thinking that it’s never enough although we get by fine, but I can’t pull myself to work more shifts than I already do. It weighs down on me mentally. And I see my coworkers who regularly pick up overtime AND have kids and I don’t understand how they do it.\n\nI feel like my work ethic and hustle is shot because I was able to live a “normal” life prior to becoming an adult and having responsibilities. My boyfriend and I agreed that I quit my casual job because picking up more overtime at my full time position is financially more opportunistic, but a part of me hopes that I can still motivate myself to pick up.

I pulled over, ran up to her, and realized she was maybe a 6-week-old kitten.\n\nHer head was perpetually tilted and her eyes were cloudy. I later figured out she was either blind or mostly blind. I guessed she was the runt of the litter and left behind.\n\nI took her home and my parents let me keep her in our attached garage, on the condition that I try to rehome her once she’s older. I fed her and cared for her for maybe two weeks. I couldn’t decide on a name for her.\n\nI came home after being out all day. And my mom told me (remorsefully) that my kitten was dead. She had let my kitten wander around outside unsupervised, and she had been ran over by a car.\n\nSo my kittens body laid flat in the road for a couple weeks after, right in front of my home, until it somewhat disintegrated. I feel horrible now. But I was too heartbroken to clean up what was left of her. God I am sobbing writing this.\n\nThis memory is courtesy of another redditor’s post about his mom neglecting his cat while he was overseas…. I had repressed this one.",

I guess a good example of this would be him threatening to rape me and what sound it'll make when he takes it out of me. I've brought this stuff up in front of our friends because I didn't feel safe talking to him about it one on one and that's the only time he stops.

    "title": "Burnt Out & Undervalued @ Work – What Do I Even Do?",
    "content": "I’m (25f) beyond burnt out and just need some support. I work as a promotions assistant in radio, making $15 an hour. On paper, it sounds like a simple job, but in reality, I do far more than what I’m being compensated for. I’m not saying I’m a full-on Social Media Manager, but I frequently operate at that level - creating high-quality content, strategizing ways to keep us relevant, and putting in 10 to 20 extra hours a week off the clock.\n\nI’m technically limited to a max of 25 hours per week, but the workload doesn’t reflect that. There’s no consistency, so on the surface, it might not look like much, but it always snowballs into more. My company prioritizes quantity over quality, and while my quality work is finally getting noticed, it’s still not as valued as just pumping out content.\n\nBeyond my usual role, I’ve been asked by multiple people across the company to help with projects, including a morning show - which is a huge opportunity. When they first asked, they expected me to be there every morning, and I had to stand my ground and say that wasn’t realistic. Even though I set that boundary, I can already feel the expectation creeping in.\n\nTo top it off, I work in radio, which is a dying industry. I’m learning a lot, but I also know there’s a cap on what I can gain here. The reality is, we should be pivoting more into social media, but many of my older peers don’t fully understand how much effort that actually requires. Because I do understand, I know exactly how we could stay relevant...but I don’t feel like I’m taken seriously.\n\nAnd to make things worse, I have a coworker with the same job title as me, yet I’m convinced she gets more hours and opportunities. Her dad is my boss’s boss, so - surprise - she’s coddled. She’s not great at a lot of the tasks we’re given, so guess who gets stuck handling the ones she “isn’t as good at”? Me. Meanwhile, she gets other opportunities that I could excel in, but because she struggles with certain things, I get stuck picking up the slack. And the kicker? She doesn’t even want to work in radio, marketing, events, or anything remotely related to this industry. She wants to be a librarian. It’s frustrating as hell watching someone who doesn’t care about this field get cushy opportunities while I work my ass off.\n\nTomorrow, I’m running a promotions meeting where I’ll present my research into our social media, our competitors, and new ideas we could implement. I want to use this meeting to quantify and prove what needs to be done. But here’s the problem - I know I’m going to present great, manageable ideas, and I’m almost certain they won’t be fully heard or understood.\n\nSo, after this meeting, I plan to go to my boss (and possibly someone above her, but in a way that doesn’t throw her under the bus) and say:\n\n“Here’s what I’ve put together. I believe this is what we should do. But realistically, I cannot make this happen with my current budget of hours and pay. I need more time, I need more money, and I’d like to receive the same benefits that full-time employees do. If that’s not possible, I understand, but I want to be upfront—I’ll be looking for opportunities elsewhere.”\n\nI really like my boss. I think she’s great. But I also think my time here is running its course. My biggest obstacle is that I don’t have my degree yet, and I worry that a lot of positions I’d be qualified for would require one. I hope to finish by the end of 2025, but right now, I feel stuck between being undervalued here and being potentially locked out of better jobs elsewhere.\n\nIf I left, I know they’d be so screwed - which makes this all the more frustrating. I know what I deserve, but I don't want to screw over people that I really do care about in the process.\n\nSo, Reddit - what the hell do I do? How do I navigate this? How do I advocate for myself while still being realistic about what’s possible? Any advice would be massively appreciated.",

    "title": "My Mom Neglects & Abuses My Family",
    "content": "TL;DR Emotionally abusive mom is a caretaker for my grandma and makes our house a living hell. Might report her neglect.\n\nObligatory \"this is my alt account\" message.\n\nFor context, I'm in my mid 20s and my relationship has been tumultuous with my mom (54) for maybe 16 years or so now. She's just very arrogant, controlling and narcissistic. She is a perpetual victim and can NEVER admit fault. She has always been emotionally abusive to me but she used to hit me and my older brother (28) when we were kids too. She only does things out of spite or a future hope that you'll do something back for her.\n\nMy grandma (73) suffered a stroke about 2 years ago that left her paralyzed on her left side. She's completely bedwritten and depends on us entirely. Recently, she had to get an amputation below the knee on her \"good\" leg because of a vein blockage. So she's even less able to help us turn her and clean her etc...\n\nI work a full time job and am gone long hours, but when I come home, I try to help out with helping feed my grandma and move her legs and keep her company. My mom is her main caretaker and even gets paid to do so by the local health care system due to her nursing background. Nurses and physical therapists make house visits sometimes to make sure my grandma is doing okay. She's mostly of sound mind but she was diagnosed with dementia so she gets sundowners sometimes and other times she's generally confused. But she has days and moments where she's mostly her normal self.\n\nHere's the part that has been absolutely ruining me mentally, emotionally, physically. I of course have my own medical problems and financial and whatever else. But my mom is a raging bully. She constantly belittles me and insults me and she cannot handle her emotions at all. No matter how calm you try to approach a situation, she will rage and drink and make everyone suffer.\n\nShe's gotten to a point where she doesn't even understand logical conversations. She will argue until she's blue in the face making no sense. fighting herself and her own arguments because she can't even remember or understand what she just said. She'll interrupt me to say her point and yell over me but it's like gibberish. it makes no logical sense half the time. And she gets frustrated when she gets confused and obviously it just spirals.\n\nShe yells at me AND my grandma when she's stressed, even making her feel like a burden and telling her as much. She abuses us. She forced me to do my grandmas insulin and pills a couple months ago by myself and I have no knowledge of how to do that. My mom was a nurse for over 30 years and knows how those things work. She wouldn't even tell me the dosage out of spite or how to do it. I had to call my aunt crying to ask how to do it and look up a YouTube video.\n\nShe will neglect my grandma when she calls her for a diaper change. She leaves her soaked over night or for hours. She was cleaning her the other day and purposely used scalding hot water and made a rude remark when my grandma screamed out in pain. My grandma was hysterical for a day or two after that, shocked that her own daughter would do that.\n\nWe both can't sleep most nights because my grandma gets hysterical or she's in pain and we have to physically get up and assist her. No one is happy, right. But we HAVE to help her and my mom will just flat out give up sometimes but she always refuses additional help from nurses or even from me sometimes.\n\nMy mom has a drinking problem and will go to the store and leave my grandma unattended for periods of time while she drives (with an open alcoholic beverage in the car) to the store. I've seen her do it first hand and smelled it on her breath. She drunkenly backed into my car and dented it and then blamed ME.\n\nShe also has serious anger issues and always forces me to do cruel things like she'll stand over me as I clean the bathroom and nitpick it for hours until it meets her impossible standard. She used to stalk my bank statements and make comments about my spending as an adult??? And she constantly berates me for having a relatively small amount of student loan debt and credit card debt post-college (Less than $8K combined that she's never had to pay - I paid my own college). And she has always made disparaging comments about my appearance. My body. My style. My identity. She has to comment something hateful nearly every time she sees me.\n\nI used to have nightmares about her murdering me or chasing me all throughout highschool because of her abuse. I'm scared of her sometimes although we're not physically that much different.\n\nI help out maintaining the house but she's so manipulative and narcissistic that she tells everyone I don't do anything. And she never acknowleges my help. She will actively gaslight me and tell me I don't do anything and that I'm worthless and a bum and whatever else. She's also become a compulsive liar which obviously worsens everything. If she's in a bad mood, she'll yell at me for TRYING TO HELP??? And she can get in my face or grab things from my hands like if I'm trying to sweep or mop.\n\nMy grandma is more than capable of using her phone to call people. She uses siri with her \"good\" hand. But my mom leaving her alone is neglect because there could be an emergency. When my mom is home she sits outside smoking and drinking all day watching the baby monitor where my grandma's room is.\n\nI'm at my wits end today because after spending hours in the ER this morning for an infection, I came home and tried to sleep. My mom woke me up to move my grandma upward in the bed and I groggily helped her without any fuss and went back to bed. I woke up to a jarring scream by my grandma about an hour later and when I rushed out to the room, she was on the hardwood floor and had fallen 3 feet and hit her head. Mind you, she's paralyzed and has a slew of health issues pre and post stroke.\n\nMy mom is so stubborn and arrogant. she was yelling at me to help but I started panicking and said we shouldn't move her. my mom was tugging on the harness she uses to transport her on the hoyer (to put her into the wheelchair). And I was standing there being screamed at for not helping. But I kept insisting we should leave her still to avoid injury. My mom kept screaming at me so I just called 911 as she kept berating me and trying to move my grandma.\n\nI went outside and called. they came but I called my mom psychotic to her face. Because she kept acting like it wasn't a big deal and saying I was overreacting and that she was fine. But my grandma hit her head when she fell and she was hysterical. She's 73, she could've died.\n\nI just can't deal with bullshit like this anymore. I've been saving to move out. I even toured some apartments recently but I'm terrified of leaving my grandma. The financial stress of my mom getting paid nickels to help my grandma and afford the house has made her even worse than she's always been.\n\nWe have very little help from anyone else in the family and its just us in the house. I swear I'm losing my mind.\n\nAny and all advice is appreciated as long as it's constructive. I just want to figure out how to move forward. I plan to go no contact with my mom as soon as my grandma passes. But what can I do in the meantime to help my grandma and I escape her?",

I mentioned that only about 5% of it has been properly explored, and immediately, this friend was like, “No, that’s wrong.” No discussion, no nuance, just a straight-up dismissal. I tried explaining that I meant human exploration, not just mapping, but nope—apparently, I was just “being funny.”\n\nAnother time, we were deciding on a movie to watch, and I casually mentioned that American Psycho was labeled as a horror/thriller. I read that description directly from Google. And guess what? “No, it’s not horror. What the fuck are you talking about?” Dude, I didn’t write the genre classification, I just read it. Even now, you can Google it, and it still says horror/comedy. But to him, it’s not, so therefore, I must be wrong.\n\nIt’s not even about facts at this point. It’s this compulsive need to be right, to shut down others, to prove people wrong even when it doesn’t matter. And the worst part? It’s not like I was arguing in these moments. I was just casually mentioning things. I get having a discussion, I love debating ideas, but this isn’t that. It’s just…exhausting.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with people like this? Is this just extreme confidence, or is it something deeper, like narcissism or insecurity?",

    "content": "my (22f) roommates (22f) has been seeing someone since october of this year. My roommates girlfriend just kind of showed up one day and never left. I was originally fine with this as I assumed the girlfriend had her own place and could go back to it at anytime if we asked. I also assumed the girlfriend was around our age and in school, which is why I didn’t ask my roommate to reevaluate utilities/electricity bills because I assumed the girlfriend had her own bills to pay for her own place and didn’t want to hold her accountable for 2 bills if i could afford it myself. In January, my roommate and her girlfriend moved in a third person. I realized after 2 weeks that this person never left, so I asked my roommate what was going on and she said that the third person just needed a place to stay since where she was living before was unsafe. I was homeless for a bit as a teen so I understood and didn’t ask any further, since I was just happy the third person was safe. Earlier this weekend, we decided to have a game night so that we could get to know each other a little better since I knew virtually nothing about either of these people that were living in my house. It was at the game night that I learned my roommates girlfriend was 37 and that her girlfriend was also in a relationship with the third person who moved into our house. it didn’t sound like my roommate and the third person are in a relationship. I also found out that my roommates girlfriend is unemployed and moved to the city shortly before meeting my roommate so she does not have a place of her own. I do not know the reason she is unemployed. I feel really uncomfortable that this 37 year old woman is dating my 22 year old roommate. I feel lied to about the situation with the third person, as it’s clear that at least part of the reason she moved into our with us was because of the relationship with my roommates girlfriend. I also do not like that my roommates and I are essentially footing the bills for these 2 random people. However, I am afraid of alienating my roommate since i’ve noticed she doesn’t talk as much to me or her friends since getting into this relationship.  I also feel like I’ve waited too long to raise this issue, but with this new information I feel so mislead and taken advantage of. I don’t want to piss off my roommate by kicking her girlfriend and her girlfriends girlfriend out but I frankly don’t want these people in our house and they aren’t on the lease so they aren’t even supposed to be here anyways. I’m honestly just very confused about what to do and hate the fact that i’m even in this situation.",

    "title": "I blew up my family over a party invite.",
    "content": "Some context before we delve into the story. I (22 female) live in Australia. The big milestone birthday is when you turn 18. We tend to still celebrate our 21st but it’s not as intense as an 18th.\n\nMy dad has two siblings. An older brother we shall call Anthony and a younger sister we shall call Daphne. All three are married. My Uncle's wife shall be called Kate and my Aunt's husband shall be called Simon. I also have a sister.\n\nMy Aunt Daphne’s eldest, Elosie was born a week before me, so we have always had parties pretty close together- we rarely ever combined any. This will be important later.\n\nTo provide some insight into the family dynamic: Growing up, my Aunt Kate would often idolise her children. Showing them off and of course, they could do no wrong. This led to many fights within the family, often started by her which would result in a period of time of not speaking. It got to the point that every family function we attended, they would make a scene. These never ended with her apologising and was always on the other person to make amends. My family were often the ones in the middle and reconciling the family. I could provide specific examples but they would make up their own post. Just know that a lot was built up to this point in the story with my Aunt Kate being incredibly selfish and rude.\n\nSo now for the actual story: My mum loves planning parties so we started planning my 21st right after my 20th. When it came time to the guest list, I spoke to my mum about not inviting Aunt Kate and Uncle Anthony as they always cause more drama. I was in a state of my life where I saw a big decrease in my social circles and I put more value on my close friends and family. I have never felt love from my Aunty Kate- she rarely even hugged me. The previous year I invited them to catch up for my birthday (they were in the area and free) and they never showed up.\n\nWhen I listed these to my mum, she agreed it was a lot of effort and that I was an adult now, so the guest list was up to me. The only family I invited was Aunt Daphne and Uncle Simon and their kids. Note that none of my mums family were invited to this event either.\n\nElosie was having a family birthday dinner a week before my party and invited my family, but not Kate and Anthony’s crew. We both agreed that we were adults and this year we wanted to feel celebrated and loved.\n\nBut photos from her dinner obviously got posted, and Kate and Anthony found out. Yet, they didn’t blow up. Daphne and Simon’s family were often at the butt end of all the drama caused by Kate so it was probably no surprise to them. And a week later, when the photos from my party were posted, it was radio silent. (My mum would often talk with my Aunt Kate at least once a week on the phone.)\n\nA few days later, my mum noticed they all unfriended us on facebook and unfollowed all our social media. It really broke my mum's heart that they didn’t even talk to us about it first. Because despite it all, mum really loved her nieces and nephews. So she called Kate, who pretended everything was fine, (which is very clearly was not).\n\nEloise and I began to feel a little bad that our parents were losing contact with their brother and that the adults in the family were falling out because we didn’t invite them. However, we both agreed that if she was willing, we would talk to Aunt Kate and explain why we didn’t. Elosie was adamant she was going to call Kate and explain. She never did.\n\nWe haven’t got full confirmation from them, but it’s very clear that this was the reason we don’t speak anymore.\n\nFast forward to Christmas (birthday is at the start of the year), my mum sends a “Merry Christmas” to Kate who doesn’t respond until the afternoon. She sends back a message along the lines of, “You too. We had a great day at {place that is 10 minutes away from you}. We spent the whole day here and it was lovely.” They never dropped by to say Hello and it was clear that she was telling us that the communication is cut off. My mum then gave up extending the olive branch.\n\nMy dad, who has the same job as my uncle, reached out to tell him about the promotion he received and got a very cold response back.\n\nEverytime we have asked what is wrong or asked if they were doing well, they pretended like everything was normal. Which it very clearly is not.\n\nVery recently all the adults attended a family funeral and as far as I’m aware they were all being civil. When most of the people had cleared out my Uncle completely ignored my Aunt (his little sister) when she was saying goodbye. This had made her quite upset.\n\nWe also know that this family talks to my grandfather about all this and it seems they are on the same side. When we visited my grandpa (in a different state to us) he told us he was sad because he couldn’t make the drive to see us anymore. Fast forward a month and we receive word he’s driving down to see my Aunt Kate and Uncle Anthony (who live further down then us and we are on his way to them).\n\nThis has made my father and my Aunt Daphne super upset. This has continued to cause distress and discomfort for my family. I feel incredibly guilty and my dad keeps telling me it’s okay. I can’t help but feel horrible that all of this has happened because I couldn’t suck it up for a night and invite my toxic family to my party.",

    "title": "I Reconnected With My Ex After 3 Years… and Now He’s Ghosting Me",
    "content": "Hey everyone, I’m really struggling right now and need to get this off my chest.\n\nI (25F) recently reconnected with my ex (26M) after three years of no contact. He was the first (and only) man I’ve ever loved, and after we broke up, I spent years healing. When we started talking again, I just wanted answers. I wanted to understand why things ended the way they did, and how he felt about it now.\n\nBut instead of just answering my questions, he was the one who asked if we could try again. He told me that he regretted taking me for granted, that he lost a good girlfriend, and that he wished he had communicated better back then. I believed him.\n\nFor the first few weeks, things were great. He was attentive, affectionate, and consistent. We texted daily, FaceTimed, and checked in on each other, even though we were both busy with school and work. It honestly felt like maybe we were getting a second chance.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, his energy shifted. He became distant, took longer to respond, and wasn’t putting in the same effort. At first, I gave him grace because we both had exams, but once my exams ended, his behavior didn’t change. It felt like I was chasing him just to maintain the connection.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I expressed to him that I had trauma from our breakup and that his inconsistent communication was triggering those feelings. He apologized, reassured me that nothing was wrong, and even said he wanted to see me during our spring break. I thought we were good.\n\nBut this past weekend, he became even more distant. I felt like I was the only one initiating conversations, and I started to feel like he was slipping away.\n\nLast night, I sent him a message saying: “Hey, I’ve been trying to get a hold of you, and clearly you’re not available. I know we said we’d take our time, but this feels one-sided. If something is going on and you don’t feel comfortable telling me, just communicating that would have put my mind at ease instead of crashing out. I’m blocking you on IG for my own peace, but I’m still open to hearing your side. If I don’t hear from you for more than a week, I’m going to assume that this is over. The ball is in your court.”\n\nIt’s been 12 hours, and he hasn’t responded.\n\nI don’t understand why he flipped so suddenly. He was the one who seemed so invested at first. If he didn’t want this, why say all those things? Why make me believe he regretted losing me, only to ghost me now?\n\nAt this point, I know I deserve better, and I refuse to keep chasing someone who doesn’t respect my time.",

    "content": "Hi all. I’m 28 years old, and I have been agnostic since I was in elementary school. I didn’t know what it was called back then; I just knew I wasn’t 100% sure about God, Heaven, Hell, the Bible, etc. I remember feeling this way when I was 6/7. I still feel the same way. I have no problem believing in something, but I have to see proof with my eyes (bible doesn’t count for me). Believing a man in the sky that I’ve never met before doesn’t sit right with me. I don’t mind being agnostic. I feel everyone is really agnostic when you think about it.\n\nThe reason I think I’m going to start pretending to be religious is because of people, society. I live in the U.S, and even though there is suppose to be a separation between church and state, that’s just a saying. We’re a religious Christian country. Our money says “in God we trust, our license plates have “in God we trust” on them, in court you have to swear on the Bible, to become president you have to swear on the Bible, and during court with congress and the house a lot of “the Bible says” is said even though there’s “a separation between church and state”. It’s weird.\n\nWhen people find out I’m not religious, it’s like I’m seen as an other. I have no problem with people being religious, but religion to me is an opinion. It’s annoying when it’s spoken on as “matter of fact.” Even though I tell my family I’m not religious, I’m told to pray, and that I need to start believing if I want to be accepted into Heaven. It’s like talking to a wall. I’m ignored, and seen as child like for not believing. I think it would be best to just pretend to be Christian.",

    "content": "For context, my mom and dad have never been married. They only dated for maybe a year after I was born and obviously, I can't remember that. This has never bothered me because it's all I've ever known. My mom takes good care of me and at least my dad still came around. My dad and I would spend time together pretty regularly and I admired him because we were so much alike. Him and I were extremely close until he gradually started coming over less and less. It got to the point to where I only saw him in person once a year and would only get a text from him on my birthday or on Christmas. This hurt me a lot, but I never let it bother me too much because I just assumed that he was busy and at least I still heard from him. Some people don't even know their dads, at least I know mine.\n\nWhen I was around 16, I got a text from my dad (after not hearing from him for months) saying that he was having another kid with a woman I didn't know. He texted me two weeks before the baby was born. I called to talk about it with him and since I hadn't talked about anything serious with him since I was a literal child, I realized just how manipulative he was. Which was probably a big reason why my mom didn't have a great relationship with him. This was the breaking point of the relationship with my dad. It hurt so much, and he couldn't even bother to tell me sooner. I felt like I was the last person to know. I was no longer a priority to him. He didn't think of me a quarter of the amount that I thought about him, so I quit reaching out. Honestly, it felt great for a while. I didn't owe him my time and he would reach out when he remembers that I exist, which was usually just to say, \"I love you\" and leave it at that. Like I said, I liked that for a while.\n\nA few weeks ago, I made a joke about my dad (cause that's how I deal with it lol) in front of a friend who doesn't know much about my relationship with my dad, and he asked me a few questions about my relationship with my dad. I don't mind talking about it, but I never really get the chance to talk about it because a lot of people think it's sad. I don't blame people for not wanting to hear about it. Ever since I talked about it, I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I don't even know him anymore; he has a whole new family and a whole new life. I've started to realize how big of an impact my relationship with my dad has made on the way I see myself and how I simply live my life. I spent my teenage years hating everything about myself and feeling worthless. I have been terrified of being in any romantic relationships because I don't think I'm good enough. What's been bothering me the most about this situation is that there's a big possibility that he's happier without me, and that really hurts.\n\nAnyways, thank you to whoever reads this. I appreciate that you let me get this off of my chest and I'm sorry if this is sucky writing, I just need to vent.\n\nTL;DR I used to be really close with my dad as a kid. I haven't talked to him in two years and I've just realized how much it hurts that he's gone.",

    "content": "I was raped 7 years ago, then sexually abused for a year, and my body still remembers it. My boyfriend and I are coming up on 6 years together, and two years into the relationship I started to process what happened to me. In short, my body completely shut down, my vaginal muscles started tightening, and my vagina began to painfully tear at the tiniest amount of penetration.\n\nSex was scarce. My boyfriend stayed supportive and understanding. We had many deep discussions about our sex life. I finally saw a therapist in 2022, who encouraged me to see my obgyn, who then referred me to a physical therapist for my pelvic floor. Early 2023 is when I began my PT and it changed my life. I was able to graduate at the end of the year. But progress was slow, sexual trauma is hard to recover from. I had to completely change my view of sex and my relationship to it. I basically declared myself a born-again virgin.\n\n2024, sex is still scarce but my boyfriend and I are starting to become more intimate without PIV. I relearned my body, what I like, don’t like, my fantasies, and my hard NOs. I developed a mantra in my mind every time we engaged in any sexual activity, “I am safe. I am okay. This is normal. This is fun.”.\n\nI wanted more, though. I wanted to be able to have PIV sex without the fire burning pain. It wasn’t until my boyfriend and I were looking for something to watch that it clicked. We watched a trailer for a comedy movie and in it a birthing instructor recommends massaging the vaginal area daily to prepare for the big stretch of delivery and to prevent tearing. Amy Poehler’s character asks if she could just spray Pam down there so the baby can just slide out. I told my boyfriend that you can sort of do that, just with vaseline every day to prevent any tearing. He asked how I knew, and I told him my gyno recommended it. MY GYNO. WHO I SAW TWO YEARS AGO. AND I JUST REMEMBERED!!! I felt so stupid!!! The answer to my vaginal pain was a $6 purchase from Walgreens!!! From then on, I put a glob down there every. single. day. I hoped and hoped and hoped this would actually work.\n\n2025 is now here and I promised myself that this is the year I have the pain free sex I needed. Guys. It happened. Of course there’s still some minor pain, but this is the first time in years that I DIDN’T BLEED FROM TEARING. Was there most likely a paper cut down there? Yes. But a paper cut compared to a full out tear is nothing to me. My libido is now starting to rise. I finally know what it feels like to not be in agonizing pain every time my boyfriend and I make love. I finally feel sexually free.",

This  happened a little over a week ago. Needless to say, I'm friggin' going through it.\n\nI'm in that, \"want him to see his mistake so badly\" phase still. Not only does that mistake include leaving me; Someone who still loves you very much, wanted to stay, work it out, acknowledges her role, and tries her best to respond that won't trigger you further. But I want you acknowledge the mistake you made and know that it is NOT OKAY to purposefully escalate an argument (because you're big mad), yell, scream, throw down your food in my car, make me so scared I asked if you were gonna hit me (in my heart I know you wouldn't but I was that scared), call my feelings a lie, say this is tit for tat, that you think I was being irritational so it illicited that kind of irrational reactive response, and refusing to believe that that response you gave me was a choice you made. You felt like you had no choice but to scream/yell/throw down your food/look at me with such disdain to communicate something to me. You felt like you weren't being heard so you did that instead and made me scared.\n\nYes, I know my part. I even told you as calmly as I could, apologized, asked what I could do better moving forward. BUT STILL you think I'm trying to attack you and your character. I kept telling you that wasn't my intention and I'm sorry. I blame myself so much for our break up even tho I get reminders from my friends and family saying it isn't just mine. I sincerely feel like if I just changed a few things despite your yelling at me we probably would still be together. I know it takes two and I put a lot of fault on me.\n\nAnd that same night, you said we're too different when it comes to resolving issues and that we should split up. And I said okay. Especially if you thought that reaction was okay. I asked if were to ever escalate like this again, is what you did something that might repeat. And you said yes because irrational things get irrational responses.\n\nI'm healing, and in a lot of those waves of processing, I'm ridiculously clinging on to any universal/spiritual/whatever the hell else will help you see your mistakes and come back to me. I still want your emotionally immature and aggressive ass back because one mistake doesnt have to define you, and as a whole, you are the best person I know that made me feel good about me, us, and you. But ONLY if you acknowledge that wasn't right and want to work on yourself and us.\n\nSo, back to that, \"any universal/spiritual/whatever the hell else will help you see your mistakes\", I found out that earthquake happened in your area. All I could think about was THAT WAS FOR YOU! How ironic that it happened in your exact neighborhood. After all the wishing/manifesting/begging to any higher power to some how get you to want me again, maybe that happening was some how related. My wishful thinking and hope is you saw and felt that as a sign to wake the fuck up, self-reflect, have that \"Oh shit I messed up\" moment, and just fucking call me already. I love you and I miss you.\n\nYes, I logically know no natural phenomenon happened because of one person's wish/hope/manifestations. But God damn does it still kinda feel good to think it does. Just give this to me, okay?!\n\nET: typos, clarification.",

It is his money and he does whatever he wants with his own money. We live together and do not share a bank account and have been together for 6 years so we are basically a partnership without the marriage. Anyway, today he told me he was going to get his car washed and I was like ok I am going to take a shower and then we can go get lunch when you get back. We went to lunch and when we got back home, I noticed his car was super dirty and actually was NOT clean on the outside. He told me he didn't \"wipe it off\" when he was finished with the wash. So he had like 2 chances to come clean, literally. Finally, after stewing upstairs, I went back downstairs and said where did you go. First he was like “why are YOU being like this”… then finally after asking over and over and telling him I know he didn’t get his car washed, he came clean. He said to get more baseball cards. He said he didn't want to tell me for fear of being judged... what is that?? I have been supportive of his hobby, he had a break scheduled this past weekend online and I was rooting for him, texting how I hope it goes well, :)! etc and just trying to be a supportive GF, what else am I supposed to do. Now he is LYING to me for fear of my reaction?! He did apologize but there is so much here to unpack now. Please tell me what to do and if I can get past this.

    "content": "Hi. I'm sorry for any mistakes as english isn't my first language.\n\nTW : SA / toxic relationship\n\nHello everyone. I just need to vent I think, and maybe get some advices from SA survivors here. I'm a 27yo (F) ans 7 years ago I got out of a relationship with my ex bf who was very toxic and SA'd me multiple times during the relation. I'm sorry if it's long I have a lot to say...\n\nTo make a long story short, we met through mutual friends, we were a very tigh group of 3 grils / 3 boys at the time. We kinda started it as \"sex friends\" and it was fun, I was 17 at the time, but he kept insisting for us to get together and I finally said yes. I knew he was not great for me and not great as a bf anyway, but I was young and stupid and though that it wouldn't be so much of a problem. For context, he was 18, already a father of a 2yo boy (whom I loved very much and grown attached with the time), was out of school since 15, and was unemployed. Yes I know, what a gem ! Told you I was very stupid. I was an high school student at the time and worked part time jobs.\n\nAnyway, we got together. It was kinda great for the first 3/4 months, and then I was very attached to his little boy. Looking back, I realize that I was drawn into an absolutely horrible relationship with an extremely manipulative man-child. But at the time, I didn't see this, I though he could get better, that I could make him better (jokes on me), that he was just a little immature, but it was way more than this.\n\nI'm not gonna go into alot of details because to be honest I don't remember everything that happened and I just washed it off my memory for most of it, but I'm gonna give you a few instances where he was very controlling :\n\n- He would go through my phone everyday, all day, asking about the guys I had on fb or insta, the guys I talked with, etc. Once he even texted one of my friends with whom I had a little sexy exchanges by texts MONTHS PRIOR to meeting him, making himself pass as my father saying that he couldn't text me anymore and if he did he would beat him up (mind you my dad is very peaceful, not the type to beat a guy up bcs his daughter had a little fling).\n\n- He threw tantrums when I talked to boys, any boys. He was extremely jealous and controlling watsoever, like once he walked me to the high school gate and saw me coming in, then he texted me and when I didn't respond (well I was in class) he bombarded my phone with texts and calls, until I answered one of them and let it go on so he could hear that I was in class. I started to tell my classmate what was happening ans made fun of him so he cut the call and started insulting me saying I was shaming him (I'm kinda proud of this one, bro if you're ashamed you know it was a shitty move!)\n\n- I was the one paying for everything, including HIS weed uptake (which was a lot). When I told him I couldn't once, he told me I was extremly selfish, stingy, and a manipulative lyer.\n\n- I found almost all his jobs for him, he couldn't last more than 2 weeks. He always threw tantrums over how it was so difficult, so tiring, needed more money, ect... He was always borrowing money from his mom. Btw he loved going out to parties, raves, taking drugs, so he was a spender. But never spent his own money somehow...\n\n- One time my mom found the bag of weed he hide at my place and she threaten to throw it away (which was false I knew that, I told her I'de be right back to take it, didn't told her it was his but told her it was mine instead, bcs why not take the fall for this b*tch of a man? Btw she knex I was lying). While I was gone to my mom's house, he texted her telling her that she had no right, that she had no idea how much it cost and how hard it was to get it, that she had no idea of ​​the value of money (the fckin AUDACITY) blablabla... I got in a lot of troubles for that. When I came back I almost threw hands at him, he was so condescendent.\n\n- He was invited at my dad house for a week (first time ever someone went there, not even my friends went before). He was very disrespectful and when confronted, he got upset and told me later that he though my dad was the one disrespecting him and that he was an horrible man and father (again, the audacity coming from someone who never even watched his son alone for an hour or gave any alimony.)\n\nWell I could go on like that for hours, there are so many instances here he was the bitchiest bitch that ever bitched, but I'm losing the point. To the assaults.\n\n- Once I woke up and he was, well, assaulting me, straight up. I told nothing and just let him finished. After this I never went to bed naked again, always covered with big sweatpants and a large shirt. That didn't stopped him.\n\n- He would force me to, throw tantrums when I wouldn't, manipulate me into having it, etc. Sometimes I would just cry during it and we would continue anyway. When I confronted him and told him it was assault, he went crazy, telling me that's accusations that can ruin someones life, ect.\n\nI'm not proud of it but I cheated on him. I was so, so miserable, not an excuse, I know, but it felt like the only time I was free. Well he discovered it. When he discovered it, he violently raped me. Very violently. To be honest, and that's also something that keeps me awake at night, I never saw him so hard than this day. I was crying so much, he punched me, then forced me to get down on him, then he threw me on the ground and got in me very hard and fast and finished quite fast. Oh btw, it was in a public place, like a little walk that went to a beach. There was no one but some passers-by and he wanted to do it in the middle of the road for everyone to see me \"because if you like it so much!\". I had to cry and beg for him not to and he finally did it behind a bush, not very hidden but better...\n\nI don't know how I could finish this story. It was the beggining of 8 months of absolute horror for me. I don't know why I stayed with him after this. in a way I felt like I was worthless, as if I deserved all of this. I really thought that no one could love me as much as he did, that he was the only one who could understand me, that I would be lost without him. I don't know how he managed to turn my brain around so much, but the truth is that I was unhappy. I drank and smoked a lot, I slept very little, I had sex I never wanted, I lost a lot of weight, I had a gray complexion and bags in my eyes. By the time he cheated on me, I was 20. And he didn't even had the guts to tell me he wanted to end it between us, the discussion went in a way that he kinda forced me to break up for him...\n\nWell very long story. All of it to say that I don't know how to process it still. I'm in a very happy relationship now, with someone great, who respects me and all women in general, and I love him very much, I know I'm gonna marry him someday. My problem is that I still think about it, it still bothers me in my intimate life. Sometimes it feels like I'm not in control of my own body and mind. I come one out of 3 times, sometimes I just freeze, sometimes after sex I cry so hard as if it was happening again even if my current partner is very gentle and aware.\n\nI went to a psychologist few years ago, but his advice was to start having sex with multiple partners even when I told him I couldn't even do it with someone I love. So it blocked me and I didn't went back. I'm starting a new therapy in a few weeks with someone new, I hope this will help.\n\nBut I still feel confused and stupid. Sometimes I think about it, I think about him, I want to cry. Sometimes I'm having a good time with my boyfriend and suddenly an image or a feeling comes back to me, and I still feel like I was 19, when I was abused regularly, when I had no power over my body or my thoughts, and I feel like I'm going back in time and that all the work I've done on myself hasn't changed anything. I feel so stupid I was with him for 2 and half a year and let him do all of this to me. He broke my trust, my body, my mind, how can someone so insignificant break me so much, for so long ? How come I'm now loved so much by a wonderful, amazing man, who has a wonderful family that accepted me as their own, and this doesn't erase all the scars ? I let a 18yo man child take 2 and half years of my life and ruin the 10 upcoming years, for what ? Why does this have still so much impact on my life and how I view myself and my sexual life ? I know he doesn't deserve all this attention, all this importance that I give him, and it's worse because I feel like in addition to having let him abuse my body, I'm still letting him abuse my mind and my sanity. I can't pass it, I can't forget it, I can't forgive it.\n\nThere is so, so much more to this story. So many details that added to my pain, like the fact that most of my friends stayed friends with him untill I had the courage to open up about what happened and cut contact with people that still talked to him after it. Like the fact that my \"\"bestfriend\"\" went out with HIS bestfriend, and then told me that if they get married, he would be her bf's groomsman and I had to deal with it. (She had been assaulted too, so she KNEW how it felt for me.) Even had to audacity to tell me \"he changed\". GFY.\n\nWell I'm sorry it was very long and all over the place, but I held this inside for so long. I don't care if no one reads it, at least it's out there. If anyone has tips on how you recover from this, if SA survivors can tell me that now they never think about their demons ever again, that they came back to normal, that they took back all the control, maybe it will give me a little bit of hope. I'm tired of living in the shadow of my own trauma.\n\nThank u for reading reddit. May the peace be with U !",

    "content": "I don't really have a place to go to explain how I feel aside from one person who didn't see the situation back then, and I'm worried over what the fall out could be.\n\nI (30f) dated someone a few years ago and the relationship then was traumatic to say the least, multiple health issues, the immaturity stemming from both of us, the lack of accountability. We frequently broke down into yelling matches or crying fits and arguments. Back then, I didn't know my attachment style, I was misdiagnosed, I had recently lost who I thought were my best friends. I felt neglected, abandoned, used etc.\n\nI told myself I'd never go back, that I hated them. But over the last few years the grudge fizzled out, they had apologized a sincere, genuine apology and I was caught off guard. I learned they went to therapy, they began to take life seriously, they started to use healthy skills. Quite honestly it's terrifying.\n\nI had moved on, I wrote them off as just a toxic person and then I see this completely changed individual, and I was honestly hurt that they started doing everything I had asked them for, everything I begged them for and questioned why they didn't when I was still around. I learned over the last few years sometimes people don't change until they hit rock bottom. We became friends again, arms length, cordial. I saw how they took responsibility, I saw them get their life together, I watched and learned as they became one of the healthiest people I have known. I'm proud of them for the growth they've gone through, while at times being melancholy that it was all I had asked of them.\n\nThat is until they talked about the kind of relationship they had wanted after another failed date, they ranted about the difference of needing someone versus wanting them, that they want a healthy balance and someone to wake up and make the choice to pick them not because they need to but because they want to. They apologized for the rant and laughed it off but I think I honestly fell back in love with them and it clicked right there for me. It's fucking terrifying.\n\nMy parents don't like them, my dad hates them that's for damn sure. A lot of my friends know what happened back then (emotional/financial abuse, toxic codependency etc) and while they believe people can grow and change, I know they would not give him a pass. I know they'd see the person who hurt me, not the growth.\n\nI'm terrified. I've seen this person grow, learn some damn hard lessons. I learned recently the catalyst of them going to therapy was losing me. I thought they'd reject me, I WANTED them to reject me so I could stop and get over my growing feelings because everything they described was everything I had wanted for years now. They didn't, they embraced me. They explained the passion they had with me, how they wanted to be better but didn't want to daydream of the chance they thought they'd never have with me again.\n\nThey hurt me years ago, I resent the person they were then. The person they are now though? I'm scared it's manipulation, they've had no inclination of it, I know I'm looking for some red flag to back out because I'm scared of getting hurt again. I can't find one, the only flags are ones from the past, and the growth they have gone through is not easy to fake (job change, physically healthier, financially stable, healthy communication and boundaries, everything they were not back then) and takes months of effort if not years.\n\nI want to give this a chance, I'm scared of being hurt, of the what ifs, or if it's just rose colored glasses. I'm hopelessly in love with the man they have grown to be, how can I make sure I don't have rose colored glasses on? Has anyone ever gone back to an ex years later when the first time they dated was an absolute shit show?",

    "title": "is it possible for me to reconcile with my ex?",
    "content": "When it all went down me and my ex were broken up for six months, he said that he didn’t have feelings for me anymore and he was dating other girls. One of his closest friends started showing up to my work to see and talk to me. We started to develop a friendship. We would talk about our feelings and how we felt about our past relationships (mind you he was on a break with his girlfriend when this happened). I thought i was over my ex and i really liked his friend even though the whole time i was thinking of him. One night while we were out his friend suggested we have drinks. One turned into another and i blacked out for a moment. While i was blacked out he convinced me to stay at one of his friends place. I don’t remember how i got there or how that happened. He made a bed for both of us, even though there were plenty of places for us to sleep separately. While we were sleeping i accidentally touched him and he took it as a “sign” that i wanted him. All we did was make out but he immediately wanted to have sex with me to which i disagreed to.\n\nAfter that we kept talking he kept texting me all day every day but i kept replying and i felt guilty. I told him i wouldn’t sleep with him because those were my boundaries and i had a past with sexual assault. Another night we were drinking and this was one of the worst blackouts ever. We were staying at one of bis friends place and i don’t remember anything till the next morning. We slept together but the only recollection i have of that is the worst. I only remember that i was in pain and when i told him he silenced me with his hand and at one point he took off the condom without me knowing. After that he told me i was the one who initiated it even though i don’t remember. Since i had been assaulted before i remember the pain my body was in for the longest time. And this was the same pain. I didn’t think much of it so we kept seeing each other but i told him strictly that nothing wont happened between us. After some while my ex found out through our friends because his best friend kept lying to him when he asked about it. My ex was extremely mad at him and of course me. Everything ended between me and his friend when he told me a lot of disgusting things about how he used the fact that i had feelings for him to have sex with me or how my body is not appealing and all of the other times he tried to fuck me were just because i was a hole to him.\n\nMy ex has been ignoring me since it all happened and i understand why. But im just so distraught because just recently i started to feel absolutely disgusting in my body after it all happened. Im not saying that he assaulted me but it still doesn’t sit right with me that i was so drunk that i couldn’t give him proper consistent consent. my ex doesn’t really know all of this and i want him to know and i want to reconcile with him. Because previously when i was dealing with all of the sexual assault he was always there for me. Am i even allowed to want comfort from him? Anyways im thinking of writing him a letter in which i will be apologising for my actions and also explaining what happened from my point of view. But considering the fact that anything sexual between me and his friend only happened while i was under the influence and dont really remeber anything, should my ex be really mad at me for that, considering i didn’t really have control over the situation? I think i still have feelings for my ex and it hurts me that we cant even say hi to each other. I know what i did was fucked up, but is there a chance we might reconcile?",

    "title": "Wtf!! I was contacted by a random man who claimed my best friend’s dad SA’d him and his GF about 35 years ago",
    "content": "This is going to be a doozy. I am so lost and wondering how tf I was thrown into this situation.\n\nI am writing this on a throwaway account just in case anyone I know personally comes across it. I am a 21M and I have known my best friend, Lou (22M) since middle school. His father, Gerry (54M) has basically been a second father to me since I met Lou.\n\nFor all I know, Gerry is the best man I’ve ever come across. He has done so much not just for Lou, but for me and I remember always coming to him if I had a problem with something. Lou and I attend the same university, and Gerry will always invite me to dinners/games when he visits, along with making sure I have everything I need.\n\nWhat happened last night might have been the most shocking thing of my life. I received a Facebook message request from this random man who I will call Mike. I decided to accept it and had to read the message a couple of times to comprehend wtf was being presented to me.\n\nThe message from Mike read: “Hello, my name is Mike. From looking at Gerry’s Facebook posts, I see that you are Gerry’s son’s best friend and thought initially contacting you about this matter would be better than contacting family. I apologize for the predicament that I’m about to place you in, but I cannot let Gerry walk free these many years later. I grew up right next to a famous university. When I was in high school, I started going to many college parties since they were nearby. One day, when I was 16 and my GF was 15, we had too much to drink and were approached by Gerry, who was in college. Both my GF at the time and I immediately were drawn to him. To us, he was the coolest and most vibrant individual. He eventually invited us to his apartment, and only my GF remembers us being sexually assaulted. We maintained a friendship with Gerry, and he would constantly invite us to parties and various other events. The last straw is when he invited us to one of his apartment parties he and his roommates threw. This was the first time he told my GF to invite her friends. All of her friends ended up being drugged and we were all sexually assaulted by him and his friends. That I remember since I wasn’t drugged and as drunk as when I first met him. We stopped answering his calls, and soon after my GF and I broke up. I buried the incident for many years until my nephew’s friend, who is going to school to be a therapist, brought up the fact I probably have repressed trauma and need to start seeing someone. For the past five months, I’ve been seeing a therapist, and I decided to contact you for my own sake. You may see Gerry as this wonderful man, but what he did to me, my ex-GF and her friends was immoral and disgusting. I don’t know what you will do with this message or if you will even tell Gerry or his son. You are a young man, and I think this is an important test for your morality and standing up for others. Whatever you decide, I wish you well.”\n\nI left him on read. I was too floored to respond. I want to think Mike is lying, but there is no reason for him to lie about this. I have NO idea if I should or how I should approach Lou and Gerry. I’m now questioning whether Gerry is the man I thought he was. Why would Mike contact ME though? What if some adults we looked up to and helped us through our darkest times were those who put others through their darkest times? I have so many questions and I hope someone can guide me. I can’t believe I have to deal with THIS on top of many other things…",

    "content": "I did not even know that getting filler in your temples was a thing. I know people get filler in their lips and cheeks but getting it in your temples sounds crazy to me.\n\nI've started seeing a guy. We are exclusive but we're taking things slow because both of us were cheated on in our previous relationships and last year was a rough year for both of us. His family lives in another province and it's still way too new for us to be meeting the family yet. A few weeks ago he went back home for a family member's wedding. He told me he showed some of his family a picture of us, which I am okay with.\n\nSo my boyfriend's younger sister, who has never met or even spoken to me, and has seen exactly 1 picture of me, sent something to my boyfriend's for me. When he got it in an email she told him it is a gift for me. No occasion, just a gift. It's a gift certificate for a med spa, for filler so I can get filler in my temples. She told my boyfriend that my temples are hollow and that filler will help. She even said she wishes I lived where she does so she could take me to her own injector, but since she can't she looked up an injector here for me. I didn't even know what she was talking about with my temples. My boyfriend didn't either and his sister had to explain it to him. The 1 picture she saw of me was from when my boyfriend and I went skiing. I had been wearing a helmet most of the day and my hair was messy. Based on that 1 picture she decided I looked awful (her word apparently) and needed this filler.\n\nMy boyfriend told her off and he didn't give me the gift certificate. Since it was only for filler and I couldn't use it for anything else or sell it we threw it out after he showed it to me. He told me about it later because he said he didn't want to hide anything from me and I needed to know if I ever met his family in the future. He said he doesn't know why his sister thought this was a good idea. Apparently she's never acted this way to his previous girlfriends and he talked to his older brothers and their wives and she's never said anything to them about filler and botox. My boyfriend told me she made a weird comment about my hair too - that I should fix my dishwaster blonde hair like his sister does. I don't know why she would dye her hair blonde when she's already blonde. I don't dye my hair but if I did it would be a different colour and not the colour I already am.\n\nI trust that my boyfriend handled it. He told her off and said he would reconsider her getting to meet me unless she changes her tune. I'm glad he told me. He said he didn't want me finding out from someone else in his family later in the future. He told me to ignore what his sister did but I don't even really know what she thought was wrong or how my temples need to be fixed. But one think I'm sure of us how rude and tone-deaf it is to tell someone you have never even met before they look bad and need filler. Like wtf is wrong with you? My boyfriend is still upset but I'm glad he didn't hide it or make any excuses for her. But I'm still stuck on who does such a thing?",

    "content": "Hi,\n\nSo basically as the title says I (24f) recently started dating this guy (28m) and with time we definitely started falling in love. It’s mutual, he seems to be a good match for me, really attentive, considerate and the communication is so good, basically everything I could be asking for. We are now on month 4 I think of dating and decided to make it official. I knew he had two long relationships (5 years and 2.5 years) and two relationships that lasted only a few months. His friends told me how he was so hurt in his past relationship because she “broke his trust and treated him badly at the end” and he many times said he can’t really trust so easily anymore because of his ex experience.\n\nA few days ago I pointed out that this age difference (2000 and 1996) is basically the biggest age gap I’ve had in a relationship but I think it’s fine. He was a bit hesitant to respond so I decided to ask him if he’s had a 4-year gap before and he revealed what shocked me: the 2.5-year relationship that he just got out of this summer but kept “talking” until October was an 18-year-old girl. So basically an 8-year gap: 18-26.\n\nI was disappointed because I personally can’t imagine seeing someone so young sexually or romantically and I’m not even 26 yet. Plus I’m ick a bit because this happens to be the age of my younger sister and I def can’t imagine her dating a 26-year-old.\n\nHe tried to assure me that it’s not as bad as it sounds, that they met because they used to go on vacation to the same place (typing this I start to think… did they just meet there when she was 18 or did he know her from before..?) They lived together!!! And that in his other relationships it was like only 1-2 years younger and not 8. He said he understands now that it sounds weird and stuff and that he is sorry that this makes me see him in a different light, that he isn’t creepy and “he can explain” (to which I said, explain what lol it’s pretty clear). And then he tried to tell me “yes but your friend met her boyfriend when they were 22 and 30 so it’s like the same” which weirded me out even worse. I don’t know what you guys think but I do think this is like, a little better than 18 but still not what I consider ideal but happy it worked out for them I guess.\n\nI really badly wish I didn’t know and that I could get past this, because apart from this everything is good. What do you think about this? Am I overthinking?\n\nTldr: found out the guy I date (28m) had the last relationship with an 18f while he was 26 and I wonder if this is weird in general or I’m too strict, because for me it kind of is. Anyway for me it is so weird to date someone freshly out of school into the adult life while you’re in the last half of your twenties and then claim they hurt you and were bad for you. But I really want to hear opinions.",

    "title": "I blocked my ex for 9 months because he made my SA worse somehow. broke no contact to tell him my trial had finally ended. I feel good",
    "content": "This happened a long time ago, 9 months ago to be exact. I was on and off with my boyfriend for 5 years because of family issues as first, but then his crippling avoidant behavior. We kind of became friends, but there was still love there, we just knew we couldn’t be together. 9 months ago I was assaulted by someone (not my ex) and since I had only been intimate with my ex, i reached out since the shame was less. (We also had a minecraft server together lol) He actually helped me validate what was going on due to the nature of the assault, and even took care of me as I was going through intense psychiatric treatment. He brought me food and medicine almost every day, since i was almost completely incapacitated (I was on 2 strong sedatives and an SSRI that was backfiring).\n\nThen one day he came over and tried to kiss and cuddle with me while I was exhausted, crying, and nauseous from the medication. At this point I could only stay awake for a few hours out of the day and was so grateful for his help. Idk wtf he was thinking, but I told him not to touch me and he still tried to cuddle me and comfort me. When i later tried to confront him he got triggered as an avoidant person (or maybe just as an asshole LOL) and started an argument with me that ended in, I kid you not, a psychotic break where I don’t remember the entire week afterwards. I needed to be sent to a hospital, but he was too busy yelling at me and then wallowing in self pity.  When he screamed at me and threw his phone across the room while I was sobbing, begging for help because I had lost my mind. When i assure you, I had dropped everything repeatedly to help him in his time of need. My life was in danger and he purposefully made my assault feel worse to spite me, and then wallowed in how bad he felt for the weeks after.\n\nAfter that I completely fell out of love with him because… what is there to love? and I dealt with all of my problems on my own. 9 months of doing it ALL on my own. I went to the police by myself, I made the report by myself, I got a therapist by myself, I got a SANE exam done by myself, I went to my trial and hearings by myself, I went to DV help centers by myself, I wrote my statements by myself, I sobbed in front of everyone at the trial recounting my worst nightmare BY MYSELF. did all of it for MONTHS by myself and didn’t even think about him.  I couldn’t be happier with who i am and what i’ve accomplished today.\n\nBut now, since I’m doing so much better and am over the immediate crisis in my life (the assault) i have the space to process what else happened. I am so resentful about how i was treated. At the lowest point of my life he brought me lower because of some “attachment style”?? Our relationship was gray when it came to labels, but I wouldn’t have confided in him if i had honestly thought he’d do any of that. He fed me for weeks, even bathed me, and then left me to die when he felt like he needed space. Now that i’ve healed for the most part from the assault, I have time to really think about his betrayal.\n\nI had him blocked for 9 months, the longest we’d ever gone without talking. He apologized profusely for what he did but I just couldn’t look at him and feel anything. No anger, no love, just indifference. He kept reaching out to see if I was okay but I was too exhausted to deal with him. So I blocked him. But now that my trial is over, these feelings are creeping up and in a moment of crazy I texted him that my trial verdict came out and that the nightmare was over. The best part? it’s been over 24 hours and he didn’t respond LOL. He hasn’t changed one bit, and I’m sure he’d do it all over again in a heartbeat.\n\nI didn’t have the energy to say anything more. Just that the verdict came out and to suggest that i did all of this, ALONE, because he was too much of a loser to show human decency. I’ve been treated so unfairly and i’m exhausted from being this big strong person. Im doing okay, but my appetites gone. I regret texting him only because I wasted precious time and energy by revisiting that traumatic period of my life.\n\nIf you’re reading this bub, puppy, or whatever else I called you, I loved you more than anything but i’ve never been happier now that you’re gone. not because of some force beyond your control, but because of decisions you decided to make repeatedly. I’m disappointed that you didn’t turn out to be the same loving person I knew as a kid, and I still remember how you’d take the train for hours just to see me for a moment. You had so many dreams and you chose smoking weed over your life saving medication that I fought to help you get. It’s a nightmare that you turned out addicted to drugs, a dropout despite a full ride, and tore yourself apart and me with it. I’ll never forgive you for abandoning me in my time of need. No apology you could make will be worth me hearing, because last time I checked, you only ever cared about how sorry you felt. Please don’t date anymore. not because i’m jealous, but because you need serious help if you can encourage people to die because “they deserve it and are pathetic” for being assaulted. No human being deserves the unique manipulative hate you’re infected with. Fix yourself. You are unrecognizable, but so am I. You don’t know me anymore, and if you ever see me in public, no you didn’t LMAO.",

    "content": "We have been friends since 4th grade. We've been friends for decades, and also she lives in a different state now we still try to catch up monthly through call or texts, and hang out when she visits home.\n\nI'm looking for a job currently as I'm about to graduate from my masters program, and the job market is incredibly tough these days in my field. I'm really struggling tbh. Many people have advised me to try applying through referrals as new grads are having a tough time securing internships and early talent roles. My friend works for a big company in a different field, that also has internship opportunities in my field. When she first joined the company several years ago, she would always tell me to let her know if I ever needed help finding a job, because she could give me a referral to her company. They apparently really value referrals, and hiring internally, and she always mentioned how she would be glad to support her friends in anyway she could.\n\nFinally, when I decided to take her up on her offer recently to ask her to refer me for the internships I've been looking at, she refused. Why did she refuse? Because she's worried about her \"performance review\" and somehow she claimed that giving someone a referral would cause her boss to evaluate her further which she doesn't want as she's already worried about her performance review.\n\nI'm really struggling to understand. How does giving me a referral for a fucking internship in a completely different field and in a different state altogether affect her performance review? The referral is just going to give my application a stronger chance of being looked at, not cause her to be \"evaluated further\" or ruin her performance review. If anything, the hiring manager will probably reach out to her to ask her about MY performance, and MY ability to do the job, not hers. But she was claiming that they might review her performance and try to see if she's a good employee too, which is bullshit. Even if they did do that, she's a good worker. She works hard, and she's good in her work. From what she's told me, it seems like her coworkers would agree. So what's the problem even??\n\nI can't believe that our friendship of so many years has amounted to just this. It feels so fake. So shallow. So hypocritical too. Why offer to give me a referral if you aren't going to follow through on that? Why try to paint yourself as a supportive friend who wants to help if you're not actually willing to do anything?\n\nI've made new friends recently who easily gave me referrals to their companies, yet my best friend from 4th grade can't even do that much. Back when we were in school/undergrad, I was literally her emotional support animal and I helped her so much back then, and in the end when I really need something, she can't even do that much even though it would take 5 minutes out of her day, and would have little effect on her, but instead would help me a lot. Instead she makes up some dumb unbelievable excuse. At least make up a better excuse girl. Say the referral portal isn't working or something. I'm not an idiot that I would fall for such a stupid reason.",

He's a big guy so people rarely mess with him, I didn't think he was even capable of fighting.\n\nHowever a few days ago we went to one of his friend's places for a chill gathering. One of the host's friends showed up drunk off his ass and was jovial but raising his voice and yelling and talking over everyone.\n\nHe didn't seem angry or aggressive but he was being \"jolly\" to a belligerent level. He was touching everyone and my husband looked really uncomfortable as he is touch-averse, even with me. We can't cuddle for more than a few minutes without him getting prickly.\n\nHe came over to my husband and offered to shake his hand, and my husband held up a hand and said \"I'm good, thanks\". This seemed to only spur on the drunk guy who went to reach out a hand to put on his shoulder. My husband took a step back and said \"I'm not messing around, don't touch me\" and his face just looked dark like I've never seen it before, he was breathing hard and balling up his fists. The other guy wouldn't take the hint and went in for a hug.\n\nIt was a complete blur, I was looking directly at him and I barely saw what happened, there was just a loud pop and a crack and the drunk guy collapsed, totally unconscious. My husband stepped over him and walked outside and everyone was trying to wake the guy up. He started shaking and groaning and ended up having to go to the hospital because he had a seizure.\n\nMy husband was just sitting outside on a bench staring off into space and smoking a cigarette. I'm not going to lie, I went off on him and was yelling and screaming and he just didn't react at all. He just said \"I told him not to touch me\". The next morning when i cooled off I asked him again and he gave me the same answer. I asked him if he even felt bad and he said \"no, why should I?\"\n\nLike.. I get not wanting to be touched, but the complete lack of remorse or even caring about the guy's health is terrifying to me. He got a call from the friend who hosted the gathering today, telling him the guy he punched was going to be okay. My husband just said \"why are you telling me? It's kinda not my problem\". Like YES IT IS. Is he some sort of sociopath who just was really good at hiding it? NOBODY does that. I'm actually scared of him now and have been sleeping on the couch the last 2 nights. I can't believe I never saw this before, how could I be so stupid? He was never shy or timid, he was just emotionless.\n\nEdit 2 (first one is in the comments)\n\nTo summarize, the police came and took his statement. I was shaken by what happened initially and reacted out of fear and anxiety and said some stupid, selfish things. The last few hours I spent cuddling his chest and just being there physically. He didn't freak out or get uncomfortable and I asked him if it was okay quite a few times. I apologized that he had to go through that and told him I know he was upset and I freaked out, and it must have been really difficult for him to be in that situation, feeling so cornered and violated.\n\nI reassured him that everyone reacts differently. I told him what happened scared me but he was within his rights to do it and I just needed some time to work on my emotions regarding it. I made it clear that if someone were doing the same thing to me, I wouldn't be upset if he did that to them and that I was being hypocritical when I got upset with him because of that.\n\nTurns out that the majority were right. It was a trauma response. His dad beat him until he was bigger and stronger than his dad, and then his dad turned on his younger brother. When he was 18, my husband nearly beat his father to death before taking his little brother who was 12 years old away from that terrible home.\n\nA couple people were wondering how big he is. He's 6'4 and 275. The drunk guy was nearly as tall as him but not as bulky but clearly could have been a threat.\n\nMy husband's 30 now, and he said that's the last time he laid hands on anyone and would never do it unless he had good reason, certainly never with me. And I believe him! He let down his shell and cried to me. And I told him I'd be there to support him if he just needed some time, or if he wanted to pursue therapy. The comments saying he deserved better broke my heart. I want to be better.\n\nHe got another call from the cops who said they're closing his case because there's nothing there - friend would be guilty of simple battery and my husband would be guilty of aggravated battery, but it's roughly equal since the other guy instigated and my husband was literally backed into a corner. Drunk felt really bad and didn't want to pursue anything. Thank God.\n\nBut yeah, my husband admitted he went too far without me needing to say anything. He said he wasn't proud of what he did but he felt so embarrassed he played it off as indifference to save face in front of me. I told him he didn't need to, that I've seen him at his worst moments and never judged him before and I'd do my best to change this situation for the better. I just kept apologizing and once the tears started coming out I held him and let him cry for a long time.\n\nWe are going to be okay. Everything is going to be okay and I'm going to be with him every step of the way.\n\nEdit 3: Comments were locked for no reason and with no explanation.

    "content": "i dont really even know what im gonna bullshit about but i just really wanna get some shit off my chest. im 16 so everything im about to just shit out might seem like just puberty bullshit, but frankly i dont really care if it is. ever since i was a child, i always hated myself. it was in a way that made me force my parents to remove my mirrors from my room, put on a matte screen protector on my laptop and phone so i wouldn't see my reflection from them and avoid pictures or showing skin. i havent been to the beach in over 2 years because frankly, the idea of everyone seeing my body thats basically just a bag of bones makes me wanna bury myself under the sand and never come out. its really not even new, in our home or in my parents galleries, youll find only a few pictures of me from the ages 10 to now, and those are the pictures i was forced to be a part of. i hate group photos too, everyone else looks so much better than me and im just standing there with dark circles under my eyes looking like im the fucking enderman if he was a sex offender. a few weeks ago, i saw a picture of my side profile that was taken in school (i wasnt aware of it, ofc) and i saw just how fucking hideous my nose looked. i went home and cried for hours straight. it looks so out of place to the point that it makes me wanna burn my whole fucking face off. i see the beauty in everyone else but myself. people tell me that im overreacting and that im not ugly but i dont believe it one bit. beauty is subjective, sure. but when it comes to me im rather %100 sure that its an objective fact that im ugly. sometimes when im out with my friends or family i think to myself, are they not embarassed to be seen hanging out with me? i struggle with going out alone and school too, especially school. im repeating the 9th grade because in my first year of it, i slept the whole day at school because i just did not wanna show my face. whenever someone commented on my body like \"oohhh your so skinny\" id have to hold myself back from making the nastiest comment i could come up with. its like no im not fucking starving myself, i eat a ton of food thats extremely high in calories and stuff and would make a normal person obese, but it doesnt do anything to me. now, if i was born in the gender i identify as, then id have no problem with this. id be like \"damn baby im 186 cm and 52 kg?? sign me up to every modeling agency you can find 😍😍😍\" but no i was born a man, its lame and boring. i could go on even longer about how bad i feel about myself but i wanna rant about just life in general now. life feels like a burden to me. i see everyone around me, going out at night, doing fun and risky stuff while im in bed playing some dumb gooner visual novel game and wondering why the fuck the only friend i really consider myself close with lives 7 hours away from me. im 16, yet i feel like ive lived way longer. days either go by extremely fast or painfully slowly for me, theres no normal inbetween. i hate school too. i always feel out of place in school, and i always have. ever since i was 6 when i started school, id always just wanna not go. there were days id sit infront of the toilet for hours trying to make myself sick so i wouldnt have to go to school for a few days and not see anyone. now, theres a fix for this. of course there is. im not fully out of place in any school in the country. but in my city? i dont fit in to any of them. the city i live in is quite big, like the second or third biggest city in the country. yet, i have not found more than 2 people who i actually click with and dont get bored of. but of course, gods cruel and doesnt want me enjoying shit so he made sure that those 2 people would have a replacement for me that they would prefer over me any day. sometimes i think its my fault for feeling like this, considering the shit im interested in literally consists of gore, doing nothing, plotting against people and so on. sometimes even i make fun of myself like \"yeah ok bud you like gore your so cool and edgy yeahhhhh\" like i get how cringe it is and shit. also im not good at anything except for english. english is truly the only thing ive managed to succeed in life, having nearly the same english knowledge level as all of my english teachers, even tho ive taught english to myself. but thats like the only thing im good at. heres a funny yet unbelievable story, one of the only reasons im alive right now is because i couldnt tie a knot when i wanted to hang myself. i still dont know how to tie a knot either, nor how to tie my shoes. its like mad embarassing and it pisses me off but i just cant learn it no matter how much i try. also im basically an unwanted child. my dad made this very clear as hes very open about how he didnt even want a second child and he would be fine with just my sister, but my grandparents wanted another grandchild. and thats literally the only reason i was born. sometimes i think my parents would have been better off with just one kid too. i mean my sisters fucking amazing. she landed in like basically one of the top 3 best high schools in our city after getting only 1 question wrong in her high school entrance exam. for reference, the highest you can score in the high school entrance exam here is 500. she got a 498 or 497, i got a 310. shes now in one of the best private universities in the WHOLE country studying computer engineering with a 100% scholarship and interning for huawei, while i struggle to do simple math and im struggling to pass my 2nd year of 9th grade. its just fucking embarassing. i cant understand shit no matter how hard i try, so i dont know where ill end up in the future. the only classes im good are in are deadass german and english, ive literally failed fucking arts. suicide crosses my mind every second. i dont think i fear death anymore even. i find it rather comforting and im waiting for it to just happen already. i just fear whats gonna come after. like 2 weeks ago, one of my classmates choked me as a \"joke\" and he didnt let go because he thought i didnt mind or something (in reality he really probably just wanted to hurt me and i hope he fucking dies.) but in reality, i was basically blacking out. but i didnt struggle against him one bit, no. i just let him choke me from behind, hands in my pockets, just waiting for the sweet relief of death to come. now, i know that sounds like a lie but think of this, what would i get out of lying to random strangers on the internet? if i wanted attention i could just slit my wrists and tell everyone that im struggling and id soak in their attention. i loathe that said classmate so much. he hasnt really done anything bad to me, and people think im overreacting but i dont care. i feel everything strongly, and its easy for me to want to absolutely despise someone over the smallest thing ever. i dont know why but that brings me to another topic, my mindset. ever since i was a child, i didnt care about justice unless it affected me. i didnt care about anything unless it affected me, no regrets for anything i did unless i came out harmed at the end of it. notice the pattern? i only cared for myself. i still do. theres literally one other person i care about in this planet and thats my best friend, but shes a whole different story because i truly believe that shes my soulmate. i never had a line for what was wrong or right. unless the wrong or right action was being done to me, of course. when it came to others, there was no line. i simply just did not care, i still dont. for example, if you came up to me and said something absolutely traumatising happened to you, i wouldnt care. i wouldnt feel empathy towards you. but if said thing happened to me, id want all the attention, all the empathy, all the pity. i dont really want to change the way i am lol, i just wrote this last part so nobody would really feel bad over everything else written because im not someone worth worrying over (but at the same time i kinda am so yeahhh 🫠🫠)  i would still go on cause i have a lot more to say, but i need to take a huge, gigantic shit. so this is the end for now.",

    "content": "This is my first relationship (F25) because I was never able to fall in love or bond properly. My boyfriend (M23) is a good man and he takes care for me, prioritises me, always makes sure I'm well mentally and emotionaly, always buys me flowers and plans dates regulary, he always wants to see me and everyone around us see that he really loves me. See all those things I have listed down? I barely do any of that. We were supposed to meet today (he planned it, as always) but I canceled cause I have \"University things to do\", which is true, but I ended up watching Bojack Horseman for hours and now I'm writing this stupid post. He always puts his plans away if it means he will see me for 20 minutes, but I never do. Now you will probbably think I don't like him, I do, it's just that I feel emotionaly crippled and tired to do all that. And sometimes I'm afraid he is going to get bothered that I'm not putting any efforts so he is going to draw back as well. I absolutely love being around him, I'm happy, I'm always touchy with him and all that in love stuff, but as soon as I'm alone its hard to get me out of that alone state. I never miss him, I never miss anyone actually, but I do enjoy being around him and others when they are there. I don't even know what my problem is. I think that deep down, I just think everyone is going to leave anyways so I never put in any efforts, because if I did and they leave, it will break me. Or I just don't like him as much as he likes me? I think everyone that loves me, loves me because they can use me in a way, they love me because the way I make them feel is good, and because of that I always feel used. I think I just want to be alone. I don't know. But hey, its off my chest now.",

I had a female calico cat that was a one year old, I got her a year ago, that I had gotten certified as an emotional support animal for my depression and other behavioral issues. My stepmom (40F) didn’t want her coming over cause they had gotten a dog… literally three days ago. Apparently before I came over, in December, I don’t know what they discussed but they discussed about my cat coming over… mainly my stepmom did apparently.\n\nYesterday, they took her to Walmart… with my reluctant permission because they wouldn’t let her inside the apartment because they already had a puppy. They told me she couldn’t because some relatives of my stepmom’s were allergic and no one else could take her in on my or my dad’s side. I tried looking but no one wanted her either. They said they gave her to a lovely couple at Walmart. I’m still heartbroken and don’t know what to feel but I feel like I can’t trust my parents anymore when I wanna come home. They said she’s replaceable but I don’t feel like she is… she was my baby… I got her when she was a four month old… I don’t know how to feel at all since they gave her away yesterday night.",

When I first got read it, it was something fun to scroll through and maybe add a few comments. It's always fun to do that sort of thing and hopefully end up on one of those YouTube videos. So then I started joining more communities and posting and got mixed reviews. Some of it commenting on my lack of punctuation, despite the fact that I use voice typing to make things easier. I am blind and anyone that hates on me for something I can't control because on it I always respond to them saying as much. Sometimes they respond to me saying it's no excuse for something. Also, it has helped me find stuff that I didn't know where it was. Earlier I made a post about something that happened where my cat threw up and I asked my mum to clean it up because I am blind. I don't know how to and I got lots of negative comments that I responded to all of them explaining my reasoning for my my mum cleaned up the cat sick and I haven't had any response from any of that. I made another Reddit post saying about what happened. I won't mention the specific subreddit but it rates whether or not you are the bad guy but in more foul terms and people were not on my side on there saying that I shouldn't have my cat which is really upsetting. Considering that my cat is one of my closest friends and I always have her around for comfort. I hate looking like I am playing the disability card but it's so annoying having so many ignorant people commenting on my post not knowing what's actually going on. I know I will probably get some negative comments over here as well, but it just makes me so sad and I know that it's pointless to argue with ignorant people but it just frustrates me so much. I have also been banned from subreddits for not providing good enough visual images for them and I have asked for the mod team to appeal the ban and they responded saying that they wouldn't and blocked me. I wish some people on this site would learn some more respect than hating on me for just being me. I get some support in the blind subreddit but that is practically the only one. Now one of the people that was being cruel to me has found a post on another community that I put up for support and is now sending me hate food at.

    "content": "Quick backstory: my husband and I got the news back in January 2024 that my father-in-law had terminal pancreatic cancer. He was given 3 month to live. Engaged at the time with our wedding planned for September 2024, we decided to go to the courthouse so my father-in-law could be our witness. He ended up making it to both the courthouse ceremony and our big wedding 🙏🏼. He made it 14 months, when he was only given 3.\n\nMy mom tells me I haven’t cried properly because I’m focused on making sure my husband is okay. His funeral is has not happened yet, because he is being cremated. My husband is the youngest of 7 so everyone has been coming by my mother-in-laws to make sure she’s doing okay and not alone. Well she came over to our house tonight because she didn’t want to cook and we were happy to spend time with her. She’s been to our house only 2 other times. Seeing her, it just broke my heart that I have my person next to me while hers was taken away. She was talking about how she’s not sleeping and how certain everyday things make her miss him. My father-in-law was the father I wish I had. I feel guilty for not being able to cry. I listen to stories about him and it makes me laugh but also feel sadness.\n\nA thought I had was that I’m also on Zoloft and I don’t think I’ve cried once while being on it. I don’t know if it’s a side-affect but I just wish I could cry. When my husband breaks down, I just hold him and wish I could cry with him. I don’t want him to think I’m not heartbroken. He’s told me how much of a rock I’ve been for him. Maybe there’s still a part of me that doesn’t think it’s real. I don’t know. It feels like a sneeze that keeps being held in. When we got the news I felt that I had to be the strong one, but now, I just want to grieve on my own but I can’t and I don’t know why.",

I am 24 years old.\n\nI was still a kid back then, so I missed a lot of the issues my parents had with family. Most of my memories, especially with my grandparents are positive. I remember him secretely shoving money in my pockets, or he used to collect coins over the year to give us grandchildren when we wanted to visit the fair in town.\n\nThe last time I saw my grandfather before, must have been around 8 years ago when he was in hospital for a heart surgery.\n\nPast few weeks were tough, cause my grandpa would be in hospital with countless of illnesses. Diabetes, COPD, dementia, his roommate infected him with the norovirus too. My grandpa didn't react to any of the antibiotics anymore and it looked really bad for him. My uncle called my mom last week thursday telling her, the doctor said everyone who wants to see him, should visit that day because he won't be doing it for much longer.\n\nMom, dad and me left work early to drive to see my grandpa. It was horrible, compared to how I remembered him. He looked really bad and wouldn't even talk anymore. He was just laying there in his bed, staring on the ceiling, not reacting to anything. My mom was devastated and it hurt me seeing her like that, but also it kind of broke me too. Seeing my grandpa like that was shocking.\n\nAt first my dad said, after us being in there for a few minutes, we should leave the room to give my mom and my grandpa some time, for her to say goodbye. This already hurt me, I understand him but like, I wanted to say goodbye too.\n\nAfter a while, my mom messaged me that my grandpa wants to see us. We entered the room and he still wasn't talking, but he reacted now. He was looking at us. I walked to his bed, put my hand on his shoulder and said \"Hi, grandpa!\", he looked at me, smiling big saying \"Hello princess!\". And I teared up.\n\nThat was the first thing he said since being in hospital, and one of the last things he said. I didn't even think he would still remember me due to his dementia, but not only did he remember me, he even started talking again, the first words after him being in such a bad condition were towards me.\n\nWe left when my mom asked him if he was tired and wanted to sleep, which he nodded to. When we left, we all said \"sleep well and get well soon, so we can bring you cake next time we visit.\", he laughed and nodded excitedly.\n\nWell, on saturday he passed.\n\nEven though I haven't had much bonding the last decade, I was devastated. It was the first death of someone closer to me. And especially with what happened at the hospital, it was hard for me too.\n\nI was actually planning on going clubbing that night, but I wasn't in the mood at all. I had a phone call with my dad, and told him I wouldn't go out and he just didn't understand it. He only said I haven't had that much of a relationship with him and I should rethink going out.\n\nThis conversation just felt like I didn't have the right to grieve. My dad also never checked in on how I am dealing with it all. Feels like shit and I feel embarassed to be hurting like that after what my dad said.",

I can be entirely financially stable with a perfect partner, perfect friends, work my dream job, live in my dream house and it still makes me upset thinking about it. I don’t want weekly phone calls, I don’t want daily phone calls, I can barely handle not talking to them when they’re working. When I’m with my friends I want to be with my parents, I always prefer hanging out with them. I can’t be excited for summer, I don’t want to go into my senior year, I hate reminders of time passing. I cry about my sibling being in college even though we haven’t been close since childhood. I can’t relate to any media about people my age because it’s all about “getting out,” I don’t want to get out. I think they’d be fine with me staying after high school, even into my early 20s, but it’s not societally acceptable and it just wouldn’t be the same, and it’s not like I want to totally miss out on all those experiences. It’s not a “not doing work” thing, I don’t think I’d mind a 9-5 unless it’s a job I really hate. I can sit down and do work, I enjoy doing schoolwork, I do extra online classes and study recreationally, I get good grades, I like feeling productive and fulfilling expectations and whatnot. But I want to come home and sleep in my bed in my parent’s house. I’m terrified that this feeling will continue into my adult years and I’ll never truly be self-sufficient. I’m in therapy, but even there she wants me to form goals for my future and none of them I feel strongly towards. Like I don’t even have motivation for school, I rely on enjoyment or deadlines because doing assignments leads to graduation, and graduation leads to college, and that means moving out and growing up. I was also really independent even as a kid, I could take care of myself and everything around me perfectly fine, I still can, but now my relationship with my parents is actually good now and I don’t want to let go of it. I still can’t communicate this to them though, or really anyone but anonymously online because of how embarrassing it is. Like, I can barely tell them I love them because our relationship has been strained for so long and I’m still a very independent and avoidant person. I just feel so alone in this. I know exactly what I need to do to feel better, but it doesn’t change that I still don’t want to leave.",

    "content": "Warnings: physical & verbal abuse\n\nThe story is long. You can grab a cup of tea. It's my first time posting it.\n\nI'm 18 years old and from Almaty, Kazakhstan. I'm in my senior year of high school. I knew that I was gay since my pre-/early- teens and I'm long time atheist.\n\nI first had sex last summer when I was 17(age of consent is 16). Since then I had some 15-20 (safe) hookups(I'm sex positive). I went to a clinic specialising in HIV treatment and prevention in September once I turned 18 to get PrEP. It was all behind my family's back up until they discovered the box for PrEP in early October, which I forgot to hide.\n\nAll abuse ensued after that starting point. I live with my mum and my brother left for college, so he's home on his breaks. My father has been living separately for the past 12 years with his new wife and kids. They're all Muslim and bigoted. I had a fight with my mum and my brother was a mediator. I was told it was wrong and that I'd never be accepted as I am. A few days after that my mum and my father picked me up from school, which never happened before. They were shouting, threatening and pushing me for 15 minutes non-stop. They were ruthless. I was traumatized at that very moment. When we got back home, I didn't want to go inside and was followed and beaten 3 times (punched in the stomach, kicked between my legs and slapped in my face) by my father while my mum was watching. There were strangers passing by and I was shouting, so my mother told me to shut up since I was \"embarassing\" them.They let me go and I spent the evening at my grandma's with my grandma, my uncle and aunt. They were not happy, but they are, for the most part, enablers of my parents. My mum picked me up at night and we went home. No relative supports me as of now.\n\n(There were 8 years of domestic abuse history in my family. My father was the perpetrator and my mum the victim. He was never reported. My mum hates him, but thinks that we, his children, should socialize with him. I usually see him once a month. It has become much harder to tolerate his presence and I'm afraid and alert around him.)\n\nI knew that reporting them to police would make matters worse and I'm still to finish high school. Police very often works backwards and not just in here. I was advised by my Polish friend(I met him in August and we still video call every week) and my close friends to feign change of character and try to make peace with them. I was very much disgusted by this notion, but it was the only way at that moment. They accepted my apology and my \"confession\". They still see me as untrustworthy, but they tolerate it.\n\nI found a channel of Dr.Ramani and it helped me somewhat to make sense of all that happened and learned about DARVO(Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim & Offender). They used this tactic all along. I feel contempt and disgust towards my family. I made up my mind. I never want to see them again, as soon as possible. I feel unsafe around them and I don't know what will happen to me, if I stay stick around them in the next few years. They insult me, threaten me, disregard my input, never see me as an equal and want to maintain their control over me.\n\nI want to study nursing in English abroad. My father is controlling and doesn't want me to be far-away and be \"Europeanized\" in his words(liberated and proud). My mum was supportive of my ambition, so I applied and was rejected from one scholarship. I can still apply to a few more unis, but now she doesn't want me to study abroad and insists on me studying in the same uni as my older brother in Astana(the capital of Kazakhstan).\n\nThe university (NU) is the best in the country and teaches all subjects in English. I have BS Biology(4years) or BS Medical Science(6 years) as options and I dislike both of them. I aspire to work as a nurse in either Belgium or Iceland(I know, nothing is easy, but it's good to at least try). There are nursing programs in Kazakhstan, but they are usually 2 years long and aren't well recognised. I'd have very hard time emigrating with that kind of education. I don't want to stay in Kazakhstan as I'm very afraid of them abusing me again and if I cut contact, they might track me down or report me as missing and trap me.\n\nI kept hooking up from time to time through Grindr. I met a French man who's much older than me in late October. He stays here for work-related reasons. We became good friends since then. He's such a good person that it makes me speechless. I have warm feelings towards him and would like to keep in touch with him. Not gonna lie, he's the boyfriend material, but only time will tell what it will lead to.\n\nIn the meantime, I want to make a plan of what to do next. I had thoughts of doing Au Pair work this summer in the recent past, but was discouraged by my family. Since then I met this French friend and started to learn French. I believe that doing Au Pair in France for a year or two would be beneficial, as I would be able to learn French to a decent level and feel safe and less alone with the host family next to me after I'll go no contact with my family.  It'd be much cheaper than studying in a language school only where I'd have expenses such as housing, medical insurance, commuting, groceries and so on. My French friend and I would still be able to see each other a few times a year or more often if/when he's finished with his work here.\n\nI'll ask him soon, if he'd be willing to sponsor my visa process and a flight ticket or not. I'd be somewhat upset if it's not to materialize, but would never hold a grudge against him, as I like him for who he is.\n\nIn case he agrees, I have plenty of concerns of how it'd work. Nothing is as easy as a piece of cake.\n\nI'd need to tell the prospective family of the facts that they'd never get to know my family and that I will not turn to them for help. Also, probably introduce them to my French friend. All of which is far from the usual arrangement and maybe no family will be down for it.\n\nAs there's mandatory conscription in Kazakhstan, I'd need to reach out to the French embassy and local military office to find out whether attending the language classes while working as an Au Pair would count towards my advancement in education. One can delay their conscription by continuing their study abroad or finish their training while attending a university in Kazakhstan. In case it counts towards it, I'd need to have some proof of my studies by August as conscription starts in September.\n\nI'd need to time my departure really well, since I should get my high school diploma in mid June and visa application can take from 1 to 2 months. Also, all of it must be done without my family's knowledge and they'll believe that I'm going to the uni in Astana in early August. If I leave them soon after graduation to live with my French friend, then they might report me as missing to the police and even accuse me of something bad I haven't done to get me back. If I'll be reported as missing it might complicate or make my movement, visa process and departure impossible. I'd not be surprised by police looking for me and detaining me to their office to give me back to my family without my consent or listening to me. I might be able to go to uni in Astana in August and leave then, as they'd have harder time knowing where I'm specifically. My brother studies there, so he'd be able to check on me and tell my parents, if I left uni. Also, to get visa I'd need to give my passport to the French embassy for a long time in which case my family might find that I don't have my passport with me and interrogate me. It's possible to take a train to Astana, so maybe it's possible to circumvent it.\n\nI know that you guys can't in most cases give me solid advice on most things. Still, I'd appreciate any insights, your own experiences or just support. Be it going no contact, immigrating when you're very young and so on. Please write in good faith. You can give me constructive criticism if you have any. I'd welcome it.\n\nHopefully, I'll make an update.",

    "title": "I Feel Like I'm Losing My Sense of Self...",
    "content": "It’s like…so strange. I have always been a people pleaser due to “anxious attachment” from toxic people in my life including my dad and his side of the family. I was also crazy bullied for being on the overweight side with frizzy hair in elementary school (which has now caused me to straighten my hair all the time and have an eating disorder).\n\nMy anxious attachment comes from, as my therapist says, being left by my dad and judged by the toxic family members in my life that I can’t imagine abandoning them the way they emotionally abandoned me. I feel like there may be deeper reasons that I don’t necessarily know, but I know it’s childhood acute trauma.\n\nI react horrible to rejection, whether it’s friends saying no to hanging out, loss of people in my life, or asking to get to know a guy. and every time I make a new acquaintance or “friend,” I am already wondering if they’ll betray me and how I can betray them back if they try something on me. I wouldn’t consider myself a bad person by any means, and most people in my life tend to think positively of me. I’m just way too gone in my brain and lost in thought that I feel like I don’t know who I am. I feel like I need to work on myself but I don’t know how or where to start or if it’s too late for me to change.\n\nI feel in a way trapped because I’m over here trying to make an impact, be useful in this world, but nothing tends to “go my way.” I don’t have many friends, never been to a cool party, no boyfriends, and I barely have a fashion sense (but my friend has already agreed to help me out style wise). I’m 18, and I don’t know what’s happening, probably a mid-teen crisis 😭 I need to have some more control over myself, mentally and physically, but I’m actually physically stuck right now because I just had wrist surgery and I can’t get my drivers license for another 2 months. I can’t be independent, and I want to feel like I don’t owe anybody anything, but I’m scared my friends and family will dislike me if I change in any way. What if I feel like I improved but my family thinks I’m more depressed than I already am? What if I’m gonna be judged by people around me? What if everybody just thing I’m ugly, stupid, and deserve to be alone? I’m so afraid of being alone in life, even though my mom’s side of the family has always been by my side. But this is a thing I have to fix and I don’t know how. I don’t want to end up by myself with nobody around me.\n\nI know that’s like a…stupid reason to feel so lost in life because of elementary school bullying that no longer exists and having your dad leave you, but man does it suck to not understand yourself, your purpose, who you are besides your own name. I feel so alone yet so supported but why do things never happen my way? Like I’m so kind and I never get anything in return other than loss of people around me.\n\nIf anybody has any advice on where I can go from here, how to find a sense of self and feel loved rather than rejected, to heal and not hurt from past acute traumas…please help out. I’m desperate. Thanks. Sorry this is a bit long",

I have heard many MIL horror stories so I am glad to get along so well with Daria.\n\nJosh and I had a bit of an embarrassing situation over the holidays when we were overheard being intimate by Daria (we didn’t realize she was home). I apologized and she was very cool about it, and told me not to ever be embarrassed about that, that sex is natural, etc. After that she started being more open about sexuality with me and sexual topics, saying how important sex is in a marriage, etc.\n\nI learned that Daria has only had sex with her husband - he was her first everything. She has asked me questions about what it’s like to be with different men, how men are different, etc. She has started to see me as the sexually experienced one and almost looks up to me if that makes sense?\n\nI like these conversations but I’m wonder if it’s not appropriate to go there with her. I know her heart is in the right place but she’s learning a lot about me! I don’t mind sharing, and maybe I’m overthinking, but I’ve been wondering if it’s too much.",

Pretty much the 'good lottery' when it came to that. Growing up I hardly had to do much, because everything I asked for was served to me in a silver platter.\n\nMy mom was a respected teacher and my dad has a ranch so never had any sort of money problem either; no matter what I did my parents cheered and if I did something wrong I got lighter punishment than other kids might've had.\n\nSo, if I had all of these, why I sound like I'm complaining? Because I can't take their expectations anymore, because they hurted me even if they didn't mean to, because being the golden child has been a burden. They always have such high, almost unreasonable expectations from me and I'm not sure I can make them. I'm not great at work because they usually made my homework, I can barely clean my room because they did it for me, I don't have any friends because they shield me from the outside due to fear of me getting hurt.\n\nI love my parents, but I just wish they had realized that all their love did was turn me into an incompetent adult, someone who's going to crash and burn, hard, and the idea of disappoint them is worse than the feeling of being a completely useless person.",

It’s been a few months and we all just kinda deal with Tod and accept he’s creepy, he’s stopped touching anyone after a talking to and that’s that.\n\nWell NOW our store manager has promoted Tod to be a supervisor even though all of us expressed how absolutely wrong that would be and how none of the women feel comfortable around him as it is now. When my shift found out every single one of us including three managers wrote our two weeks notice together listing the reason why with all of our signatures. Our new GM said the process can’t be stopped because he’s already in training and our Store manager basically said oh well suck it up I need bodies.\n\nAt first I was pissed he called bluff on us and wrote out another formal resignation and then thought about it and decided nah that means they win, so instead I’m going to make there lives miserable from this inside.

Suddenly I saw a notification pop up on instagram and boy that message was thirsty, the message was from my mothers childhood male friend, although I shouldnt have opened the chat(curiosity kills the cat) I read the chats and my heart skipped a beat when I read what kind of messages that guy sent. I do not want to get in detail but he said he missed the intimate moments when they were together and went into specifics.

    "title": "I lead on my best friend so badly, he \"proposed\" to me",
    "content": "This has been haunting me for a year now and I think I have to share.\n\nI went to a boarding school in the UK, pretty posh place, lots of rich kids. Back at home, I had always been the kid that was \"well off\", maybe not particularly wealthy but we didn't have any struggles. At this school, I was poor.\n\nIn my second year there, when I was 19, I made friends with a guy whom we'll call Jimmy. In the beginning of our friendship, we had a crush on eachother but neither of us did anything about it so the crush kinda fizzled out. We spent all of our time together, and for those of you who haven't been to boarding school, the friendships you have there are very unique and strong. We also had a bit of a \"pact\"; Jimmy is very wealthy, whereas I lived off £50-100 a month, I loved cooking, and we both didn't love the school food, so he would pay for groceries and I would cook. We had dinner in a classroom every night.\n\nSchool ended, and we all went our separate ways. During summer break, we had a catch-up call. He was drunk, I was stoned and we admitted to eachother that we had a crush on eachother in the beginning of our friendship. He said he loves me. I said I do too. Jimmy was so important to me and I knew him so well, this love I had was real. What I failed to notice is that love doesn't have to be romantic, it can be platonic and feel just as strong.\n\nWe decided we would see if he got into the London uni he was trying to get in, we would try and date. Well he didn't, and when I moved to London, he moved to another UK City.\n\nThen, after half a year, he visits London and we see eachother. I really missed him and since I had to work until late, he got me an uber to meet me at his hotel room. He said he has a king size bed and I could just sleep on the other side.\n\nMy intention was very honest and since I hadn't seen him in so long, the thought of doing anything didn't cross my mind. That we at some point intended to date was far away, in my mind we were two close friends seeing eachother the first time in ages.\n\nWe catch up, it's almost like in boarding school, we go to sleep, him on one side of the bed, me on the other side. Nothing happens. I didn't even think about that something could happen.\n\nThe next morning we wake up and I'm still on the edge of the bed, but Jimmy has moved quite a bit closer to me. We chat for a bit and he comes closer and closer. At some point he's hovering over me. I panic, I know exactly what he's trying to do and whereas I thought half a year prior that we could date, this situation made me quite uncomfortable. I had my eyes closed so I didn't have to face him trying to kiss me but he wouldn't budge. So here's where I made the biggest mistake. I was desperately trying to have this situation be over so I just kiss him. Looking back now I genuinely can't tell you why.\n\nJimmy goes back to the other city that day and I'm left confused. He comes to visit the next weekend. The weekend after that we visit our old boarding school and remaining friends. He pays for the hotel room, breakfast, lunch, dinner. I would look at something in a shop and he would buy it for me although I always said no. He didn't just treat me like a princess, he treated me like a goddess. I loved this time, not because I got stuff out of it, but because Jimmy is so important to me. I just loved spending time with him. Weirdly I kept thinking that I could picture a life with him, as his wife, but was so confused about that feeling. I can't tell you how chaotic my feelings were.  But then I more and more realised that my feelings are definitely not romantic but I'm too far in. We kept talking about a future together, one day we even got some crappy rings and pretended to be a young married couple \"as a joke\". We talked about getting a cat. We talked about me applying to his uni (I was doing a gap year at the time), that we could find a flat together and live happily ever after. was so on board with these things, with this imaginary future. I was living in a fantasy.  It's so conflicting, I really meant these things, yet, I didn't love him romantically.\n\nI know that when I back out now, I'll lose him forever. I also knew I couldn't keep this up. I disliked kissing him, I didn't like when he touched my butt, it felt weird. I'm autistic and I sort of convinced myself that I just don't like the sensory aspect of it, I was so desperate to keep this guy in my life, but now that I'm in a happy relationship I know that it was just that I didn't like doing these things with him.\n\nI realise that I'm balls deep in shit. He also knew that this was a difficult situation, that we probably won't work. We kept talking about it, that this was going to end in shit hitting the fan. That he could tell I didn't \"bedroom-love\" him and that this would be an issue in the future.\n\nThe only thing that made things easier to deal with was that Jimmy had this girl at uni he was talking to. He was very open about her being backup and I had absolutely no problem in helping him to get her. It was a weird dynamic, I think we both knew this wasn't going to work out but didn't want to face the inevitable.\n\nFast forward, we saw eachother a weekend when some of my friends came to visit London. Jimmy didn't know them and has this vice of buying friends. He has a lot of money and at our age, people are easily impressed when a 20 year old casually pays for everyone's dinner. It really bugged me, I knew him, I knew what he was doing. He would pay for stuff and then he would expect that everyone does what he wants, that he makes the decisions and everyone follows because he has spent money. Maybe I was just annoyed because it made me realise that he had been buying me too. I always said no to him offering to buy me things (he still did though) and tried to pay for some things but he wouldn't let me. One time I paid for two pints and he got really annoyed with me so I left it.\n\nI like to argue that the money he spent on me was not why I spent this time with him, it's not why I kept this going for way too long but I can't deny that it wasn't nice.\n\nThis weekend of my friends staying in London, Jimmy had set me an ultimatum. By the end of it, I should tell him if we're gonna go through with it, that we should date, or that he will go for the girl at his uni. When he first said that, I already knew what my answer was going to be. But I just wanted to have one last weekend with my best friend. I told him I would think about it and while my other friends are here, we should not be all lovey-dovey to not have a weird dynamic throughout a weekend of a bunch of friends doing things together.\n\nMy friends were out for a smoke one night and it was only me and Jimmy left. He gave me some earrings he had gotten fixed for me and then cleared his throat and put a box on the table. I can't remember what exactly he told me but it was something along the lines of \"I saw this when I got your earrings fixed and I knew this was yours\" and something like that I could be making him a really happy guy. In retrospect, I don't even know if it was a 100% real proposal or if it was a promise ring situation, he didn't say anything about marriage, just asked if I would make him the happiest guy or something like that. But it most definitely felt like a proposal in some sense.\n\nThe ring was beautiful, he was completely right. It was my ring. It's not the biggest, not the most expensive, but it was exactly me. I started sobbing uncontrollably when I saw it was sized perfectly for my ring finger. I said I couldn't do it, I could barely get out words. I still can't describe it well, but this was the most heartbreaking moment I've ever gone through.\n\nJimmy said that if the answer was no, I should still keep the ring as a farewell gift, otherwise he was just going to throw it away.\n\nThat night we went out and Jimmy left early to go back to the Airbnb and a friend of mine living in London joined us. He offered me to come back to his place and since the night of my friends was coming to an end, and we were all pretty drunk, plus he lived close to where I would work the next morning, I accepted. I genuinely wish my friends would've forced me to come back to the Airbnb and not let me go with my London friend. I wish they would have told me not to do that. Anything to show me what the fuck I was doing. The implications were pretty clear. I said no to the ring, and that night I go home with another guy. Worst decision ever. I can't believe I did that.\n\nI've never seen him again after this weekend, but I saw on his socials that he's with the girl that he was keeping as a \"backup\". I'm happy for r him, and although the backup part sounds horrible, I don't doubt that he genuinely likes her.\n\nI still wear his ring, although not on my left hand, and I still wear all the other things he bought for me. I think of him every time.\n\nI miss him so much and I genuinely despise myself for letting this go on for so long when I knew early that my feelings were platonic and especially going home with my London friend that very night. Sure, I was drunk, sure, it was more convenient for me to take an uber with my friend to his place that is closer to my workplace, but it's no excuse at all. I obviously didn't see it this way during that night, but the very morning after and ever since, I think it was just such a CRUEL thing to do. It wasn't my intention to put salt in the wound but from an outside perspective it's obviously just a huge \"fuck you, Jimmy!\". I can't believe I did that, I always considered myself to have high morals but wtf. How could anyone do that to a person they love, especially when the person loves them, too.\n\nI've told no one really but my boyfriend and it's been so rough on me. I really want to apologise (and my boyfriend did encourage me to do it) to Jimmy but I think it's inappropriate to approach him after a year, when he's moved on and in a relationship. I also don't deserve to be forgiven I think. I just wish he would know that I feel so sorry and despise myself for it. I just need closure I don't think I deserve since it feels so selfish to approach him and apologise. I know we can never go back anyways, we'll never be friends again and we probably shouldn't.\n\nThis will forever be a mark of my own stupidity and weakness, and maybe that's what I deserve.

    "title": "How do I talk to my little sister?",
    "content": "I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, I'm usually just a scroller.\n\nMy (25M) little sister (13F) has been committing self harm for a while now. Her mother hadn't noticed and just found out recently from the school messaging her and letting her know that her daughter is self harming. I live out of the house with my wife so I was also unaware of this happening.\n\nI find out from a text message from her mum asking for help. I was out on site (2+ hours away) working and when I found out, I immediately told my supervisor that I had to go and won't be at work for at least tomorrow. My little sister and I have a pretty good relationship so that's why her mum had reached out to me. Little sister wouldn't talk to her parents or other brothers. I thought I could do something and just talk (I am typically the most calm and patient one out of everybody).\n\nI got back home, told my wife the situation and she is on board with me trying to help out and taking time off (she is the best, that's why I love her) even though we are struggling ourselves. I took my little sister out for some McDonalds and ice cream, we went to a nearby park and just chilled and be on the swings. I tried talking about my past and my experiences with depression and etc. but she didn't want to listen or talk about it.\n\nI went back to casual conversation as we finished our walk but didn't know what to say in the car. I then started asking some questions about school, home life and just how she was doing in general. The most I got out of her was when I asked about school so I started asking a few more in depth questions about other kids, teachers and friends. I got some more information and she opened up a little, I asked a few questions about how she was again and I got a bit more of a reply this time which I was happy about but also (internally) upset about the answers.\n\nI reassured her that if she isn't comfortable, she does not need to answer any of my questions and she doesn't need to tell me until she is ready. I also briefly spoke about seeking help from people who do this type of help as a career. She said she wasn't very interested but said she preferred talking to people she doesn't know very well (hence the teacher contacting her mum). I made her aware that if she ever wanted to seek the help, it is there for her and I will help through it if she would like.\n\nI told her that I have personally used professional help last year when I witnessed a death from an accident on the road and I was a first responder. That took her by surprise because I hadn't told her or her younger brother about it because I didn't want them to feel burdened by it.\n\nI'm now at a loss and don't know what to say, ask or even do at this point. She is sleeping at my place tonight and she isn't going to school tomorrow. I'm taking the day off and we are both going to play video games and hang out tomorrow. Any and all advice will be super appreciated.\n\nTLDR: My little sister committed self harm. I came home from work to help her but she isn't opening up. I don't know what to do.",

The reason I broke up is not necessarily why I'm here but still, we broke up because we'd had problems with communication and negativity in our relationship, some from my side some from hers. But I was just unhappy, so I decided to break it off. For the past week I've been wondering why I'm not actually sad about losing her or anything and yesterday it hit me. I hadn't been truly in love with her for maybe a few months or something, but I never had the balls to leave because I am afraid to be alone. I've been hanging out with old friends and my family the past week, but at night, when I am alone in my apartment, I get incredibly sad and lonely. I feel like I used her just to not feel lonely and broke her heart.",

    "title": "I introduced my mom to my friends for the very first time at 23",
    "content": "I have a rough history with my mom. A lot of my childhood involved serious trauma that still impacts me today, and it caused an extreme rift between the two of us. As a result, I cut contact with her from the ages of 11/12 to 18. Therefore, I never introduced her to friends I'd made aside from neighborhood kids that she was already familiar with or friends from school that she'd also already met through school events.\n\nAs a teenager, my stepmom described the friends I made as stray cats off the street. Harsh, but pretty accurate. Many of them can be considered societal outcasts, almost all of us having bonded over coming from bad upbringings. Some of these friends I'm still extremely close with as we've helped each other heal over the years, others have either gone to prison or became terrifying to be around and were promptly cut from my life. All of this is to say that I tend to surround myself with the more odd types of people, people that my Dad and Stepmom weren't 100% okay with me being around.\n\nYesterday was my 23rd birthday, and to celebrate I invited three of my friends out to a restaurant with my mom who covered all of us as my birthday gift. We all laughed, joked, shared stories, and my mom loved all of them. They loved her energy, too, and nothing felt odd or off about introducing my friends to her and vice versa. I wasn't nervous about how it would all go down because I didn't realize until earlier today that I'd never had that experience with her before. It feels like catching up on all of the missed time I had with her, and I hope to introduce her to more of my friends in the future.",

    "content": "Tagged for animal abuse just in case but it's mostly to do with euthanasia and animal injury not real abuse.\n\nMy family dog had to be put to sleep today. In October my ex's dog also had to be put to sleep and that experience was very painful and traumatic for me. She was the first pet I'd been present for their passing, and it was unfortunately very bloody and she was disoriented and it left me with nightmares for weeks. I only really processed it within the last month or two. This past year I also worked in wildlife rehab out in a remote location. The place was often overrun by mice, and sometimes I'd find them half dead and felt it my responsibility to put them out of their misery. That was traumatic for me too, which might sound silly to some because they're just mice and people do things like hunt and fish all the time but I'm just not that kind of person who handles death well. I've always opted out of being there for animals or even family members passing away because I knew it would be more difficult than saying my goodbyes ahead of time.\n\nI wasn't there for my family dog today, I was already a wreck crying over it and reliving all of the trauma and pain of the other animal deaths I've had to experience over the last year. I couldn't hold myself together and don't feel comfortable being emotionally vulnerable with my family, so I pet him and gave him a kiss on his head and left to go sob alone until it was over.\n\nAdditionally, my ex and I officially broke up in the beginning of January. It had been rocky before then with an initial separation in December but things got messy and it finally reached the point of us going no contact for a month until they reached out to me at the beginning February. We stayed really low contact for a few weeks after that, and just kinda started being in more regular contact this past week. The split in January finally gave me the push to get myself back into therapy, start attending support groups, and try my hardest to work on myself and process my grief about everything that I've been through in the last year. There's more than what I've detailed but that's the relevant stuff here. The breakup left me realizing that I had become far too dependent on my ex (but completely emotionally unavailable at the same time) and neglected any of my other friendships. I was left totally alone and found that most of those previous friendships were unsalvageable. I worked through it all, eventually going out and making new friends and finding things that interested me and finally feeling like myself again.\n\nThen today happened, and now I'm reeling over everything all over again. I'm scared I'm going to start having nightmares again. I can't stop thinking about the blood and the smell of it and everything I've seen. I'm sad for the loss of my family dog but it also feels like I'm grieving the loss of my ex's dog again and even the loss of the relationship with my ex.\n\nI reached out to them today and we talked about things on the phone for a while. They listened to me cry and vent and we even talked about their dog and I opened up about how it affected me at the time which I hadn't previously told them about. It was a helpful and healing conversation but now that it's over I feel heartbroken that they aren't here to hold me while I cry and help me through this. I want nothing more than to lean fully into them for support but I know I can't do that. Things are over between us but I still have feelings for them. I still want the relationship back and I'm trying so hard to let go of that possibility but I just wish that they were here and we could spend time together. I feel like I used up my one phone call and I don't know when we'll get to really talk like that again or see each other again and all I want is the comfort of their voice and their presence and their support. I feel like I need them and before this I had finally stopped feeling that way. I finally knew that I didn't absolutely need them but that I chose to still have them in my life because I value them as a person and care for them. But now I feel like an addict desperately grasping at any shred of them I can get and I'm so upset to see that I still feel this way when I thought I was getting better.\n\nI'm trying to balance it and talk to other friends and I have support groups and therapy coming up in the next couple days but it doesn't feel like enough. It isn't the same. I'm still not very close with anyone else and don't feel like I can be as open with anyone as I can with my ex. I know this line of thinking is toxic but I just want my person back. I'm so tired of constantly grieving and crying and being set back by all of this feels hopeless. There is a void in me that it feels like shrinks sometimes but never really goes away.\n\nI know that I am strong enough to get through this and that I will be okay. I have experienced many other losses before and I have gotten through those. These most recent ones have all just been particularly hard and different than the other losses I have experienced. This is the first time in my life that I'm taking a real inventory of myself and admitting my faults to myself and actively working on healing to not repeat my own patterns. I had started taking these steps before I met my ex, but I left my mental health unchecked for too long while we were together and that is what directly caused our relationship to end. I don't know, it's only been 2 months since we really broke up so I'm aware it's still fresh and that it makes sense that this situation is triggering all of those feelings but it feels like a big step back and is really hard to cope with at the moment.",

While he loves and cares for me, he never takes initiative, and we’ve never had sex because he’s not ready. Sometimes, I feel like I’m forcing him to kiss me or make out with me, which makes me feel disgusting afterward.\n\nHe’s a smart, career-focused guy, but indecisive and dependent on me for all his decisions. Over the past year, he declined multiple opportunities because they weren't perfect.

    "title": "I'm A Failure",
    "content": "I am a single, divorced, 27-year-old woman with a 3-year-old daughter. My life is incredibly lonely—I have no friends, and I’ve been alone for most of my life. Even in childhood, I went very few places and made even fewer friends. My mother was older, a single mom who worked a lot, so I spent many summers playing outside by myself, exploring the woods and riding my bike.\n\nAs I went through puberty, I felt uncomfortable in my body, almost dirty. For years, I hated the way I looked, and my mother was embarrassed by it. I hid myself in baggy clothes and sweatshirts. My older siblings—a sister 14 years older and a brother 8 years older—worried about my social life because I never had friends over. That made me think something was wrong with me.\n\nAs I grew older, making friends remained difficult. People avoided me as if I were the plague, bullying me for my clothes, my teeth, and my short stature. Still, I tried to enjoy life. I played soccer throughout middle school and ran track—I had fun and got along with my teammates. But everything changed in high school.\n\nGrowing up, my mother never complimented us on our looks (at least, not her daughters), and boys never seemed interested in me, so I figured I was just average—especially since I didn’t have nice teeth. At school, I noticed other girls dressing nicely, and I wanted to feel pretty like them. When I started dressing better, my mom, stepfather, and older brother had a conversation about how I must like boys now. That was strange to me because we weren’t even allowed to date until we were 16. If I was dressing nice to attract boys, then why weren’t any talking to me? (Now I know I’m demisexual and have never really had a crush on a boy.)\n\nIn 9th grade, I got braces and thought I made a friend. But she was only using me as a placeholder until her real friend moved up a grade. Slowly, she started disliking me and making sly comments. I didn’t realize at the time that it was because she never actually liked me. I had only one other close friend, but her parents mistreated me during a vacation they invited me on. They assumed my family was wealthier than we were and accused my parents of lying. That friend barely spoke to me the whole trip, staying closer to her cousins. I had to pay for things I couldn’t afford, and eventually, I just wanted to go home.\n\nBy 12th grade, everything fell apart. My sister kept asking if I was gay because I never talked about boys. I got sick and couldn’t finish my last track season, so my coach refused to give me my final letter award, which had me in tears. I was left eating alone at lunch after I made a comment about a girl who constantly talked about people—someone told her what I said, and she cussed me out. The friend I was a placeholder for had a \"real\" friend who liked a guy I wasn’t attracted to. He kept trying to ask me out, and when I rejected him, she took offense, as if I had insulted her by not wanting him.\n\nAt home, my stepfather criticized me for my clothing, calling me a \"hoe\" because of my shorts. My mom took them away. I wanted to be a doctor and got accepted into a few schools, but I didn’t even realize that was an accomplishment because we were never really praised for anything.\n\nCollege was the first time I had a real group of friends, and I was so happy. But it didn’t last. I liked a guy in the group, but he was too immature. I wasn’t mentally stable enough at the time (at 26, I was diagnosed with OCD), and the relationship went downhill fast. Our friends, all his male friends, turned against me. They shut me out, picked on me, and were just mean. My obsession with him dragged me into a deep depression—I didn’t understand why I couldn’t stop fixating on him or just leave him alone. Eventually, my friends left me too.\n\nI spiraled. I started skipping class, smoking weed, and failing a course I had to withdraw from. I lost my virginity in a horrible experience. I was broken and alone. But I still loved school, so I kept trying. I finished the fall and spring semesters and decided to retake the class I had withdrawn from in the summer. That decision put me $6,000 in debt, and my family couldn’t pay. No one helped me.\n\nI had to drop out. I had no car, no way back to school, and a job that paid $7.75 an hour. To pay off some of my debt, I asked my mom for the inheritance my grandmother left me—only to find out she had already spent it remodeling our kitchen while I was in school.\n\nI decided to join the military. I saved every penny, making sure not to overspend so I could pay off my debt. I was so proud when I finally did—until I got a call from collections. Apparently, I had unknowingly taken out other loans, and they were severely overdue. That destroyed my credit, and I’ve been trying to repair it ever since.\n\nAt 20, I thought I met the love of my life (lol, silly me). My ex-husband was 19, and we dated for about a year and a half before getting married. We were stationed overseas at the time. When we moved back to the States, his true colors showed. He never got me anything for Valentine’s Day, spent all his time playing video games, started watching Red Pill content, and didn’t even congratulate me when I finished my undergrad in psychology.\n\nIt got worse when I got pregnant. He left me multiple times to go visit his friends in another state. After our daughter was born, he helped at first—making bottles, feeding her, bringing me food—but it turned into weaponized incompetence. He expected me to cater to him 24/7 while I had a newborn. He called me disgusting for not showering, insulted my body, and refused to clean or cook for the baby. He even made messes on purpose.\n\nFor his birthday, I got him a custom DBZ cake and flowers. All he cared about was that his friends didn’t say happy birthday. That’s when I realized how self-centered he was. After 9 months, I couldn’t do it anymore. When he cussed me out for not wanting sex, I knew I had to leave.\n\nI bought a house, thinking maybe if he got out of the military, he’d change. He didn’t—he got worse. I had panic attacks and breakdowns, and he still expected sex. When I refused, he told me he wanted a divorce. He demanded 51% custody just to keep his military housing. I said no. He didn’t believe I’d go through with it, but I did. He signed the papers without realizing he was giving up his parental rights. I was relieved—he wasn’t a good father anyway.\n\nNow, as a single mother with my own house, car, and a spot in grad school, dating is nearly impossible. The men I meet either ask about my money or feel insecure.\n\nRecently, a guy I had known for years love-bombed me. We planned to meet, and everything was great—until I mentioned my book. His demeanor shifted, and suddenly, he was asking about my income. Two days after going home, he ghosted me, then told me I was beautiful, smart, and funny but that we should \"date other people\" and \"work on our friendship.\" I was devastated and blocked him. Later, I found out I was late. When I told him, he first acted concerned, but when I asked what if I kept it, his true self came out. He called me a \"2x baby momma\" and told me I would be struggling, just like his first child’s mother.\n\nI’m not keeping the pregnancy, and I blocked him everywhere. I was doing well with my mental health, and now I feel like a failure. I risked my health, and I failed my daughter by not choosing a better father.\n\nI love my daughter so much. I made all her meals from scratch as an infant, she’s been in swimming classes since six months old, and I decorated her room beautifully. I don’t want her to be lonely like me. I tell her every day that she’s pretty and smart.\n\nI just want one real friend. I wish I weren't alive every day. I wonder why I am still here. What am I doing wrong?",

    "content": "I'm currently on a long weekend trip with my husband in a nice hotel for my birthday. Weve been out and splurging on us since thursday.\n\nLast night, we were at a local attractions bar, having a wonderful time, and my husband pulled out his phone to snap a picture of us. A message notification popped up. The contact was saved as \"little one,\" who I know he's texted before. In fact, 4 years ago, a week after our 7th anniversary, I found messages to another girl, and he drunkenly admitted to cheating on me then. In the aftermath, we separated for a couple of months, but I stupidly slept with him off and on and got pregnant. My little girl is now 2 and my absolute joy in life, especially when I never thought I'd have kids. We seemingly worked through our issues and stayed together. He's been a good dad, and overall life has been good, but I will admit I've never given him my full trust. November of 2023, I noticed a notification from this same contact, and have brought it up countless times to be ignored, gaslit, and told I don't know the whole story. When I get angry and call him a liar and a cheater, I'm met with tears and tales of regret and the toll his cheating has taken on him 🙄\n\nNow, he knows what I saw on his phone last night, and refuses to talk or say anything about it. I've asked directly to only be ignored. I've been hugged and held all day, and in response I've been stoic and cold. I want to scream and cry and know the truth but I know I'll be made to be the bad guy, be the psycho, toxic, controlling bitch.\n\nI need to leave, I already know, but financially it's  difficult. He makes 3x what I do and has threatened to use my PPD/PPA against me. I have no friends, family is full of flakes, and I'm just stuck. But I'll do it, I'll get there.\n\nIf you've stayed for all this drivel, thanks. Solidarity to y'all folks dealing with shit in life and still being good people. I see you, I hear you and I am you.\n\nETA: I appreciate all the words, kind or not. I needed all of them. I asked to see the texts or I'm done and was told to \"get a lawyer\". I'm driving home tomorrow 6 hours to get my baby girl and I'm done. He can fuck all the way off. I hope only bad things happen to him. I deserve to show my baby girl better and so help me she won't ever settle for a copy of her father.\n\nUPDATE because I'm a fucking idiot: He spent the whole night drinking, being cold and deflecting. At the hotel, I asked to see the messages, he deleted them and her number and gave me this phone. He didn't realize the trash folder is a thing. I copied her number to my phone, tried to not blame the woman because that happens a lot and asked if she knew we were still married. She told me to \"grow the fuck up\" and stop texting her. When he realized I had her number, he flipped and it got violent. I didn't call the police because we were 6 hours from home and I defended myself, so he has bruises too. I grabbed what I could and left town at 4 am, driving through the night. I picked up my daughter from my in laws and we just got home. He's apparently flying back and having his dad bring him by to get his truck and clothes. I'm at a loss, I want to cry. I've loved this man through all his lows amd now I'm alone at mine.",

My dad was absent from my life from when I was 12 onward, her dad was always in her life even after he split from our mom.\n\nShe’s always had certain advantages over me (having both parents, her dad’s side having money while I only had our mom who was very middle/lower middle class).\n\nWe’ve gotten a lot more appreciation for each other now that we’re both adults (34 and 24).\n\nBut lately she’s been, like…living the life that I always wanted.\n\nI’ve made so many mistakes in my life that have lead me into my current life which I 100% never wanted. For a few reasons, I dropped out of high school. I’ve done great for myself despite that (I’m a homeowner!) but my job is not something I ever wanted. I’m an office manager at a dental office. Yippee.\n\nI always had a passion for the arts and writing, but as a high school drop out those fields were never an option. Hell, even with a college degree they’re a pipe dream. But yet my sister is pursuing a career in journalism.\n\nI love New York City. Since as long as I can remember I wanted to live there; one of many dreams I gave up on when I realized that I’m a loser. I only live about 2 hours from there and my best friend lives in the heart of the city, so for a while that’s been a fine scenario for me (visiting my friend at least once a month).\n\nThat is until last week. My sister just got accepted to NYU and I want to be happy for her because I AM proud but…every time I think of it I start to hate myself and I have intrusive thoughts that say “it should have been me” which makes me feel like a total asshole.\n\nI can tell our mom is over the moon. Our mom always fancied herself a writer and she herself dropped out of high school to have me so I feel like I’m further eclipsed by my sister. Like she’s everything my mom ever dreamed of having for a child.\n\nI was so paralyzed by this depression that it took me two days to respond to the group text where the NYU announcement was made. I mustered up the strength to say I was proud, and my sister responded “thanks brother 💕now you have another reason to visit the city” and although I’m sure she didn’t mean to, that was yet another slap in the face. She gets to live there, doing the thing I always wanted to do and I get to be the loser big brother that visits her before going back to my hourly job in a small house that I hate.",

    "content": "I’ve come to the painful realization that I am nobody's best friend, and it hurts. To some degree, I know it’s my fault, but I wanted to share what led me to feel this way.\n\nI thought my close friend group from high school was solid, despite the distance and long times without contact. Every time we would get together, it felt like no time had passed at all. There are 5 of us, and after high school, some went off to college while others stayed. A couple of us went to the same college, but months would go by without texting—when we did meet, I’d travel to see them in different cities.\n\nAfter college, most of my friends returned to our hometown, while I left for the capital, chasing my ambitions. I visited my hometown, but no one ever came to see me. I know that’s on me, but back then, I was dealing with a toxic and abusive boyfriend, and only one of my friends knew about it. It wasn’t an excuse for not being there for me, but I didn’t reach out for support as I should have.\n\nEventually, I moved to another country, and though I was only there for a couple of months, it was a tough time. At that moment, I felt incredibly lonely. But now, as I write this, I see how it’s all connected.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, I moved back to my parents’ place. Life was hard, and I made a couple of new friends. Fast forward, and I eventually moved abroad again. As the pandemic came to an end, my old friends and I drifted apart. I still kept in touch with one of them weekly, but things just weren’t the same.\n\nSince then, three of my friends got married, two are about to have babies, and while I know it was my choice to be far away, I haven’t received any personal updates. I only find out about their big moments through social media, and even then, I have to DM them to get any more details. Honestly, it feels like I’m an afterthought.\n\nI’m a loyal friend, and I always thought I was a good one, but now I feel so left out. My messages barely get replied to anymore. Last week, I traveled to another country, and I posted about it. I shared the experience with my best friend—expectations, reality, and fun stories—but my message went unread. I wanted to share something nice, and it was met with silence.\n\nI know my lifestyle is different now—I’m child-free, pet-free, living overseas, and an artist—but we always knew I’d be the “cool aunt” who brings gifts from different countries. I’ve even taken care of some of their kids when I was back home. I support their ideas, emotionally, and sometimes financially.\n\nAll of this to say: I feel really lonely. I’m not great at making new friends, and though I’ve had some come and go, these five were supposed to be my ride-or-die people. My husband is amazing and supports me, and his friends are great too, but they aren’t my best friends.\n\nHas anyone gone through something similar? How do you rekindle friendships when things start to feel so distant? Maybe I move back and all is good, they are just not putting much effort 'cause i will be back soon?\n\nAnd no, I haven’t told them any of this, because I don’t want to come off as dramatic or needy.",

    "content": "This happened years ago when I was in 6th standard, just a kid, too young to fully understand what was happening or what it meant.\n\nThere was this 9th standard girl in my school. I didn’t know her. We had never spoken before. But there was an upcoming Model United Nations (MUN) competition, and both of us were selected to participate.\n\nDuring the practice sessions, she was always affectionate toward me, pulling my cheeks, calling me cute, joking around. At the time, I thought it was normal. Almost every girl did that to me back then. My teachers, my classmates, even aunties in my neighborhood would pull my cheeks because I was a little chubby cute kid.\n\nSo, I didn’t think too much about it.\n\nBut there was something different about her.\n\nThe way she talked, the way she looked at me, it felt different. Unusual.(all this I feel now, earlier I didn't felt any difference)\n\nShe would joke about kissing me, say things that felt out of place in a school setting. Sometimes, I felt uncomfortable, but I didn’t dwell on it. I was too young to process these things.\n\nAnd then, came the last day of the MUN conference.\n\nThe Bus Ride That Changed Everything\n\nThe event was over, and we were heading back home in the school bus.\n\nAs students got off at their stops, the bus started to empty out. Eventually, only four or five students were left, including me and her.\n\nI was sitting near the back of the bus, on the second-last seat, completely absorbed in my phone, playing Granny (the horror game). I was in my own world, completely unaware of what was about to happen.\n\nThat’s when she came and sat right next to me, blocking my way.\n\nI didn’t think much of it at first. I just kept playing my game.\n\nThen she spoke.\n\n\"I think I’ve started liking you.\"\n\nI barely reacted. I was focused on my game.\n\nShe repeated herself.\n\n\"Listen to me. I think I love you. I want to marry you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.\"\n\nI paused my game, looked up, and laughed. I thought she was joking.\n\nBut her face was serious.\n\nBefore I could say anything, she held my hand not in a casual way, but in the way couples do.\n\nThen, she moved closer.\n\nOur thighs touched.\n\nShe took my phone out of my hands and looked straight into my eyes.\n\n\"I love you. I have fallen in love with you.\"\n\nI didn’t know how to react. I was just a kid. This wasn’t something I had ever dealt with before. I felt weird.\n\nAnd then, she kissed me.\n\nOnce. Twice.\n\nOn my cheek. On my forehead. Again and again.\n\nI tried to pull away, but she was holding my hand tightly. I was trapped in that moment, completely frozen.\n\nAnd then her stop came.\n\nShe let go, got off the bus, and left.\n\nI sat there, not knowing what had just happened.\n\nTelling My Parents, And The Frustration That Followed\n\nWhen I reached home, I told my parents.\n\nThey immediately told my class teacher.\n\nAnd do you know what happened?\n\nNothing.\n\nBecause she was a girl.\n\nIf the roles were reversed, if I was the 9th standard boy who had kissed a 6th standard girl, there would have been outrage. Action would have been taken immediately. But because I was the boy, and she was the girl, no one cared.\n\n\"It’s okay.\" \"She was just being affectionate.\" She was just doing it as fun.\" \"You’re a boy, it’s not a big deal.\"\n\nAt the time, I didn’t argue. I didn’t fully understand why it felt so weird or why it made me uncomfortable.\n\nI just moved on.\n\nBut now, years later, whenever I think about that day, I get this shivering, unsettling feeling.\n\nAnd then, something hit me.\n\nWhat About Girls Who Face This EVERY DAY?\n\nThis was just one incident.\n\nJust one experience.\n\nBut almost every girl in India has gone through something like this.\n\nSomewhere, at some point, every girl has faced harassment, discomfort, a moment where someone crossed the line.\n\nAnd they are expected to move on. They are told to forget about it. They are laughed at when they speak up.\n\nAnd yet, they live through it. They survive it. They carry it with them.\n\nAnd that’s what shakes me the most.\n\nBecause if just this one experience makes me feel shivers even years later, I can’t even begin to imagine what women go through every single day.\n\nAnd the worst part?\n\nMost boys will joke about this post.\n\n\"Bro, you’re lucky! I wish a girl kissed me like that!\" \"Wow, why are you complaining? That sounds like a dream!\"\n\nBut I was a 6th standard kid.\n\nAnd back then, it wasn’t exciting. It wasn’t fun. It was weird. It was uncomfortable. And now, looking back, it’s unsettling.\n\nI understand now.\n\nWomen are stronger than we will ever understand.\n\nBecause if just one incident still makes me feel this way, what about the girls who go through this every single day?\n\nWhat about the girls who couldn’t resist? Who were told to \"forget about it\" because \"it’s not a big deal?\" Who were laughed at when they spoke up?\n\nIf this one memory still gives me shivers, I can’t even imagine the strength it takes to live through this constantly and still move forward.\n\nI respect their strength more than ever.\n\nNo one should ever have to be \"used to it.\"",

    "content": "And they're the cutest fucking things ever. I had dogs and cats growing up and I loved them all, but after I moved in with my husband we've had dogs only for over 20 years.\n\nOur first home didn't suit cats so we adopted a puppy, we moved when she was older and adopted another dog, when she passed we adopted another adult dog that we were told was fine with other animals. She was not. She was so prey driven, completely untrainable and had been obviously failed by her previous owners. I've never known a dog like her, she loved people and our dog but wanted to murder everything else. We tried so hard for so long but it was futile. But we don't give up on pets, we kept her, and kept trying. For over 13 years.\n\nBoth our dogs recently passed and I'd promised my daughter that if she could give everyone space to grieve, we would prioritise adopting a kitten next, but it could take weeks or months to reach that point. Our current house is fine for cats, and we all love animals no matter fur, feathers or fins, but she's ached for a cat for years and we couldn't risk one around our dog.\n\nWe had to put down the old, crazy dog on Friday. By Friday night after some tears and talks, we all decided the house was too quiet and too sad without any pets at all. That we'd loved our dogs their entire lives and nothing would change that or detract from it. But for us, it's empty without pets.\n\nSo we looked up all the animal shelters in our city, and decided to visit the earliest opening one first then visit the rest if we didn't find one that we liked.\n\nNot going to lie, I knew my daughter would find a kitten at the first location, but she had a vision in her head of what she wanted and what it would look like, and they had one that was exactly it. But she just didn't vibe with it at all. So she hid her disappointment and looked at the other cages, and stopped dead when she saw the tiniest, absolutely not what she thought she wanted kitten in one. It ran straight up to the front and she asked if she could hold her and say hello. That kitten practically leapt at her, buried straight into her and started purring and she just said \"This one. I'm done. I love her,\"\n\nThen I went to go get my recently adult son and let him know we'd found a kitten. Only to find him holding another kitten, telling me he couldn't leave her here. He's always been an animal lover but he'd said he was happy for his sister to get a kitten first, and after a while he'd look for a new puppy. But this kitten latched onto his jacket when he sat down to say hello, and promptly attacked him. Repeatedly. While purring and smooshing into his hands when he tried to detach her.\n\nSo anyway we now have 2 kittens, and home feels a lot less sad than it has for the past few months. Kittens are fucking hilarious.\n\nAnd I can't wait to adopt a puppy soon.",

It all ended when she had gotten physical with him after they both got high. She came at him and hit him, scratched up his face. They have been on and off. Two days ago they got into another major fight. She moved away to another state but came down to visit him even though they aren't together. After the fight my brother tried to kill himself. He left home which he usually does but his friend called hours later telling my mother about the situation. His phones were taken away so he wouldn't contact his ex girlfriend. I drove my mother to stay with him, as he and his support system managed the situation.\n\nI didn't stay. Though I am his sister, I must take care of myself first. He is an energy leech and has been since he was a teenager. I am the youngest and would always be quiet and complaint to get through my teenage years with him. Even now. I am drained and numb to his antics. So is my poor mother who is chronically ill. I hate seeing the stress weigh on my mother. He doesn't pay rent, he hasn't gotten a job, he only talks to me when he needs money or a ride. 3 weeks ago he called me asking for 17 dollars, I was trying to refuse when he began guilt tripping me saying \"fine next time when you need help I'm not going to help you.\" That made me so upset, and I stood up for myself. He was guilt tripping me, and putting me in a corner making me feel like I have to agree to what he wants and needs.\n\nI am tired. He has always been self centered. Not once has he asked how I have been or my mother. He always argues with my mother, who can't take much since stress and anger cause her pain to flare up. It makes me so upset. I feel as though I didn't want to go and support him either because I don't want to think about it. Losing another loved one, the only other man in my family since my dad died. I am upset with him. I don't understand how he hasn't gotten his life together. He's had a long while and our support. We don't make him pay rent, food, or bills. I don't get it. My mom says I should be more caring and considerate to him, but I'm so drained I don't have much more sympathy to share. I want to focus on my classes and study. Not this. What should I do? What can I do?",

    "content": "I have a step-brother (let's call him M), one class at school he touched on the topic of who likes whom, he said that he likes one girl from our company (let his name be D), I said that I like one guy from our company (let's be called G) and him, well, he didn't seem to react strongly and we forgot about this conversation, then after a while, maybe a week or two after that conversation, he comes to my room and that's it  it went again, I said who I like (G) and he, well, I logically asked him who he likes, and this time he said that he likes two girls, and told me to guess who they are, I said that it is not fair because I told him who I like just like that, and he said if you want to know, guess, if not, then no, and I started to think (at that moment I started to guess that he would say that it was me), I started to name different girls' names  in our company and outside it (for example, from the class or something), at that moment I named everyone (I thought so), and here I say that I named everyone I know from the girls, so I asked if I knew her at all, he said that I knew and even very well, I opened our group in Telegram and began to list, first I listed everyone except myself and various bots, then he said that I missed this person in the list of participants and I started again, quickly named myself and several girls and so on  said yes, and I asked \"what is it?\"  he said that I had already called her (at that moment I already knew that I just wanted to make fun of him a little), well, I made fun of him for three more minutes and called myself and he confirmed that it was me (I acted a little shocked, for him it really looked like I was surprised), I honestly don't remember what happened after that, but we started fooling around, then we just went to our rooms, and I don't know if I remember  my brain doesn't want to remember it, but as soon as I didn't try to remember, but I don't remember when these \"dislikes\" started, he started coming to me almost every evening, we were lying down, hugging, kissing, talking.  But at one point it turned into just a \"misrelationship\", he already massaged my back, buttocks, then after some time maybe a month like this, he asked if he could rub my breasts, I refused and every time we saw each other or when he came he asked.  But one day I honestly can't remember how it happened either, but he started grabbing my chest, at first I pushed him away, etc., but then I don't know, but he just lay there and grabbed me (well, I'm the kind of person who doesn't know how to defend my boundaries), well, I don't know if it was something in my brain or what, but I didn't mind (or I thought so), well, it also continued for a while, maybe up to a month, but relatively  recently (two weeks ago) we distanced ourselves very sharply from each other, he stopped talking to me, ignored me in various ways and all that.  And just yesterday I found out that he has a girlfriend and they have been together for about a month and a half (and our \"unrelationship\" lasted for two months, maybe a little more), and I think I shouldn't be jealous (probably) because it wasn't an official relationship, neither he nor I offered to meet.  So now I don't even know how to feel.  On the one hand, I am upset that I can be said to have been used, and at the same time they had another girl. At some point, I wanted to end this relationship, but I didn't know how. Tell me what you think about it.",

    "content": "I'm frankly so appalled by myself. Lately, I've been having this one gorgeous, albeit dark fantasy in my head. It makes me feel like a monster… like a devil in a new dress… but the power I feel when I indulge it makes me want to turn off all of the lights, leave home, and become a runaway. It's a hell of a life, but I feel a bit lost in the world, disconnected from those I hold dear. In fact, I often question who will survive in america? With the way our country is going, who knows? No point in playing the blame game as to who is responsible for this, however. Even with all the awful stuff in the world, I am able to find solace in my beautiful dark twisted fantasy.",

    "content": "I don’t want to but I hate my brother. If you find this I’m sorry dude. He has always been rude to me, growing up he would comment on how I can’t sing, suck at everything, and am annoying and over emotional. Since we have been adults he has said things like “ I wish I was around you less when we were kids.” The final straw for me was when he confessed he touched me inappropriately when we were kids and I was asleep. It wasn’t anything terrible all over the clothes but I wish he never told me. As a woman body autonomy is always in question anyway but knowing that when I was like 8 I lost it sucks. Dude can’t retain a relationship while I am happily married and because of that and some of his health issues my parents want me to be nice to him. My mom, dad, and still living grandparents always ask if we have “worked things out” and about how “happy it would make them”. I don’t want to, he sucks. He’s been mean to me my whole life and I am just supposed to be the bigger person and let it go?! Cause he’s sad and alone? Even if now he suddenly gets his shit together I don’t think it would make up for my whole life of feeling inadequate thanks to him.",

    "title": "My dad is expecting me to apologize for his angry outburst and I'm furious",
    "content": "I am a 35 year old woman and my dad is 67. Several years ago now my dad set up a bank account in his name so that any money I gave him to hold on to for me would be safely stored away for when I needed it. I haven't needed this account in years but have been having some impulse control issues with buying stuff and wanted to make sure that the money I set aside for new computer components would actually go towards that. So I started sending money to dad to stick into that account last year. There has never been a problem with this arrangement before yesterday.\n\nA couple days ago, I finally had enough money set aside to buy the three major computer parts that I needed to upgrade my rig. I sent a text to my dad asking him to transfer me the money from that account. There was a little over $100 discrepancy between what I thought should be in the account and what actually was in the account. I told dad this and said that we should get together to find out where the mistake is (as in whether my records are wrong or he forgot to put the money into the account).\n\nHe immediately called me up and started yelling at me about how he's \"dealing with enough shit right now\" (his ex-wife is dragging out the divorce trying to get as much money out of him as possible) and that \"he's not going digging through his finances over this.\"\n\nI'm now angry that he's yelling at me over something so stupid and decide that my relationship with my dad is worth more than $100. So I tell him in an admittedly angry tone that I'll just take whatever is in the account and be done with it. He took offense to this and started yelling louder and swearing about how I'm not allowed to be mad at him and how he \"gets enough of this shit from [ex-wife].\"\n\nI immediately hang up on him and text him saying that he can call back when he's calmer. He then has the gall to reply back that I need to apologize to him. I responded back that I would not respond to his calls or texts until we've both had a chance to calm down. Things said in anger cannot be taken back.\n\nI'm so sorry that I didn't sit there and let you yell abuse at me over what was clearly a misunderstanding! I'm so sorry that I didn't allow you to project your financial troubles onto me!",

    "title": "My MIL accused my boyfriend of being suicidal and having leg pain for attention. Now, my boyfriend won't speak and I'm scared I'm going to lose him.",
    "content": "I’m scared, lost, and don’t know what to do. It feels like I’m about to lose my boyfriend, and I have no idea how to stop it. I don’t know what steps to take, and it’s eating me up inside.\n\nMy boyfriend (23M) has autism, anxiety, some trauma, and dissociative traits. He’s also been told he shows symptoms of bipolar disorder, though he doesn’t have a formal diagnosis. Despite all of this, he’s been handling his increasingly hectic and stressful life balancing school, work, and chores. Better than I ever expected.\n\nA few days ago, my boyfriend had a family emergency. I don’t know all the details, but I do know it’s been incredibly traumatic and stressful for him. But last night, things escalated in a way I never expected. His mom completely broke him.\n\nIt started with an argument after she told him to stop having panic attacks and that she wouldn’t take him out in public if he might have one. He snapped and had some kind of episode (I don’t know if it was a meltdown, a breakdown, or something trauma-related, but it was bad.) Then his mom said she was done caring about him, that she was tired of “being judged” and “turned into the villain.”\n\nI tried to de-escalate, but then they got physical. My boyfriend is never violent, but I watched them throw things, dodge each other’s hands, and scream at each other. It was chaos. And then I heard him say, “Since I cause so many problems, maybe it’s better that I leave. Then you guys won’t ever have to put up with me again.”\n\nInstead of comforting him, his mom shot back, “I thought you weren’t feeling that way. So you lied to me? I guess you just say that for attention then.”\n\nMy boyfriend immediately denied it, but his mom didn’t stop. She looked him in the eye and said, “Are you even in pain? Or is that all an act as well?” in regards to his leg injury from last year.\n\nI tried again to calm things down, but it was useless. The stress had completely overwhelmed him. His body just gave out, and he collapsed to the floor. Instead of helping him, his mom kicked us out. As we were leaving, she threw one last remark at him: “Since I make you so miserable, maybe I should leave instead of you. Then your life would be so much happier.”\n\nOn the way home, I seriously considered taking him to the ER. He was weak, his vision was blurry, and he had chest pain. But as we got closer to home, the symptoms slowly subsided.\n\nI tried to comfort him, but he just wanted to be alone in his office. He didn’t eat, and when he finally came to bed at 2 AM, he didn’t say a word. Throughout the night, I kept hearing his breathing change. Sometimes it seemed like he stopped entirely, then he’d suddenly jolt awake and gasp for air. He has no history of sleep apnea, and I’ve never seen him do anything like that before.\n\nThis morning, I woke up to find him gone. All he left was a note saying he was sorry for putting me through everything and for potentially traumatizing me like he’s traumatized his mom. He said he was leaving to clear his head.\n\nIt’s been five hours, and I haven’t heard from him. I’ve called hospitals, shelters, fire departments. Nothing. His aunt refuses to speak to him for some reason, and he’s no contact with the rest of his family. I have no idea where he is.\n\nI’m terrified I’m going to lose him. I don’t know what to do. I’m not leaving him over this. I don’t know the full story of what’s going on with him and his mom, but something isn’t right. I just want to support him, but I don’t know how. Please, if anyone has any advice, I need it.",
