I don\u2019t know what I like to do anymore and my energy has really been lacking also. Along with my self esteem. I am feeling really bad for my boyfriend now because of my depression and how I may be coming off. I\u2019ve been more anxious and also not knowing what to say or not having the energy to talk as much. This is the first time my depression has started \u201ccoming out\u201d since we\u2019ve been together and even though I know I can talk to him and he would be 100% supportive. I don\u2019t really know how to explain how I\u2019m feeling so I\u2019ve started pretending I\u2019m okay when really I feel like I\u2019m being held under water. I also feel like my low energy, not talking as much is making our relationship boring for him maybe? I want to see him and be with him. Even if we\u2019re just laying together, especially if we\u2019re just laying together cause that\u2019s almost all the energy I feel like I have right now but I keep thinking, he didn\u2019t sign up for this and shouldn\u2019t have to go through me feeling and being this way. I think this is more of venting than asking for advice. I don\u2019t want to scare him off with how much/bad my depression can get. ",

I lose everything and my closet is overflowing with junk I've never used. I don't enjoy doing much except listening to music and watching cartoons. \n\nIt sucks because I want to be better. I am very clean, I shower daily and wear deodorant/cologne, but my room is a mess. I hate it, and it makes me hate myself even more than I already do. I have a therapist, but I rarely see her, and I'm scared to tell her this about me. I have a full time job and people love me, I'm very organized and happy at work. No one would ever suspect I have a terrible room. The only thing I keep clean is my pets' cage (rats). I feel so embarrassed and ashamed, I never have friends over.

    "selftext": "So, I'm from a very close-init family, we love each other a lot and have always been together. My grandma had three children, uncle A, uncle B, and my dad, and then grandpa had a child with another woman, uncle C. This is about uncle B.\n\nI don't like his current gf. She immediately trauma dumped on my grandma to gain sympathy, then proceeded to imply she was old and getting forgetful and clumsy (grandma's perfectly fine, she's as healthy as they come), then she brought along her son she had with another man, who I have no trouble with. She herself isn't bad, but the way she and her son behave is weird, because it's like they're not a part of our family, they just kinda live there, and I have the feeling that she wants to kick my grandma out and have the house to herself, which isn't possible because it's decided 50/50 between uncle A and uncle B, but she's tried to buy the other half to uncle A, who firmly refused, because once they both pass away, the house is mine.\n\nThe worst part about all this is my uncle's behavior since she arrived. He works with my mom at a local restaurant, nothing fancy, its main target are the broke college students nearby, but they get paid well. My mom had a cousin of hers working as a waiter there, and he wasn't the best, but hey, acceptable,  but uncle B decided to start saying that he was more trouble that its worth, and that his girlfriend's son should work there, my mom firmly refused. My grandma has anxiety of going out on her own for years now and since she only lives with uncle B and his girlfriend, she constantly relies on him to get medicine or to just go out, and he's been getting extremely rude with her for no reason whenever she asks to go out, yelling and saying \"he needs his own time too\". We threw a party for grandma's birthday a while ago, and you'd expect him to sit with his mother, but no, he went and sat with his gf's family, completely ignoring grandma. I fell and got hurt pretty badly a while ago, and everyone called me and asked of I was okay, but him? Not a peep. \n\nMy last straw came a few days ago, my mom suffers really bad anxiety/panic attacks sometimes and he caused her one. Long story short, he missed work without calling in advance and my mom had to cover his shift and then tried to reprehend him because she's the manager of the restaurant. He completely flipped out and said something along the lines of \"leave, it doesn't matter, (gf's name) can replace you\", and my mom got really mad, and said \"I don't want to have anything to do with you as work or as family, you're never stepping foot into my house again\". \n\nNow I love my uncle, but his gf has completely ruined everything, I don't like her, I see her and I feel angry, but I can't do anything because I'm forced to interact with her, and you'd think my lack of warmth would tell her to not talk to me, but she talks to me as if she was my aunt, SHE'S NOT, and I genuinely wish I could just make her go away and make things go back to normal.

I met this guy online he was really nice I gave him my phone number and we hit off, we have been talking for two days the second day we call I remember he said \"oh!, someone is calling me bye!\" and I didn't think anything of it but uhm I haven't really heard from him since I texted him and he kinda left me on read and I texted him again I don't think he bothered looking at the message and I think I don't want to believe that I had just got ghosted but I think I did? And I don't blame him really because I don't know how to talk to people. I've noticed that I overshare and I can be awkward and maybe I make people sad when I talk to them but at the sametime I don't know how to approach people, or how to really make connections so I just blurt things out and I can see why that would drive someone away that kind of thing is so tiring to deal with. I also noticed when we were talking to him he said now you sound more relaxes or more comfortable or you're not trying too hard and i've got that a lot, I don't know what that meana though because sometimes thats how I genuinely act, I guess because i'm so awkward some of the things I say come off as forced but I can't help it and I don't know what to say really and I don't want to interview people and be like, oh so you like this? and this? and that? how do you feel about this? asking a ton of questions. I also was talking to someone before this guy not ina romantic sense but I think I made things awkward with that person too, I think I made them sad and I didn't mean to but it just happens sorta and I don't notice until like a day later or so and its like damn I shouldve approached it like this or like that. And even when i'm trying to talk with new people I always overthink what I want to say, I LITERALLY WAS OVERTHINKING WHAT I WANTED TO SAY TO BOOK A HAIR STYLING APPOINTMENT LIKE COME ON, thats just pathetic that it took me 3 days to ask my stylist how much is this or how do I get to her studio because I was ovethinking what I wanted to say and because I felt embarrassed and ashamed. And I started to realize that even my bestfriends don't really know what to say to certain things I say so its an awkward silence before I have to be like so uhm ahaha sorry about that!! and I have to make a stupid joke or something because I know they don't know what the hell to say and I made the whole convo awkward. I haven't even spoken to my bestfriend of 5 years, in which I should be thr most comfortable speaking to in like 5 days because i'm trying to think of something to talk about, again this is so pathetic and I don't know why im like this, it shouldn't be hard to talk to people but for some reason for me it is and it just makes me kinda angry and kinda sad and jealous because everyone makes it seem so effortless to talk to people and have a regular convo where you're like \"AUGH I SHOULDNT HAVE SAID THAT IM GONNA PUT MY HEAD IN A WALL!!\".",

    "selftext": "So, towards the end of summer last year, my coworker (26m) and I (24f) went on a date and ended up fooling around a few times after that. I had had a huge crush on him for a while and was so excited to finally go out with him. The date was super nice, but the hookups were unexpectedly really good. I don\u2019t have a lot of experience whereas he does, and he knew that, and he let me take control of the pace and the things we did which made me feel comfortable enough to try stuff with him I hadn\u2019t done before. Unfortunately, life stuff happened all at once, and he ended things like two weeks after the first date. I was crushed. I was hurt, disappointed, confused, and quite honestly, very sexually frustrated. I really, really liked him, and we had gotten very intimate very quickly with the expectation that there would be a lot more to come, and then all of a sudden, it was over. I felt like I was left high and dry.\n\nThe thing is, a couple of months ago, we basically ended up confessing over text that we both still wanted each other in that way and almost made plans to meet up again, but more life stuff got in the way, and we both agreed that it would still be a bad idea to do anyway. But now every time I see him at work, I can\u2019t help but think about the things we said and did, and how much I want to do it again. The fact that I know that a part of him still desires me in that way is kind of driving me crazy. I could torture myself overanalyzing every normal conversation, every glance, every little interaction.\n\nIt would very likely be a terrible idea to do it again, and it would probably end worse than it did the first time, but the feelings just won\u2019t go away no matter how much I remind myself of these things.

    "selftext": "So I recently exposed a narcissist but my situation is very different and I can\u2019t find anything online about this situation. So I came here for potential outcomes. \n\nSo back in 2023 of March I started talking to this guy and he knew me from my childhood (we were not best friends we just saw each other in passing during our middle school years) and it went well at first. (It only lasted two weeks) While we were getting to know each other I got on his IG and saw this girl constantly posting on his page but he never paid her any mind and of course I asked and he denies it. But he must have sensed that I was hot on his tail so he decided to end things but still wanted to be friends even though we were never friends but I just said ok. What he didn\u2019t know is that I knew I was blocked after I questioned him about the girl on IG so I made a fake page to see what was up. And even though he said he wanted to end things he was still keeping in touch with me. Even though I\u2019m blocked on his IG so in April 2023 I saw him with that girl and he she got him to move down there with her. He is originally from my city and this girl lives in the DMV area. And with me investigating I realized that it\u2019s a money thing so basically this guy is a prostitute she buys him stuff and he agrees to be her bf. So of course I wanted revenge but I wanted to wait until it was unexpected so for a whole year I gathered information on this girl and realized she may be a narcissist. With my digging on this girl I got her phone number driver license address email you name it I got it. And I tucked it away. So in March of 2024 I made a fake number and pretended that I knew her from one of the colleges she went to but I told her that I wanted to stay anonymous. And she went for it and all I did was expose her bf for being with me. I also wanted to add that had I not been hot on his tail he would have continued to date me. And when I found out about the girl I cut all communication with him and he found a way to contact me and wanted me back and I told him no. He even told me he never wanted us to stop talking but he needed help from this girl and I had all that in the screenshots. And you best believe I sent them screenshots to her when I was hiding behind the fake number. This girl really wanted to know who I was so I decided to give her a call and actually reveal myself and we were on the phone for 27 mins. Mind you I recorded our conversation as well because I don\u2019t trust this bitch. But while we were on the phone she talked bad about her bf and her bf family and I did defend the family because I actually know them. Because the city we are from is small. And at one point in time I was close with the guys cousin. She said really bad things about the bf mom too. And I didn\u2019t like that so I spoke up and I think she could tell I wasn\u2019t going for any of her lies because I knew she was lying. And I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t like that. I actually got off the phone with her because she wouldn\u2019t let me go. So the day after I spoke to the girl her bf called me screaming at me and accusing me of all these things I didn\u2019t even say. I couldn\u2019t even get a word in but I knew she was going to lie so I wasn\u2019t tripping because in my head I was going to get my lick back. Fuck this hoe. The guy wasn\u2019t even mad that I hurt gf feelings he was mad that I lied on his family and said bad things about him. Which I didn\u2019t say anything bad about him or his family. So after I took a verbal beating from this guy I just said cool. But I wasn\u2019t done yet. So I waited for about six months so now we are in September 2024 and from March of 2024 to September 2024 I kept my eye on them and I watched her crumble because she is very transparent on the internet and the bf broke up with her while she begged for him back because he realized that she lied on me and she must have found me on social media because she changed everything about herself to mimic me. Mind you when I spoke to her in March of 2024 she claims that he begs her but social media says otherwise. And between March of 2024 to September of 2024 this girl and her friends and her momma started to bother me because apparently I\u2019m the reason why her bf won\u2019t speak to her and I still keep calling her bf and pulling him away from her but I haven\u2019t seen that man since March of 2023 nor have I spoke to him the only time I spoke to him was in March of 2024 and that\u2019s because he yelled at me. So in September of 2024 I reached out to him I unblocked him on IG (in case you are wondering he did block me first on IG but unblocked me on IG to get in contact with me because I had him block on everything else then when he asked for a second chance and I told him no I blocked him on IG and he been on that list since September of 2024 and then I blocked him again because he is a dick) and sent him all the details of the conversation I had with the gf. I even revealed to him that I was behind the fake number but he told me to leave him alone so I said ok bet and changed my number and reblocked him on IG. But what I banked on was how much he liked me so I knew he was going to read and listen to all the things I sent and within three days he started calling my fake number (because he couldn\u2019t get in contact with me because I changed my real number) so I deleted my fake number and got rid of my social media account because he had his family look for me too. He also offered to send me money to talk to him but I declined. And of course I\u2019m still watching this all play out on my fake pages and again because she is so transparent on social media she is having a breakdown because he now knows the truth and she can no longer lie on me to him at least. But he is stupid anyway because why would you believe a liar with no proof but I guess because she is a narcissist and the guy isn\u2019t good at setting boundaries. I never been involved with a narcissist well I don\u2019t think I have been and I think it\u2019s because I\u2019m too outspoken and I have no problem getting into a fights. I promise you this is not what the fuck you want but overall I\u2019m a pretty peaceful young lady if I do say so myself. Anywho, this girl is upset that not only is he furious with her but also his family is happy that someone was able to finally expose her for the liar and manipulator that she is (I didn\u2019t know that his family didn\u2019t like her) but apparently she plays victim and uses this guys insecurities and her money so she can get her way and this relationship was going on for years. I\u2019m basically the hero. But I wasn\u2019t done with this bitch yet so I got my black ass on Twitter and put her on blast so much so she lost a lot of followers on social media and her momma is off of social media completely because her momma was bothering me too. And I did this a few weeks ago me exposing this girl on Twitter. So now I\u2019m satisfied. But I wanted to know what happens when you expose a narcissist? I wasn\u2019t the one being manipulated but it was like I was the defender of someone who was being manipulated. And I came here to see if I could get any info because I couldn\u2019t find anything.

    "selftext": "I worked at three of the biggest influencer marketing agencies over the last decade, and now that I don't, it's finally safe for me to speak the truth without risk to my career - I need to expose that whole industry as a scam and no one is talking about it..\n\n\"Influencer Marketting\" agencies make almost all their money NOT from sponsorships but from influencers paying them monthly fees to FIND them sponsorships that never happen. I was shocked each time I got a new job at a new \"influencer marketing agency\" to discover they all work the same way- colleagues who mentioned it were fired or made redundant. It's kind of like a pyramid scheme... Out of thousands of influencers paying monthly \"subscription fees\", almost no sponsorships actually happened in the years I was there. All of our workload was dedicated to finding more influencers to sign up rather than sponsorship companies.\n\nThink about it- why would we need sign ups in the first place if we can find sponsors? We'd obviously take a cut of sponsorship as that would make more money- right??!! What's going on is dishonest &amp; takin advantage of the poor.\n\nMost people think that a large following of 500K+ followers, makes that person wealthy. The reality is that 99% of people with 500k followers on insta and tiktok (and in many cases, youtube shorts), make nothing. I\u2019ve worked with influencers sleeping in cars, couch-surfing, living below the poverty line for years, incredulous to the fact they aren't making anything, while my colleagues persuaded them to continue building a following and that sponsors were \"just around the corner\". We would be told to persuade these people to by dangling carrots like this. Many of them worked 20 hours a day to build a following- often from uplifting or positive content- and weren't narcissists- it is not a pleasant life, and I knew of so many like this.\n\nI don't like how the industry is taking advantage of these people. Websites like SocialBlade are hilarious - the number of times I've seen them claim people are making $500K+ per year but in reality, they're earning nothing... It happens all the time.\n\nThe key is that most audiences aren't monetisable no matter how big they are, and the ones that ARE monetisable (e.g. \"technical\" topics), are nigh on impossible to persuade sponsors to bite because they're all so stuck in the past (they think of social media as something \"free\" and will only pay to advertise on TV or via traditional routes).\n\nTo make things worse, 99% of companies reaching out just want free advertising. They offer \u201cexposure\u201d or a cheap free product and refuse to pay. They all think that someone with a large social media following is a philanthropist millionaire, or can eat \"free products\", didn't work full time to build that following, and doesn't need income.\n\nMeanwhile, marketing agencies exploit this situation by selling influencers false hope and taking their money with no return. It has to be biggest public perception vs. reality mismatch I\u2019ve ever seen.. on such a grand scale.\n\nNo one is talking about this. Agencies won't talk about it because their income comes from maintaining the lie. Influencers themselves won't talk about it as they fear it might destroy their chances of getting a sponsor in future (which is never going to happen!!). So I had to get this off my chest, now that I don't work for them anymore. I'm frankly amazed these \"companies\" haven't been shut down.\n\nI'm sorry but I can't name myself or the companies for obvious reasons, but they're all the same (afaik), and I can't give examples of specific social media accounts for similar reasons unfortunately. Therefore, you don't have to believe me on this, but I speak the truth &amp; just happy to get this off my chest.\n\nMy advice to you if you're unable to find sponsors for social media following:  \n\\- Don't waste any more time on it. Views can't pay your bills. Don't waste your life..  \n\\- Don't trust any social media \"marketting agency\" that requires a monthly subscription fee from you (if they are genuine, they'll operate on a percentage of sponsorship deals that they obtain for you - NOT a monthly fee from you)  \n\\- Don't trust when anyone tells you \"you're just marketting wrong- it's impossible to have no income on 500k followers\" - they don't know what they're talking about unfortunately. Most influencers even in the 500k braket make NOTHING, but none will admit it for fear of it sabotaging their future chances.  \n\\- Spend your time re-skilling to do something else that will make a living, don't fall for this scam.  \n\\- Even monetisable accounts with monetizable topics are VERY HARD to get sponsors for, that's why so many don't have a sponsor for years.  \n\\- Don't fall for the \"if I get a big following I will automatically find ways to make an income\" trap\n\nThere.

    "selftext": "Throw away account so no one sees this. \n\nI have been working really hard the last 5 years or so to improve my life. \n\nA little background about me- I come from a low-income, below poverty line house hold. Grew up in housing during my childhood. Majority of my family including cousins are either on social assistance, housing, drug addicts, alcoholic, ect. \n\n6 or 7 years ago, I was on social assistance myself. I didn't finish high-school. I was drinking daily. Ended up in an abusive relationship. Managed to get a cleaning job. \n\nSince then I've gotten my GED, partially went through college, ended up building a career before I completed college, am now a program manager on my way to making 90k a year in a field i love that feels like I'm making a difference in people's lives, in a happy loving fulfilling relationship where I live with my partner, we plan to buy a house soon and are thinking about marriage and kids. I have a car. I've essentially hit all of the life goal milestones I wanted to hit by the time I was 30 and more (I just turned 30 a few weeks ago). I've been to therapy, ive been on a good medication for my mental health, I've done the work.\n\nI feel like my life is finally on the right track. Because of this, I've finally been able to shift my focus to more \"shallow\" or less important things that have been kinda low on my radar. \n\nFirst let me say, I love myself - not in a self centered kind of way, but I appreciate that I'm resilient, goal oriented, determined, am empathetic to peoples experiences, and I have a lot of love to give. And I have a lot of respect and compassion for myself- just as I do for others. \n\nWith that being said, my appearance has always been something that's bothered me. I've always had bad skin, I gained quite a bit of weight over the last 4 years- and I'm just not in a place where I feel good about how I look. So I've decided, this year, that's what I'm going to work on. I've bought more professional clothes, started my skin journey to help with my skin texture and acne scars and redness. And planning on getting my teeth fixed. Getting a good hair regime. And controversial- i decided id try ozempic. My insurance is covering it so essentially it's like why not? Why wouldn't I give this thing a try to support me in losing weight and feeling better about my appearance. It's not that I think I'm UGLY I know I'm not- i just feel like I haven't really taken care of myself and I'm working on it. \n\nAnyway long story short- I feel like I'm getting some much push back randomly now. And the more I think of it the more I realize how much push back I've gotten generally on decisions I've made. \n\nMy dad once said how will you live on your own your on welfare (this was 7 years ago before I met my boyfriend and 3 months before I got a fulltime job as a cleaner and my own apartment)\n\nMany times as I've changed jobs to move up and learn more I've gotten aren't you scared? Are you sure you want to do this?\n\nAnd now from some family members and old friends its - wow that treatment is a lot of money, I've heard so many negatives about ozempic etc. My own mother has issues with me improving the way I look for some reason.\n\nI just don't understand it. I would never try to put someone down for bettering themselves in anyway. It's actually almost hurtful.\n\nOf course I realize I don't have to and won't listen to others on my life choices, because my choices have gotten me to where I am today. I guess I'm just venting because it feels like the people who don't even make decisions try to influence yours. \n\nAnyway thats all haha.",

    "selftext": "It was only a couple of months between his first doctors visit and finding out it was terminal. all of this has moved incredibly fast, and I don't feel capable of talking about it much. In the few times I have mentioned it to other people, I'm always very calm. I'm very calm when I see him, too. I just can't seem to cry about it when you'd expect me to, but then I break down at random times. \n\nHe's a lot older than me, so if I ever thought about it, I probably would've guessed he'd die before me. But not like this. Not this soon. \n\nI'm not family or anything, or a really close friend. there are people who have known him for more than a decade, and I have to be some kind of blip in his life, having only really been his friend for a few years. In a way, it doesn't seem like I have any right to be upset about this. Not when he's got actual family and friends who are as close as family. but here we are. \n\nthe thing is, like, my own parents are...fine, but fell short in a lot of ways. i'd never, ever admit this to anyone i know, but I did/do see him as kinda a parental figure. Or, at the very least, a trusted older adult. Someone I could be honest with and rely on, which is pretty rare in my life. He looked after me a bit. Now I'm trying to look after him. I don't think I'm doing a very good job of it, but I'm doing my best to do as much as he'll let me. \n\nI feel so worn thin. I'm trying so hard to be here for him, and also be here for my best friend who's going through a rough time mentally, and my family, and also work and have my own life and not go absolutely fucking insane. i don't know. this is more important than anything else i could do. I'm just so tired and sad and i'm not sure i deserve to be but there it is. I want to tell him that he's important to me, that this is really fucking me up, but i have no idea where to find the words. I don't know that the right words exist. I'd give anything to fix this. If I could die instead, I would, but that's not how cancer works. I don't know. I'm tired and right now I just desperately want things to be okay, or to not have to be the strong one for once, but who else is gonna be?\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nLast summer I 22F met a man on this app who is 45M. The day after we met online we had a phone call and ended up spending nine hours on the phone! The following month he flew out to see me and I spent that whole weekend with him. We had an instant connection and even nine months later things still feel really great. \n\nHim and I live only a few states apart so for the past nine months we have been traveling a lot just to see eachother. We have been traveling back and forth so much that this weekend is our 20th visit with eachother and we have spent roughly 100 days together in person! \n\nWhen we first started seeing each other I didn\u2019t tell anyone because I was too afraid of the judgment people would say. I have no clue how people in my family or community might feel about our age gap. Overtime it just got more and more involved but I still did my best to hide my relationship from everyone.\n\nThis upcoming May I need to find a new place to live and I don\u2019t really have many options. The best case scenario is for my partner to move to my state and for us to live together. That is a realistic plan for us but the only issue is that I don\u2019t think I can hide that from my friends/family. I am also starting to think about just telling them since there are times where it is hard to have to hide my relationship, especially when it\u2019s such a big part of my life. \n\nI am really worried about what my family might say. I am worried they will look at me in a negative light. I know that it\u2019s just their opinions but it isn\u2019t easy to feel judgment. I am really stressed and confused on what the right decision is. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated \ud83e\udd0d",

We were alone at the snack table and started talking (I don\u2019t remember much details), the conversation went really smoothly and at the end she invited me to go to a rap concert with her. I politely declined as it\u2019s not my genre of music.\n\nThe party went on, everyone got slightly drunk and the girl invited me to dance with her. At some point the dance became kind of intimate (to the point she wanted me to \u201egrab her ass\u201d jokingly)\u2026 so  ofcourse I excused myself and went to get a drink. \n\nAt some point me and my friends went upstairs to chill on the couch, later in the evening the girl joined us and squeezed in right next to me. Some time passed and it was getting late so people began to fall asleep. I wanted to go find a bed for myself but it turned out the prettiest girl I\u2019ve ever laid my eyes on fell asleep holding onto me, snug on the hoodie over my left ribcage. Being the awkward fuck that I am I just spent the night with one arm parallel to my body and the other on top of the couch as to not hug her without consent. \n\nMy memory has never been the greatest so I probably left out some details, but generally our chemistry when talking was great. \n\nIn hindsight it seems pretty obvious she could have been kinda into me (or she was jus being nice, guess we\u2019ll never know) \n\n",

She\u2019s smart, so fun to be around, made me laugh and made me feel genuinely loved and appreciated for the first time in my life. I felt more confident, more comfortable around her. Not to mention she\u2019s also the most gorgeous person i\u2019ve ever seen. \n\nWe dated for a bit, and then she broke up with me towards the end of our senior year. I was heartbroken, and went off to college still processing and dealing with the breakup. As silly as it sounds and I know most people think this with their first love, but I really thought i was going to marry this girl. We chatted on and off throughout my freshman year, just normal shit like \u201chey how are you doing\u201d and \u201cwe should catch up\u201d before I finally decided it was finally time to fully move on and forget about her, so I blocked her on everything that summer, and deleted her number. \n\nWhile i still thought of her from time to time, I wasn\u2019t angry or hurt about the breakup anymore, I had accepted that 17-year-olds know nothing about love, and all I can do with heartbreak is learn from it. \n\nFast forward to the beginning of my junior year of college, and I\u2019ve dated on and off for years now and was in the process of trying to end a terrible long term relationship. I drove from college to my hometown, around 3 hours, to be with my friends after ending things while my new ex blew up my phone with calls and messages telling me what a horrible person i was for breaking up with her (I was not, she treated me terrible and refused to listen to me when I had an issue). \n\nMy friends and I decided to grab food and hangout in my car in one of the parking lots in our hometown. We pulled in, and I saw my first Ex\u2019s car. It had a very distinctive bumper sticker, so I knew it was her. I didn\u2019t get out or try to say anything, but my heart skipped a beat. I really truly believed I would never see this girl again. I debated reaching out, but in the end I unblocked her on snapchat and reached out with a simple \u201chey! were you at x lot the other night?\u201d and we spent a few weeks catching up and then hung out for the first time in years. \n\nShe told me she missed me, and had always regretted the way things ended between us. I had no intention of trying to date again when I reached out, but I admit I did miss her too. That was about 9 months ago, and one thing led to another and now we are fully back together and it\u2019s been amazing. \n\nI know it\u2019s only been three years since we broke up originally, and I will say that I still don\u2019t know anything about love. I\u2019m a different person than I was in high school, and so is she. She makes me feel like the most beautiful person in the world, and i\u2019ve never come close to feeling this way for anyone but her. All I do know is that as long as I\u2019m able, I will do my best to love her the way she deserves, because as far as i\u2019m concerned she does the same for me. I can\u2019t help but wonder how my life would be different now if we hadn\u2019t gone to that one parking lot that night. \n\nThank you for reading, xoxo",

    "selftext": "today I found out my mom was murdered. blunt force trauma to the head that lead to brain bleeding. she had a migraine for 11 days and vomited daily. I had no idea she was sick. she passed in july of last year, and the county I am in is so backed up that the medical examiner took 8 months to get back to us. we all assumed it was a fentanyl overdose that she may have come in contact with because one of her friends was an addict. it turns out that she had no drugs in her system.\n\ni\u2019ve been waiting for 8 months. i\u2019m only 20. my dad hasn\u2019t been around at all for my whole life. my mom picked terrible men. her whole life has been around horrible men. she was raised being beaten by her father by anything and everything possible he could find. she married a man who got addicted to crack, my father. she then married another man who cheated on her the entire relationship with other men. the final man, a man who had stolen from her in a relationship prior and who has killed 2 of his previous partners indirectly, took her, too.\n\nthe only answer it could be is that the final man took her from us. he had never killed them exactly, but both of his previous wives were completely clean before they met him. 5 and 7 years later, they both died of a heroin overdose.\n\nI cut off my relationship with my mom in 2019 due to something I was a victim of when I was younger by the man who cheated on her with other men. he did some fucked up things. a lot of fucked up things. he let a lot of fucked up things happen to me under his supervision. I had caught a disease from what he did/let happen and decided to move in with my grandma because I did not like the man she was now with, the man who (may) have killed her, the final man. I had no contact with her after I got a restraining order.\n\nshe and I had started to get along for once in 4 years. I had hugged her (albeit halfassedly) for the first and last time. she cried and cried. I don\u2019t know what I would have done if she were to have passed and I didn\u2019t get on good terms with her again.\n\nI wanted to see her succeed in her life. she spent all of her life desperate to be shown that she was worthy of being loved. I tried to show her before she passed, a few months before, that the way I had loved her growing up was enough proof that she was worthy of love. that if she can say she isn\u2019t worthy of it, then my love I showed her as a kid meant nothing. she finally started to understand.\n\nwe were going to go to college together. I wanted to help her get her GED. to start going to school. to make the loser of a boyfriend she has had for years go work instead of making her work 2 part time jobs being disabled and still not being able to make the rent. he did nothing for her other than steal from her and hurt her.\n\nI had to protect myself by moving out those years ago. she didn\u2019t want to listen when I knew he was bad news. i\u2019ve known since I was 14. I just wish I could have done something to save her. I wish he never met her. I wish I could have been there to stand up for her when he hit her.\n\ni\u2019m terrified. i\u2019m so scared of being angry. I don\u2019t know how to deal with the fact that someone took her from me. she was my everything for years. someone so cruel took her from me and made her be in pain. no one knew he had hit her. no one knew her migraine was not just a migraine. she couldn\u2019t tell anyone or go to the doctor because she would have to admit he hurt her. again.\n\ni thought I processed it all when she died. but being told today that she died due to blunt force trauma and brain bleeding makes me feel like I lost her this morning. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know how to feel. I feel like my world just broke. again. and now I have to deal with detectives, with getting information, with anything that I can do to help them investigate.\n\nI just want my mom back.",

I suffer from anxiety and depression and was diagnosed with Cyclothymic Disorder. So yes, I deal with body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria. I won't deny that it likely fuels a lot of my feelings. \n\nBut despite that, I am extremely self-conscious of my weight. And you'd think I'd be fine with it. I support body positivity heavily and would not ever judge others about their weight. Weight is not a proper scale of health, nor should it be tied to your self-worth; weight is weight. It only ever seems to be myself that I judge for my stomach. \n\nI have a potbelly. When I look in the mirror, all I see is my too-large stomach. And how it doesn't match the body that I'm SUPPOSED to have. And I do everything in my power to hide it because it causes me so much embarrassment. I wear high waisted skirts and pants, I'll tighten my belt just a little too much to tie it in, and I'll wear shape wear all so I don't have to acknowledge it. It makes me feel like less of a woman. Which I know is stupid. Women come in all shapes and sizes. Hell, my girlfriend is plus-sized and she's the most attractive woman I've ever laid eyes on. And yet, I still can't help but compare myself to other women, who have flat stomachs and small shoulders. \n\nI can never stick with exercise long enough to see any results. I like eating unhealthy, sugary foods. I eat a lot, in part to help my chest grow bigger, as HRT affects new fat distribution. I like to eat. And I live in the south, so you KNOW the food here is good. I'm terrible at forming habits. It feels like no matter what I do, I'll never have the body that I actually want.\n\nSo, sometimes, I wish I had an eating disorder. I've TRIED to give myself an eating disorder. I wish that I could go days without food and let my stomach shrink, just so I can finally look the way I want. I wish I could live on scraps of food. But I can't. Food is always there, mocking me until I finally give in.\n\nAnd the worst part is that I feel like I can't tell anybody. I can't talk to my girlfriend about it because it's a trigger for her own weight dysphoria. I have no friends I can talk to about it, and I'm terrified to talk to my parents about it. I hate the way my body looks and I wish I could just force it to look the way I want.",

    "selftext": "Basically, the title, here's some context.\n\nI (F19) and my best friend D(F19), have been close friends since elementary school. The summer before COVID me and my parents moved to South Florida for the start of high school, and still we talked everyday. We would talk on Facetime for hours, fall asleep on the phone, play multiplayer games, and watch movies through shared play together. We got through college app season together, first jobs, and she was the first person I came out to. I've never had a sibling, but I'll always call her my sister. Even though we've practically been 1000+ miles apart for almost 6 years, she's always my #1 call. I tell her I love her everytime we hang up. \n\nD is in college in New Jersey for nursing, and just recently started sessions with a psychiatrist. She is actively on medication for depression and sleep.  She's always been a very introverted person, but recently she has been telling me that she's been going to different club meetups and parties. I was excited for her because this was a chance for her to make some friends and get out more. We downloaded Life360 together and I told her to keep her phone charged, text me when she got back, and have fun.\n\nI'm not dumb, I know kids are drinking alcohol and smoking at college events. Personally, I've made a life choice to stay away from that crap, but I don't hold judgment to my friends and others partaking. However, D has skipped the little white claws and high noons and started drinking straight vodka and tequila whenever she goes out. At first, when she told me, I just assumed she was taking a little shot here and there and calling it a day. However, some of her friends who know me and our relationship have let me know via Insta that she's drinking to the point of blacking out and keeps multiple bottles of alcohol in her dorm room. I've called D and told her that she's turning into an alcoholic, that she should stop going out as much, and that drinking leads to more destructive behaviors. She brushed me off and called me judgemental and stuck up. She's even blown off our gaming nights to go smoke with her friends. \n\nLast night she texted and told me she had to call me about something serious. She told me that she was drinking alone last night to the point of wanting to kill herself.  Her roommates had found her called the police and she was brought to a psych ward. She told me that the police and her dad found out about the alcohol and that she ended up coming out to her dad unintentionally. She\u2019s also been lying to her psychiatrist and has been skipping her meds. She said she's been admitted and was calling to let me know so I wouldn't worry. I just told her that I love her like always, and that I'm glad she's still here. \n\nBut after getting off that phone call, all I could think was \u201cI fucking told you so. I told you the dangers of drinking and you ignored me.\u201d I\u2019ll I feel is anger. I feel angry that she would think that way about herself and want to leave me and her parents and her little sister. I\u2019m angry at her on campus \u201cfriends\u201d who observed this behavior and didn\u2019t stop it. They let her get this bad and I wasn\u2019t there to help her. It kills me that I\u2019m halfway across the country and can\u2019t afford to see her and make sure she\u2019s okay. And most of all, I\u2019m upset that if she ended up killing herself, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything about it. I\u2019m just her former middle school friend on FaceTime a million miles away.\n\nI haven\u2019t cried or felt sad and I\u2019m not sure if this is normal.",

The one thing I absolutely hate is how passive management is with the participants. They let them make any decision they want even if it ends up with someone falling down the stairs with little to no consequences.\n\nThe one guy they are horrible with and let him get away with anything. He is extremely violent and has hurt me and others on numerous occasions. The only consequence he faces is when he breaks things he just doesn't get to use it till it's fixed or replaced. Which is nothing, the worst part is this guy is smart and knows he can do whatever he wants and get away with it.\n\nThe worst time I experienced this was when me and another staff took him out to buy him candy with his own money. He wanted to buy a knife (it was a butter knife) and we said 'no'. It took alot just to get him away from the knifes and out the door. We managed to get him some of his candy and as protocol we gave him some. Still mad with us daring to say 'no' he threw the candy at me and tried to run back to the store to \"get the knife so I can stab you f*ckers\". I had to do a hold to stop him from going too far and hurting someone else. However the hold we are trained to do doesn't restrain both hands so they decided to scratch at my arm hard, to the point I was bleeding. It took a long time to calm him down and get him back in the car. The part that broke me was the fact he wanted me the one shaking and crying to apologize and my coworker who did nothing but call management to let them know what was going on also tried to get me to apologize. I couldn't cause I went completely non-verbal and just got in the car. I missed a week of work cause I was terrified of that participant and was locked up in my room. I filed a report for injuries, but nothing came of it.\n\nNow I just hate the participant. I'll never do anything to hurt or try and upset him, but I will always hate him and wish for his downfall.\n\nOne thing I want to note is that I understand alot of the people I work with can't control how they act. This one in particular also struggles to control their anger. However I've seen them handle 'no' from their parents and staff he likes and he was completely fine. He just doesn't like me and gets upset any time I ask him to do something or deter him away from dangerous things (I'm not rude about it I always ask very nicely I'm just not a guy or pretty enough so he hates me).\n\nTLDR: I despise a guy cause he can get away with anything he wants, including hurting others and he knows it.",

It was also a \"2nd notice.\" assuming the 1st one was lost in the mail. I was already gathering that for a different service, so I just made copies of the pay stubs, waited an hour, and turned in everything asked. That is when I was told that I had been Flagged for something involving income and needed to see a medicare insurance adjuster. I wondered if any were available and was told no and that I needed to come back tomorrow or call in.\n\nI asked if I could make an appointment but was told none were available, as \"due to holiday training and staff shortages, we are unable to fill requests for appointments at the moment.\" However, I would \"put a note in my file that it was a late notice.\"\n\nI asked if I could get an extraction as I never received proper notice. I was then told, \"Also, due to staffing shortages and holiday training, we cannot do extractions, nor can we, as we are not responsible for lost or delayed mail.\"\n\nShe then told me that the best option was to come in at 7 in the morning to be the first in line. I told them that I work tomorrow and can't come in. I was told I didn't have to, but it would be at the \"small penalty\" of losing my medical and dental through California. So I did that and was one of the first 15 people waiting in line for the doors to open in cold, rainy weather. I got a ticket and waited for about an hour, thinking I could make it to work on time at 1030am. I sat and told them I was there for a medical adjustment with a medicare insurance adjuster.\n\nI was told they were not one and that the hour's wait was to set an appointment. I was told I could have called or come in earlier to have a specialist set it up. I told them I tried yesterday, and there were none available. I was hit with, \"Well, it's not my fault you poorly planned this. Seeing as you had 2 weeks.\" I told them about the late notice and a note in the file. The man eye-rolled me and just scribed out the latter on my ticket. Telling me to expect my number to be called again in 2 hours and that in the future to be \"more mindful of prep and time management.\"\n\nI called my boss; he was surprised but was cool with me coming in later as long as I kept him updated. And so I waited as eight became 9 and 9 became 10. I checked in as it should be around time for the meeting and was told due to a lack of adjusters today, there will likely be unseen delays. So I had just to wait, and I skipped breakfast to get there, messing with my phone and eating some of the fruit offered there. I messaged my boss every half hour as he was skeptical that any department could wait this long.\n\nby the 11 or 12th hour of the day, they started giving out parking passes as the parking lot had a two-hour limit and needed one. There was a small argument between one of the managers and staff members about whether they should ask the ones here over the limit just to move their cars as they technically violate the parking code, and we shouldn't be encouraging that behavior. a 3rd staff member had to step in just to hand out the passes.\n\nSo, by the 13th hour and a half, when I was falling asleep and wondering how much of my shift I would have left, someone poked me in the face and told me to look up. A new number had popped up. It was mine.\n\nI go through the door with paperwork in hand to see the Ajestor about what the problem was. It turns out they wanted to know if I had SSI payments and asked why I didn't have any from SSI. I told her that I wasn't on SSI, and she told me that was the problem. When applying for Calcover, I marked down that I had a federally recognized disability, autism. So they wanted to see if I was making too much for the program; when I didn't show any SSI payouts, i was flagged for possible fraud and they tried to ask me in person if I had any other forms of assisted living payouts or financial aid. I told them i was disqualified due to being able to work.\n\nSo the adjustor told me that next time, I needed to uncheck that box as legally, for health care, I didn't have a federally recognized disability as it implies I'm getting federal aid. So I waited nearly 6 hours for a 15-minute meeting asking me not to say I have autism on a federal level.\n\nMy god, why do we put people through this?",

    "selftext": "I don't really know what to make of this, and I don't really have anyone to talk to about it. I (23F) started my master's this academic year and was brought in as a graduate assistant in one of the academic advising offices on campus. Our office has a new director who comes from a high school administration background and relatively new advisors (two of them, both have been here five years max).\n\nUntil yesterday, I didn't know why the previous GA left her role. She clearly left in a hurry because my office (her office) still had wall decorations, cork boards with posters and flyers, supplies, and cabinets chock-full of folders with papers, guides, flyers - you name it, it's here. It looked like the place was already in use is what I'm getting at. She created entire binders about our department's programs and even fully stocked the supply closet that we have. I knew she hadn't left due to graduation, it had to be either right before she graduated or she hadn't renewed her contract, but I didn't know why. It's not really my business, but I was curious and wanted to be sure it wasn't for something nefarious.\n\nSo, my suspicions rise when a classmate of mine, M, recognized the office that I said I'm a GA for (a handful of us are GAs, most of them for our college, but me in this advising office) and she brought up that she used to work there in undergrad until she graduated last year. M started asking about names from when she was there, and it became apparent we've had a lot of staff changes in less than a year. I thought, \"Interesting, I wonder why?\" She also did not like most of the people (advisors/director) who are/were here. I kind of shrugged it off, figuring that she probably just had some bad experiences or that the leadership prior to our current director was suboptimal, because I liked my coworkers. Na\u00efvet\u00e9 on my part, I'll admit.\n\nBut something hasn't quite left me since that day: M said the previous director, let's call him Colin, resigned after being caught in a relationship with a student. I took this with a grain of salt because I hadn't heard that, not even from the other student workers who like to gossip, and M had made it clear that she didn't enjoy the office atmosphere.\n\nThings came to a head for me yesterday, when I met with the current director to discuss some issues with the website. Things progressed to how she doesn't like how disorganized the supply closet currently is, and her plans to clean it out with our administrative assistant over spring break. She mentioned having so much stuff left behind by the previous GA, like thick binders of who-knows-what, and not knowing what to do with them. They're multiple 5-inch binders stuffed to the brim.\n\nBringing up the GA snowballed until Director casually mentioned how my coworker, let's call him Andrew, one of the two advisors in our department, was the one caught making sexual advances - and *toward the previous GA.* They had gone out for drinks after-hours (unsure if it was with a group), and he had texted her inappropriately about hooking up. The then-director, Colin, received word of this but didn't want to do anything about it. He was promptly fired for his inaction once an actual, full-blown Title IX case opened against Andrew.\n\nThe GA left after this incident and no one has seen her since. She left everything behind. Her friends harassed the office to try and hold Colin accountable, but it wasn't until the case was opened that action was taken.\n\nI'm in shock and just don't know how to process these instances. *He* came onto my predecessor, yet she left, and he is still working here. I don't even know if she's graduated, but it makes sense now why her stuff was left behind and why nobody talks about her aside from the student workers who don't know the truth.",

But since last year, it has been a bit up and down between all the three of us. It all started when my ex suddenly showed up at my door wanting to talk. But this girl friend of mine got angry at me because I asked back the money I am owed back, and went and told my boyfriend that my ex showed up, we \u201ctalked\u201d and some other stuff. This caused a major break in between our relationship, and I only knew about this recently that she was the one who ratted me out when it wasn\u2019t her place. I would have told him, but she went ahead and told him adding unnecessary untrue details to it.\n\nWe had some misunderstandings, and we moved past that. But as of now, she seems to be becoming more possessive of him, though she has her own boyfriend. She expects him to take her out everywhere, doesn\u2019t include me, and he seems to be doing it. But when I ask him, it\u2019s always reasons and excuses. \n\nShe still owes me a little around $600, and I am honestly scared to ask her about it. They have been doing a lot of video calls, texting constantly and I know it may be nothing but I just cannot digest the fact. I know I need to be more trusting but I feel like a third wheel in my own relationship. He expects me to adjust to this, but why should I be adjusting in MY relationship.\n\nYesterday night, I questioned him about it and he came to hit me. I got shocked that he raised his hand on me when I asked why did he video call her. He keeps saying I am more important to him and I am his first priority but I just cannot understand why he would get so angry when I questioned about it. This was the third time in a row he raised his hand on me. But later consoled me. I asked him to choose between me or her, he said he is in a situation where she is his roommate and he cannot do anything. I hate the fact that she is so touchy around him, I just hate it. \n \nI trust him that he wouldn\u2019t do anything behind my back like sleep with her, but I just cannot let it go. I am still in shock from yesterday night. I feel like I lost all my friends because of him, I don\u2019t feel like I belong with anyone and I don\u2019t even have anyone to talk about this that I have to vent it out on Reddit. \n\nTL;DR my boyfriend seems to be involving our mutual friend a lot into our relationship and seems to be choosing her over me.",

The moment I push back, I\u2019m met with guilt-tripping and emotional manipulation: \"You\u2019re disobedient.\" \"You\u2019ve dishonored us.\" \"I will never forgive you until the Day of Judgment.\"\n\nAnd many of the things they react this way to aren\u2019t even that big of a deal. For example, I\u2019ve always wanted to cut my hair short, but my mother made it clear that if I ever did, she wouldn\u2019t forgive me and that it would be a a sin hanging over my neck until Judgment Day.

They tell me they\u2019ll force me into marrying someone against my will or that they\u2019d lock me in a room if I disobey them.

He seemed easygoing and respectful, so when he asked if I wanted to meet for a cigarette, not at my place, just somewhere outside in the neighborhood.\n\nWhen he arrived, we sat outside and talked for a bit. Then he suggested going to a nearby hotel. Only if I wanted to, of course, but it was cold and dark, and he said we could just sit inside, have a drink, and talk. He promised he wouldn\u2019t try anything, that he didn\u2019t want to be intimate either. He seemed harmless, trustworthy even. So I agreed, telling him I only had two hours anyway.\n\nAt first, he was still friendly. But as time passed, he started acting off. I kept my distance, positioning myself in a way that made it clear I wasn\u2019t comfortable with any physical closeness. Then he went to the bathroom. When he came back, he was only in his boxers.\n\nI told him to put his clothes back on and that I was leaving. That was the moment I felt truly unsafe. I got up, heading for the door when he grabbed me by my ponytail and pulled me to the floor.\n\nI fought as hard as I could, but he knew exactly how to overpower me. At first, he didn\u2019t rape me he *enjoyed* me fighting back. He hit me, yanked my hair, and choked me so hard I couldn\u2019t even make a sound. He threw me all over the room. My body is covered in bruises, even on my throat. And then, at some point, he raped me. I pleaded for him to stop, but he just threatened me over and over again.\n\nEventually, my phone rang. I saw my chance and told him I had to answer it, that my friend would be suspicious if I didn\u2019t call her back immediately, and that she had my location (she didn\u2019t and it wasn\u2019t a friend calling I was lying). I told him I\u2019d just meet her quickly and then come back. He let me go and I left.\n\nIf this had happened to someone else, I would never blame them. But standing in my own shoes, I can\u2019t stop thinking: What the fuck is wrong with me? Who goes to a hotel with a guy they just met? I\u2019m almost 30. I should know better. I should have learned my lesson by now.\n\nBut I don\u2019t feel scared. I don\u2019t feel sad. I don\u2019t even feel vulnerable. And that makes it hard to process what actually happened to me.",

Whenever I asked, he insisted that everything was fine.\n\nAbout a year and a half after that, due to circumstances beyond our control, we had to sleep in the same bed. I asked if he was okay with it or if we should switch rooms, and he said it was fine. Still, I did my best to stay on my side of the bed so he wouldn\u2019t feel uncomfortable. Unfortunately, at some point during the night, I rolled over onto his arm in my sleep. He woke me up and asked me to move. The next night, he decided to sleep in a different room, saying it was because of the bed. I thought that was an excuse, but I didn\u2019t press him\u2014he had every right to make that choice. Instead, he slept in a room with two of our female friends, A (19F) and K (18F).\n\nAfter that, things mostly returned to normal, except I noticed that A and K became more aggressive toward T.\n\nFast forward to about a month ago: I was out for coffee with A, and we were discussing T. He had made an awful joke toward K, and I was defending him when A suddenly said she had to tell me something. She revealed that on the night he changed rooms, he had told them about what happened. He told them I had feelings for him, that he constantly felt uncomfortable around me, and even outed me as bisexual (I am closeted because I live in a very homophobic country). He also told them that he couldn\u2019t wait to work abroad for the summer so he could get a break from me.\n\nAt first, I didn\u2019t want to believe her, but she knew details only he and I had discussed, and I was sure I hadn\u2019t told her. A said they hadn\u2019t told me sooner because they thought I wouldn\u2019t believe them.\n\nI was crushed. I confronted T over the phone, but he claimed he didn\u2019t remember anything from that night and insisted A and K were just trying to ruin our friendship.\n\nWe\u2019re meeting for drinks in a few days to talk face-to-face and hopefully resolve things. I don\u2019t know what to think. Everything points to him betraying me, and his excuse isn\u2019t convincing\u2014but I don\u2019t want to believe it. Any advice would be welcome.",

During covid I went up to 250 pounds but last year was a bad year for me mentally and I lost 90 pounds without going to the gym. My body looks good in clothes now but my naked body is pretty saggy and has wrinkled lose skin and cellulite in some places. My boobs which used to be my favourite thing about me now look like small sad deflated balls of sand. I\u2019ve been talking to this cute guy to meet up for casual sex and I want to do stuff with him but he goes to the gym every day and his body looks great and mine looks terrible. He\u2019s seen what I look like in photos and in clothes but im afraid he will be disappointed by how I look naked and I don\u2019t want to catfish him or go through the process of him rejecting me in person.\n\nI\u2019m against sending nudes for security reasons and I also wouldn\u2019t want to go through with it if he\u2019s just going to screw me that night just to get off and ghost me because I don\u2019t look good.

    "selftext": "I(18/ M) passed my theoretical exam for my drivers license today, it\u2018s crucial to me to have a license because I live on a mountain far outside the city. \n\nI went home and told my mother about the great news, she asked me wether I had to do another one or not, we had agreed 2 weeks earlier that I would do the 2 exams( general knowledge/ Automobile) split because learning and memorizing 1400 questions isn\u2018t for me. I told her I did have to do another one but the next placement is on the 20th of march. she got very mad screamed at me and threw things while yelling what a disappointment I had become. \n\nI have to add, the last couple of months have been hard on me, my boss had a big problem with my appearance( for understanding I worked at a high class gym in my city) because I am very muscular and outshine him in a lot of ways, I also have a buzzcut but that shouldn\u2018t matter. because of my boss bullying and nagging me the last 7 months( yes it started in august), I quit, today I handed in my letter of resignation, I couldn\u2018t do it anymore, working 50-60 hours a week for an ungrateful boss that hates me and wants to fire me anyways isn\u2018t my thing I don\u2018t take disrespect. I\u2018ve been into working out for a couple of years and got my personal trainer license in winter of 2023, my mom was so proud. Yet she didn\u2018t work, my first paycheck went entirely into her purse, I didn\u2018t mind because I like responsibility and do plan to have kids in the next few years, so I have to be able to provide for people, yet she blew all my money on cigarettes cheap alcohol and gas to drive my sister and me to school, oh and the rent and electricity bill of course, there are no gas bills because we heat with wood.\nI was and am fine with that nothing wrong there, but after almost a year of unemployment for her she started becoming unbearable, she started yelling at me daydrinking, at one point she tried to punch and fight me physically. \nI begged one of her friends to find her a job at their workplace so she could finally get some fresh air, she had a boyfriend whom I got along with very well, very intelligent man, but her stubborn attitude and her narcissistic behavior obviously drove him away, I couldn\u2018t even blame him, in the time of my mothers unemployment I raised my half-sister (13/ F)\ndrove her to practice on my bike,until I crashed it beyond repair, I made arrangements for her to be driven and picked up from everywhere. my mom started working, it is nice to see her happy and thriving, but she always had a bad temper and a lot of self hatred. I love my mother, I have always loved her for every sacrifice she made for me. but I stopped feeling anything towards her today.\n\n after a heated argument, me staying mostly calm because I\u2018m the type to shut down and become quiet once I\u2018m yelled at, and my mother yelling at me. She said, that I don\u2018t have money, I don\u2018t have assets, I don\u2018t even work anymore, and that all this bullshit that has been piling up was too much for her to handle. \nI asked her if she wants me to move out and she said I should fuck myself and go to hell or wherever else I wanna go, I\u2018m in tears. I\u2018ve been living in this house for 7 years, a comfortable life that I tried to sustain for as long as possible. I have a job offer in chicago, but I don\u2018t have the funds to go there, I don\u2018t have enough money to buy a one way ticket for me and my fianc\u00e9e (18/F) and one month of rent+ a downpayment on an apartment. I could move there but it\u2018s 10000km away. I have had reasons to move out before but decided to stick around so my sister has a male influence growing up, now she\u2018s a teenager and I\u2018ll never stop being there for her. I have packed my bag, I have prepared to get away from my home which I\u2018ve lived in for so long. I\u2018m applying for jobs tomorrow, going to a jobcenter, getting all my documents, renewing my CV and just applying at every gym I know. I\u2018m crashing at my fianc\u00e9es place tomorrow night and see how long it takes for me to find something to start over with in a proper manner. I\u2018m in shambles, I know I could live in this house for another month, another half a year too, but I lost my will to do so long ago. I\u2018ve always wanted to compete in bodybuilding, but I am scared that all the dreams I have such as: Building a beautiful healthy family, having a homestead, winning and receiving an IFBB pro card, retiring my future wife and building wealth for my family, I come from nothing but I need to do everything, I\u2018m hopeless scared and alone, I\u2018ll figure it out by myself though I\u2018m confident.\n\nif there is anyone who has advice for me, anyone who has been in a similar situation, please reply.\n\n",

    "selftext": "*!no names are real names!* For some context let me start by explains my family tree and giving some history. I 20 female am the oldest child. My parent we\u2019ll call them Bob and Lynda (not real names) had three kids me and a set of boy/girl twins ( East and brook). Then my mom cheated and got with a guy (Tony) and had two half brothers (Timmy and tommy). She then cheated again with a new guy (Bret) who was also cheating on his wife. He had two kids with his ex wife (Kat and Sam) my now step sisters. And my mom Lynda and Bret had two more kids (spike and Leo). Meanwhile my dad and step mom (Molly) had one daughter (Katie). So there\u2019s 9 kids  total with my mom, in order it\u2019s: me, East and brook, Kat, Timmy, Tommy, Sam, Spike Leo. My parents had 50/50 custody of us given to them by the court. My dad tried reporting my mom for abuse and the court did nothing about it. It\u2019s very pro mommy where we live. My mom Lynda and Bret are very abusive parents. They used to to things like hit us, throw us outside, make us stand on chairs for hours on end without being able to get down, put shock collars on us and starve us. I remember once that I missed a spot mopping the floor and they made me use my toothbrush to clean it ( no I didn\u2019t get a new one). We were also very low income but my mom and Bret always found a way to take trips to Disney and have expensive date nights. Them being out often left me home alone with kids for hours if not days at a time. This went on from the time I was 11-16. At 16 I finally said enough was enough and made the decision to live with my dad. I got thearapy and have been doing much better. It\u2019s been 4 years since I left. I have tried to fix things with my mom and Bret multiple times but my mom always falls short and blames me for leaving instead of herself for her actions. However when I left to stay with my dad my sister brook chose to stay with my mom without giving anyone an explanation. My dad wasn\u2019t bad to her but they where never close. My sister brook is my moms golden Child, her favorite and her mini. My sister was a snake my whole childhood and could get away with murder. So she left my dad and never looked back. Well this year she turned 18 and on her birthday my mom had posted a video of her asking my step dad to adopt her and today was the day of her adoption. I found out through my moms ex baby daddy Tony that she was being adopted because Timmy messaged him about being taken out of school to witness it. He shared the messages with me and then I shared them to my step mom and other family. Not my dad because in these 4 years he has been grieving my sister leaving and finding this out will only hurt more.I\u2019m devastated for my dad and have left it up to my step mom to tell him. I just cannot understand what there thoughts are and why my sister has done any of what she\u2019s done in the last 4 years but I cannot say I\u2019m happy for her. But I wanted to get this out and I just needed to vent it somewhere. I guess in the 4 years I\u2019ve been gone I\u2019ve really been holding in a lot of what happened to me and still cannot find it in myself to let go or forgive them. Thank you Reddit for listening.

But I also noticed on Tuesday that I was feeling really low and didn't know why. Same yesterday, and today is even worse. It occurred to me that my brain isn't getting its usual constant dopamine supply throughout the day from checking Facebook and seeing that I have notifications or new info to read (even if it turns out to be nothing interesting). I know that social media is engineered to give you a hit of dopamine with every notification to keep you engaged and coming back for more. And I'm starting to think my brain is literally addicted and I'm going through withdrawal. I'm actually really proud of myself and given how awful I feel right now, I feel even more resolve to break this addiction and not go back to how I was. But man, I feel like shit. I just feel so depressed and want to do nothing but sleep. I keep wanting snacks even though I'm not hungry, and I think that's my brain desperately seeking other sources of dopamine. This sucks.

    "selftext": "First post here and from phone so apologies if there\u2019s poor formatting. Also not sure if this is the right platform but turning to here as I need to get this out of my system.\n\nAs the title says, I (21M) ended things off with my girlfriend (21F) last night and I feel awful. I had initially thought that I would feel relieved \nbut it\u2019s tearing me apart. She was my first. We were together for 2 years and all of 5 mins it was just gone. Took everything in me to not lose it on the train ride home. Even though I initiated it, I hate myself for what hurt it has caused her and I haven\u2019t been able to sleep or eat well. It\u2019s really harder than I had imagined.\n\nOf course with any relationship, there were low moments but there were also some of the highest highs and I was so blessed to be with her. I broke things off because I haven\u2019t been in a good place recently and I didn\u2019t want to \u201cbleed\u201d on her due to whatever circumstances I may have. In hindsight, this was immature thinking as I chose the easy way out and I\u2019m now dealing with immeasurable amounts of pain as a consequence.\n\nToday at work the events from the previous night replayed in my head over and over. I said what I had wanted to say but something still didn\u2019t feel right. Thing is, I do not think this is a \u201ctake time to heal\u201d situation. Part of me feels like it was poor judgement to not fight off my thoughts of leaving.\n\nI really miss her terribly. \n\nNot looking for any sympathy here. Just wanted to pen down my thoughts that clearly aren\u2019t very cohesive with no fear of judgement. \n\nIf you\u2019re reading this, thank you for everything. I\u2019m sorry for the small things we bickered about that escalated unnecessarily. Thank you for our fun dates that brought me so much joy. I\u2019m sorry for all the tears you shed because of me and my actions. Thank you for the past two years.\n",

    "selftext": "In my younger years, I\u2019ve struggled with drugs. I\u2019ve done everything you can think of, but the only drug that scared me to my core was meth. The first time I smoked it, my brain said , \u201cThis is what you\u2019ve been looking for your whole life,\u201d so I was a functional meth addict for 3 years (would go on week-long benders every 4-5 months), then I quit, cold turkey with all substances, for 5 years, started getting muscular at the gym, got my life stable and manageable. \n\nNow I own my own landscaping company and I flip homes; life is good. But it was getting overwhelming. The paperwork that comes with self-employment is the bane of my existence. Especially because I was diagnosed with severe ADHD as a child. \n\nSo about a year and a half ago, I went to my doctor to get diagnosed again so I can get prescribed some kind of medication. I knew I was going to need something to keep my business growing without completely crumbling it under my lack of focus.\n\nI went through the long process and got denied because by divine providence I smoked weed for the first time in years about 5 days prior. I was infuriated. So I finally said fuck it and looked up old contacts and bought 3 grams of meth the next day. I still remember holding that bag like I was Sm\u00e9agol with the One Ring lol. The deep whisper that calls to all addicts beckoned me to go all in, to smoke that shit right up.  But by that point I had already realized the simple joy of living a true, peaceful life and I knew I would throw it all away if I started back up again. \n\nI bought a milligram scale and started off with 25 milligrams. The realization of seeing what 25 milligrams of meth looked like made me understand the sheer power of amphetamines. For years, people were smoking grams of this shit. Consuming it like candy, yet all you ever need is a crystal the size of a grain of sand.\n\nI put them into individual pill cases and started to take one a day. If I haven\u2019t taken a dose before 10am then I would skip taking it altogether. \n\nI\u2019ve tried Adderall in high school from friends, and I really enjoyed how it made me focus, meth felt cleaner, more aggressive. Over time, I started to remember my appointments without having to write them down. My sleep schedule became predictable as I never sleep during the day anymore. And my willingness to work harder is becoming effortless. Sex is always amazing, and I stopped drinking again because I\u2019ve become sociable without the need for alcohol. \n\nThe best thing that has happened is that I\u2019m more aggressive with business negotiations. I\u2019m less nervous and I\u2019m not afraid to assert my dominance when I feel it is necessary. \n\nNow, I can never think of ever smoking this stuff again. I know I\u2019m the exception and I\u2019m not telling you to use drugs. Meth is powerful and will destroy your life before you realize what\u2019s going on. But I just needed to tell someone. Ask me anything you want. Btw I still haven\u2019t finished the 3 grams I first purchased a year ago. It\u2019ll probably last me another year before I have to go back out on the streets for more.",

    "selftext": "In the beginning of the year, my (27f) ex husband (27m) came to me after not talking for a year since the divorce finalized, to confess to me of having sexual fantasies about children and looking at cp while we were together. I took this information to the police and have been working with an investigator since then, and made a controlled call to him with the investigator where he confessed only to looking at animated cp because \u201cthe real stuff is really hard to find\u201d. Today I was told that they spoke with him and looked at his devices and haven\u2019t found any evidence and are closing the case. And it\u2019s a relief that, to the best of my knowledge, he didn\u2019t hurt any children or consume any content that hurt actual children. But I was also warming up to the idea that he would face some kind of consequences for his actions. Because he also emotionally manipulated and raped me throughout our entire marriage. I know that I could still try to press charges for what he did to me, but I don\u2019t really have any proof except for my own words. And I want to be able to just move on and enjoy my life now that I\u2019m free from him. But he has a new girlfriend who is significantly younger and reminds me of me when I was young and fell for his bullshit. It feels so wrong that he can just do all of this and put me through so much and have nothing happen. \n\nI hope he\u2019s telling the truth about getting help and wanting to change, but I also can\u2019t help but believe that every word that comes out of his mouth is a lie, even when he believes it\u2019s the truth.

    "selftext": "\nI (20F) just went through my boyfriend (21M) of seven months phone for the first time. I have my face in his phone, and he\u2019s told me multiple times that I can. However what I found has hurt me and hit my confidence in myself and my relationship.\n\nI know that some girls have felt it too, that little nagging feeling that something is wrong. When I looked, I went straight for the girl best friend. And that is exactly where I found messages between them, Sexting. \n\nIt was about a year ago at this point that these messages were sent, however, they were saved in chat. He is still best friends with this girl and did not tell me about this because he said that he didn\u2019t wanna lose her.\n\nTo give a little context, I have been cheated on with the girl best friend before, twice. So this immediately raised some red flags for me. To top it off too, recently the amount of times we are intimate has severely decreased(once a week or sometimes less) \n\nI cried for a bit, and then I woke him up to talk to him about it. He apologized, and I was very mature and tried not to let my jealousy show. I told him it\u2019s OK that he is still friends with her. I just wish she had told me.\n\nHowever, a couple days later here we are, I can\u2019t stop thinking about it, and how she\u2019s everything I\u2019m not. She\u2019s skinny with blonde hair, he sexted with her and never does with me, and he seemed to be way more attracted to her than me.\nI can\u2019t help but overthink and be jealous.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nthank you for all of the advice. I talked to my boyfriend and we have started to work it out, and set some boundaries so we can move forward. I am a firm believer of not having friends of the opposite sex but I also would never want to make him choose between us. He is an amazing guy and hopefully this just ends up being something we look back on. We have some growing to do of course, we\u2019re young and new to this relationship, but we want to work it out together.\n\nTo clear some things up, no he did not cheat, just saying I have experience that issue with girl best friends in the past, and saying that I invaded is privacy is wrong. He put my face in him phone and told me I can look through it if I needed to. Yes, I\u2019m crazy jealous, yeah I have some self doubt, but I was just venting about something that was bothering me, so then I could put words to paper and evaluate how I wanted to go about handling this.\n\nJust want to remind some people that everyone is different, along with their relationships.\nI hope you have the day you deserve &lt;3",

After like 5 minutes i heard a couple starting to argue pretty loudly.\n\nI don't know who they are but just listened a bit. They were arguing about a possible break up after he caught her kissing another guy and she wasn't apologetic or something like this but was arguing back that everyone make mistakes and after 3 years of relathionship for her this wasn't a major reason to break up cause she was drunk and don't remember anything about it.\n\nI'm gonna say the exact piece of conversation that i heard: her \"are you serious? You wanna break up with me for a kiss that didn't meant anything? Are you insane?\" him \"of course, what else would you expect? Me cheering you up for another? Or maybe more?\" her \"but this insane, it's not cheating. It was just a kiss when i was drunk. It meant nothing\" him \"to you maybe not but to me yes. It's called taking responsabilities of our own actions. I can't believe i'm even here to argue about this\" her \"me too cause this insane, it was just a damn kiss while i was drunk that meant nothing\" him \"well this ends here, i'm tired of you and your excuses\" her \"you know right that if you break up with me you will never find anyone like me right?\" him \"well honestly i hope so\" pause and then she \"do you think you are funny? Should i laugh?\" him \"do what you want but i really hope to never find someone like you\" her \"i was way out of your league anyway so it's your loss and not mine\" him \"whatever you say ex gf now i wanna go home and text your sister. She is hell hotter than you\" her \"don't you dare. I will ruin you if you only try\" him \"well this is funny cause a few days ago she texted me first so let's see how things goes\".\n\nBelieve me i almost chocked myself from not laughing at this.

    "selftext": "TLDR: Wife\u2019s family felt entitled to my money to help with their mother\u2019s retirement, and none of them have ever expressed one word of gratitude.\u00a0 Not looking for advice, just venting.\n\nBackstory: I\u2019m 65M, wife is 61F.\u00a0 Married 36 years.\u00a0 Wife has three siblings: one older brother, one older sister, one younger sister.\u00a0 We were very close with all of her siblings and their spouses for many years; we went on dozens of vacations with all of them, always had gatherings at holidays, spent weekends at each other\u2019s homes, etc.\n\nHer brother and I were as close as we could be, always hanging out, playing music, and having a great time.\u00a0 I loved him more than my own brothers.\u00a0 He began to hate me in 2020 because I had the gall to disagree with his political views.  When he found out I voted for Biden, he screamed at me \u201cWE\u2019RE FUCKING DONE\u201d at a family gathering.\u00a0 He\u2019s barely said two words to me since then.\n\nHer older sister and her husband have had a simmering ill-will towards my wife and I for many years.\u00a0 Back in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, I was earning great money, and we used to take them and their kids on vacations that were 99 percent paid by me, because they didn\u2019t have two nickels to rub together.\u00a0 If we bought a new piece of furniture or TV or whatever, we would offer them our barely used stuff, for free, which they (seemingly) gladly accepted.\u00a0 We did these things because we loved them. Evidently, they took our generosity as \u201ctreating them like a charity case\u201d.\u00a0 Now that they are both in high-earning careers and don\u2019t need anything from us, they basically hate us for \u201ctreating them that way\u201d, and now simply look down their noses, sneer, and snub us.\n\nHer younger sister and her husband have always been \u201cgood Christians\u201d but have become more fervent (\u201cEvangelical\u201d Southern Baptist) over the years.\u00a0 I made the mistake of having a discussion about religious beliefs (I am an atheist) with the husband several years ago.\u00a0 I know a thousand times more about his \u201cHoly Bible\u201d than he does, and the discussion did not go well for him.\u00a0 Ever since then, they have done their best to ostracize us from the family at every opportunity.\n\nFast forward: My wife\u2019s 80-year-old father passed away a couple of years ago, leaving his wife (my MIL, also 80) widowed.\u00a0 They relied almost exclusively on Social Security for their retirement income.\u00a0 After his death, there was a \u201cshortfall\u201d in the MIL\u2019s monthly SS income.\u00a0 My wife\u2019s three siblings had a meeting and decided that the shortfall would be made up by the four siblings, split evenly.\u00a0 Each \u201cshare\u201d came to $2,500 annually to make up the MIL\u2019s \u201cshortfall\u201d.\u00a0 All three of the other couples are fairly wealthy, with annual incomes in the $250-350K range, and all have 401(k) accounts over $1 million, which they brag about.\u00a0 My wife does not work.\u00a0 I own a small business, which has slowed dramatically since covid; I make around $75k in a good year.\u00a0 I would like to retire at some point, so I am trying to save every dollar that I can in order to do so.\u00a0 I will rely heavily on Social Security for retirement income.\n\nThe long and short of it is that I had to funnel $2,500 per year into MIL\u2019s \u201cretirement needs\u201d that would have otherwise gone towards my own retirement savings.\u00a0 The way the siblings view it is: \u201cyour money is your wife\u2019s money, therefore she needs to chip in to help her mom\u201d.\u00a0 Fortunately, two years into that arrangement, the MIL sold her house (she moved in with one of the siblings) and netted around $200k.\u00a0 She told my wife that with that money, plus her SS income, AND the $50,000 she \u201calready had in savings\u201d, I would no longer need to contribute to her income, especially since her expenses were now basically zero.\u00a0\u00a0 So thankfully, I only had to \u201cdonate\u201d $5,000 of my retirement money to the MIL.\n\nThe shitty part is that not one of the siblings, or the MIL, have ever expressed one word of thanks or gratitude to me even though they are well aware that the money we contributed came 100% from my earnings.\u00a0 We still have to see them every now and then at weddings or funerals or whatever, and they have never even acknowledged my contribution and sacrifice. Their sense of entitlement is appalling, especially in light of the fact that they all have a great disdain for me and consider me to be \u201ctheir asshole brother-in-law\u201d.",

She would stay at his place while I was home taking care of our two stepkids (5 and 8) and our son (4). I was struggling financially because she was out drinking all the time with her friends, spending money we didn\u2019t have, while I stayed home looking after the kids.\n\nThen, in December 2022, she started cheating on me with a different guy\u2014Mark. She promised over and over that she\u2019d stop, but she never did. We ended up getting evicted in April 2023, and she moved in with her brother.

She said she was at her brother\u2019s, but in reality, she had secretly moved in with Mark. I found out when I logged into her accounts\u2014yeah, I know I shouldn\u2019t have, but it was the only way to get the truth because she compulsively lies. (She was living at her brothers for a couple months then after the wedding she moved in with him)\n\nShe even took Mark to her sister\u2019s wedding, bought him clothes for it, and kept telling me we were going to fix things. She made dozens of promises\u2014saying she\u2019d visit me with the kids, bake me cakes, buy me gifts\u2014but she never showed.\n\nEven after I found out everything in October, she still asked me for money in December, saying Mark wouldn\u2019t help her. And I gave it to her, like an idiot. In total, I\u2019ve given her around \u00a33,000 because she made it seem like we\u2019d work things out. I even paid for the carpets in her new house because she told me she\u2019d cut Mark off once she moved. But now I know that was just another lie.\n\nThroughout all of last summer, she was constantly gaslighting me. I caught her sending nudes to Mark while playing Stardew Valley with him late at night while I was asleep. She\u2019d go out every night with him, and whenever I confronted her, she\u2019d call me crazy and make me feel like I was the one in the wrong. At one point, she and Mark even tried to get me to be friends with him\u2014we all played games together, and I had no idea what was actually going on behind my back.\n\nEven now, when I ignore her, she acts upset and says \"there's still something there.\" But all she ever does is use me. She sends me explicit pictures and videos while claiming she \u201cjust wants to be friends.\u201d And when I tell her she\u2019s confusing me, she shuts down the conversation because it's \u201ctoo stressful\u201d for her. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve been the one supporting her, giving her money, and being there for her when she needed help.\n\nI also hate her friend Emily because she covered for her constantly. she\u2019s cousins with Mark and was helping her lie to me the whole time.\n\nOne of the worst moments was when I visited her brother\u2019s place while she was staying there. I found used tissues under the bed, and she swore up and down they weren\u2019t what I thought they were\u2014but come on, it was obvious. It was disgusting. And yet she still called me crazy. (She actually made out they were snot cause she had a cold but there was like 50 tissues under the bed lmao)\n\nWhenever I ask her what she wants, she just says, \"I don't know. I need to live alone and figure things out because I\u2019m not well mentally or physically.\" But if that were true, why is she still stringing me along, keeping me as a backup plan while she\u2019s with him?\n\nShe tells me I\u2019m \u201cstalkative\u201d and that I\u2019m the bad guy, but I only ever found out the truth by logging into her stuff\u2014because without doing that, I\u2019d still be believing her lies. I know I should\u2019ve just walked away, but I love her. I actually cared.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m just too nice, or maybe I\u2019m an idiot. But a part of me always thought this was just a rough patch, that we could fix things and go back to how we were before all of this. Maybe she\u2019s sick mentally, or maybe she\u2019s just a terrible person. I don\u2019t know.\n\nThe one thing I do know is I feel used, betrayed, and like I\u2019ve wasted so much time and money on someone who never really cared about me the same way. And the worst part? She still wants me to keep all of this quiet.\n\nAt this point, I feel like I should just tell Mark everything and ruin things for her, because I don't think it's fair that after everything she got it all.\n\n\n(This is actually typed by me)\n\nLike I'm currently on my parents sofa, I barely see my son, I keep trying to find private or council places but I'm getting nowhere. My depression is genuinely awful like I feel like after everything I have nothing I've just lost it all and no matter how much I try it won't get better. I used to be depressed at uni, even tried to kill myself on my birthday but my flat mates actually got me a birthday cake and stuff and it put me off for a bit, like it was genuinely heartbreaking.\n\nThing is my credit score is completely fucked as well cause I let her use my credit card and my very account and stuff and my credit score is tanked to hell because of it.\n\nLike I am genuinely screwed and it's like trying to claw myself out of quicksand, struggling is just making me sink further into it.\n\nI don't know what do you guys think? Is there a chance do I give an ultimatum or just do I give into everything\n\n[I've ran this through chatgpt because originally I was just trying to get this off my chest through it and get some advice but I figured here would be a good place to get some Human advice and it'd help get rid of all the identifying details\n\nIf anything doesn't make sense just comment it and I'll elaborate on it cause I've noticed a few details are wrong but  I mostly wanted to get it off my chest anyway]\n",

    "selftext": "Throwaway account.\n\nSorry if the story is too long because the details are a bit fresh.\n\nI  have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for a couple of years.\nI am finishing up university, but since I major in Humanities, my career prospects seem bleak. Also, I had problems with with uni so I had to repeat a few semesters. Both of these things are a source of my anxiety and depression.\n\nI have friends and family members, but not a significant other or a person with whom I can talk about my problems.\n\nFor the past several months, I have been looking for a job without too much success. At the same time, I was trying to find help for my depression, insecurities and suicidal thoughts. Since I'm broke and cannot afford a therapist, I found an organization that offers free counseling. After filling out their application, they told me I should go to the hospital because they are not qualified to handle patients experiencing suicidal thoughts.\n\nI had my reservations about doing that since public healthcare, especially regarding mental health, albeit free, is pretty bad in my country.\n\nFast forward one month, I managed to get two job offers, one in a translation company, which is a 9 to 5, and an evening teaching job.\n\nI was pretty excited about the success in getting not one, but two job offers so I decided to take it easy and not exaust myself with work. I thought that the best course of action for me was to start doing both jobs until I figured out which one I liked more so I could focus on that job or even quit the other one.\n\nMonday was my first day on the translation job. In short, it went pretty horribly. The \"translation\" job turned out to be a regular office job, where I had to scan documents and edit Word files, and it did not involve any sort of translation or useful skill that could help me further my career. Bear in mind, I have had several translation jobs and I am not a complete beginner.\n\nAfter coming back home, I just started crying and felt desperate because that unpleasant experience on my first day on the job brought up all my repressed emotions to the surface, uncertainty about my career, loneliness, and the fact that all people my age have accomplished something in their lives except me.\n\nTherefore, I gathered my courage and took a taxi to the hospital, hoping to find a therapist with whom I can talk about my problems.\nI went to the ER and talked to the nurse working at the reception, who was very compassionate and patient. Then, she led me to talk to a psychiatrist, who after listening to my woes politely informed me that I would be transferred to a psychiatric hospital (or a mental asylum if you like) since the hospital is full and they can't take me. He also told me that I should not try and leave the hospital otherwise they would be required by law to call the police since I said that I sufferred from suicidal thoughts.\n\nThen, I waited for two hours until the ambulance arrived and an ambulance crew member escorted me to the car, holding me by my arm so that I would not try to escape, completely ignoring the fact that I came looking for help and did not try to hurt myself.\n\nFast forward to the insane asylum, I was interviewd by a middle-aged psychiatrist, who gave an impression as if he wanted to be literally anywhere else but in that room talking to me. After the interview, he told me that I would have to be committed either involumtarily, which would last for 48 hours, or voluntarily, in which case I would have to talk to a different doctor and stay in the insane asylum until she decided what is to be done with me. I tried patiently explaining to the psychiatrist that I only wanted to find help for my anxiety and suicidal thoughts and that I did not want to be committed to this institution. Moreover, I stressed that my emotional issues are connected to my career and that I had to go to work on the following day. I tried reasoning that missing the second day of my job and possibly losing both of the job offers is hardly productive for my mental health. He shrugged it off saying that it wasn't the end of the world.\n\nThe nurses then marched me off to the psych ward, gave me different clothes, and showed me to my room. The room had three beds and the furthermost one from the door had a heavily-sedated patient, whose arms and legs were tied to the bed. The nurse, in all seriousness, even asked me if I would prefer to sleep next to the sedated patient or I would choose the first bed.\n\nThe lights went out and I took the sleeping pills that the nurse offered and slept peacefully... until at least my roommate woke from his sedative-induced stupor and started cursing, swearing and yelling at the top of his lungs, demanding to be released from the restraints.\n\nTwo days have passed since then. I have not showered, brushed my teeth or shaved since I wasn't prepared to be committed to an insane asylum and had not prepared any of my things when I initially went to the hospital to get help.\n\nA lot of thoughts have gone through my mind in the past few days so I hoped that writing it all down and sharing with strangers would help me make some sense of it.\n\nTLDR: Tried to ask for help and find a therapist. Got committed to an insane asylum instead.\n\n",

    "selftext": "I'm 27M and life is so weird to me. I see people seemingly caring and loving each other but I struggle to feel that at all for anyone. I know my parents and family love me and I had a great environment growing up. But I'm just... detached. Like, I gained the ability to cry on command to feign sadness when something bad happens, but in reality, I don't feel anything at all. When my mother died, I know I was supposed to feel sad. I know I was supposed to love her as she did me, very much... but I failed at both. I really tried.\n\nI've had relationships in the past where my partners would tell me they love me, but I couldn't feel the same way. They treated me amazing and I try my best to be a good partner, but I could never get attached to someone or care for someone in that way. \n\nI know it sounds cruel, but I just can't seem to love anyone nor care for anyone no matter how hard I try.\n\nI find it hard to feel what others feel. For example, when my friend's dad died, I knew I needed to feel sad, but I just didn't. I didn't understand what he was feeling so I just tried my best to be there for him and take care of him. Even though I couldn't relate to him at all. It's just, I know this is the action that should be done, but I have no emotions attached to it. \n\nWhen I got a perfect GPA in college, and my cousin who was in the same college as me, in the same course did worse, I knew she didn't feel good, but I cant describe what that would feel like, if that makes sense. I mean, I've been bad or failed at things before and I just felt indifferent. So when my family was praising me and comforting my cousin, I was so confused because I had to feign being happy and sad at the same time. \n\nIt's so frustrating because I want to feel for people, but I can't look at people as anything else other than just... people. I can't relate to their struggles even though I try. I know I'm supposed to but I can't. I've been acting this whole time but I have no idea what's wrong. \n\nI know how I'm supposed to feel but I can't feel it. Everything is just monotone for me and things that happen just happen. I know what emotions are and it's so hard for me to feel them or relate to anyone else's. Idk I just wanted to put it out there and maybe find out what's wrong with me...",

    "selftext": "I just want to say thank you for all the replies. Honestly, it\u2019s really opened my eyes. I think I was very lost in my feelings, and I truly appreciate everyone encouraging me to go for it, as well as those who reminded me to be careful and respect her boundaries. That\u2019s really important to me. The last thing I want to do is make her feel uncomfortable or like I\u2019ve overstepped, so I want to be very mindful of that.\n\nI also just want to say thank you for all your love and support. I'm a bit shocked. You guys are incredible people. \n\nSomeone suggested a book for me to read, and someone else suggested that I HEAL... Yes. I do think this is the crux of the matter. Thank you for that. I looked into the book and honestly, I think it's exactly my current experience. \n\nI got a lot of DMs asking for my personal experience and also, how to become a male escort. I thought I'd give a tiny update on what I plan to do, and then my story, in case people might be interested. \n\nSorry of its long and jumbled. I've only ever really spoken about some of these things with my current client. \n\nOkay so my idea: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to work, but I think it allows me to put the idea there in a careful way. Based on how she reacts, I might then make the decision to drop her as a client because I don\u2019t think this situation is healthy for me. Some people have pointed out that this isn\u2019t a great way to do business as an escort, and I completely agree. \n\nHonestly, if I\u2019m being real, I don\u2019t think I'm a good escort anyway \ud83d\ude04 businesses wise.\n\nSo, here\u2019s my plan. My birthday is later this month, and there\u2019s a company in our area that specializes in theatrical productions. They have a live performance at a restaurant where you get dinner and a show all in one. From what she and I have talked about, this is exactly the kind of thing she values. She loves theater, singing, opera, she\u2019s very cultured in that way. And it\u2019s something that appeals to me, too, for my own reasons, which I\u2019ll write in my back story, in case someone is interested.  She also knows this is something personally meaningful to me.\n\nSo, I\u2019m going to buy two tickets, but I won\u2019t invite her outright. Instead, I\u2019ll reach out and jokingly reference the terms of the boyfriend experience she paid for, something like, \u201cYou know, technically part of the package is me checking in on you, and I haven\u2019t heard from you in a while (haha)\". Depending on how she responds, I might then say something like, \u201cI was actually given two tickets to this event, but I don\u2019t have anyone who would really appreciate it. Would you maybe want to come with me?\u201d She knows that\u2019s true. I really don\u2019t have anyone else for something like this.\n\nThe reason I thought this might be a good approach is because a lot of people pointed out that her paying puts her in control of the dynamic, which I completely agree with. But in this scenario, there\u2019s a disconnect from that. It\u2019s something separate... What do you think? \n\nHere's my story: \n\nI grew up in a small rural town, close to where I currently am. My home life wasn\u2019t ideal, a bit of a mix of financial instability and neglect. I didn't finish school and by the time I was around 16, I was doing odd jobs, mainly in auto repair. \n\nI learned from the older men in town, working informally in backyard garages. I guess I figured this would be my future. Everyone in this town was kind of like that. Grew up there. Married someone who lived there. Never left... Everyone has dated everyone, kind of thing. I was never really interested in dating. \n\nThere was a girl a bit older who only showed up on weekends and during school holidays. She was visiting from somewhere bigger. She went to school in the city. We weren\u2019t close or anything, but just knowing someone like that existed, that could... Leave the town? I don't know. I think it gave me hope or something. \n\nLater on, I got an opportunity to work as a farm laborer in the area. The farmer was an older man, past retirement age but still running around and working. He had a wife and two adult children. I was fixing fences and machinery, driving tractors, hauling feed, digging in the dirt with spades, but eventually the farmer saw, I don't know, potential? In me. He gave me more responsibilities, and a few years later, I had some kind of a foreman role. \n\nOne day, I was about to go into the farmer\u2019s office when I overheard him and his son talking about me. I ended up eavesdropping, probably shouldn\u2019t have, but I did. His son is more 10 years older than me, I'm not exactly how much older, and he was basically saying that me and my whole family were low class. \n\nAnd honestly? It hurt. But also because I felt like he wasn\u2019t wrong. We were low class. But my mom was trying her best. She wasn\u2019t around much, but that was because she was working constantly to make ends meet. And I have my own complicated feelings about her, but I also recognize that she was doing what she thought was best for us.\n\nWhat really got to me, though, was the son has had every opportunity handed to him... His family is wealthy, he can travel wherever he wants, study whatever he wants, never worry about money. And yet, he does nothing. I don\u2019t want to sit here and judge someone else\u2019s life, but he sleeps until 10am every day, barely does anything, then goes out drinking every night. \n\nHalf the time, he\u2019s passed out on a couch, sometimes puking from drinking too much. And that\u2019s the person calling me low class?Someone who\u2019s never had to fight for anything, never had to struggle to survive?\n\nBut maybe he has his own demons he\u2019s dealing with. Maybe this is just his way of coping. I don\u2019t know. What I do know is that comments like that stick with me. And I do know that I\u2019m not that guy passed out on the couch. I\u2019m out here trying.\n\nEventually the farmer offered to pay for a GED for me. I took the opportunity and I'm so grateful for that man. I took a GED course that was offered by the university in the next town over. The \"big city\". But it was actually just a bigger town \ud83d\ude02\n\nIt opened my eyes. Suddenly, the world felt bigger. I had savings from working on the farm, and I wanted to go further, get a degree, but I needed a way to make some more money.\n\nThat's when I kind of considered escort work. I don't really have some dramatic story. I just Googled \"Male escort agencies near me\" \ud83d\ude05\n\nI was surprised by how many results popped up. At first, it was just research, out of curiosity more than anything. But found a website that seemed legit (or at least, more polished than the sketchy looking ones). I sent an email, attached a couple of photos. And then a few weeks later I got a call and I met up for coffee with two men. One was the \"manager\", the other was an escort himself. They explained the business was small, just a handful (lol) of guys. Their clients are men and women. They weren\u2019t high-end, but they aimed for discretion and professionalism.\n\nAt first I wasn't sure. But I did like these men and the way they carried themselves. They were confident, polished, almost like businessmen who just happened to be in a very unconventional business. They made it seem... professional. I decided to just give it a go. Why not...\n\nThey provided me with a handbook of some sorts. It had information on how to conduct one self as an escort. How to negotiate with clients. Self defence... Information on drug use. How to identify and avoid STDs. Things I always need to take with me when seeing clients. How to dress yourself. Some legal aspects that might arise. Honestly it was all very helpful. \n\nMy first client was a woman in the middle of her PhD. I didn\u2019t know what I expected... But I guess it was not was I was expecting? She was blunt, straightforward, and treated the encounter like a business transaction. There was no awkwardness, no false pretenses. It was surprisingly easy. She was my client for a long time. I saw her maybe twice a week. \n\nOver the next two or three years, the agency changed. More men joined, some left, and eventually, the guy managing it moved on to other things. The few of us who remained started working more independently but still using the agency\u2019s reputation, but mostly managing our own profiles.\n\nThat brings me to the current situation, I guess. \n\nSome people have asked about my future plans, whether I\u2019m thinking about a different job or what happens if things pan out with my client. So I thought I\u2019d write something about that here.\n\nFrom the beginning, my business as an escort was always slow. It seems like the escorts who take both male and female clients get more work, but I was only comfortable working with female clients, so maybe that played a role. Either way, it was never something that fully supported me. There were times, especially over the last year and a half, when I didn\u2019t get any work at all. It was really just a side hustle, something that sometimes worked out and sometimes didn\u2019t.\n\nI'm trying to focus on getting my degree. I\u2019m older than most of my classmates, of course. \n\nIn my second year, I got the opportunity to work as a pharmacy assistant. The pharmacy was close to my university, so I could walk over after class. I\u2019m really grateful for that job because it helped me a lot financially. Then, from there, I landed an internship at a company in my field. It\u2019s part-time, but they\u2019re paying me to work there, and there\u2019s an understanding that once I graduate (which, if all goes well, should be by the end of this year), they\u2019ll offer me a full-time position.\n\nSo, escorting was something I turned to as a way to earn extra income, and for a while, it did help. But I always knew it wasn\u2019t sustainable, and I\u2019ve been slowly stepping away from it. In fact, before this specific client, I hadn\u2019t taken on anyone in quite a while. I had a few once off clients here and there. \n\nSome of the comments suggested that I should let my client know that I\u2019m quitting escorting and that if she still wants to stay in touch, we could. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve been thinking about too. Because the truth is, I am stepping away. The agency doesn\u2019t really exist anymore and it\u2019s basically just a bunch of us still lingering. But I think I\u2019d like to make this official. It feels like the right time to close that chapter and fully focus on what\u2019s next.\n\nAs for why this event that I want to ask her to is special to me:\n\nIt ties back to something from my childhood. When I was growing up, there was an old lady in town who played the organ at the church. My home life wasn\u2019t great, as I've said. But to give more context, my mom was raising me, my sister, and my sister\u2019s baby, my niece, who was unfortunately born addicted to heroin. My dad was... somewhere, but not in the picture.\n\nI had a cheap bicycle and used to ride around town a lot. One day, I rode past this lady\u2019s house and saw that she had a dog. I don\u2019t know why, but I just went inside her yard and started playing with her dog. I was about eight or nine at the time. She invited me in for tea and cookies. She was a retired music teacher. She actually called my mom to let her know I was there, and my mom was absolutely livid, telling me how inappropriate that was. And yeah, maybe it was. But the old lady seemed to like me.\n\nI ended up going back a few times, I guess I helped her around the house and in the garden sometimes. She was a widow and her son was living overseas.

    "selftext": "Hello, it is my first time ever posting on reddit and english is not my native language so sorry if I am screwing stuff up.\n\nQuick context: I am a 26 year old male with a partner of 5 year (28F) that I love very much together in our house with cats. My friend called \"V\" is a great person to be around, really soscial and funny. We met at university and were good friends from the moment we met and although life has lowered our time together, we still meet for DnD once a month at least and chat when time allows!\n\nAnyway,last year V told our close group of friends that they are transitioning but we can still use male pronouns and everything around him for now. We all accepted it and told him that we are here if he needs help.A couple of months went by and he started the hormone treatment, grew out his hair and starting dressing and acting more feminine. I started to find it a bit interesting to witness the transformation and my GF talked with him about his feelings and some tips and tricks regarding clothing and make-up. \n\nThe first \"feeling\" came when he was going to a dress-up party where he asked my GF to help to dress as a proper women for the first time with a wig, make-up and everything. She was happy to help and went over to his place where he and his roommates live (all girls) to work her magic. All went well according to my GF's text and she send me a picture when he was done. He looked so good! Cute but also sexy and most importantly, happy! That is when I first felt \"something\" and I was a bit shocked, I kinda pushed it away as a reaction to seeing the guy I know for 7 years suddenly as a beautiful women.\n\n The next feeling came later on the evening when I got a message from him (drunk) that was a picture of him blowing me a kiss and saying \"I love yooouuuu\" and some other stuff that he is happy to have me and my GF in his life. This gave me a butterfly in the stomach feeling but I thought it was just a corny message that some people send to friends when drunk (I remember plenty of instances where other friends told me they love me after a night of drinking as I am dropping them of at home and vice versa). I showed the message to my GF and she jokingly asked if I am going to leave her for him. I told here no because I really love her and this is just a random drunk text plus he mentioned her also in the text that followed so it was not only aimed at me.\n\nThat leaves me with the situation right now where I am 90% convinced that this is all just a temporary feeling and will blow over as they complete their transition and I move on with my GF in the meantime.\n\nWhat the hell should I do if the other 10% turns out and I cannot stop thinking about him/her when he starts looking for surgery etc? I really love my GF and I also don't want to ruin a great friendship. Do just thug it out or try to talk with V about it? Thanks in advance",

I should take care of my health, I should take care of my hygiene and housework, I should... I should... I should ...

You don't need to run down into the next buildings basement and book the laundry room and then on that day haul everything back and forth. You have a dishwasher you can fill and let it do the work if you don't feel like standing and doing the dishes. You actually enjoy cooking, I hate it. I wish it was that easy to just get it done. It should be that easy to just get it done but it isn't and right now I just wanna go to sleep and hope I never wake up so I don't have to deal with this bullshit anymore.\nGuess I'm just having a really bad day today.

As a Uni student, I stayed home almost the entire semester last year because I just hate to be in crowded lectures halls. \n\nI feel so uncomfortable walking to the campus from the uni accommodations cause there\u2019s so many people walking the same way. \n\nI haven\u2019t made many friends cause I can\u2019t talk to people, the only ones I have are through a group project and one that I knew earlier online. \n\nI sometimes really wanna study somewhere not in my room, but I can\u2019t stand going to the libraries or cafes cause they\u2019re always so crowded. It feels horrible\n\nThe main point is this. Sometimes when I\u2019m at uni, I will feel so vulnerable, so self conscious, that I\u2019ll go into a bathroom stall just to be alone for a moment. Not just bathrooms either. I\u2019ll hide anywhere I can. I was once waiting to take an exam, there were so many people in line and the invigilators were late setting up, so I walked through this door in the hall where j was waiting, into this random break room where I probably wasn\u2019t allowed to be, but I just couldn\u2019t stand there. \n\nI spend a lot of time on how I look, how I dress, because I don\u2019t want to stand out.

And especially when the explanation is \"I walked into a door\".\n\nHere's the thing though: I ACTUALLY WALKED INTO A DOOR!!!\nNot only that, I was wearing crocs. And yes, I know: ewww crocs! But my mum bought them for me and they're really practical when I just need to put some shoes on to run to the mailbox. \n\nIn case you're unfamiliar with crocs, they're like bouncy rubber balls when you wear them and hit your foot on, let's say, a door! \nSo here I am, in a bit of a rush, shoving my feet into said crocs and then attempting to run out the door. Only, I somehow misjudged the distance to or the size of the door? Maybe? Whatever the reason, when I pulled the door open while simultaneously rushing at it, my foot hit the corner of the door. So the door stopped instantly, but my body didn't, resulting in my face smacking straight into the side edge of the door. Impact no 1. As if that wasn't bad enough, my leading foot was between the door and doorframe, so when the door bounced off my back croc, it hit my front croc, bounced back and smacked me in the face again. Impact no 2. It then bounced into the front croc, and back again. Impact no 3. I'm pretty sure that's when my nose got squished. I'm not sure how many more times it happened, but it sounded like a machingun was going off! I was so disoriented, seeing double, blood flooding out of my nose, my eyes rapidly swelling shut, and it felt like my forehead was splitting down the middle.\n\nSo yeah, I don't blame the hospital for thinking my \"I walked into a door\" was a lie...",

    "selftext": "Essentially the title. It annoys me so much when people say \"money isn't everything/can't buy happiness\", usually said by people who have enough money.\n\nMoney would literally solve all my problems and I'm not even talking about extreme amounts like 100k plus. 15-20k would solve ALL my problems. And I'm not saying that this isn't a shitload of money. It would allow me to pay my debt my ex left me with, get the education I need to find a better job and fix the broken things in my home. \n\nIts just crazy to think that for a billionaire this amount of money is peanuts, a blip, while it would make my life not a hell of stress and worry.\n\nAnd before you come for me, I know life isn't fair and with hArD wOrk I can pull myself out of it, I'm not sitting on my butt doing nothing but I just needed to vent to the void or something.",
