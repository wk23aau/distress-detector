I loved my father more than anything and one day, usually me and my mother sleep on the bed and my dad and my brother sleeps on the floor, but on that day my dad was drunk , so he slept on the bed beside me and I was very asleep, in the midnight that's the time he put his hand inside my panties and touched the private part\ud83d\ude2d i was just 12..I don't know what's happening then i wokeup because of the uncomfortable feeling and I started to ask for mom...and my mom asked me what happened but I never told her. I don't know what to do! I have never shared this incident with anyone. Is being drunk can be a valid excuse for his actions? Is he was in the sense and knows what he was actually doing? Because I have never consumed alcohol so I'm so confused. Anyone tell me please. And do you know what's even more worse? My parents are divorced now and my mother abandoned us and me and brother are growing with my father. It's really traumatic to me but after that day he never reapeated that. I'm so confused. I cannot talk to him properly give me a solution.",

    "selftext": "Me (21M) and my girlfriend (22F) have been together for 4 months now. After the first 2 months I started to notice and understand better all the things she has to deal with in her head, bad experiences in past relationships that affected her deeply and left her with traumas that are now being reflected in me just because we are in a long distance relationship and we can't see each other 24/7 and know what the other is doing or know entirely what is happening to us. Although she never saw a specialist or therapist to treat these problems (which she admitted to me was out of fear or pride), I always try to explain to her that right now it is impossible for me to be devotedly aware of her every second of the day, with my career, my activities, my friends and my own life in general. Every day I talk to her to accompany her in the little free time I have during the day and when I return home exhausted I also make sure to communicate with her and ask her about her day and if she would like to talk about something with me, in which most of the time her answers are \"I have nothing interesting to tell\". There are also times when a harmless joke I make unleashes hell where she gets offended at me and I need to reassure her of how much she means to me and how much i really love her, I apologize for upsetting her with something I said, to which she (apparently) accepts my apologies and (also apparently) everything is resolved. Last night I even went out with my guy friends to a bar after a hard week and all day long I let her know who I was with and what our plans were for the night, to which she ended up responding, as a way of throwing it in my face, that I will never be able to understand her and solve all the damage she suffered with me with a simple forgiveness, and acussed me of not caring about her and not being able to see things the way she sees them. That made me feel like like I'm worth absolutely nothing, like all the sincerely unconditional love I give her when we're together isn't worth it even in the slightest, that all the moments in which I was there to listen to her and understand her also meant nothing. I need honest and direct opinions on this. ",

    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about how cultural assimilation impacts opportunities, especially in the workplace. I was raised in a predominantly Caucasian church group in the Midwest/South, where my mom worked multiple jobs, and members of the church helped babysit me. Because of that environment, I never learned Spanish, and I became a native English speaker without an accent. My name and skin color make it obvious that I\u2019m Hispanic, but everything else like my speech, my interests, even the way I present myself is very much in line with mainstream American culture.\n\nI never really thought much about this until I started noticing a pattern in my jobs. I\u2019ve had no issue moving up. I\u2019ve always been recognized for my abilities, and promotions have come naturally. But people I know people who are just as educated and capable tell me they\u2019re being overlooked for management positions or even treated differently at work. Most of them have thick Hispanic accents, and many were raised in predominantly Hispanic communities, even if they were born here.\n\nI live in a primarily Caucasian area, and it\u2019s become clear to me that how you present as Hispanic plays a massive role in workplace opportunities. Whitewashed Hispanics, whether they grew up like me or are half Hispanic with \u201cwhite\u201d first names, seem to have a much easier time getting ahead than first-generation or immigrant Hispanics who retain strong cultural ties.\n\nI don\u2019t think this is talked about enough. People love to say that discrimination is just about race, but I think it\u2019s also about how comfortable people feel with you. If you fit the dominant culture and don\u2019t challenge their perception of what\u2019s \u201cnormal,\u201d you get a pass. If you don\u2019t, you hit a wall.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this?",

    "selftext": "I (27) father of three lives alone with my three children. Thanksgiving month of last year the mother and I got into a heated argument which led to a back and forth (physically) the most I did was push her to get some space to walk away, because I truly don\u2019t believe in hitting women( unless it\u2019s life or death). Before that even happened, two days prior to this she was already putting her hands on me which led to a big bruise on my back. And a long scar going from my neck down to my back. Once I pushed her away from me she instantly called the cops and said I was the one being belligerent and she wanted me removed from the house. The police arrive and she!! Yes she showed them the camera footage of what had been going on and ofc she was deemed the main aggressor and was taken to jail. Once she got out \u201capparently\u201d she has a court order to stay off of the property and to have no contact with me. Her name is still on the lease so she helps out by paying her half of the rent and once a week will ask if the kids need anything( she has a friend that reaches out for her). She currently has no where to live but she stays with a friend and still has her job as a nurse and is in school during the day. She gave me the option of getting a hotel room to get the kids because it\u2019s going on four months since she has seen or talked to any of them. I thought the hotel option was a good idea and I even offered to pay for half the expenses. But it never happens because she either to busy with school and work. I would like too take her to court so she can at least help me by getting them and keeping them for a week. I have managed to do what I can with childcare and anything else the kids need so I can work my self and I have managed to do this alone. What do I need to do to get her to court so we can have our time with the kids individually? I understand she is in a situation but I shouldn\u2019t have to suffer because of it. I hope this doesn\u2019t sound bitter on my end but we are not together anymore so she is going to have to start riding her storms out alone now. Im not complaining about taking care of my kids because I love them dearly and I don\u2019t find anything manly about complaining about something you helped bring into this world but I need a break some times and I\u2019m only asking for a week.",

    "selftext": "     I was heavily bullied via social ostracism as a kid. It also didn\u2019t help that I am very likely autistic and I have a very hard time picking up on unspoken social cues. I also grew up in a bit of a turbulent environment where speaking my mind often ended in punishment. Therefore, my own communication habits are not the healthiest - I tend to bottle things up for months and then crash and bedrot for days on end when it all becomes too much. But I have a best friend who I finally felt comfortable attempting more immediate, healthy communication with, and it\u2019s blown up so badly that I\u2019m almost wishing I\u2019d just kept my mouth shut instead.\n\n     They\u2019ve been getting really into a TV show for about 5 months now - which is great, and I\u2019m truly happy for them. A lot of the time they\u2019d send me voice notes about it, or we\u2019d call and they\u2019d end up talking about it to the point of apologizing for \u201covertaking the conversation,\u201d and I\u2019d always say they had nothing to be sorry for, because I love listening to my friends be happy about stuff. Genuinely, I do, and it was literally all fine up until last week.\n\n     After months of searching due to unemployment, I had a job interview lined up for the next day. Of course, I immediately texted my best friend, and they congratulated me and said they\u2019d send me messages of encouragement before the interview. I thanked them, and then they immediately proceeded to talk about the show again. I didn\u2019t think much of it and listened as always, because I enjoy it. \n\n     The interview day comes the next day, and it\u2019s HECTIC - I was so busy that I was literally going from 5:30am to 5:30pm, and by the time I got home I was ready to crash. My interview was scheduled at 4, and they\u2019d been texting me about the show prior to it, so I figured I\u2019d get my messages soon. Well, long story short, they never came - I got home at about 5:30, immediately crashed and took a 2 hour nap, and then woke up to chat with them only to have another conversation about the show. Admittedly I didn\u2019t feel great about it, but I thought it was just the lack of food and sleep talking, so I brushed it off.\n\n     Over the next few days, though, I noticed that sometimes the things I\u2019d send them would just get liked and immediately moved on from in favor of talking about the show - eventually I realized that this wasn\u2019t making me feel great, so I decided to ask them if we could maybe tone down the conversations about this show and explain how it made me feel. Sounds like a healthy way to communicate, right? Wrong.\n\n     As soon as I sent the message I realized how badly I fucked up. They were (rightfully) upset that I\u2019d waited a week to tell them this and didn\u2019t give them the opportunity to correct themselves in the moment, and for that I apologized - I genuinely thought a week wasn\u2019t that much time, and it wasn\u2019t something I was even mad at, just mildly upset. But then the whole conversation kept spiraling, and I literally feel sick at the way I made them feel. \n\n   I thought that I was avoiding bottling it up and actually doing the right thing because I was communicating a relatively minor (on my end) issue early on, but it turns out that by not saying anything immediately, I\u2019ve basically reinforced their worst fears about themself. They\u2019re now scared to talk too much to anyone about anything, and now any mention of the show makes them feel sick. They said they feel like a bad friend, and part of them feels lied to because I always said it was alright how much they talked about it - but it wasn\u2019t a lie. It really was alright, the job interview was literally the only incident that made me feel not great about it. I kept apologizing because I never wanted them to feel like that around me, but they\u2019re still really hurt and now we\u2019ve been taking some space from each other for about four days now.\n\n     I feel sick. I feel like I ruined the one friendship where both of us felt safe to be ourselves. Even if we manage to move on from this, I know it\u2019ll never be the same, and it\u2019s all my fault - they\u2019ll never talk to me again without worrying that they\u2019re being \u201ctoo much,\u201d and that\u2019s the one thing I never wanted them to worry about with me, because I know what it\u2019s like to be \u201ctoo much\u201d for the people around you. \n\n     I wish I\u2019d kept my stupid mouth shut. It was never even that big of a deal, I could\u2019ve just dealt with it and bit my tongue, but of course the one time I feel like communicating is the right thing it just ruins everything. I hurt my best friend so bad and I didn\u2019t even mean to, and now there\u2019s nothing I can say or do to fix it. I thought I was finally doing things right, but it all just went wrong anyway, and now one of the people I care about the most is hurting because of me. The guilt is eating me alive, I\u2019ve been crying ever since it all went down, and now I wish I\u2019d never even said anything. ",

We met in 2022 and we had a friendship that you wish on everyone, but the friendship got stronger and so did our feelings. At first he started getting feelings, at the time it was not appropriate because I was still in a relationship. I broke things off so I could be with him, but when that happened he didn\u2019t have the same feelings anymore and everything went downhill. I\u2019m not gonna explain everything that happened in those 6 months, but I can say that nothing went back to how it was. \n\nBecause I was still in love with him when he basically ghosted me at the time, I never got the closure I needed (I think). And I begged him to let me stay in his live as friends, and now that I\u2019m hearing myself I sound so stupid. After everything that happened in those 6 months we kissed etc. for like 2 more times and that made it even worse to get over him. \n\nLike I said we stayed friends and talk like 3 times a year (new years, birthdays and holidays). I even got a new amazing boyfriend whom I\u2019ve been together with for almost 2 years, and who I really love and could see myself marrying one day. But I still think about him (the ex). \nLast week he even responded on a story I posted on Snapchat and we exchanged maybe 10 sentences. I wake up the next day and he deleted me from snap. I would like to think his new gf made him do it, because it would honestly hurt more if he did it himself. \n\nSo now 1 week later and everyday I\u2019m thinking about it and everything that happened almost 3 fk years ago. \n\nSo my question Reddit users is why can\u2019t I get over him? Why can\u2019t I get over the memories that we made? Why not after everything this person has put me through?\n\nEnglish is not my first language so I\u2019m sorry for my grammar. \n\nSide note, 1,5 years ago he moved to another city so I haven\u2019t seen him in 1 year. And I see him maybe once I year now. I was supposed to see him last week, but he couldn\u2019t come\u2026",

He has fits of rage every day and shouts at us and mostly her because i do not live there anymore. Name calling of all sorts for no reason. \n\nI will give an example - once i was going out for a walk and i took a bottle of water with me (1L), small bottle nothing insane. He saw it and started screaming at me every offensive word you can think of. He said no person in his right mind takes water outside on a walk. \nAnother example - he screamed at my mom and the didn\u2019t speak to her a whole week because HE forgot his lunch on his way out. Apparently she needs to be there every second and remind him to even blink. \n\nHe is the same with my sister and his parents( my grandparents). \n\nNo one in my family has ever talked to him about this and they are enablers to his behaviour. \n\nFor the years that I spent living with them, when he would get home from work I would stay in my room and not even go to the bathroom for hours even if i needed to just because to get to the bathroom you have to go through the living room and that is where he watched tv and spent the evenings. \n\nOver the years i developed severe anxiety, low self esteem, binge eating disorder and many more characteristics and conditions that make my life miserable. \n\nThe binge eating disorder came because all my life he would call me fat and huge and enormously big ( I have always been 50-55kg at 1.65cm height, i work out at the gym and have been a runner for a few years, so yeah I am slim and have even been very skinny for some time ) \n\nSo, this person with his insane behaviour has long ago lost my respect and fondness of him. Although until now i have been silent.\n\nToday, at dinner i couldn\u2019t take it anymore. For months i\u2019ve been having dreams of him screaming at me and while asleep I felt the hatred in my heart. So today, he started to insult me again and I didn\u2019t stay silent this time. I told him that respect has to be earned and he doesn\u2019t have mine because of all the years of name calling and treating me like garbage. He was stunt and said that i don\u2019t have a father anymore. To be honest, i\u2019ve felt like that since i was 11. \n\nEven though it hurt him, he can\u2019t begin to imagine the pain i\u2019ve been feeling for years.\n\nI can\u2019t stop crying because of the words I said but I know I had to say them at some point in my life to free myself and defend myself. \nI feel pity for him and nothing else. I am sorry that he is the way he is because it can only end badly for him. \n\nI am proud I defended myself for the first time but I will always be in pain because he\u2019s been brought up to be the person he is. He is incapable of change and I am sorry for him. \n",

His side of the family is very religious and I tend to work best when religion and I give each other a wide berth. I understand that for religious people there is comfort in hearing scripture at a funeral and I am fine with some readings. Unfortunately the pastor for my cousins funeral saw it as an opportunity to give a full fire and brimstone sermon and a similar thing happened at my grand father\u2019s funeral last year. It was a full blown transphobic rant at my grandpas funeral. I\u2019m tired of funerals in general and there\u2019s been too much death in my family the last few years so that\u2019s probably a contributing factor to my annoyance.

There was this one small house on the left side of the road and coming up on it, I could hear splitting noises like someone was being hit but I think I couldn't believe it until I actually got close enough. There was this guy, 20s maybe both of them, standing over his wife or girlfriend on the front lawn, she was lying down on her side and had her arm stretched out. Then as I walked by slowly, unable to stop for some reason, he started beating and slapping her and grabbing her by the hair and yanking her towards the house. He also kicked her multiple times. I think he might have called her Alicia. But the eerie thing was that she was surprisingly quiet about it, not like crazy screaming, but just like, please stop! You would think she'd be screaming and crying out for help or something. I remember that I was just walking in horror, the guy didn't seem to notice me or if he did, he didn't care. I couldn't stop and I couldn't stop looking at them. I think I was trying to figure out what street I was on but I had never thought to memorize the alley way streets so I didn't know. The whole scene moved in slow motion but I still remember the entire beating, the sounds, the sounds of grass scraping, the shape of his hands. Just broad daylight at 3pm on a weekday, front lawn, no one else on the street but them and me, springtime.\n\nI ran home in tears and told my mom who just told me not to get involved. When I tried to tell her that I think he was going to kill her, she asked me what street and address this happened because if we report it, I'll have to know all these things. I had no idea, so again, she told me to mind my own business.\n\nI was 10 or so when this happened and I'm in my 30s now. I still have the exact same fantasy memory of having gone back in time and instead of walking away and running away from the scene, I get in between them and save her somehow. If not save, but at least make such a fuss that someone calls the cops. It's always the same thing - that I don't care if I get hurt in the process, I would have done the brave thing. Instead of what I actually did... just run away in literal horror. I feel so haunted by this scene. I don't think I'll ever forget it for the rest of my life, honestly.",

    "selftext": "Recently my sister got engaged, and she asked me to be a part of her bridal party. Initially I was very excited to have a role in her wedding, kind of still am, but now I'm feeling iffy because she invited our brother, who I don\u2019t have a positive relationship with.\n\nFor context, I\u2019m the youngest out of the three of us and we were raised by a single mother who worked a lot. Because of this, my sister took a lot of responsibility over us when our mother couldn\u2019t. She\u2019s like a second mother to me and my brother even though she shouldn\u2019t have been. My brother, on the other hand, was kind of a weirdo growing up. He dressed alternatively and had \u201cnerdy\u201d interests, something that younger-me at the time thought was really cool, and was all around awkward.\n\nI was maybe 8 and he was 14 when he started getting curious with his body, and that eventually led to him sexually assaulting me. It didn\u2019t happen for long, thank god, but the experience left a disgusting stain on me. Eventually I realized that what had happened to me was wrong, and it wasn't until I was 13 that I finally had the chance and courage to talk to someone.\n\nI was removed from my home and placed in a children\u2019s psych unit, and my case was being handled by a social worker. Of course, they informed my mother, who then told a few others, my sister included. I didn\u2019t know this at the time, but some of the adults around her pressured her into convincing me to recant my statement. So when she visited me, she asked me to do just that. I was obviously so betrayed and angry, she was my role model and the one person I relied on the most at the time. I can\u2019t recall the rest of our conversation, I just remember leaving the visitation area and completely losing it in my room.\n\nBut I was young, impressional, and ruminating a lot at this time, so I did end up recanting my statement. My case worker didn\u2019t agree with my decision but respected it anyway. For the sake of procedure, my case was still investigated, but without the victim\u2019s statement it fell through. It didn\u2019t erase anything that happened to me, but it felt like it did with how everyone else around me went about their lives like nothing happened. It was jarring and fucked with my head, and I slowly started believing that I made the whole thing up for attention. My memory wasn\u2019t the best, and it could\u2019ve just been a messed up dream I had. I started feeling disgusted and I couldn\u2019t trust myself anymore, and I began spiraling.\n\nFastward to when I was 17, I was hospitalized for almost taking my life. For some reason, this was much more serious than before. I was finally put on medication and was put into a program for other at-risk teens. It was through group therapy I started thinking about getting closure for myself, so after a lot of mental and emotional preparation, I confronted my brother. At the last minute I decided to record the conversation without him knowing, and I actually got a confession. I went to my social worker, and after a few days he was removed from the house.\n\nAfter that, I was both relieved and stressed by the events that came next. To be honest I didn\u2019t follow too closely with the court proceedings, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to care what happened to him, all I remember was being interviewed by SVU and getting monthly check ups by social services. But the whole ordeal was mentally and emotionally draining for me and my family. My mom couldn\u2019t believe it at first, and briefly experienced religious psychosis, but no one took it harder than my sister. I guess she felt guilty, because 1) such a serious thing happened between two of her siblings right under her nose, and 2) she didn\u2019t have my back when I first came forward about it. I don\u2019t blame her, or anyone really, for not noticing what was happening. I can\u2019t bring myself to blame anyone, no one wants to believe that someone you love is capable of something as horrible as sexual assault.\n\nA few years have passed since then, and I\u2019ve been working on improving my mental health. My sister was my rock throughout the process, the most understanding of me and my circumstances, and after a while I thought I had made peace with the whole situation, until her wedding. My sister\u2019s decision to invite our brother, after years of no-contact between the two of us, kind of blindsided me. Not because I didn\u2019t expect her to, but because she didn\u2019t tell me. Now here\u2019s the thing, I would never ask my sister to choose between me or our brother. I understand that she loves the both of us despite what had happened, so to ask her to do that wouldn\u2019t be fair. But I would\u2019ve liked a heads-up. I had to ask her myself if he was coming, and I\u2019m glad I did. The thought of walking into the venue and seeing him in the crowd without warning would\u2019ve sent me into a panic.\n\nAnd because of this I started to rethink my relationship with her. She\u2019s done a lot for me, and I\u2019ll go as far as to say that she has a bigger impact on me than our mother does. I want to give her some grace for this, but I still feel so uncomfortable with his presence. He\u2019s also still in good standing with our extended family, who don\u2019t know of the situation, so the possibility of them joking around and having fun with him without knowing what he\u2019s done doesn\u2019t sit right with me.\n\nI most likely won\u2019t do anything regarding my sister\u2019s wedding because I don\u2019t want to ruin her big day, but it\u2019ll probably change the way I see her. Like I said, I won\u2019t ask her to choose between me or him, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t. It\u2019s a scary realization that my relationship with my sister can change, I really don\u2019t want it to, but I can\u2019t ignore how she\u2019s willing to look past what our brother has done to me when I haven\u2019t. I want to start by having a proper conversation with her about this first though, after the wedding. I want to fully understand her side of the story and her perspective before making this big decision.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know what to expect or hope for, but I feel like if I don\u2019t do something then all the improvement I\u2019ve made will come undone and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll recover this time.\n",

    "selftext": "My (F20) oldest brother (OB, M31) is an abusive misogynist. He genuinely thinks that women - his girlfriend, his wife, his mom, doesn't matter - should be beaten and/or be physically intimidated when he has any (even the smallest) disagreement. He was kicked out of the military for beating his wife (he somehow got honorable discharge from what my mom says). My mom also has video evidence on OB practically dragging his girlfriends down the stairs in front of her children (my brother *only* went after single moms)\n\nWith that said, let's get into the main reason I'm scared for this child. I recently found out my OB is a child predator and that the reason OB was kicked out at ~14 (almost 15) wasn't because of no reason. It was because my mom walked in on us with our pants down in my closet when I was 4. 3 years later, OB got my name tattooed on his arm. I don't really remember it that well because I had pushed the memory deep down in the back of my mind because I thought it was my fault. I remember thinking \"all I have to do is push it all the way back, behind the wall, into my subconscious\" because I heard that's how other's got rid of the bad feelings or bad memories (I think it's because I heard that there was 2 sides of the brain). I remember thinking, \"Why didn't I just say 'no'?\".\n\nIt wasn't until years later (OB had moved back into our house) when I noticed weird things OB would do (like how I mentioned he only goes after single moms or moms who recently left an abusive relationship,  only for them to leave OB because \"I never wanted my children to be put back into that situation, luckily the Girlfriend he practically dragged down the stairs has a new boyfriend who said \"I'll make sure he doesn't goes anywhere near my family again\"). I would notice things like how OB treated me like OB would his girlfriends or how OB would stare at my chest or at me in a weird way like a dog would a squirrel (or almost like how they describe jaws eyes) but I thought I was just being crazy. Then OB offered my underaged friend alcohol if she got into his car and went on a drive with OB (to nowhere is particular). \n\nAfter a couple of years, OB was kicked out again for trying to beat my dad for telling OB to stop yelling at my mom about how *OB* crashed his car while drunk and the entire time, the way OB was talking to her it sounded like he was trying to blame her or the mechanic who fixed his car (my mom said the next day OB went back to the mechanic and yelled at him, then OB got upset that *the best mechanic who worked there wouldn't fix his car and told him to go somewhere else*). And, then as soon as she raised her voice above him to get him to stop screaming and yelling, he immediately started the crocodile tears. The story OB told us was actually ridiculous, OB apparently hit a boulder in the middle of the road and swerved (?) off the road into a ditch.\n\nMy parents visited the crash site of where the supposed boulder was, and all they found were swerve marks to a ditch. As for the road, it looked completely fine for a road that had a boulder land on it a couple hour prior (we live in a part of America where the roads don't get that much maintenance and when we do, it's noticeable and definitely lasts longer than a day)\n\nAfter a little while, the whole p diddy thing came out, and something about it made me snap, and I kept thinking about predators and how they are disgusting creatures. (At the time, I had recently bought some shrooms bars from a local store.) The more I thought of the p diddy situation, the more the memories of my own molestation started coming back. I started getting angry a lot, and eventually, I told my mom. \n\nShe said that when she found us, she didn't think anything had happened yet and that OB was just about to do something. I asked her why she didn't call the police because OB would have still attempted to molested a 4 year old child. She said it was because of my dad's crazy ex-wife. \n\nSometimes, I wish I could go back in time and stop it. I was littarly just playing with my toys before OB came home from school and immediately ran to me like I was present under a christmas tree. I still remember the conversation we had.\n\nOB: (he said something along the lines of) \"we should take off our pants or something about a game\" (I wasn't really paying attention when he initially walked in because I was focused on my toys)\n\nMe: \"But, why?\"\n\nOB: \"Because I want to show you something.\"\n\nMe: starts to take off pants\n\nOB: \"If you kiss mine, I'll kiss yours\"\n\nMe: (senses something is off and starting to get scared): \"but why? I don't want to\"\n\nOB: \"it's not scary, see.\" (does what you think he said he would, I genuinely feel sick thinking about it)\nThen I geuss he heard my mom or he had locked the door. \n\nOB: \"You need to get your pants on, she's not supposed to see us\"\n\nThen my mom walked in and stopped when she ws my still trying to button and zip up my pants\nMom: \".......... what.... what..the Fuck.... (then she started yelling at OB) WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU DOING TO HER (then, she grabbed him and pulled him out of the room)\n\nI don't really remember much after that, but I do remember the couple of times I would think about it and get a disgusting feeling or like shame before I had successfully pushed it down. Now, I don't know what to do, it's not exactly like I can go to the police and get justice when it was a long time ago and there is no actual proof the court would listen to. My family has cut him off though, which is good because I was scared of what OB would do if OB moved in with my nana and papa (they're 80 and my aunts have mobility problems, the only person who would be able to defend them is my uncle, who isn't exactly the athletic type and is much older than OB)\n\nEdit: I fixed the spelling and grammar mistakes \n",

    "selftext": "Hello. I just came to get this off my chest because I can't take it anymore. English is not my first language.\n\nThree years ago, I adopted a stray puppy. After having him at home for five days, I realized he had parvovirus, so I had to hospitalize him for ten days. It was a miracle that he survived, and after that, he had to stay home for two months without going outside, as recommended by the vet.\n\nThe first time I took him out, I noticed he was terrified of absolutely everything\u2014noises, cars, other animals, people, but especially men. It took a lot of effort to get him comfortable going on walks. We took it slowly, and after a year, I managed to take him to the dog park.\n\nNow, my dog is three years old, and for the past three months, his condition has worsened. He only wants to go to the bathroom once a day, around midnight, when no one is on the street. I live in the city center, which is always busy and noisy (for various reasons I just can't afford to move to the country side). Every day is a struggle. He prefers to go inside the house to avoid going outside. He trembles and cries. If visitors come over, he hides and shakes the entire time. The only time he is happy is when it's just me, my partner, and him at home.\n\nSeeing him like this breaks my heart, and on top of that, no one wants to take care of him\u2014not even paid services or dog daycare centers because of his condition. I took him to a specialist ethologist, tried medications, relaxants, and behavioral exercises, but nothing has improved.\n\nSometimes, I think about giving him to someone with a huge field where he could run and be happy, but at the same time, I don\u2019t want to let him go. It feels wrong\u2014no one will take care of him like I do, no one will love him like I do. What if he misses me? What if he feels abandoned?\n\nEvery day, I suffer for him and blame myself for not being a better owner.\n\n",

I did both long term case management and later investigations that led to the removals of children. With about a decade of time and reflection, I\u2019ve come to realize the following:\n\n- I was a young woman with lots of privilege who did not understand the lives or needs of the people over whose lives I made decisions for.  This now causes me great pain. \n- Turns out I was dissociating through most of it due to secondary trauma and moral injury. The ability to dissociate (although we just saw it as toughing through back then) was seen as showing that you were a great worker and could \u201cget shit done\u201d. \n- I wanted to do good in the world and I wanted to help children. And I did. But I also caused harm because I had too many cases, not enough supervision and no real self-awareness.\n- It took years of therapy to understand and grieve the harm I had caused and the harm caused to me. I don\u2019t even remember the first few years of my children\u2019s lives because I was so dissociated. I often have to look at a photos to remember events with them. \n- I still get flashbacks of things I was exposed to and am swapped with pain. \n\nSometimes it all comes back. Just this week, I was contacted by a former colleague and a child who was on my caseload many years ago. \n\n- The colleague reminded me of a child death case we worked on. It was particularly searing because we both had children that were about the same age as the child who died. \n- She also reminded me about the death of another colleague (through an aneurism) and the suicide of a couple others. Yes, our work had a death count. \n- The girl, now an adult, reached out to me to say she is doing well and to thank me for helping her find an adoptive home. \n\nIt\u2019s a mixed bag. And these memories reinforce in me the idea that nothing in life is guaranteed and I\u2019m just trying to do the best I can each day. I screw up and I repair where I can. I put kindness and compassion into everything I do, but that isn\u2019t always enough. \n\nI don\u2019t really have a purpose for this post. Just wanted to get it off my chest. ",

We met during 10th grade and they had already been dating a year so she had already met his family and such. She would make these comments like \u201cMax\u2019s dad is so hot\u201d or \u201cMax looks just like his dad and they\u2019re both so attractive\u201d, it was kinda funny at first, then she said \u201cMax\u2019s dad said if we were the same age, we\u2019d be dating\u201d, and that\u2019s when we knew Max\u2019s dad was a creep but she kept dating the boy and we couldn\u2019t do anything.\n\nFast forward to senior year, Max decides he wants to date other people so they break up. Charlie was distraught, barely even speaking to us, dragging her feet around school, the usual teenage break up shit, til eventually they get back together. And this is where things got interesting for us.\n\nCovid hits, we\u2019re out of school and hanging out at Charlie\u2019s when she tells us she slept with one of Max\u2019s family members but wouldn\u2019t specify who. We thought it could\u2019ve been his younger brother who\u2019s 2 years younger than us, she said it wasn\u2019t him, we said his dad, she claimed she wouldn\u2019t say. We didn\u2019t have to wait long tho, Max somehow finds out, we still don\u2019t know how, that she in fact fucked his father and all hell broke loose.\n\nHis father denied and denied, Max and his brother stopped speaking to their father and Charlie, we never heard anything about his mom but I can only imagine she was drawing up divorce papers. Oh, and the reason she didn\u2019t wanna specify it was him? They had sex in January, her 18th birthday was February\u2026\n\nWe haven\u2019t talked to Charlie in years, but before she stopped talking to us, she made a comment in a text like \u201cMy man is taking me on vacation\u201d and when we asked who her \u201cman\u201d was, she just sent a smiling emoji and basically never talked to us again. Recently, we discovered through FaceBook that apparently, Charlie and Max\u2019s dad are still together, Max and his brother don\u2019t talk him, he and his wife divorced and he hardly ever sees their youngest daughter who\u2019s maybe 8 now. \n\n",

    "selftext": "I always hear a lot of critique about how the western world is too individualist. Well, I feel like I completely understand why now. I\u2019m in Canada for reference.\n\nI have been at my current job almost 3 years now. I have been on contract that entire time. I\u2019ve been fighting to get permanent but no positive movement yet. Anyway, the last position I got was a 2 year contract-which comes to an end this summer. I feel I\u2019ve been a positive addition to the team. The team was short staffed (*is* short staffed, even now) and I was able to help out with the work load. I\u2019m a quick learner and pretty efficient, and I\u2019ve definitely shown that on our extremely busy days, or days where extremely short staffed (we often have people falling ill or someone is on vacation). With my contract end coming up I asked my boss if there was a future for me. I have also been looking for work-with no luck-in preparation.\n\nWell, this week she told me the chances of me being kept on were slim to none. I cried at my lunch break. Hell, I had panic attacks and cried before all this. I have been trying to find work and it\u2019s rejection after rejection or just not hearing back at all. Even jobs I\u2019m more than qualified for aren\u2019t responding.\n\nWhat has really hurt and frustrated me, is the apathy of those around me. Friends, coworkers I thought liked me, even family to an extent, could all care less. \u201cOh damn that sucks. Anyway.\u201d \n\nAnd I 100% understand why. Why would *anyone*, even people who like me, give two shits about me? They have their own partners, families, finances, etc. to worry about. People don\u2019t give two shits what happens to anyone around them when they have their own lives. Someone they know could go homeless and it\u2019d just be a \u201cdamn how tragic! They were a nice person. Anyway, what\u2019s for dinner?\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve been bullied at jobs to the point of being suicidal. People saw-and looked the other way. Dont want to involve themselves. I\u2019ve complained to bosses/supervisors about workplace bullies only to go ignored. I\u2019ve been chastised for speaking up. Damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t. No one cares-they can like you, but they\u2019re there to get their bag and go home. \n\nI see this a lot in Canada with the housing crisis. People who own their homes have a \u201cfuck you, I got mine\u201d attitude. They don\u2019t care about the rest of us, especially younger folk, who will never be able to afford even a modest apartment. They got their house, they got their family, fuck everyone else. The homeless are just an inconvenience/nuisance to them.\n\nI\u2019ve tried in my life to have a community mindset with helping others, caring, I always would send fitting job postings to unemployed friends who were looking to try and help out, tried to be there for others. No more. Never again. Not a single person around me would give a fuck if I died tomorrow because understandably, they have their own shit to worry about. Only people I can see caring about me being gone are my mom and dad.\n\nI have fought my entire life to try and be better. Grew up with abusive step parents. Didn\u2019t grow up wealthy. Pretty much everything I did after 18 was my own-rent, schooling (with help of loans, which I am also paying off solo), finding jobs, figuring shit out, etc. \n\nI\u2019m done. My hope for finding work in time before my contract ends is extremely low. Even with experience and schooling, companies dont want to hire, or they want to pay you minimum wage for skilled work. And if they can\u2019t get a canadian to go that low they\u2019ll find a TFW who will take below minimum wage (story for another time). Idk what will happen to me but I know that I will not care about anyone else again. Im gonna worry about me only. Good luck to everyone else.\n",

Today I just found out that after nine months, she\u2019s still with the rebound. \n\nI want nothing, absolutely nothing to do with this person. I want to make that abundantly clear. But the idea that after a 1.5 year relationship that she moved on so quickly and ended up having a successful relationship with someone else really does hurt me, considering that I myself haven\u2019t been so lucky to find someone. This might also be TMI, but I also think about how she lost her virginity to someone who wasn\u2019t me.\n\nI feel like God wants me to focus on my walk with him as opposed to finding someone else, but it really does get lonely. And my ex is always in the back of my mind when it gets too quiet. ",

Initially we wanted to wait until they were old enough, but it became hard to find places to go on vacation or long weekends that had facilities for children.\n\nToday we were at one on the parks \u2014 and at a slower ride intended for all ages (toddler friendly), when our youngest threw a tantrum (1.5M). It was close 30 minutes until nap time, and he\u2019s been teething.  We decided to come celebrate my eldest\u2019s birthday (3M), and especially since the recent passing of my father left him very sad and aggressive toward others at daycare (he cried seeing photos of my dad and asking where he was). \n\nWe apologized to the two women next to us, as my youngest threw things on the ground near them. They started off saying that it\u2019s OK. Then they proceeded to let us know that they never came to the parks before a certain age, and that my kids would be better \u201cjust by the pool or something.\u201d Keep in mind, we are in the Disney Junior area. And that drowning is a common cause of death in young children, and I know at least three families that have experienced that loss. I tried to keep it nice and then I finally said \u201cyou know, they usually do well with travel, they\u2019re just tired today.\u201d And said goodbye. \n\nWas biting my tongue the whole time and wanted to remind them that this is a ride meant for younger children, and not adults in their 20\u2019s-60\u2019s (the two women were mother and daughter). I never understand the idea \u201cchildren must be seen and not heard.\u201d At a children\u2019s ride in a theme park that is centered and based on children\u2019s cartoons and film.

And my mental and physical health got fucked because of severe lack of sleep, partly because of stress and because of my other roommate refusing to switch off the lights. I have fully recovered from my sickness, but am still struggling despite my parents finding a place nearby to stay with me. It seems like nobody except my parents and school friends value me, and even they live such fulfilling lives and are not struggling to make social connections like me. I feel there is something wrong with me because friendly conversations with people in class never progress further into a full fledged friendships, it's as if I'm invisible in people's eyes until I talk to them, and then they go back to their friends and ignore me like usual. I know this isn't the worst situation to be crying about, but it feels awfully isolating. And I was so absorbed in my own mental health struggles that I forgot to check on my best friend, and I feel bad for that as well. But it felt like she had moved on frm our friendship as we hardly saw each other and she would not attend our weekly calls (with her and another of my best friends).

    "selftext": "I was in a long distance relationship with this girl, since last august. She took me at my worse, at the time I was alcoholic, had no job, had social anxiety over the roof. Was single for years since my first relationship cheated on me 20 times or more, since then, I couldn't trust any woman and I was a bit broken. But life was going on anyway.\n\nDuring those months together. I've had multiple relapse of alcohol and would send dumbs drunk messages to her. Nothing to serious. But it happened quite a bit. Just forgave me and understood my alcoholism, if I definitely stopped drinking.\n\nThat what I did. For the last 15 days, I was sober. I didn't told her but it was really really harsh, sweating, mood swing, shaking. But I was determined to not disappoint her.\n\nLast Sunday. She sent a friend of her to message me on Instagram. I told her I was in couple. But then, I liked a photo of her in bikini, and told her we could flirt. \n\nShe had few followers, only one photo, for me it was pretty much a fake and I was messing around.\n\nI would never have gone said that if I knew it was someone real, nor gone any further.\n\nI am french and here, I've been asking friends and most of them tell me it was dumb, and a bit disrespectful, but not cheating, that our love must go above this mistake.\n\nFor her, friends and family all tell her I'm disgusting, it's unforgivable, and she told me you can't repair a broken glass... She never forgave cheating, and won't.\n\nShe is now ghosting me, blocked me everywhere because I have been spamming her to talk to me at least. I didn't realised at that time it was cheating and I feel miserable.\n\nI've been sleeping for weeks, I've had found a job that I left the day after she broke with me, I even booked a flight and then canceled it, losing money in the process.\n\nIt's been one weeks and I desperately need her help, she was the one goal of my life, the only one I've ever been able to love again, I feel like killing myself everyday and I am not even joking, I know it will go wrong for me, i physically cannot live my life without her, not for a mistake I didn't realised... I never ever cheat, and I would never ever, I guess our boundaries are different and it's a miscommunication.\n\nI have nothing to ask, my chest is empty, my life is empty, I just wanna kill myself now, and I have no way to contact her to explain her my point of view...\n\nTLDR : Sorry if I failed you, I don't know how much longer I can endure this. I love you more than anything. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry...\n\nEdit : The worse part is she never let me a chance to explain myself, to even say goodbye, she just disappeared like I am nothing. I can't express how much pain I am going through right now, I just cant keep living this life without her.",

That\u2019s it??? Meanwhile, they\u2019re out here writing a whole PhD thesis about how amazing her man is, even after he did her dirty?? The math is NOT mathing.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just that. Even when I ask them basic questions, they either leave me on seen or reply two days later with the most half-assed response ever. But somehow, they have the time to be active af on Instagram, sending me reels??? Calls? LMAO, those don\u2019t even exist anymore. And yeah, they\u2019ve never been big on calling, but even when they promise they\u2019ll call, they never do. And before anyone says \u201cMaybe they\u2019re just busy with college?\u201d\u2014nah, they have time for our other friends, just not me.\n\nAnd yeah, I\u2019ve tried bringing it up before. The problem? They\u2019ll act normal for like, a week, and then go right back to the same cycle. Atp, I don\u2019t even see the point in saying anything anymore.\n\nOh, and the cherry on top? I recently got a pink rose from my boyfriend, and I was so happy because I genuinely prefer pink roses over red ones. I shared it with them, and the reaction was so bland. Like, no hype, no excitement\u2014just a casual \u201cOh, that\u2019s nice.\u201d I know if it were one of them, the energy would\u2019ve been completely different.\n\nIdk, am I tripping, or does this sound off to anyone else?

    "selftext": "So, my girlfriend (32) and I (30M) have been together for almost a year now and everything is going really well. There have been Ups and Downs in our sex life in the past because of several health reasons, but recently we both feel like our sex really took off. I was kind of inexperienced before I met her so there are a lot of firsts for me.\nA few weeks ago we started experimenting some more and talked about things we'd wanna try, and even watched some video footage of those things to get some ideas and stuff.\n\nI told her that I'd experimented with butt play on myself in the past and I would like to try that during sex (not talking about pegging here). We ended up buying a whole bunch of toys and stuff for both of us including some buttplugs.\nLast night we ended up really tipsy and horny so I suggested giving it a try.\nWe did... And at first it was really nice and hot. We both enjoyed it and had some fun UNTIL all of a sudden I felt the plug pop out. We stopped, and looked around everywhere but the plug was nowhere to be found. That was the moment we realized the (moderately big) plug, even though it had a wide base, got sucked up my butt and was in fact stuck there.\nI straight up fucking panicked and my gf said she could see the terror in my face. I instantly felt sick and started sweating, felt like throwing up. So it was like, do we go to the ER or what do we do?! I preferred not becoming one of those embarrassing sex accident ER stories...\nSo we decided to try and get it out ourselves. I kneeled on my bathroom floor with my upper body leaning over my bathtub because I felt like I'll throw up.\nAnd yeah... My girlfriend basically had to use half her hand trying to fish it out real deep up my butt. It hurt like shit and when it finally got out I was grossed out, felt violated, exhausted and traumatized. I ended up in fetal position in my bathroom with my girlfriend nearly crying for having to hurt me.\n\nMy butt still hurts today and was bleeding a bit this morning and I'm severely traumatized. Even though I'd love to keep trying this, I don't know if I'll ever be able to trust a plug again.\nMy girlfriend did an amazing job being there for me and preventing me from going into a full panic attack so we kinda bonded over this even more. All in all a very traumatic but kind of funny story, I wanted to share! \n\n",

I mean, I've known him for years, and we've been through thick and thin together. But when I stumbled upon her videos, my mind was blown. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. She's doing some extremely hardcore stuff - I'm talking multiple giant cock gangbangs, and her body is just... wow. She has a gigantic ass that seems to be the center of attention in almost every scene.\n\nAt first, I felt a mix of emotions - shock, curiosity, and a little bit of jealousy, I won't lie. I've always thought of my friend as a bit of a shy guy, so it's hard to imagine him with someone who's so... outgoing. But as I watched more of her videos, I started to feel a twinge of concern. I mean, this is a whole different world that I'm not familiar with, and I worry about my friend getting hurt or caught up in something that's not good for him.\n\nBut at the same time, I have to admit that I'm also kind of fascinated.

And I would sit in a position to make sure I was not in view. I would offer food multiple times even if they declined as well. So I felt I was giving them my best.

It\u2019s not an excuse and I still have regrets. \n\nI can never share this with anyone. This is truly off my chest. ",

We had so much in common, we both made each other laugh, you get the gist. But all of a sudden he stopped talking to me. Mind you, he had stopped speaking to me in April 2024, and then randomly texted me from a new number in December or November? But nonetheless I was elated to have him as a friend again. Me and him have bonded over the few months that we were talking, and all of a sudden, he doesn\u2019t answer.

    "selftext": "My sister stole an earring of mine, I'm sure. A long, fringed earring with a rhinestone on the head that I could remove that I bought about three years ago. It was my absolute favorite, basically the only one I wore and I wore it everywhere, it was perfect for everything, I didn't even need another one.\n\nI wore it to a party in December, and I clearly remember taking it off inside the house and putting it in my jewelry box. But when I went to wear it again, where was it? It doesn't make sense. I didn't lose that earring, I put it where it should have been, but someone took it, didn't tell me and to this day has never given it back to me.\n\nI live with my mother, two sisters and my grandfather; and my aunt is the neighbor in the apartment across the hall, and she and her daughter have complete access to my house. I've already gone to everyone, calmly asked if they had taken it, if they had borrowed it and forgotten to return it; everyone said no.\n\nBut here's the thing: my older sister is a bitch. She comes into my room and takes my stuff. She's already finished my perfume, makeup, skincare, hair products - expensive stuff. She complains when I complain, she takes absolutely no care with anything. My whole life has been like this with her, and my whole life I've complained to my mother about it - but my mother just told me to keep my stuff away from her. It's kind of hard when we live in the same house, but it's okay.\n\nShe's already taken some of my jewelry and broken it. When I was a kid, she took three of my rings and returned them to me broken that same night, but I was a kid and the rings had cost 30 reais in total.\n\nWhen I was 17, she took a pair of earrings that my aunt gave me for my 15th birthday, big earrings with stones, more expensive, but besides everything else, a gift, the same thing happened, they disappeared and one day, rummaging through her room, I found them broken; She didn't even bother to show it to me. This one caused me problems, but this woman had the nerve to tell me to my face \"I'm not going to buy another one, they're too expensive\" with the utmost disdain in the world, and my mother did nothing. I kept up the conversation for a while, telling her that she was an irresponsible idiot who had stolen my earrings, but it was no use, and at 17 years old, what was I going to do? Sue her for a pair of earrings? Alone, even more so, because my mother wouldn't help me.\n\nBrother, this story about that earring that she broke has been cooking in me all these years and, along with everything I went through with her in my childhood, God, I hate this woman.\n\nNow, the same thing happened. My earring disappeared and there was absolute silence. I know she has it, I know she took it. But it was in December, it's already March. I've asked her on separate occasions if she took my earring and she said no. I've already gone to her room and turned everything upside down looking for those earrings and I couldn't find them (I found other things of mine that I hadn't even noticed were not even with me anymore). I want to look in her bag, but she won't let me, she'll get stressed and throw them to my mother who will be on her side like she always is.\n\nBrother, I'm going to go crazy because sometimes I stop and think about this piece of crap earring that I know she took. I know I didn't lose it, I know where I put it; if it had been my fault, if I had left it at the party where I wore it, if I had put it in my bag and it disappeared, if it had fallen on the street, I know I would have gotten over it by now; but no, it disappeared in my house, in the place where it should be, someone took it. The only person who has the nerve to steal it from me and act like the biggest sly person there is. Practically every week I end up staging fights and fights with her, demanding that she give me back the earrings that I know she stole, but she'll turn the story around and I'll leave like a crazy person because I've already looked in her room and nothing. And I swear that, for real, if I found that piece of shit earring with her I would sue her, now I would sue her. It costs a lot less than the earring she broke, but I don't care. I just want my earring, I just want that bitch to give me back what's mine because I know she has it.",

I've pleaded to her about how i care about her health and i want her to live a long happy life, and she just doesn't seem to care. She has horrible friends who cheat on their bfs, were ex meth addicts, and all are going to go no where in life. I've always wanted to be something big and keep improving myself over time to reach those dreams and goals i have and she doesn't. The only thing she wants is to be a mom, thats it. No drive for a good job, good career, legacy just nothing besides the bare minimum. \n\nDespite all of this i still love her. I'm frustrated with myself cause maybe i did something along the way to make her this way?

Essentially I find a big pregnant belly extremely attractive and the thought of the women's breasts, hips butt, getting bigger very attractive. It is purely objective/visual and I have had this ever since I was young. I have always felt very uncomfortable with having this fetish. Pregnancy is normally thought of as an amazing beautiful thing which to most people means 'baby' on the way. I also see it this way but separate to that I have this fetish as well. I worry that if someone hears pregnancy fetish that they will immediately think that this is some sicko thing for unborn babies or just not understand what the hell that kind of fetish is or what it means and immediately feel uncomfortable. Don't get me wrong, I'm not planning on openly telling people but as my peer group enters the 'having kids' stage of life I am feeling weird about it. I know that society has changed quite a lot but fetishes are still very taboo and make a lot of people uncomfortable. Sometimes I wish I didn't have the fetish just so I wouldn't have to deal with the mixed feeling. The only person who knows about it as an ex girlfriend of mine.

But for the past eight months, I\u2019ve felt like a completely different person.\n\n(No one knows about this, and this is my first time venting or talking about it.)\n\nMid-2024, my parents had a huge fight. I thought, they argue all the time, it\u2019ll be fine, but this time was different. My mom fell into depression right in front of me. I took her to therapy, checked in on her daily, and tried to be there for her.\n\nThen my dad shut down too. He locked himself in his office, barely ate, and was cold whenever I tried to talk. My dad is just like me\u2014we hate sharing emotions\u2014so I just sat with him in silence, hoping he\u2019d feel less alone.\n\nWatching the two strongest people I know fall apart broke something in me, but I held everything together. My routine was: wake up, check on my dad, school, gym, study, then spend hours with my mom. The only time I had to myself was 12-4 AM, and that\u2019s when I met a girl online. Our dumb late-night conversations were the only thing keeping me sane.\n\nBy September, my parents were worse\u2014and so was I. My grades were bad no matter how much I studied. And the girl who helped me escape started playing mind games, making things worse.\n\nThen in October, my parents got better. They were laughing, eating together, and finally acting like themselves again. I thought life was turning around.\n\nBut a few days before my birthday, I got a phone call. One of my childhood best friends had died from cancer. That was my breaking point.\n\nAt his funeral, my brother cried. Everyone cried\u2014except me. At the grave, surrounded by people sobbing, I felt like an outcast. I wanted to cry. I should have cried. But I couldn\u2019t.\n\nThat night, I sat in the shower, eyes red as hell, trying so desperately to cry. But nothing. I just wanted to feel human again.\n\nI held it together until February. That\u2019s when the girl told me she loved me. I said it back, and for the first time in months, I thought maybe life was finally giving me something good.\n\nBut now, for the past eight days, I\u2019ve done nothing but eat, sleep, and doom-scroll. I haven\u2019t gone to the gym. I haven\u2019t studied. I haven\u2019t done anything. And I have an important test in three days. I\u2019m stressed, but I don\u2019t even care.\n\nAnd to make it worse, the girl who said she loved me is playing the same mind games again. I don\u2019t understand why. I thought I finally had something good, but now I just feel like an idiot.\n\nI feel like everyone\u2019s life is moving forward except mine. I\u2019ve been stuck since July, and I don\u2019t know how to fix it.\n\nNobody knows anything about this. It\u2019s just me, alone, going through all of this by myself.\n\nI just feel lost, scared, and overwhelmed, so please, what\u2019s happening to me? What do I do?\n\n(Small note: I finally cried actual tears today, and I don\u2019t even know how to feel about it.)",

    "selftext": "Y\u2019all, I\u2019m struggling. There\u2019s so much, and I\u2019m not faultless. Mother &amp; Daddy divorced before my 5th birthday. Mother \u201clet\u201d my older half-brother* live with his bio-dad once he turned 13. Mother also was diagnosed as bipolar in the 1960s and was treated far too long on lithium. I get this logically, but emotionally.,,I always lost out. \n\nMy mother &amp; my aunt/:her sister have always found a common ground. They\u2019ve had typical sister disagreements over the years*but* have always been each other\u2019s biggest advocates. Point is my mother was not a bad person. \n\nAround my 5th grade year I tuned into fashion. I wanted what I liked, not her cutesy smocked dresses, etc. listen I am now as Southern as can be\u2026I have a ridiculous amount of monogrammed items and would/will happily support a smocked personalized/monogrammed adult dress! There\u2019s no shame in my game. Whatever I buy for my niece will have a matching auntie(or mom) part! ***\n\nWhen my older half-brother was 12, he went to live with his father. After my older brother\u2019s death when I was 12 myself, I was sent to *my* father and his wife and my younger half-brothers. To this day, we are all full siblings in each other\u2019s eyes. My daddy raised my older brother, and his final wife helped raise us. This stepmom loves me and adopted me. \nToday, on the anniversary of my husband\u2019s death, I learned that my bio mother passed away 6 days ago. Our last visit was very pleasant; neither of us drug up the past. However I am struggling with the fact that the hospital (where I used to work, and still love) did not notify me, my aunt, or the temporary Power of Attorney. I\u2019ve been out of reach for a couple of years so a family friend stepped in as mPoA, knowing my mother\u2019s wishes. My aunt &amp; I have consistently been listed in medical records as emergency contacts. No one from the hospital contacted my aunt, me, or the mPoA.\nMy mother\u2019s body has been unclaimed in the hospital morgue for 6 days. 6 days!!!\nHow am I supposed to feel? \n\nTL;dr: my bio mom passed away 6 days ago in the hospital. They disregarded all emergency contacts listed and her temporary medical PoA in my absence. Her body has been unclaimed in the morgue for almost a week. They told my aunt on Monday that she had been discharged(blatant lie). There\u2019s a lot to unpack but she was my mother. We had a lovely visit before I left town 3 weeks ago. I\u2019m so furious that her body has been \u201cunclaimed\u201d in the hospital morgue. \nNote: I loved this healthcare system. I spent almost a decade of my career in their local hospital Admin. When I was very, very sick, this staff literally saved my life. I\u2019ve been so loyal until this circumstance\u2026",

I came back and cried into my pillows and blankets and he tried to act like he cared asking what was wrong.

    "selftext": "It was just my almost 2 year old son and me in the house. Dogs were outside and I was at the kitchen table doing my makeup getting ready for work as I was supposed to leave in 2hrs. The doorbell rang and I ignored it for a couple minutes. It's not uncommon for solicitors to try and sell shit. I slowly walked up to my front door peephole and looked out. There was a man standing with his back to the door blocking most of my view and then a second man was out at my curb back also facing my door kinda looking around. I started to get nervous and slowly turned the lock on the front doorknob so he wouldn't hear I was on the other side. \n\nImportant to note: my mom's transmission went out last week so she's borrowing my car. No cars in the driveway or in front on the street. But the TV was on playing a kid show for my toddler so he wouldn't miss my presence as much while getting ready. \n\nI watched him for a bit and decided he'd probably leave soon and started walking away. That's when I heard my glass door open. I thought I'd hear him knock next but instead I got to watch as my front door knob started jiggling like someone was trying to get in. And then I froze. Instead of getting my husband's gun to protect myself and my child I did nothing. I just froze. He fiddled with the door knob for a bit and then eventually walked away. I peeped out the kitchen window and watched as this dude met up with his buddy and then they started walking away. \n\nI texted my husband instead of calling the police. He's the one that did. He told me to call them because they wanted to ask me questions, and so I did. Then when I tried to call my phone said I had to connect to a wifi or network to make a call. My bill is paid every month on the 2nd and I was connected to wifi. Just another thing that was going wrong. The police had to call me back and ask if I was ok to even talk to them. When the police did show up they said the guys were solicitors and it's illegal in the city to do that. We even have 2 no soliciting signs taped to the glass door. She said her partner found them up the street and was kicking them out of the neighborhood. Since there was no proof they tried to enter the house nothing could be done. The only thing they could do was drive up to the company and tell them that if they walk onto our property again they will have trespassing charges filed and the company will receive a citation. \n\nAt the end of it all I'm extremely shaken. I didn't do anything right except lock the door. I didn't tell them to go away. I didn't call 911. I didn't get a weapon. I just locked the door and then watched as they tried to get in, texted my husband, and then did what I was told. I cried for a long time after. I'm still not doing great. If I hadn't locked that door I really don't know what could've happened. If you've read this far thank you, I just really needed to get this off my chest and out. ",

But I really tried to work through it and honor our vows. But the last years before we opened our marriage and went ENM I thought about your death more than once. I never thought about killing you but about you dying and freeing me from my vow. I resented you.

    "selftext": "I am a 26 year old guy born in 1998. I\u2019m going to sound crazy in this whole rant. \n\nWhen I was 18 in 2016/2017, I became curious how others were perceiving me. I thought I looked young and still had the teenage look. As someone born in 1998, it wasn\u2019t my turn to be 20+ yet, I was still a teenager. Growing up, people born in the early 90\u2019s and mid 90\u2019s seemed to look more mature than me and I thought it was obvious that I was younger. \n\nI began posting pictures of myself to Yahoo Answers and Facebook \u201cguess my age challenges\u201d and asked people to guess. **Every picture I posted, there was at least one person or a few people who guessed correctly that I was 18. That gave me validation** Yet I also heard 23, 24, 25 etc and that felt super weird at the time. I felt weirded out and uncomfortable because I just didn\u2019t understand how/why I was being perceived as much older if there were people who were guessing my age correctly. I remember feeling upset even if I heard 20. I suffer from OCD too and numbers are very triggering for me. They were adding on years to my life and that just made me feel very restless and I felt absolutely disgusted. I was like **Omg i\u2019m still a teenager and I\u2019m being seen as old??Do I have an abnormal appearance, what\u2019s wrong with my development.** But at the same time there were many people online who guessed correctly that I was 18. I remember one picture someone told me I looked like a teen and that she thought I was 14/15 but another person thought I was 23. Another picture, 4 people thought I was 15-19 yet another person thought I was 24. One picture someone guessed correctly I was 18 but another person said \u201cearly 20s unless you have brilliant skincare regime\u201d. I also uploaded a picture of myself with glasses once and someone thought I was 17 or 18 yet another person said 20-25. I was like 25!!?? And that haunted me for several years. I constantly kept having intrusive thoughts about these extreme perceptions and suffered so much. I even had to see a doctor and psychiatrist and took medication to try and stop the intrusive thoughts. I made a vow in September 2017 to stop posting.\n\nIn real life, many people thought I was a teen in school and asked me what grade I was in but at the same time some people thought I was past university age and doing my masters. It just felt super weird. This kept happening to me throughout university. People asking me what grade I was in (being shocked that I was university) and a few people who thought I was past university age. I will never forget September 2019. A guy born in 1992 told me that I looked younger than 21 to him and still looked like a teen but the day after that, a lady thought that I was older than my then 29 year old sister (1990) and kept saying she looked really young like 22ish and I wasn\u2019t even 22 then like wtf.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I suffer from OCD and constantly had intrusive thoughts that I was filthy and disgusting because years were being added onto my life and I wondered what I was going to look like when I was actually 23-25. These numbers were disgusting in my mind. I also developed Body Dysmorphia and hated my appearance. I didn\u2019t mind being perceived as young but wondered what was it about my face that made me look old to others??? How could I look young and old at the same time? \n\nThen when I was actually 23/24, 2 people asked me what grade I was in and a few days before I turned 25 in 2023, someone asked me if my school was closed for summer break. But then in January 2024, someone asked me if I was 25 and I was like omg have i looked 25 for the past decade?? Am I living in some sort of time warp??\n\nNow I\u2019m 26 and many people ask me if I\u2019m a student of a postsecondary institute (uber drivers, restaurant/cafe owners, people helping me in stores etc) That\u2019s a common perception many people have of me. But I have a sneaking suspicion that history is going to repeat itself in a new context and that a new trend will form that I\u2019ve got to be 30, or 30+ when I\u2019m technically not even in my late 20s yet. This is why I don\u2019t post pictures online and avoid socializing with people. Because I\u2019m afraid history is going to repeat itself again and that I\u2019ll suffer again. I\u2019d much rather be alone than be around people who have the potential to make me uncomfortable in my own skin. I wasn\u2019t uncomfortable withy appearance until I became aware that some people have extreme perceptions of me. I also get really angry like why are most people so stupid and unable to read my face??? \n\nSometimes I just wish I could stay locked up in a tower like Rapunzel away from the whole world so that no one can ever see my face again. I\u2019m also pretending to be Evil Queen now as a coping mechanism. Someone obsessed with her appearance, constantly needing validation and being vindictive towards those who challenge her identity. \n",

It was often enough that I noticed when it no longer happened. \n\nWe are very obviously a gay couple, so I figured at some point or another they put that together and stopped coming. I was wrong. Turns out my lover, who is (lovingly and in their own words) \"built like a brick shithouse\", answered the door fresh-out-the-shower wet and in one of my silk robes at some point in the middle of the day, and they have avoided the building since. I still see them in the neighborhood but never on our floor.\n\nmy lover just confessed this during couple's game night and I just started crying laughing. It's been months. They never told me because they were sure they had stretched my robe out in the shoulders and didn't want to upset me. I personally think they look great in tight clothes but I can understand why seeing a big, burly ginger man in a barely closed, ill fitting silk robe could get us put on a religious shit list. Maybe it's just a coincidence (and what lucky guys, either way. They never wear anything like that when I'm home.) but regardless it's so silly. ",

    "selftext": "We have been coworkers for almost 10 years and best friends for over 5 years. I'll keep it vague because she uses reddit regularly. Annie (fake name) and i are both in our 30s, both single, we talk constantly- we are either texting through the day or voice noting each other while we are driving. Everyone at work thinks we are a couple and are constantly asking if something is going on, unfortunately nothing ever has. \n\nI've been in love with her since I first met her. She's just so beautiful and smart and funny, there's nothing I don't love about her. She's a great mom too and I've been partially filling a void in her sons life of a male role model. \nAnyway on to the incident. We were out for dinner after work. I had asked her out knowing I was going to finally confess my feelings, but she didn't know that was my intention, we get dinner regularly enough. \n\nWhile eating we were gossiping about work and about a new project we are starting. It'll be us two and a guy called Craig (m 50s). Craig has asked me out multiple times to the point its definitely an ongoing joke. He knows I'm interested in women only and we have a great working relationship. Annie makes a comment about us having some late nights working coming up and I better watch out for Craig's advances, I joke that I guess everyone just wants to kiss me, she says not everyone. OK not a great start. I say well speaking of kissing and she cuts me off and just says \"please dont\".\n\nI just said ok. We both got fairly quiet. Finished our dinner with some small talk and work chat. Went our separate ways and haven't spoken since. It's been 2 days. I'm just so sad and lonely without her. I miss her son. I want to talk to her so much, but I know I can't keep this situation going on or I'll lose my sanity. I'm going to look for a new job. Maybe actually start dating women. In time I hope I can be a real friend to her. I feel bereaved. If anyone has been through this type of situation and has any advice please let me know. ",

    "selftext": "\n\nYesterday, my parents went out to attend a family function, leaving me alone at home. The first time my dad left me alone at night, I felt a little scared. After all, for a girl, spending the night alone in a big house isn\u2019t always easy. But this time, it was completely different\u2014I felt calm, confident, and absolutely at peace.\n\nWhat surprised me the most was that my parents didn\u2019t call me even once to check whether I had eaten or done my work. Not because they forgot, but because they know I am responsible enough to handle everything. Being the eldest daughter of the house, I have always been expected to take care of things on my own.\n\nWith \u20b9200 in hand from my dad, I first treated myself to chhole bhature. Later, I managed to earn \u20b91000 by sending some rice, so now I had even more freedom to enjoy!\n\nFor lunch, I had paneer curry with rice, and at night, I went full feast mode\u2014pizza and pasta while watching Tenali Rama on TV. No one to disturb, no distractions\u2014just me, my food, and my favorite show! After that, I enjoyed gulab jamun and ended the night with a cold Thums Up, making the day feel even better.\n\nThe best part? This time, I didn\u2019t feel scared at all. Sleeping alone, which once felt a little uneasy, now felt completely normal.\n\nWhat I realized was something even bigger. Every night, when my family is around, I feel lonely. But when they weren\u2019t there, I understood that I don\u2019t actually need anyone to feel complete. If someone doesn\u2019t want to be with me, I can still live happily on my own. As the eldest daughter, I have often been ignored because of my younger brother. But now, I\u2019ve finally understood\u2014there is nothing wrong with being alone.\n\nThis morning, I woke up, spent some time soaking in the warm sunlight on the terrace, and now I\u2019m making myself a cup of tea. After this, I\u2019ll do some housework, and before my parents return, I\u2019ll prepare a meal for them.\n\nHonestly, this experience made me realize that being alone doesn\u2019t mean being lonely. It\u2019s peaceful, freeing, and fun! No unnecessary stress, no chaos\u2014just me, my time, and pure happiness.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI feel silly to be in this spot making this post but I just needed to get this off my chest. \n\nI (23 M) started talking to Walter (49 M fake name) a few months ago. He found me on an app based around a certain fandom, which name I\u2019ll be leaving off, where we ended up connecting. \n\nI knew he was older, and I know better. But he\u2019s so charming. And I just feel so silly because I can see the red flags but fuck is he so easy to talk to and he makes me so happy. \n\nWalter is not well, he told me he has BPD. He\u2019s had to do two stays in mental hospital in the times I\u2019ve known him. Well, today, we were talking, everything was normal. And then randomly, he texted me that he took a bunch of pills and that he was sitting outside of a hospital and I just started panicking. I mean, what the hell.\n\nI feel like I should state, I too am mentally ill. I just have started making improvements to my quality of life, and I thought Walter was as well. We\u2019ve been bonding over growing as individuals. Trying to keep each other up. Y\u2019know. So I was really worried to see this turn today.\n\nHe said he was on the phone with the hotline. I asked him if I needed to call for help. I pleaded with him. I sent him audio messages because he tells me how cute I am. I pleaded. And he just said how cute I was, and asked me to say please like that when we meet. \n\nHe kept telling me how much he\u2019s going to miss me and sending me virtual hugs and just complimenting me. \n\nI know. I know better. I know what\u2019s going on. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m still letting myself fall for him. He\u2019s just so smooth. He makes me feel safe. I feel like he understands me. He listens to me. I just. Is there. And I don\u2019t have many people there for me. And I know that\u2019s not a reason but just. Here is where I am in life. I didn\u2019t think I would find myself in this position but I haven\u2019t heard from him in 2 hours. He said he thinks he likes me. He brought back up when he asked me out, but I turned him down then. He\u2019s just a weird little guy that I think I\u2019m starting to like. \n\nIt feels good to say that. I can\u2019t really explain this to people my friends my age. My best friend knows about him, but not that I like him or flirt with him back. I just don\u2019t know if they\u2019d understand. I know what\u2019s happening, and honestly I\u2019m okay with it right now. I probably deserve this happening to me. Because I put someone else through this before. I\u2019ve been the suicidal guy making someone plead for me. I am not proud of that guy I was. And I am making these changes to my life and trying so hard to be better. But maybe before I get better I should go through what I did someone first. \n\nMaybe it won\u2019t be bad. Maybe I\u2019m worried over nothing. But he is truly sweet. Maybe it doesn\u2019t always have to turn bad. ",

    "selftext": "I'm 14 years old and have told two of my friends briefly about this but I feel like I'll annoy them if I speak about it more. I just want to get this off my chest and put my experience somewhere in hopes it'll make me feel better. I'm also posting this here because I don't want anyone to try and intervene, it'll just make everything worse. Content warning for violence as well, but suicide is mentioned first so I used that flair, sorry.\n\nMy mom is an okay mom most of the time, but she's very quick to anger and has total freakouts over small things that always result in herself threatening to kill herself, or saying she's going to kill herself. I have a little brother who is 13, and my mom is 45 with a history of suicidal thoughts and one attempt before we were born, which she told us about. \n\nWhenever we get into huge fights, she usually takes my stuff and threatens to destroy/burn it (she never does), she never let's me talk and always screams over me, and then of course she threatens to kill herself and says it's because of me and my brother and she says we ruined her life. I can understand why she resents us to an extent, my brother and I are rape babies and we look like our dad. On the topic of him, he's an abusive rapist who was/is addicted to drugs, and who hasn't been in our lives since I was 3. He has gone off the radar for a few years and nobody knows where he is. My mom keeps threatening to send us back to him and has shown us her text in him multiple times telling him she's done with us and that he needs to come get us. He never has, obviously. The last few times we've gotten in fights I never even yelled once and just keep talking calmly because I heard that helps calm angry people down, it doesn't work she just keeps yelling, and there's even been a few times when I do raise my voice that she literally covers her ears and says \"lalalala\" like a toddler until I stop talking. \n\nAfter she threatens this, she usually leaves the house and says she's never coming back and says we can live with our grandmother. She says either that she's gonna drive off a cliff, into a brick wall, etc etc, or that she'll just straight up abandon us and start a new life somewhere. Then she'll come back some time later and act like nothing happened, very rarely she'll apologize but if I ever try and bring up what she's done again when she's calm, she'll just get enraged again. I've tried talking to her about it through text only once when she was out of the house, sending her a lengthy few paragraphs about my concerns, but she responded back basically just shaming me, and when she came home she was angry and she said she showed the text to all of her friends, which are mostly my friends parents, and she said they don't like me anymore and I won't be able to hang out with any of my friends anymore. I started avoiding all of my friends and eventually began online school because of this, and now my mom claims all my friends and their parents miss me and they don't understand why I don't talk to them anymore. I don't know what to believe anymore.\n\nWhen she isn't in these weird freak out modes she's an okay mom but she snaps at random stuff before flipping like a switch and being happy again. Just yesterday she was yelling and slamming around her computer because she couldn't upload her photos to Facebook, she's a photographer. A few people had just been over to fix our dryer about an hour earlier, which has been broken for months, so mid yelling at her computer she just got up and went to go text out the new dryer and then when it worked she was all smiles and apologized for yelling.\n\nShe also frequently tells me and my brother that we're the only thing keeping her alive and that she would probably kill herself without us, and she's told us multiple times that she doesn't own a gun because she's afraid that when we grow up and move out she'll kill herself because she has no one to rely on anymore. This scares me and I want to move away for college when I'm grown, I planned on leaving this household as soon as possible, but I don't really want to anymore because she keeps saying things like that. She says stuff like that and says she loves me and my brother, but then says the exact opposite when she gets really angry and says she wants to die because of us and she blames everything she's mad at on us \"stressing her out\". She's also gotten physical with me and my brother multiple times, like digging her nails into the back of my neck and holding my face into a pillow because I wouldn't give her my phone because she said she was gonna break it, chokeholding me and dragging me out of me room before locking me out of my room and tearing it apart because I hid my art tablet from her, and more. She's done stuff with my brother too and I'm ashamed to admit this but I don't know what because whenever she's mad at him I just hide in my room so I won't get punished for helping him. He does the same when she does that stuff with me. I only know she hurts him because I can hear it. \n\nI don't want to call the police, I'm scared and I don't want to live with my grandma or in a foster home or anywhere else and I don't want to be separated from my brother and pets. She actually encourages me to call the police on her and says she'd rather go to jail than live with us. I just want to explain to her how her her actions hurt me and my brother and I want to get her to stop. There's been periods of times where everything has been fine for a while and my family is just a normal happy family and I cry sometimes thinking about how that's what my family could be like if my mom wasn't the way she was. I know I'm doing it to myself at this point by not calling the police but I'm just scared and keep hoping things will change.\n\nRight now is one of those times where everything's fine, my mom is currently talking to my brother, offering to clean off the couch and sit and braid his hair while they watch the movie together. We're all acting like nothing's wrong. I just wish my family could be this way all the time.",

    "selftext": "I usually don't post about this kinda stuff online or really talk about it out loud with anyone, to be honest; It's often just a page on a random notebook where I braindump anything and everything that crosses my mind at the moment when I feel like it's too much to handle. \n\nToday is different. I decided to expose it exactly because I never did. Been trying different stuff to see if something changes, in hope that any change could chain more and eventually things get better.\n\nI've always felt sort of an inadequacy around life, if that makes sense; A feeling that I never really belong anywhere or am passionate about anything. I'm currently 30 years old and so far I've been navigating passively. I wonder if there is such a thing as not really fit to being alive. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a cry for help and I'm not planning on hurting myself in any way; Also, I'm not trying to throw a pity party, I'm coming from a place of trying to figure this out logically.\n\nLike I said, I'm currently 30. Turned 30 this year. I still live with my parents, am unemployed but am currently studying computer science at an university. Never really been into a relationship, but I do have some good friends and a loving familt, for the most part. Still, there is something wrong with me. I look around sometimes and hear shared experiences from other people about romantic adventures or success on their jobs and I feel like I want that. It's not jealousy, mind you, it's more of a self questioning as to where have I been if not doing all that stuff?\n\nMy current situation is my fault, and I understand it's not good and even then, I don't have the strength or willpower or whatever you may call it to change it. It's like part of me wants to experience the world and... I guess a good way to explain it is, I want to want to do stuff, but I don't know what or how to start.\n\nStarting things is another problem of mine. I know what needs to be done and even so starting things is so difficult that it's insane. Normally that could be ruled out as being lazy or procastination but frankly, I've putting things off for 30 years, the problem has to be something else right? Currently, I know that I should be sitting down to work on programming projects to create portfolios and help me get employes but doing so is... hard. Not as in, programming is hard, it's not that. I'm also not scared of making mistakes, I embrace them as an opportunity of learning. It's a mix of not knowing where or how to start and perhaps a disbelief that it is going somewhere? I even thought at some point this might be related to me playing too much games or watching too many shows but even if I cut all that off, I still won't do what I need. I'll spend time laying in bed, overthinking, planning too much for stuff I never have the guts to get done.\n\nI guess you could call me a leech, but I don't feel like it's the case. I don't take pride nor plan on taking advantage of my dad's kindness forever, but I just feel... lost? It's always been hard for me to set goals to achieve because I feel like I don't really have anything. I can feel content with so little and that's maybe the reason why I never try and get more. I don't consider myself ambitious: Having fancy stuff or being famous or helping people... None of that stuff really pushes me forward. And those are the common stuff that people want so how can I move forward without a good reason to?\n\nThere are things I'm interested in, yeah. Like learning languages. But also some stuff I'd love to try and have no money for right now like woodworking maybe, music and theater.\n\nI still feel like a kid, frozen in time watching it go by and desperately trying to grow up but failing miserably. And although I umderstand there is no point in thinking too hard about my past mistakes that led here, I'm scared that I'm forever trapped in this loop of not being able to move on. I want to escape, but am not sure what I should do. Therapy would help I feel but I'll only be able to afford it when I manage to get a job. I'm hoping I'll manage to get my first internship this year and maybe talking to someone would help me figure things out. Sure, I have friends, but I don't feel like I have a safe space to be vulnerable with them or anyone else in my family.\n\nI always thought, back then, that I would have this figured out by now. Sometimes I think all it's needed is a small change that gets other things in motion, so lately I've been trying to do that. Doing things differently, trying to experimenting new stuff. I recently created a routine to try and force myself to do stuff; It hasn't helped much so far because even if I write things down I end up forgetting to look at the list or just can't bring myself to do it but on good days, I actually get a small amount of stuff done.\n\nI'm the kind of person who tries to understand and look for a purpose on everything and this here is kind pointless. This post went nowhere and is not going anywhere. Kinda like my life so far. It's funny to think that. But that's why I decided to do it. I'm not sure things will work out and despite hearing positive encouragement from my friends, still can't see much of a future for me but I'll keep doing what I can and trying my best, even if it's not the most optimal for a normal human being.\n\nIf you actually managed to read this far, my apologies for this mess. I wrote as the thougts came, no organization or anything. \n\nI hope someday I understand myself and determine my purpose.",

But then I think about life, specifically in my country where I can only focus on having a decent career a d get money to pay the future bills. \nI really like being single as I have to give explanations to no one when i go out or stuff like that, but sometimes feeling someone's body close to yours (not in a sexual way) its all you need. \nSorry if it makes no sense, english aint my first language \ud83d\ude13, and this is mostly a venting post.

    "selftext": "Well i dont hate HATE him. I still respect my husband. He provides a lot, roof over me and our son\u2019s head, food on the table, water to drink.. yeah what am I complaining for right? I should always be grateful that im in this position, which i am. It\u2019s just there are things that still bothers me, that ruins my mood, sucking the soul out of me little by little, draining my life day by day, inch by inch. Idk if im just a whiny wife, but here are some things that messes w my head everyday:\n\n1) He NEVER puts his coffee mugs in the sink after he used them, there\u2019s always hundreds of them outside where he smokes (i told him a million times to put it in the sink after he finish using it, i dont mind washing it, JUST PUT IT IN THE FUCKING SINK) but noopee, still compiling outside the house. Til this day, i let it be, there are still 4-5 mugs outside the house, not gonna touch it ever unless he brings it in. This is so sad for me, cus he knows i got a bad eczema on my hands, so everytime i wash BUTTLOADS of dishes, i have to wear gloves, wash the gloves, dry the gloves, also wash my hands bc rubber gloves makes me itchy a bit etcetc my main point is its hell and back on earth for me to do dishes, and he\u2019s not considerate of that. We once had a big fight bc when we\u2019re at our inlaws (his fam) he fucking WASHED HIS MUG??? Huh? Since when the fuck do u do that? So you care what your family says about you instead of caring about your eczema hands wife? Yea fuck you.\n\n2) he rarely takes care of our son. I literally do everything. He only takes care of him if i told him to. Sometimes when i shower, i have to actually ask him \u2018can you watch him for a bit\u2019 he has this ugly smug face and said \u2018k\u2019 like um wtf? You\u2019re supposed to b excited?? He\u2019s your son??? You will b rarely seeing him cus you work offshore???? Get this, infront of his family, he acts so fatherly, playing with him, taking care of his diapers etc while me, if we\u2019re actually home, IM DOING ALL THE FUCKING STUFF, not him. He literally does shit IF i tell him to. He\u2019s never considerate of how tired i am 24/7. 90% of the time if I dont wanna see his smug face if i have to shower and no one is watching our son, i had to put our son in his crib and let him watch ms rachel on ipad, eventho it hurts me doing that cus im limiting his screen time. And what was my husband doing that time? PLAYING LEAGUE OF LEGENDS, and he\u2019ll be like \u2018sorry im in game, i cant quit\u2019 well fuck you. And also get this, when i found out that im pregnant and i wanted to abort it (cus i know im not ready) he was the ONE who strongly insisted to keep it cus he said he cant wait to be a dad. Well step the fuck up bro\n\n3) idk if im wrong or just exaggerating but he prioritizes his family over me and my son. If there was a fire, he would save his 4 brothers and 5 sisters instead of his wife and son. He would go to the ends of the earth for them ( once he had to deliver something car oil at 6AM for his sister n her husband, 6AM??? Mf usually wakes up at 2pm ffs. \n\n4) he has this obsession w fixing up old cars he would spend loads of money on it and w literally his blood, sweat, tears and his time. Yo i don\u2019t mind mf got a hobby, i got a hobby too, that\u2019s great for him, but wht abt when i need to shower???? Do i have to go outside to ask you to watch over our son again with your ugly smug face again?? to sum up he has 2 obsession, league of legends and his car. None of which you can bother him at all. My hobby is just gym. JUST GYM. FOR 1 HOUR. At which i can ONLY work out when my son takes his afternoon nap! I just want him to evenly schedule his hobby.. not to the point he doesn\u2019t have time for his son or me. Do u think he listens? Nah. Everytime i told him this he\u2019ll be like \u2018this is the only time i can do this, while im working at sea i cant do this stuff\u2019 im like HELLO? cars and games are forever?? Your wife and son could leave you or die anytime? wtf is his mindset mahn istg he\u2019s still acts like a teenager. I literally feel like i have 2 sons as of this time.\n\n5) his dirty clothes and socks. Need i say more? I feel like almost every wife experienced this. \n\n6) he spills his coffee and chocolate milk every where in the kitchen but never wipes it. (I once saw the mf VACUUMS his family\u2019s kitchen bc there was a spilled rice grains). Basically he\u2019s really sloppy. \n\nThere are more but that\u2019s the top of my head. Idk what I should do. Everytime i tell him whats been bothering me, we always have a huge fight and it always ends with (ok i promise i wont do it again) but he still does and its and endless cycle. I cant leave him bc I literally have no money to raise my son alone (AND my mom is getting old, so i have to take care of her too). So til now im just tolerating everything but it drains my energy so much but at the same time i put on a happy smile on my face for my son, i dont ever want my son to see depressed or angry. \n\nMind you, he used to b very sweet and thoughtful at the beginning of our dating life and marriage life. I thought he was the most amazing guy. I know he loves me and my son, but i dont think he loves me enough to change his ugly habits. ",
