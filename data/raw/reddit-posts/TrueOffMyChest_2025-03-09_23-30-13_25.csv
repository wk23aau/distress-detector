"t3_1j79hp6","I can’t really take it anymore","Sorry for the long ass post. I would have made it longer but wanted to spare you the novel.

I’m honestly just really lost and struggling so much right now. I’m 25, and suffer from a long list of mental and physical disabilities. I’m not really able to work right now due to my disabilities but am in the middle of a long process of trying to get on disability payments. I still live at home with my mum and brother (dad is deceased), and I just found out last week my mum has stage 4 bone cancer. My partner of 3 years doesn’t live with me but is soon having to move out of his family home so has been putting pressure on me to move out with him as we’ve been together for a significant amount of time and we should be moving onto the next stage of our relationship. I’ve tried to explain that it’s difficult for me to move out as I don’t have a job and the income I do get from the government isn’t going to be enough to pay for rent let alone my food, medications, my dog’s food and be expected to save for my doctor and specialist appointments but also to save to eventually buy a house like how he wants us to be able to do before turning 30. He just keeps telling me to apply for work and I only have experience in retail but due to one of my medical conditions I can’t even stand for more than 5 hours on a good day without being in debilitating pain where I literally struggle to walk. I have no experience in being a receptionist and no matter how many jobs I apply for no luck. He wants me to move out as well as I’m being treated as a stay at home mother looking after my mum and brother (this is well before the cancer diagnosis). I don’t think as well that it’s sitting in for him that I very badly need and rely on being on my mum’s health insurance considering I’m chronically ill and it can turn at anytime for me and sadly I’m having a different surgery at least once a year, sometimes twice a year so idk how I’d be expected to afford that if I wasn’t living at home, with no job. He refuses to live with my family until we can save enough to buy a house because he hates my family and well understandably is struggling to even see a future with me like this but I feel like he’s in between a rock and a hard place with the fact that he does love me and how he doesn’t want to leave me cause I’m sick cause it’d be like leaving someone who’s got cancer which is an asshole thing to do. And it doesn’t help that I’m struggling with my mum’s new diagnosis. On top of everything else I personally am just really struggling with how beyond god damn emotional I am. Late last year I fell down some stairs causing me to be bed ridden for 2 and a half weeks and in turn has caused me to develop or severely worsen potential already undiagnosed OCD. I’ve never been diagnosed before with OCD because truly I don’t say out loud my thoughts and whatever I have disclosed or displayed gets pinned to my autism but since the fall I’ve been consumed with anxiety, depression, anger, guilt, agitation and panic with mess, things not being in a particular order (mainly MY way of order). I feel like a shell of who I once was I struggle to hide anything well, I cry almost daily and have just started to learn either cry to myself when no one is around or wait for my therapist. I don’t ever want to leave my house cause if I stay at my partner’s house, guarantee I’ll be a sobbing mess when I get back cause my mum and brother always make a mess and they never clean up after themselves which in turn triggers me more. I already am a pretty reserved person when it comes to my feelings cause I think it’ll come off over dramatic to others even though I know they’re valid but today I got proven why I think that because my partner asked me what was wrong when I got home and I spilt 1/4 of my thoughts and feelings and I got stopped with being told that “maybe you just like to make things more difficult for yourself than it has to be”. Potentially that’s true but also I don’t mean to, my brain just never shuts up which I’m realising with typing this that yes it most definitely doesn’t shut up. The sadder thing is there’s a lot more to my anxieties and why I can’t take it anymore and maybe I’ll just get a diary and deep clean till I can’t walk. I just want to be alone and lowkey sedated but I got an appointment in a couple days on an update to some scans and if I’ll need surgery or not which is obviously another anxiety. I frankly just feel a lot of pressure from my boyfriend and I feel pressure to look after and help my mum and if I don’t well no one will cause my brother and her partner are useless. I feel pressure on myself with my own mental and physical health, getting a job and what kind of job realistically would even be good for me, I feel temptation to go back into eating disorder tendencies or back into my addiction to smoking weed. I feel beyond insecure about my appearance which I know is a vanity and self esteem issues. I truly don’t know what to do because try and take it day by day but I clearly have some control issues. I’m frustrated cause I don’t want to die, but I also don’t want to be alive or at least conscious.","2","1"
"t3_1j73ltg","I wish I could get rid of my BPD..","I want it to go away so badly....I don't want to be looked at as a curse or a monster anymore. I swear I'm not bad I just want love too. I feel like somehow all the bad things that happened to me are my fault and I'm not lovable and that's on me too.

I'm so sorry to anyone's life I made harder by being in it I'm so sorry I'm trying so hard to be good I swear I am...it's just really hard I'm sorry..","6","1"
"t3_1j7052g","Stabbed a dog","I stabbed a dog. I was working as a delivery driver and I went to a house with a bunch of packages piled at the door meaning the homeowners were gone. All of a sudden a giant dog that looked like the beast from the sand lot, same breed, very large, came sprinting around the corner and latched on to my arm. I had a thick canvas work jacket on so the teeth barely broke the skin. I carry a folding knife as a habit since I was a kid in boyscouts. I stabbed the dog with my free hand after trying to punch the dog and it ran off back around the corner of the house. A woman and her teenage daughter came around the corner screaming at me and I told them what happened. Apparently they were neighbors there to take care of the dogs. It all happened on the front porch in front of a ring camera. I then left, called my boss and the cops but decided not to take legal action. I guess I felt bad for doing that to the dog. I don’t know what else to say it’s been a few months. I’m pretty sure the dog died and it probably would’ve been put down anyway.","12","11"
"t3_1j78zph","Why is it wrong for people to feel nostalgia about anything on this site?","Seriously, if I want to continue living in the past and reminisce over something I liked growing up and choose to prefer it over what's being provided for me now, I want to fucking do exactly that, goddamn it. I want to watch new movies that I'm interested in seeing in the theaters than at home on HD or 4K TV sets. I want to rent and/or own movies at a local video store or library than stream movies digitally. I want to play video games at the arcade than rely on consoles. I want to go to a concert venue or record/CD store to find new music to own. Seriously, if people are so insistent on letting people live their lives and letting them be, why am I considered an exception? All the time, whenever I come on this site, it's like people just want to do more things within the comfort of their home than go outside. I know people will say shit like ""Everything's so expensive"" or ""People don't know how to behave in public these days"", but you only live once, which is something I feel a lot of people tend to forget about themselves, and I'm not some ""boomer"" or an ""old man yelling at clouds"" for thinking this way. A homebody is sometimes not worth being when you got a whole life to live, you know.","2","3"
"t3_1j71hhj","SA still bothering me years later & here’s why.","My parents adopted with my permission when I was 11. They took classes was placed on this list got the call took my siblings and adopted them. My brother was 3 when we got him and always treated him as sibling. They were never referred to as adopted growing up. Flash forward I’m 19 he’s 13. He becomes obsessed with me completely out of no where. Starts with cutting the back out of several pairs of jeans attempting to see me exposed. Then one day I noticed while using the restroom there’s small holes chiseled into the wall. Yep peep holes. Parents patch them. He creates more. Mind you he’s in extensive therapy they’re basically begging for help as to why he’s doing this. (Of course the state wants you to adopt and then ditches you when there’s a problem.) He then started exposing himself in weird places in the house so I would walk in on him. Then I worked all night was tired accidentally dozed off on the couch (still am pissed I fell asleep because maybe this part could have been avoided) and he touched me from my butt to my vagina in one quick movement. I wasn’t hardly asleep so I instantly woke up saw him walking away and he admitted to my parents that he did it. (I moved out 2 weeks later) Now flash forward again I’m 25 he’s 17. My parents obviously continue to raise him. there was no punishment because he was a minor (he was sent off for a year if you want to call that something) my parents have a relationship with him and I have a relationship with my parents. He talks about me to mom still which I find very odd. I have not said a single word to him since the incident. Being around him even this many years later physically makes me ill. I hate his guts and quite frankly wish terrible things upon him. I’m no where close to being healed from this and don’t know if I ever will be. He has a girlfriend that he’s been with for awhile she has no idea what he did and it just makes me sick because if that were me I’d want to know and I feel wrong by not telling her but I do not know her and the fight within my family it would cause ugh. I witnessed him today with the gf and he’s constantly in her face demanding affection and overly touchy. Just makes me sick for the girl and any future potential victim. sorry for the long post. I’m just really sad this happened to me.","9","1"
"t3_1j71hd5","I accidentally showed a co worker my sex toy search history","During some down time at work one time, a co worker and I were chatting about some recent purchases we had both made.

Knick knacks for work and things like that. I pulled my phone out to show her some recent personalised items I had bought from Etsy.

While trying to find my purchase history, I pulled up my search history. I had completely forgotten the things I had been looking at. One of the vendors I had purchased from also made sex toys and sex themed items, so as any normal person does I had a peruse through her wares.

So there plain as day to my colleague was all these sex toys, phallus and vagina shaped items. And the item I had actually purchased wasn't even any of those items!

Yep. I apologised and told her to forget she ever saw anything while she laughed.

I don't even know how to delete etsy search history so no more showing my search history ever for me.","9","4"
"t3_1j71736","I wish things could just stop happening for a day.","I can't seem to catch a break.

Just in the past month, my car has needed major repairs three times and was broken into once (there's nothing but trash inside so I don't know what they wanted), work got shittier in a dozen different ways, and my cat has been getting sick at least twice a week. And now, just today, my grandfather died. Over a thousand miles away. They think he caught the flu, and was septic before they could get him to the hospital. His blood pressure was bottomed out and his heart rate was almost 200. When they took him off of life support he didn't last ten minutes.

I don't know what to do. I want to attend the funeral. I want to see my family. I want to comfort my dad. But there's nothing I can do. I can't afford a plane ticket and I have to work. My car wouldn't survive the trip if I tried to drive.

I'm so tired. I've been drinking, so sorry if none of this makes sense. I just... want everything to stop. Just for a day. I just want a break.","9","5"
"t3_1j63j0w","UPDATE: My gf beat the shit out of someone who broke into her house","I don’t know if anyone remembers me but a while ago my girlfriend and I had a home invasion incident that culminated in her beating the shit out of the intruder. I’m tired of saying my gf so I’m going to call her Diana.

Turns out the guy was a drug addict from the next town over. He was in his 60s and he had an extensive history in jail and mental hospitals. Unfortunately about two months after my post, he passed away. We didn’t know anything about why until we got a chance to talk to his sister, who insisted she didn’t blame Diana and that the doctors even said that he probably didn’t have much longer anyway. (Diana was visibly distressed during this conversation so I’m not sure whether or not the sister just said that to comfort her)

After that Diana went on a trip to a national park during a week she knew I couldn’t take off and forgot her meds. She has seizures that look like mild psychosis/magical thinking and ended up refusing to come home at the end of the trip. She kept saying that she felt like she couldn’t leave the woods because she was certain there was something she needed to learn there that she hadn’t yet, and when I asked her how long that might take, she said “some people take a lifetime.” I asked if she was breaking up with me, and she said something about feeling like she was “too attached” to me, her house, her pets, etc and that she needed to meditate on that for a while.

I ended up going to her temple to see if anyone was willing to give me some perspective on the situation since she was seeing things through a Buddhist lens. It was the right choice. A monk actually drove the six hours out to her with me to talk to her in person since she wasn’t picking up calls. I am so, so unbelievably grateful for that monk because Diana started taking her meds again and came home soon after. I’ve never been religious but I started to read the Pali canon afterwards and that shit slaps. Diana was already volunteering her time at the temple so now we both go together when we can.

All things considered, since then, things are back to normal and going well. We’re both children of divorce so even before all this we were doing prophylactic couples counseling every few months, and for a while after we were going once a week. Diana has started seeing a therapist on her own as well which I am so proud of her for since she’s always hated the idea of individual therapy.

We also stepped up our home security game. Diana already had plenty of cameras, but now we have door/window alarms and motion sensors. I also convinced Diana to get another dog, so now we have a 75lb puppy…

I know a lot of people were rooting for us to get married, but that’s not going to happen. Legal marriage isn’t something that interests us and it never has. But we did buy each other rings, and it’s been a great comfort to have something physical to remind me of her on my person all the time. We’re also considering having a small commitment ceremony next fall <3

Thanks again for all the feedback on my previous post. I got a lot of great advice, and some good criticism. I showed it to Diana and she got a kick out of the comments, and we had a little mutual cry over how kind a lot of you guys were. I asked her if she was okay with me posting this update, and she clucked at me and told me to do whatever I want online as long as I’m being nice (and anonymous lol). So… hope this qualifies!","2507","57"
"t3_1j789eo","I think I’m falling out of love","I’m so lost. I know relationships are never easy, but I’m just starting to think that maybe we didn’t meet at the right time in each other’s lives. I have so many insecurities in regards to being included in outings. Her communication is really lacking and forgoes telling me how she feels about things.

Our most recent disagreement has been in regards to travel - we can’t come to a compromise and find a balance between her travelling with her (and also my) friends with time for us to spend together. We promised we’d travel with each other after this year fell through for similar reasons. Instead, I had to leave it at she will go with her friends instead of me. I’m hurt because it feels like she doesn’t want to go away with me, but she’s hurt because I think that.

She’s promised to do better and apologised so many times for not communicating. I feel like our bad times are more frequent than the good. I want to push through because she is so loving, caring and sweet but I’ve got a massive piece missing rn and if I explain this to her, she breaks down and stops talking entirely. I’m stuck. I know I am so far from a bastion of perfection in this relationship, but I just can’t help but be frustrated and saddened by this.

Today, I was sick and quite feverish, so I spent a while thinking back to a past relationship. While I’m absolutely over that girl, I just couldn’t help but reminisce about how that short relationship three years ago made me feel. I do hold it in very high regard because I was in the wilderness prior to it - alone and totally confused about my place in the world before she showed me, so I’m now quite nostalgic about what she was for me, especially now my needs just aren’t being met. That girl and I met in the wrong time and the wrong circumstances to last, but we ended very amicably. I know it’s horrible and so unfair for my gf as well as the previous girl to keep thinking like this.

I love spontaneity and random, intimate things (and I have told her this) but never does she ask me to come over for a karaoke drive at midnight with the windows down. Never does she say she wants to spend the night with me somewhere random. I sometimes ask but it’s usually a no. I feel like I’m right back to where I was pre-previous relationship and I’m lost and so sad.

I want to make things better, and I know constantly comparing my last relationship to my current is really poor. I know I’m focusing on the negative things she does. I know I could be better but I’m so fucking demotivated bc she just doesn’t talk and we just don’t go out to do things. Then a rift forms and I have to be the one to try and pull it back, and then she’s extremely upset and scared that I might leave her, or she thinks she’s a bad person. I can’t say how I really feel because of that. It takes days for our usual fun side to return and then there’s a couple weeks of good. Rinse and repeat.

Long-term relationships are loads of battles to stay in love. Some are so much harder, but I do love her. Though, is it worth losing parts of who you are when I’m this age? I’m emotionally exhausted by the constant confusion and stress of slow and lacking communication as well as my physical needs just not being met. I’m 23, so I’m not looking to waste her or my time any longer if this just won’t work. I like solving things but this feels like it’s becoming bigger than me.","2","0"
"t3_1j7d1qk","How to tell someone their boyfriend is on dating apps?","I came across a guy on apps, I had gone on one date with him a few years ago, but a girl I used to briefly work with has been posting him on her Instagram for his birthday, Valentines, etc. The first time I saw him was on Facebook dating and it doesn’t show anything about being active so I thought it could’ve been an old profile. This was on Valentine’s Day and she posted him on her story. A few weeks later she posted on her story for his birthday. And today I saw him on tinder with his profile showing “active” and that he liked me. Nothing on his profiles says in an open relationship or non-monogamous. I took screenshots but should I tell her or send her these? I don’t really know her well at all but I feel bad knowing this if they’re likely still together 😕 How do I start that conversation?","1","4"
"t3_1j75usy","I’m once again in a toxic relationship","Throwaway cuz she knows my account and follows this subreddit.

I (M, late 20s) have been in a relationship with my gf (F, late 20s) for a bit over half a year. I can’t go into any details without her realizing its me and also why I’m not saying our exact ages.

She knows about my past. She knows I’ve had a toxic, manipulative and violent exes. She promised she wouldn’t be like them, even complained about her exes, but turns out, she’s repeating the exact manipulative patterns as my worst ex. She’s not violent, but I’m getting the feeling she just wants to see me suffer.

That’s it. No details, no need for sympathy. Just wanted somewhere I can freely vent. I don’t need advice, because I know I’ll just stay with her like with the previous ones.","3","3"

"t3_1j6c8nk","A man tried to get into my house today. I did everything wrong except lock the door","It was just my almost 2 year old son and me in the house. Dogs were outside and I was at the kitchen table doing my makeup getting ready for work as I was supposed to leave in 2hrs. The doorbell rang and I ignored it for a couple minutes. It's not uncommon for solicitors to try and sell shit. I slowly walked up to my front door peephole and looked out. There was a man standing with his back to the door blocking most of my view and then a second man was out at my curb back also facing my door kinda looking around. I started to get nervous and slowly turned the lock on the front doorknob so he wouldn't hear I was on the other side.

Important to note: my mom's transmission went out last week so she's borrowing my car. No cars in the driveway or in front on the street. But the TV was on playing a kid show for my toddler so he wouldn't miss my presence as much while getting ready.

I watched him for a bit and decided he'd probably leave soon and started walking away. That's when I heard my glass door open. I thought I'd hear him knock next but instead I got to watch as my front door knob started jiggling like someone was trying to get in. And then I froze. Instead of getting my husband's gun to protect myself and my child I did nothing. I just froze. He fiddled with the door knob for a bit and then eventually walked away. I peeped out the kitchen window and watched as this dude met up with his buddy and then they started walking away.

I texted my husband instead of calling the police. He's the one that did. He told me to call them because they wanted to ask me questions, and so I did. Then when I tried to call my phone said I had to connect to a wifi or network to make a call. My bill is paid every month on the 2nd and I was connected to wifi. Just another thing that was going wrong. The police had to call me back and ask if I was ok to even talk to them. When the police did show up they said the guys were solicitors and it's illegal in the city to do that. We even have 2 no soliciting signs taped to the glass door. She said her partner found them up the street and was kicking them out of the neighborhood. Since there was no proof they tried to enter the house nothing could be done. The only thing they could do was drive up to the company and tell them that if they walk onto our property again they will have trespassing charges filed and the company will receive a citation.

At the end of it all I'm extremely shaken. I didn't do anything right except lock the door. I didn't tell them to go away. I didn't call 911. I didn't get a weapon. I just locked the door and then watched as they tried to get in, texted my husband, and then did what I was told. I cried for a long time after. I'm still not doing great. If I hadn't locked that door I really don't know what could've happened. If you've read this far thank you, I just really needed to get this off my chest and out.","498","57"
"t3_1j7cir2","18 M & F. For the past year, I've suffered mentally cause my GF wouldn't initiate intimate contact with me.","This is a bit odd, and by intimate, I mean a bit more than just touching.

For a year, I've felt like I've initiated every kiss, every makeout. We're not sexually active yet, but have been dating for almost 3 years now. And we were fairly physical before, but now the extent of her initiating anything is holding hands or resting her head on my shoulder.

I love even that. Makes me melt. Makes me feel wanted. But then I realize at the end of the day, that I initiated every kiss. We make out once in a couple months when I initiate.

I've asked her about it. Multiple times. Is something bothering her, does she want some support, is this not something she wants in a relationship.

Every time the answer is that she wants it, and that she'll initiate but then it's like she forgets about it. I remember the time she'd hold me, look me in the eyes and kiss me. I remember the times she'd take the slower, non supervised elevator to kiss me in. I remember when she'd ask me to come over when she was alone to make out.

Nothing. For a year, nothing. I don't even ask her anymore, cause at that point it feels like I'm forcing her or making it out to be a major fault. I can't even tell what's wrong. What's changed. Every time I ask her it's a different thing. She's not feeling it, she's lost her sex drive (but then a month later, she said that wasn't the issue), there's shit going on in her family.

And it's fucking killing me inside. I've started to cook up an actual fantasy in my head. Fantasies of being intimate with her someday have turned into a fantasy of a girl in the future who actually physically expresses love for me. I have shit in my life too, and a kiss from her makes all that go away.

I just feel broken at this point. For 3 years almost, I've worked with this girl, and I genuinely love every inch of her, but somehow this issue itches at the inside of my head and makes me miserable. And I've tried talking to her, but it makes no difference. We reach an agreement and she changed things for a day and then she just reverts to the way things used to be.","1","8"
"t3_1j7cela","What is the deal with cats and Christmas trees😭","My cat loves Christmas trees specifically the fake ones. It doesn’t matter if it’s small or big he will go and try to chew on it any chance he gets, same with my other cat.  Last night I started hearing one of my cats whose name is ace struggle a little bit.  I instantly woke up and turned on my light and it looked like there was something stuck in his mouth. Immediately I put him in my arms and wrapped my blanket around him so he won’t squirm too much and looked in his mouth. At first I didn’t see it then I realized a piece was stuck in his front teeth. It took me a few minutes bc he didn’t like me messing around in his mouth but i eventually got it out and he was fine. We ended up cuddling the rest of the night and I kept a close eye on him.

Why do cats do this? What is the lore for them to want to do that. I tried getting him a catnip plant but he wasn’t interested at all.

(Also yes I know it’s March and my Christmas tree should already be taken down😭 I want a family picture of my son who I’m currently pregnant with and my family by the tree so that’s why it’s still up he’s due in less then 3 weeks)","1","1"
"t3_1j7ce4s","Grieving biking season","For the past 2 years I’ve been smoking weed, almost daily. I recently went through a lot of changes, and in that I quit smoking and started taking supervised urine tests. (Among other things) I knew that taking these tests meant I couldn’t take my drivers license for at least a few months, and that was okay with me. What I didn’t know is that it meant I couldn’t drive at all, until these tests were finished - which is 6 months - even tho I am clean.

My doctor failed to tell me (or I failed to remember) that I can’t use the license for my motorcycle that i already have.

I recently met a guy who made my passion for driving motorcycles light up again. I was so ready to get back on the bike, bring it out of the garage, change out the oil and have it in pristine condition. I was so excited to spent a summer on two wheels while getting my life back on track - and this time with someone to share the joy with. In some ways it was part of my motivation for staying clean, and having it ripped away in the span of a few google searches made it that much harder.

I feel so angry, and stupid. I feel like I should have known, and I feel like it was obvious. Yet I thought in some magical way that I could keep my excisting licence, just not take another drivers test. I was so ready for the freedom of driving to work, and going on road trips. Or just driving to the store without relying on commute or friends, or having to walk for 15 minutes.

I know it really isn’t the end of the world, but the next 5 months is gonna be that much more challenging knowing I could have been on a bike if I hadn’t admitted to my doctor that I smoked weed. Im gonna call the doctors office tomorrow to see if I’m correct in thinking I can’t drive my motorcycle, but I’m scared of getting my hopes up. I’d rather sit with knowing I’ll get told I can’t drive than be let down again tomorrow.

But on the other side of things, I probably wouldn’t have quit if it wasn’t for having to do this at some point either way.

It just sucks that I’ll be done with these tests in September, at the very end of the season.","1","0"

The past 14 months of my life have been hell on earth (for other reasons) and I was certain this would be the icing on the cake but I’m so freaking happy I was wrong.

"t3_1j7bogt","My life has come to a standstill","I’m sure this subreddit gets posts like this all the time.

I started dating this guy six months ago—he is the most wonderful and attentive boyfriend ever. Our relationship is going strong, but that’s not the point.

For some context, I’ve been very sheltered throughout my life, which has made me extremely introverted and anxious. I just started college, and I have no friends from school because, about two years ago, my mother decided I should be homeschooled and demanded that I cut off contact with my friends.

When I got into college, I ended up in a group of friends who were super shallow. Being around them gave me terrible face dysmorphia and a spending habit from mirroring them. From the outside, it looked like they had loads of fun together, but I was with them for four months, and it was terrible.

I had a friend in class, but we drifted apart because she became best friends with this one girl who was no better than Regina George. We still talk amicably, but not often.

I’m friendly with my roommates, but there’s a language barrier since they share a common mother tongue, so there’s not much connection there.

I was best friends with one girl, but she would get mad at every little thing. On top of that, she would spread other people’s secrets to unrelated parties, which was a huge turnoff. We had a final confrontation, and that friendship burned out.

I’m friends with two other girls, and as nice as they are, they’re closer to each other. Honestly, they’re a lot like me, but I’m so self-conscious around them that I don’t feel like myself. They’re super open, and the hesitant vibe I bring to the table just doesn’t fit well with them.

The only real support I have is my boyfriend. I have online friends and people I talk to occasionally, but no actual close friends. He isn’t isolating me—he actually encourages me to talk to people—but I just can’t. I know I need to put myself out there, stop caring about embarrassing myself, yada yada, but it’s way harder than it seems. I feel out of place.

I just feel so lonely. I have no one to attend events with, no one to meet up with in the evenings. I pretend it’s by choice, but honestly, I’m just fucking lonely.

My favorite festival is a week away, but i know my bully will be there and i have no friends to back me up. it will be the most joyous occasion and it hurts to know everyone other than me will be celebrating. my boyfriend cant come bc of restrictions imposed by college","0","0"
"t3_1j7bjzh","My life ended when I was 21.","It ended two years ago when I had a traumatic experience after a party. Since then, I’ve had health issues and mental issues. I used to get panic attacks every night and I lived completely alone abroad with no support system and no one to check on me. I went back home, and the psychiatrists made me take 3 different antidepressants which messed up my brain.

Everyday feels like survival mode to me. I used to be such a social person, now I get anxious of social situations and avoid it. I used to love going out, but now I get scared of being outside. Every small task feels scary to me. My intrusive thoughts are also still there despite me quitting drugs a year ago. I have no hope anymore.

And on top of that, I met someone I loved during this shitty year of my life. We ended things because he just couldn’t deal with so much from me anymore. I feel so guilty every single day for not being able to show him the version of who I used to be before drugs and experiences messing me up.

I’m 23 now. It’s been 2 years. I moved back home for a bit, even though I hate it here.

The past month I’ve been feeling very down and thinking of sometimes ending it, even though I would not act on it. I just feel like I can never become the person I wanted to be again. I keep trying to think there is light at the end of the tunnel, but it never comes.","0","0"
"t3_1j7bepy","Advice for res or even inpatient","Ok so this is advice for how to survive these places. They are helpful, but in a weird way, but it sucks, and it’s traumatizing. But it’s very isolated and weirdly desensitized, so in there you aren’t effecting anyone you have personal attachments to. So first official tip, just make it to your release date, and you will be just fine.

Next, a lot of people coming in to these places may have drug issues, or self harm. When I was in the ones I went to, I was too. And I was put in a terrible place with people on stimulants and benzos; along with a very odd amount of persistence and survival “methods” You will likely turn to snorting cheeked meds, drinking hand sanitizer and god knows what else. So go in with at least a little safety net. bring yourself alcohol wipes, an extra sock, and then a condom, if you are afab and haven’t had any surgeries or anything like that then this can work for “transportation” but the condom has other uses too. Not for sex.

Please don’t have sex oh my god. Just jerk off or something, everyone there is fighting literal demons. You do not want to end up in bed with them, I know that sounds stupid, but two people going through a mental health mess will have a very weird and toxic dynamic.

I should also say that people are going to be judgmental. They are judging themselves so they are also projecting it. So I just don’t think you should form attachments or like preconceptions. You should talk to them though, it will really help to hear about someone’s life the closest you ever can. It makes you feel less alone. And it’s incredible to know you’ve seen these people be horrible and they the same for you, and you will never see each other again, and they know the most and least about you.","1","0"
"t3_1j73nvx","I have been a shitty human being and I wish my existence was erased.","I wish I knew what I was doing was not good. When I was younger, I used to pretend to commit suicide to get nudes from people who cared. I feel like the biggest piece of shit for doing shit like that. I was wrong for doing whatever I’ve done.

I hope I turn out to be a better human being than that piece of shit from years ago. That is all I can wish for now.","4","11"
"t3_1j7gehm","i am giving this guy one last chance before i block him, and idek if i should do that","idek why i'm writing this here. not going to lie. i just haven't really told too many people about him, and the people i have told, i've only told good things, because i don't want them to worry about our age difference (im 19, he's 27)  - i'm okay w it, but most people i've told haven't been. so i just want to vent.

so we have been talking for about two months now. and while at first everything was consistent, it stopped being so after a couple of weeks. he was telling me at first that he loved my time and my company and then, suddenly, for a few days, he barely texted me. but when i pulled back, started texting less, he came back again? i figured he was just busy.

a few days later, after we became consistent again, he ghosted me on a date. but he was sick. so i forgave him. after this, he picked up with the relationship talk again, started calling me names (babe, sweetheart, etc.) and talking about loving my company again. it was sweet, and made me feel better about what happened. but after a couple weeks of this, it was back to distance again. and once again, when i reciprocated, he came back again.

he was then back through valentine's day and following. and then a couple days ago he started texting less again. this time he isn't distant per se, he's still using the sweet talk...just barely talking to me.

i really like him. he says he likes me. when we do hang and talk, it's a great time. but i'm confused and the times he's distant hurt me. so i'm gonna talk to him and if he doesn't come around this time, im gonna block him. i guess. :(","0","3"
"t3_1j7b4sy","I spent years in love with my grandma","Three years ago, I met a girl online, and we hit it off instantly. We texted every single day, flirted shamelessly, and honestly? It was one of the best connections I've ever had. We never did video calls though, so neither of us knew what the other looked like. We're both introverts, so it never crossed our minds to FaceTime (weird, I know, but that's introvert life for you). Despite that, we developed a crush on each other, but we decided to remain flirty friends who sometimes roleplay sexy things because we're both not relationship people and and long-distance relationships are a hard pass for us. So we just kept texting and gaming together.

Since I didn't know how she looks like, my brain started creating an idealized version of her and I imagined her like this alluring, confident, intense and mysterious femme fatale.

One day this girl disappeared without saying anything. Poof, gone, she deactivated all her gaming socials. She was always quite depressive so my mind started to jump to the worst conclusions, I was very worried. And I endlessly tried looking for her everywhere, but I only knew her name and country so I got nowhere.

I eventually gave up looking for her but she always remained haunting me in the back of my mind  because of the way she had disappeared and the fact that I didn't know what happened to her. So I kept thinking about her throughout the 2 remaining years, replaying our last conversations to look for cues, and all of that led me to dead ends. It was frustrating. And it was like a mystery that I needed to solve. Alexa play ""oh whooo is sheee?""

So one day, I decided that enough is enough. I was going to find her and I was going to get my answers even if I have to become the FBI myself. I believe in manifestation and law of attraction so I spent a whole night visualizing me finding her personal socials (the socials we had each other added were not personal socials, it was gaming socials, so I wanted to find either her Instagram or Facebook).

And it worked! Next day, I went full FBI detective mode. I said the only information I had about her was her name and country, so I used those leads and somehow I managed to stumble upon her real full name! (I think this was the manifestation and law of attraction at play or some kind of witchcraft I dunno). It turned out that the name she had given me was a fake one but that's understandable so I don't hold it against her. Whatever. With her real name in hand, I found out where she went to school, where she went to college, and of course her personal socials.

So I opened up her Facebook and Instagram, filled with anticipation because finally I would be able to put a face to the ghost who'd haunted me for 2 whole years! And when I laid my eyes on her, there she was... THE SHEER REFLECTION OF MY GRANDMA WHEN YOUNG!

No, really. Like not kind of, not a little resemblance, I mean copy-paste, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, a perfect genetic duplicate of my grandma in her youth. ...I had spent years chasing this mystery woman, only for my brain to go, ""Wait a minute… is that… grandma?""

I WAS FUCKING IN LOVE WITH MY GRANDMA! FOR YEARS! Years of mystery, longing, idealization GONE IN A SECOND. My attraction to her? Instantly killed. Biggest turn off of my life. All the sexy things she had ever told me were no longer sexy and I just couldn't picture us physically together anymore...

We used to roleplay fear play scenarios AND NOW THE FEAR PLAY TURNED INTO FEAR FOR A DIFFERENT REASON. Like, instead of ""I'm going to hunt you down and devour you"" being hot, now it’s giving ""Eat your vegetables, sweetheart"" and I'm just sitting there like NOOOOOO, THE MAGIC IS GONE.

This is the kind of thing that would send Freud into overdrive. ""Tell me, how does this make you feel?"" LIKE SCREAMING, FREUD. IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE SCREAMING. My brain had built up this intense, mysterious, alluring figure, and then boom! grandma vibes! And I ended up in some kind of weird family reunion, yay!

This is for real one of the biggest plot twists of my life. I basically turned 3 years of longing into a detective saga with a twist ending, and instead of crying, I'm laughing about it. At this point I'm just happy because I can finally close this chapter but at the same time I feel shallow for losing attraction towards her immediately after seeing her. Oh well, not everyone can be attracted to their grandma.","1","1"
