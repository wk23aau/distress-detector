My husband can go leave and not worry about if his son will be okay because he knows he will. I can\u2019t leave without having to pack everything get my baby dressed get me dressed make sure we\u2019re both warm. Let\u2019s say for one say I can go out IF I was able to leave my son like that then what, I have no friends no family other than my husband and son no way to get around. What am I going to do just walk around town alone? But if it was my husband he would have someone somewhere or something. Anyway I\u2019m giving up I don\u2019t see the point I just wanted friends and a new start here but I guess it\u2019s not for me ",

    "selftext": "Hi all, this is my first time posting anything like this on an online platform, heck even talking about it to anyone in such depth or to this degree. The below is a journal entry of mine from yesterday/today. I would appreciate any advice regarding steps i can take to help myself as im reaching a real down point. I tend to hide things very well, to a point where if you ask my friends/family, they have no idea how low i  mentally as im good at putting up a mask - i think too good for my own health \ud83d\ude05. I truly appreciate any comments. \n\n10.3.25 - I have been off Effexor for 3 days purely because I\u2019ve completely forgotten that it exists and I need to take it. This has been both good and bad. Withdrawal symptoms are occurring (dread, heightened anxiety manifesting as chest pains, trembling, emotional instability and elevated heart rate, shivers down my spine and a hot/cold sensation). I can\u2019t think clearly and can only focus on the negatives in my life.\n11.3.25 - Took 150mg Venlafaxine (Effexor) and 20mg Frisium, not usual 10mg - Frisium has done absolutely nothing. I can usually tell when its working at the normal 10mg dose.\nThe positives that have come of this are that I have now been able to see things within myself that I previously had not or could not, possibly because I suppressed them and bottled them up, which over time has only made them worse. The main issue is:\na severe fear of judgement which has been there since I was a young child, that has held me back in:\nRelationships (romantic, friendships, family)\nMaking decisions that impact my future (career and financial decisions)\nChronic stress and generalised anxiety\nLow self esteem (diminished sense of self worth and negative self-talk)\nDepression (feelings of hopelessness and despair in everyday life)\nIsolation and loneliness (severe in many cases)\nThis also shows in gradual behavioural changes, such as:\nPeople pleasing (prioritising the approval of others and constantly seeking approval)\nPerfectionism (leading to harsh self criticism and frequent mental burnout)\nAvoidance of expressing opinions (agreeing with others when I disagree, not sharing my ideas, thoughts or opinions)\nMasking my true self (presenting a false image of myself to please others and/or gain acceptance, acting in ways that may not aline with my true self)\nA point that I want to make clear is that under virtually all circumstances I DO NOT show my true self. I always have a mask on that is carefully and specifically crafted for interactions with that person or group. I literally live a lie day in, day out. The pain that this brings me, I am unable to put into words - it truly is debilitating).\nI also feel tremendous guilt. My parents do not deserve nor should have to deal with this, but I understand that they within themselves can\u2019t avoid it as they care. The treatment they get from me when I am in this state is horrible, unfair and disrespectful, but it seems that I cannot control it. Trying to shift my attitude to a more positive one over the last two days has been a monumental failure - I do not have the mental capacity or strength to do this effectively at this time. There have been moments (now and in the past) where I have truly wished that I was never born, or that they at least had a child that was mentally stable, one they deserve. Much to my dismay, this does not appear to be me.\nAs I see my peers getting married or at least in solid, long-term relationships, I can\u2019t help but beat myself down. This has reached a point where I know that I want that connection with somebody, but in reality I am not in a position to even consider it at this time due to my past decisions and current circumstances - this is my own fault, but nonetheless it is a pain I have to live with for twelve hours each day. I despise myself for this.\nDue to different reasons past friendships have collapsed and I am left with three good people, that I know have my back at all times - I appreciate them for this. Even with these people that I know always have my back and have shown this in many instances, I do not feel comfortable discussing these things with them - this goes back to fear of judgment. I know that they don\u2019t see it that way, as they have opened up to me when things were bad for them, but I can\u2019t bring myself to open up and talk to them.\nI don\u2019t think I would truly ever be able to take my own life, which I have always criticised others for doing or contemplating (never directly to them as that is insensitive), but these last two days have made me understand that feeling and the depths one can reach mentally. This depression and sadness felt over the last two days is unlike any other depressive episode I have ever experienced. As I write this paragraph, I have a sick, hollow feeling in my stomach. I wish I wasn\u2019t this person. I truly wonder what the contributing factors and causes are that have made me into the person I am today, but I know that I shouldn\u2019t focus on this as its an endless downward spiral that offers nothing positive, but just keeps dragging me down.\nI have also realised that I have started to intensely crave human connection - in all ways. I don\u2019t feel I can clearly explain this in words at the current moment, so I will leave it at that for now.\nI have also started to intensely crave illicit substances to help suppress these emotions. I have successfully held myself back from this by having a few glasses of scotch when I get these urges as it gives me that \u2018buzz\u2019. I fear that I will give in at some point, as the strength to say no to myself is diminishing at a very fast rate. This is not just over the last few days, but over the last few months.\nMy mind has been overwhelmingly loud and busy. Currently to a degree where I feel as if I\u2019m going crazy. There are so many problems and negatives for me to deal with that I never have a sense of peace or tranquillity. I can say that I haven\u2019t felt at peace or truly calm in many years (probably since I graduated high school). My mind is always racing at 350% capacity.\nI also feel that privacy and personal space are non-existent. This can\u2019t be helped to a degree as I live with my parents currently, but it has been playing on my mind and I think it's a large contributing factor to these feelings. I am also not in a position to move out, again due to my relationship with money and the ridiculous rate at which I spend it. Impulsivity - what a great thing (meant with all the sarcasm in the world).\nThe usual chest pains that I would feel from my anxiety are worsening. Today I have had the pain from the moment I woke up - it is also far more intense than usual. I can describe it best by saying that it feels as if I have a car resting on my chest - a heavy weight pushing inwards and an extremely intense sensation of stress around the centre and left of my chest leading to heart.\n",

He has a private account and I noticed he had dmed himself some things so I went to snoop in that first since he hadn\u2019t opened the chat with his sister. To my utmost surprise he was sending himself posts of Instagram models. We had multiple conversations about this in the past but it was even more of a gut punch since we had just gotten finished talking frisky with one another.

    "selftext": "I feel like I can't accept love. I can\u2019t form connections with anyone, and even if I could, I wouldn\u2019t be able to accept love from them. When someone puts me on a pedestal, like family members, I feel so uncomfortable. When they are happy that I graduated college, I feel uncomfortable. These things I've achieved mean nothing to me. If I feel like a connection might be made, I feel awful inside and want to pull back.\n\nMy parents divorced when I was 5, but even before that, their relationship was just a series of dramatic situations, the kind you\u2019d read in a depressing novel. Nothing bad happened to me *personally*, but a child shouldn\u2019t have to be exposed to that much darkness. I was too young to understand everything, but I still felt it. The tension, the instability. It was like I was watching a storm I couldn\u2019t stop. But back then, I told myself I didn\u2019t care. *They\u2019re stupid. None of this matters. I don\u2019t care about them or anything.* That was my mindset. I didn\u2019t *feel* anything. At least, I thought I didn\u2019t. But now, looking back, I see how much it actually affected me. Me thinking I didn\u2019t care was just a defense mechanism, a way to protect myself.\n\nAfter the divorce, I lived with my mom and her boyfriend until I was 15. When she moved far away, she left me with my grandparents. A year later, she had a child with some guy I don\u2019t even know. My dad has his own family, four kids, all around 11 years old. He\u2019s lived with them way longer than he ever lived with me. That\u2019s his real life now, not the one with me. I was just the test subject, the first attempt. They were immature and not ready, and I had to figure out everything on my own.\n\nI missed out on emotional development, and I battle with this every day. I feel like unconditional love doesn\u2019t exist. I can\u2019t even comprehend it. I\u2019ve seen my mom and dad maybe once a year since I was 15. Even before that, it was rare. How could someone like that grow up to understand emotions like everyone else? How could I be normal? And it's at the point where I genuinely feel uncomfortable when I have to meet with them. I just feel weird inside, being near my parents gives me a weird physical and psychological reaction. Like I just don't want to be near them. \n\nThe only family member who even tries to show me love sometimes is my grandma. But even then, it makes me uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable. If *anyone* tries to show me even a little bit of care, I physically feel weird inside, like something is deeply wrong. It\u2019s not just discomfort, it\u2019s like my body and brain *reject* it. I don\u2019t know how to explain it, but I feel this awful sensation, like I need to escape. Like, I genuinely in those moments want to be left alone. Like genuinely. A lot of the times I feel like I want love, unconditional love, from someone from who I can trust it's unconditional, not family. But even if I somehow got it, I know I wouldn\u2019t be able to accept it. My mind pushes it away. My body fights it. And that\u2019s the most frustrating part, wanting something so badly but being incapable of holding onto it. It just makes me feel more alone.\n\nI don\u2019t see any other family members much at all. I do live with my grandparents, but my grandpa is emotionally unstable, and it\u2019s hard to connect with him. Every single one of my family members is messed up in a different way, each their own kind of broken. I\u2019ve become really good at reading people, but it doesn\u2019t matter much since when it comes to using that knowledge, I freeze up and blank out.\n\nAnd when I do try to interact, it never goes right. I think in a logical way. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve survived. No one cared for me, so I had to figure everything out on my own. When someone has a problem, I immediately see the logical reason for it and the solution. So I say it. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve always handled things, fix the problem and move on. But when I do this with my family members, they get mad. They say I\u2019m cold, emotionless, that I don\u2019t care. But this is how *they* made me. They left me to figure out life alone, and now they hate that I see things this way? I don\u2019t mean to be cruel. I mean well. But instead of hearing the truth, they just want someone to sit there and feel sorry for them. I don\u2019t get it. No one ever felt sorry for me. Coping with a problem instead of fixing it only makes things worse. Why would I encourage that?\n\n\nI\u2019ve also never really connected with another human being. There have been some rare friends here and there, but even that was never deep. It always felt surface-level, maybe slightly deeper but eh.. And if we\u2019re talking romantically, I\u2019ve never experienced any of that. I\u2019m 23 now, and the idea of love, relationships, or even just simple emotional connection with someone feels like something that exists in another world, one I don\u2019t belong to. It\u2019s like there\u2019s an invisible wall between me and everyone else, and I don\u2019t know how to break through it.",

But my mom is losing her dad but continues to make light of the situation to comfort those around her. She has become extremely successful as she recently got a promotion allowing her to move states! And she moved and took a risk, my mom had lived in her hometown for the majority of her life. She\u2019s head of a department and makes good money. I love her I\u2019m proud of her she\u2019s so cool but corny but love her.\n\n She has always loved me and I know I am her favorite thing in the world, alongside my sister. My mom was supportive when I came out, comforting through my mental illness episodes, and has always worked to ensure I have the access to do what I want to do. I don\u2019t understand what I\u2019d do w/o her I high key ball at the potential of her dying from old age, or maybe earlier. Bc like if she goes I go like I cannot survive w/o her. I call her every day like every day. Idk she\u2019s the best mom ever I genuinely feel loved when I\u2019m with her.\n\nBut sometimes I feel so out of place in the world but I know I\u2019m where I\u2019m supposed to be, because there are moments where I feel like I am out of place but I believe I\u2019m meant to her daughter in every universe and she\u2019s meant to be my mom in any lifetime.\n\n\ud83d\udc95lol I won\u2019t tell her this myself but I\u2019ll send her a random text message at 2 am and I feel like that\u2019s the equivalent. If you can\u2019t tell by the 50 times I said I love my mom!!",

    "selftext": " (25f) started working at a gas station 3 years ago, I would arrive to the store at five in the morning, get the money for the register from inside the store and then walk 1000 steps out to the gas station to open up. Every morning the adrenaline of carrying $500 in assorted change would get to me. I knew it was unsafe to go alone, but I was the first person there everyday and there was no one to walk with me. \n\nAt first, I used to dart straight out to the gas station, to unlock the door and put the money away but after gaining some confidence, I just kept my head on a swivel and walked out to my workspace. \n\nOur store and gas station shared a parking lot with a smaller store, which routinely had homeless people hanging around it. For the most part they stayed at the little store, once in awhile they would come dig through the gabage cans or wash their hands in the windshield cleaning buckets, but nothing too concerning. \n\nAfter my first year I was no longer scared of my morning routine, I got the money and headed out on my trek, put the money away, checked the garbages, and did my leaf blowing when I noticed a figure slumped against a piller on that smaller store. At this point I was used to seeing people sleeping over there, and I still don't know why but my heart sank and I knew that he was dead. I still don't know what tipped me off, but I ran into the kiosk and called the police. \n\nThe police, the fire department, and the ambulance came, they taped the area off, and worked for what felt like hours before they took him away and left. \n\nI mentioned it to my manager when they asked why the police was there, but I never told anyone else at work. It never felt like my story to tell. All I did was call the police, that's all I could do. My manager offered to let me go home, but I declined, going home would not save that man, and I doubt that it would have made me feel any better. \n\nLater that day on my lunchbreak our local community newsgroup (who listens to the police scanners) posted on Facebook that there was an unattended death at the little store. I shouldn't have, but I read the comments. People fighting about homelessness and choices that someone could make to cause them to be homeless, people making horrific comments about drug abuse, people saying they were glad to have one less person leaching off the community. But all I could think was that was someone's son. He might have been someone's father or brother. Despite any choices he made in his life, he died alone. He might have welcomed death or taken his final breath in fear, I will never know. \n\nThe sunrise came up that morning and it was absolutely beautiful, the prettiest sunrise aI have seen, but it broke my heart knowing he would never wake up to another sunrise again. \n\n6 months later the same thing happened, but this time all I saw was a set of legs sticking out from behind the landscaping, again I called the emergency services. The police, fire department, and ambulance arrived and administered narcan and were able to revive him. My manager came in that morning to \"congratulate me,\" but it felt so wrong knowing that I called the police just like anyone of my coworkers would. \n\nAnother 6 months later it was about 8 in the morning, and this time I saw two men stumbling around in the parking lot. They looked like they were drunk and on drugs, the taller one grabbing his friend's shoulder to keep him upright, when suddenly the shorter man fell and hit his head on the cement parking barrier. His friend grabbed him by the arm and tried to steady his friend, but upon realizing his friend was gone, let him go and he slumped onto the ground, again hitting his head. Then his \"friend\" just ran away. I hesitated, maybe 30 seconds or maybe a full minute before calling the police, and they arrived, covered his body, and took him away. \n\nThat afternoon when I got home from work I just laid in my bed and cried for the first time about these three men. I was so angry, and heart broken, and I even felt a little guilty that there wasn't anything I could do. \n\nI don't know why I typed this all out, I've only ever talked about this with my parents and my husband. It has now been two years from the first death and I still think about these 3 men. I wonder what could have been done differently to prevent these deaths, and I hope the 2nd man is recovered and still alive to this day. ",

    "selftext": "\n\nI\u2019m seeking help on here since it\u2019s anonymous and I feel embarrassed about discussing this with anyone even a professional. I feel it\u2019s very awkward and vulnerable. \n\n\nTo put it shortly, my family is very toxic and dysfunctional. We\u2019ve gone through a lot. It\u2019s wraught with drug abuse, deaths, abuse, narcissism, etc. But we\u2019re doing a bit better now and everyone has changed substantially. \n\nHowever, I feel that I\u2019ve been deeply impacted by some things. Particularly, realizing that my father\u2019s love was very conditional. He doesn\u2019t love us unconditionally. He\u2019s explicit about it in his words and his actions. He told me that love and compassion have to be earned. So, I spent my whole life earning it. And it worked. He loves me, he treats me well. I appreciate him. But I had to earn it, it wasn\u2019t just given to me as a child of his. I\u2019m constantly on my toes. I feel unlovable sometimes, if I don\u2019t please people I care about. I want everyone to feel good and be happy and I get anxious when they aren\u2019t. I\u2019ve been doing a lot better since therapy (ongoing) but there\u2019s one thing I can\u2019t figure out how to fix.\n\nI\u2019m in the age of getting into relationships/marriage and I\u2019m deeply afraid of it. I\u2019m scared that my marriage will be a reflection of my relationship with my father. The things I want reflect what I lacked in my childhood. When I think of being in love, I imagine my (hypothetical) husband being extremely gentle, protective, affectionate, sensitive with me. Almost like someone would be to a child. I hate admitting this it\u2019s so embarrassing. But I feel so fragile. I don\u2019t want to desire this. I\u2019m outwardly a very confident, balanced, independent woman. I\u2019m not afraid of being codependent exactly, but I do feel afraid of why I want to be treated like the way I described above. I don\u2019t hear any other sisters talk about wanting this. \n\n\nI want to address and change this so badly. I\u2019ve been in therapy for a while and I feel that I\u2019ve healed in a lot of ways but I still desire this and I\u2019m scared that I\u2019m going to carry it with me forever. I don\u2019t want to feel fragile and vulnerable. I just want to be married to someone who will treat me as an equal. I can\u2019t expect to be treated like some sort of hurt child. \n\nI would appreciate any advice. I know this is strange but I don\u2019t know where else to ask for help on this. \n\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been in therapy since 2nd grade, but if I'm being honest, I don't think I needed therapy at that age, but Ethan convinced my parents I needed to start seeing him because what my sister is going through will traumatize me. Unfortunately, my sister did not traumatize me; he did. I don't think I experienced my childhood ever since I was put in therapy because I've faced humiliation, manipulation, and gaslighting, which ruined my relationship with my parents. I don't think Ethan was a therapist for children but for teens and adults only. I cannot remember that much about my childhood or many memories with Ethan, but I remember some parts. Ethan wasn't a good man; he was always telling me about my sister's situation, and if I remember, he asked if I had seen my sister self-harm, and I was young, so I told him I didn't know what that was. I do remember he showed me how self-harm works. He didn't care about how I felt or how my day went; he was always on his phone. He would talk to me if I was an adult, as in cursing, when I was just in 2nd grade. 4th grade got worse; I developed anger issues because I hated going to his office. He made my parents believe I had anger issues and needed to see a psychiatrist for medications. I don't think I had anger issues; I think I held my emotions for too long because no one was listening. I couldn't speak up because Ethan told me if I kept crying to my parents, CPS would take me away. I do remember he showed me videos of foster homes and told me if I wanted to end up like that. It led me to have trust issues with adults growing up. I couldn't trust anyone because I was scared to be taken away, so I kept my emotions to myself. kept getting worse I remember begging my mom to find me a new therapist because of how he treated me, but Ethan will tell her to ignore me because I'm just throwing a tantrum for attention. I don't know if it was weird having a therapist telling my younger self and older sister, who was 13 at that time, that he would invite us to his home because he had a pool. I'm happy we never went. It got worse when something horrible happened to me in 8th grade. I don't know how he made my parents not believe what happened to me to the point that Ethan told them to close the case. I remember I just cried to my teacher, who hugged me because she believed me, but Ethan made my parents not believe me. My anger issues have gotten worse in 8th grade to the point I blame my parents for failing to protect me from a man who emotionally abused me. I blame Ethan for ruining my life. Have I been to different therapies? Yes, around Jan 2020, I remember she was confused why I never played board games or other stuff with Ethan. I changed therapies 4 times, but I just couldn't trust them because I was still scared. I remember Ethan telling me I should be happy to have him as a therapist because another therapist would just call CPS and take me away from my parents. I'm now taking EMDR because that's what my psychiatrist recommended because that was definitely the #1 trauma that affected me more, I guess. I do deal with trust issues with my psychiatrist and therapist, but I'm trying. By the way I am 19F now and I don't have interest in reporting his license I'm scared of him. I think I will always be scared of him\u2026\nMy parents believed what I went through after my sister came forward that Ethan treated her poorly. ",

    "selftext": "Context: My fiance is an orphan and only has her 7 siblings in her life. She is estranged from 5 of them and only considers 2 of them to be family. I plan to propose to her this Saturday and have planned a really nice event. I told my mother my plans and I knew it would be a big fight (we have always had an estranged relationship due to enmeshment and parentification). \n\nSo here\u2019s the issue. My mother is upset that I have included her sister in on helping me decorate the hotel room where I plan to propose. She feels as if I am including her side of the family but neglecting my side. The thing is that her sister is merely helping decorate, she\u2019s not staying for the actual proposal. It\u2019s just going to be a surprise. \n\nMy mother is very old fashioned and believes in public proposals. My fiance is introverted and absolutely would NOT want that. I know for a fact it would give her extreme anxiety. She feels as if the way I plan to propose (privately) is weird and not how I should do it. If you can\u2019t tell by now, she has no sense of boundaries. I know how I want this moment to go and I really don\u2019t want her to ruin it but with all the bickering the past two days i feel like I want to call it off. She\u2019s just ruined the mood of everything. She inserts how she feels into this moment to make me feel guilty or like I am doing something wrong. Im just tired man. \n\nAm I wrong for doing things this way? Should I go about this differently? I just need advice. \n\nEDIT: Wow didn\u2019t expect this to gain so much traction. Thank you guys for the reaffirming support and advice. I will work on setting clear boundaries and moving forward with my plans! ",

    "selftext": "...and I'm insanely jealous of her.\n\nSometimes, I think about her life and how she turned out, versus what I went through. Specifically, I'm jealous of her love life, and the fact that she seems to have that white picket fence life a lot of people dream about.\n\nI still think it's a miracle that she and her highschool sweetheart stayed together all this time, even through college, and eventually got married and started a family. I'm sorry, her MIDDLE school sweetheart. They were in 7th or 8th grade when they first started dating, and everyone knew them as \"that\" couple. Nowadays, they're still \"that\" couple to be honest.\n\nMeanwhile, I met my first boyfriend in my senior year. We eventually had to get into a long distance relationship because we went to different colleges. He broke up with me after a few months into our freshman year because he met a new girl at his school.\n\nI honestly don't think I'd be feeling this way right now if I eventually found my stride. But no; I had a long string of bad and failed relationships after my first boyfriend. I even met a man in college who I wanted to marry and have kids with one day, but that fell through too. (because he cheated)\n\nIt's so much more common for middle schoolers to literally break up within a few months, at most. And if you make it through middle school, you break up at some point in high school. If you somehow manage to stay together through high school, you usually break up in college. (And those two also had to go long distance during their college years) But no; she was lucky enough to find that 1 in a billion man who apparently really does care about her. I'm not saying that she doesn't deserve to be happy, I'm just saying that I wish I had it as good as she does. Even a fraction as good as she does, honestly.\n\nI'm jealous that she seems to just have a constant stream of lucky streaks where I feel like I'm constantly failing. Even career-wise. I'm jealous that she had one idea for a career path, and stuck all the way through it. Now she's working as a lawyer.\n\nI can't tell you how disorganized my education journey has been. I changed my major several times and even took a year off to just focus on my mental health. I ended up getting my bachelor's at 24, almost 25 actually. Right now, I'm even going back to school to be a nurse.\n\nMeanwhile, she got married right after graduating college, and had her first child a year later. She and her husband bought a house together at some point, and I can't help but just think of myself as a loser for having such rotten luck compared to her. Just recently, my fiance broke things off with me because we found out I can't have kids, and now I'm living in some cramped apartment with 2 roommates.\n\nI keep feeling like every time I take one step forward, something happens that pushes me 2 or even 3 steps back. I feel sad and hate how perfect some other people's lives can be. I guess their existence just makes me feel like that kind of luck is possible to achieve, and I've clearly been doing something wrong if I've never been able to experience it.",

    "selftext": "I (20F) broke up with my boyfriend of 10 months last weekend and I can\u2019t shake the feeling of betrayal and anger off. My emotions went haywire when he turned around and said it\u2019d be better if we split. I agreed at the time, but later that night found myself deeply regretting my decision. I begged him to take me back, only for him to metaphorically slam a door in my face.\n\nTo begin with, my ex (who I\u2019ll call Joe for this) was a sweet and caring guy. Things were going well at first for me and Joe despite being long distance. At first we\u2019d call for hours and play together, having a laugh and playfully teasing each other. It was honestly a great experience for me, I\u2019d talk to Joe nonstop and always make sure to give him morning and night texts, getting online and helping him with his projects he was working on.\n\nThings ended up starting to go downhill about halfway into our relationship. I\u2019ll be brutally honest, I\u2019m extremely clingy and have a crippling fear of abandonment due to trauma from my past, so I struggle a lot with being left without replies. At the time things started to go downhill, Joe had started to become increasingly infrequent with his replies. I got worried and confused, I would end up asking if there was something I was doing wrong, or if he still loved me, only for him to turn around and say everything was fine. I started to feel as though the relationship was only being driven by me, that if I stopped then he\u2019d just forget I exist or something. Compared to the start of our relationship, Joe had just changed. Instead of actively responding to me and seeming genuinely interested in what I had to say, all my sent reels or posts would just be liked in bulk, as if he wasn\u2019t even taking the time to acknowledge anything I sent.\n\nHowever, things took a sharp downward spiral a couple of months before me and Joe split. One of my ex-colleagues (let\u2019s call him Fred) and I fell out over comments he\u2019d make. He would constantly jokingly flirt with me and my best friend, who both explained that we were uncomfortable with his advances. In the end, I ended up no longer responding to his messages. I needed space, but apparently Fred wasn\u2019t very fond of that idea. After a while, Fred quit his job and decided to leave me a note which basically threatened me, stating that he\u2019d \u201cbe my demise\u201d and whatever other shit he went on about. Long story short, Fred made me incredibly uncomfortable and I asked Joe if he would cut him off as them being friends made me uncomfortable. Joe refused, saying something about ruining friendships cause of cutting people off in the past, which fair enough, but this is the Well-being and safety of your girlfriend we\u2019re talking about here. I\u2019d do the same for him, I\u2019d protect him with my life if I had to.\n\nI suffered silently for those months, hoping maybe one day Joe would change his mind but he never did. In the end, I just couldn\u2019t deal with the emotional toll this was taking on me, and since I struggled with wording it myself due to my anxiety, I had to get my best friend to talk to him about it. After she did, I got the message from Joe, suggesting that we should just be friends, mentioning how his work schedule of getting up and going to sleep early was taking a toll on him, which is fair enough, but it only takes two fucking minutes out of your day to reply to your girlfriend.\n\nEventually, I gave in. Even if it broke me, I knew Joe didn\u2019t love me anymore, but I couldn\u2019t help but shake the feeling that it was all my fault. I spiralled badly, Joe was the main thing keeping my mental health stable after my self harming tendencies and past suicide attempts. I couldn\u2019t handle it. The emotional pain was so unbearable it became physically painful. My world came crashing down in that moment, the only thing I could think of was how none of this would\u2019ve happened if I wasn\u2019t around in the first place. That night, I threw caution to the wind and attempted on my life. The rest of that night is a blur to me in all honesty. Aside from some nasty, painful cuts on my wrists, I\u2019m slowly healing.\n\nI\u2019ve been reflecting a lot on my relationship with Joe over the last few days, thinking back to the times we actually spent together face to face. Each time the same, me spending \u00a3130 to travel down to the other end of the country to see him, spending an extra \u00a330-40 on takeaways. The most he ever spent on me being \u00a320. I feel used and betrayed. I thought he loved me. I thought he genuinely loved me. but looking back on it, I realise I was nothing more than a cocksleeve to him. How he\u2019d always try and touch me up and use me. I never saw genuine love in his eyes, only lust. He only wanted the pictures I sent, the free deliveries i\u2019d buy him. I can\u2019t help but feel angry at myself for letting this go on for so long, for getting attached to this man I thought truly loved me. I just wish I would\u2019ve been smarter.\n\nTL;DR: A rough breakup with my ex almost cost me my life, I just wish he loved me as much as I loved him.",

    "selftext": "Growing up, I didn't have the good fortune of growing up in a well adjusted family. Multiple people in my family were toxic hot messes that never sought to improve their lives, or get appropriate therapy or find ways to remedy their own issues. I was always a kid who spoke my mind and who called out my toxic mums behavior and anyone around me. She would then tell everyone I was a disobedient problematic child, and other family or friends would reprimand me even though she was lying. She only wanted to destroy my reputation. She only did this to make sure she would \"shut me up\".... for good.\n\nMy dislike for people has grown because toxicity happens all over the world. Toxic people never having the awareness to get help or do better. When people say *\"MOST PEOPLE ARE GOOD PEOPLE\"*, that is a gotdamn lie. It's simply impossible in terms of how many people DON'T have basic **self awareness** and basic **emotional intelligence.** I loathe how people are incapable of empathizing with one another or working together to create change in a good way. \n\nI hate how people screw each other over in relationships through complete dishonesty/disregard for the other person. Cheating. Lying. Using and hurting the other person. Complete cruelty. Why??? It goes back to the very beginning of my post. Toxic parents. Toxic family. **Most people are NOT good people.** I've seen and experienced too many things to think differently at this point in life. \n\nI am irritated with how people are also **PASSIVE.** I mean, DAMN. The building I live in, management takes gross advantage of tenants. They constantly violate the terms of tenants leases, and then dare you to take actions to protect yourself. I live in a building of over 400 tenants, yet people only complain to each other about major issues and NEVER take real action to change their circumstances. It is not in me to sit and complain all day without taking action. I simply don't understand how people operate in life like this??!! Fully grown **adults** just sitting back and allowing the worst to happen to them or other people. I had my own situation to deal with concerning management. When I get angry, I get REALLY angry and I take very calculated extreme measures to remedy the problem quickly. Another tenant heard how I stood up to management and was in SHOCK.\n\nAll I thought was, \"WTF are you in shock about????\ud83d\ude12\" All I did was speak the truth, get a lawyer, and I followed through on creating boundaries and followed through on any threats if they stepped out of line. People have the same ability to stand up for themselves but they DON'T. They WON'T!!!!!\n\nA lady tenant in my building said, \"You seem intelligent\" Then proceeded to trauma dump all of her grievances about the building/management on to me. I asked her if she wanted to brainstorm solutions to fight the issues, or if she just wanted to *vent.* I basically told her I didn't want to hear it if all she wanted to do was complain and not DO anything. Then she got upset with me and started going off. **I'm a very solution oriented person** so complaining without a plan is counterproductive to me. I don't understand the blatant world of passivity people live in. \n\n**People will let human rights disasters happen right in front of them. They will allow the complete decline and fall of democracy. They will allow multiple entities to take advantage of them and literally do absolutely NOTHING to stop it.**\n\nSo, for the past 2 years now, I pretty much have been a recluse. I disappeared off of social media, I've stopped reaching out to people. And I don't care to socialize mostly at all. I'm just sick and tired of people. They are so entirely  disappointing. \n\nAnyone else feeling this way?",

I've only ever been with one woman who was my ex-wife and I got no particular comments about my size, but some remakes regarding her previous partners which contributed to me feeling insecure. I know I'm about average in length and perhaps slightly above average in girth, it's difficult to find facts about this. \n\nBut now suddenly this woman is scared and nervous of potential sex because she thinks it's too big. I was sure it was nothing to worry about and that it wasn't too big or anything. She said she is relatively small, but still. Me trying to convince her it's not that big made her feel like I was diminishing her fear. But I was simply so flabbergasted in what I was experiencing. Being insecure for the majority of my life to eventually not caring about size to now being told it's big. I feel as though my perception of reality is being distorted. Almost feel like she was lying just to make me feel good or something. \n\nThis might sound like a humble brag or whatever (bragging about an average penis lol), but truly, I am flabbergasted.

    "selftext": "For context I'm finishing up college. The last 2 months have been pretty wild for me. I got the courage to breakup with my now ex gf which younger me would've never imagined doing but I have no regrets. It took a couple weeks to fully recover because it was my first relationship and we had been together for over a year but now I couldn't be happier. In hindsight I put up with far more than I should of and my friends agree I made the right decision. There were still many times where I was at fault and I've reflected on that a lot too but it's great to know I wasn't crazy like I thought I was. Since then I've gotten out of my comfort zone a lot more and I'm doing things because I want to do them opposed to doing them for someone else or for some other reason that isn't reflective of who I want to be. This is big because I'm an introvert so getting out there can be challenging. I'm also in the process of quitting a horrible porn addiction. So far I've gone a over a week without looking at anything and I'm already seeing the positive effects. Obviously a week is nothing and I've tried quitting before but this time feels much different. Something just clicked one day and it feels so easy now. Even when I'm a little tempted it's easy for me to push back and say no which is something that have never happened to me. I don't think this has ever happened to me and I don't know the last time I've went this long without it but it feels great and that makes me want to keep working towards quitting for good. This is a throwaway and maybe I'll delete the post later or give an update in a couple years if I hold onto the account and if something significant happens in my life. I mainly wanted to get these thoughts out there",

    "selftext": "(TW: mentions of drug abuse, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts)\n\nFYI: the SH and suicidal thoughts have been absent for years, absolutely nothing graphic, I merely mention it for the sake of the rant\n\nI've been in this cycle for about 5 years now and I'm just now looking into reddit posts to feel seen. I suffered with a ton of depression from stress and anxiety in my early years of HS, and now I'm only a senior (18F). I'm quiet, reserved, and find it hard to connect with people because of it. The friends I do have make little time for me, no matter how much I try to plan, or just see me as an outlet for their problems. I don't at all mind helping out my friends, but when it's constant, it's just so draining. I've always been known for letting people walk on me with how obsequious I become around people I care about, but it's so painfully obvious they don't hold me to as high of a regard. I feel like it's making me more irritable as a person, which in turn pushes others away from me. I don't mean to, but I just find myself snapping at people more often and feel way more defensive than I used to. I also can't seem to talk about my problems, and when I try, I immediately break down. It just feels impossible to go a day without crying when I'm constantly stuck in my own head.\n\nI feel like I can barely eat more than 1,000 calories a day, and I'm about 43 kg and it's only going down. My parents notice, but they've stopped commenting on it. I don't eat when I work long shifts, and I can feel how hungry I am, but it's like my body just suppresses the hunger. I've been relying on THC just to get through the day, and it became a replacement for the depression and SH. I'm almost three and a half years clean of SH now, but it doesn't feel great knowing that I \"fixed\" it by replacing it. I went cold turkey and stopped smoking only three days ago, but it seems to get easier with every day and I hope I can keep it up. I clearly can't use drugs responsibly right now, and the experience is far from fun. But I'm going to see if I can break myself out of this. I'm trying to change my life around in hopes that maybe my anxiety will become more manageable. Switching jobs to start fresh, picking up therapy again, and just trying to focus on myself. I leave for my new job in two weeks, and my therapy starts next week.\n\nThis time, I'm going into therapy with a positive mindset, so maybe they can help me through this. I really want to get better, and hopefully find someone besides a therapist or my notes app to confide in. I know that I can't just wait around for someone to save me, because I have to save myself, but doing this alone is hard. I've been far from suicidal for a while, and I don't think it will ever have a hold on me like it did back then, but I wish it wasn't so difficult to reach the end of the tunnel. It took me so long to get where I am today, and I don't want to lose the momentum I have and let this bullshit win. I just hope that the independence I'll finally be granted in the future will contribute to that.\n\n",

    "selftext": "I F[17] can't stand my mom anymore. (Burner account just in case) This is a long post do forgive me. There's a lot of background. \n\nFor years, I feel like it's been an endless competition with her. Especially when I hit the age of dating. My mom had me when she was 17 (it's relevant don't worry) and her and my dad lived together. I don't remember much from my early childhood but I do remember one significant memory and that was of them fighting and me yelling for them to stop. I was maybe 5 at the time. Either way they split up. Of course, she blames it on him. My dad had gotten custody over me throughout kindergarten-first grade before my mom got me back. She basically says he kidnapped me. Which, I'm to the age where I'm not sure who's lying and don't bother to care. Both my parents are pretty shitty. But I'd rather live with my mom than my dad. Now, my mom has obviously played the victim card when it comes to anything about the past with my dad. Which she still does heavily today. She has bragged to me about always getting what she wants in the end. Remember this! \nWhen my mom had my brother, we moved into a house. My stepdad was always gone for work and she was pretty much known for bringing guys in. Anytime I'd ask her about them, she'd make up an excuse. I unfortunately heard her doing sexual activities with a guy and she told me he was gay and probably was just watching something on the TV. And with her friend and her husband. There was always something. Then, once we moved again after she had my sister, it just turned into her going to and me not seeing her till 8 am. No text. No call. And I couldnt manage getting the kids up and ready for school while also getting myself to school as I was 12-15 and honestly, was fine with staying home. Cuz that's what happened anytime she'd be out like that, id stay home. And at one point our phones were shut off and I couldn't contact anyone. My stepdad and her are pretty much known for being incapable. They both fuck around while being married, tell people they are divorced, etc. I've had to go thru his phone for my mom so that she could have access to that stuff. Not shit I wanted to see btw... But she thinks we're close. She vents to me, complains, yaps, etc. like we're friends and not mother and daughter. Which is fine but shit. Sometimes too much is too much. To top it off there's points where I won't eat some days because I get forgotten about. When I had COVID for a week, I ate maybe once a day. We didn't used to fight so much until I got with my current boyfriend. Who for preference has been nothing but kind to me. She has had a record with trying to disrupt my relationships. \nI was dating a girl years ago and my mom flipped out because she say a video on my phone of the girls mom drinking whiskey from a cup. The father and another adult was there, not drinking. And we ended up having to break up because she threw such a fit. If course her parents felt horrible. But were still friends and she's basically forgot about it. (She's a bartender and will give me alcohol or whatever she's making so... Do with that as you will.)\nAnother case was multiple times in my ex's relationship. We dated for about 3 years and when when we were 14, we were stupid and sent not so cute texts that she found. She told me that my biological dad had hacked into my shit, found the texts, and was going to file a report on him. Scared us shitless and my ex stopped talking to me for a bit. But ofc time passed and nothing happened. She completely ignored the fact that he cheated on me, broke up with me multiple times for whatever reason, etc. and allowed that to slide without batting an eye until I finally broke up with him. Ironic.\n \nWell, I got with my current boyfriend  almost a year ago. He's been the kindest person ever and I've never complained about him to her. We're LD (he lives 5 hours away) and so our first meeting up was last August. Things went pretty smoothly because his mom was with him. Well, he's come 2 other times outside of that. October, and December. October was a rough fucking patch because this is where my mom loses her shit. She thought it'd be a good idea to text my bf through a private number and tell him I was cheating on him. She literally personafied herself as a mystery guy from my school and described my body to him so that he'd believe it. She took pictures of my undergarments with condoms (just opened) to make it seem believable. And also relayed my previous days schedule with him. How did we find out it was her? At the time I had her camera roll synced to my phone. She didn't know prior because we had done it in 2022 after my grandma passed away. (Also how I found out she was sending nudes to guys INCLUDING my bio dad bc we'd talk about it and find out which ones he got etc.) But either way, I matched up her taking those pictures to the ones she was sending him as this \"guy\". Our big clue before his was the picture she sent him of a cropped out bloody backseat bc \"he\" claimed to have popped my cherry in the back of his truck. We confronted the number and they basically freaked out and said that it was the nextdoor neighbor I had talked to for a bit. He came up with a ridiculous excuse. But I could differentiate the style between the kid she blamed it on (he talked ganglish) and her texts. Very obvious. I blew up on her that night, demanding her phone, showing her the deleted screenshots, textnow app, etc. she still claims it wasnt her. Keep in mind she did this the week before my bf was supposed to come see me. We still don't know what her goal was. I think it was jealousy . Her marriage isn't exactly love filled. It pretty much got swept under the rug but it caused resentment for my bfs mom and a lot of other people towards her. But, he did come see me and it was fine for the most part. \n\nBoth trips he's come by himself, she's always tired to make up and excuse as to why it won't work. \"We have plans. Idk what we're doing. You can't stay here this long. Etc etc.\" we never do anything. We don't have the money to. So I know it was bs. He came anyways bc it \"magically\" worked out and nothing happened.\n\nWell, he was supposed to come see me for Spring break, which is next week. I told her two months ago that he planned to come. She even recommended a different hotel. And I thought that was that, and it was pretty much solid as it normal had been. I reminded her yesterday and she starts freaking out saying she didn't know about this and that it wasnt possible. My stepdad is gone till May working and she has decided to take a government job which has orientation on Friday. Just found that out maybe 3 days ago. She's irritated, telling me this wasn't going to work and that he couldn't come because she can't have us be alone at the house for 10 hours because she doesn't have a schedule. Of course, I'm upset. My bfs already taken his vacation days off for he year which he can't get back, and booked the rental. He's mad. His mom's frustrated but trying to help us. My mom thinks it's weird that they keep bringing up my age (bug factor of why he can't be here?) etc. she also just is so upset at the fact that his mom doesn't like her and starts being petty saying that if she won't talk to her, then my bf can't be coming down. So panic sets in.\nI get through today, come home, she's sitting outside. I don't say anything to her when I walk inside after school. She takes it as a silent treatment. She comes in, talks to me, I talk back. Not ignoring her. She tells me she's emailed and asked to push orientation back till April. And she's being real guilt trippy about it. I'm upset all over, crying because I don't want to wait 6 months to see my bf, getting mad because she's accusing me of not discussing anything and never telling her anything, etc. you should seen her when she found out my plans when i graduate... While yes, I may have had a bit of an attitude, I feel that with all this shit, I have a valid reason to be. Every break, every WEEK, I'm stuck watching her kids, cooped up in this house without a license, without many friends, with no job (because she can't be reliable), etc. So yes, I probably did have an attitude. But I'm tired, my motivation and basically the only thing that would get me through the rest of my junior year has basically ripped from me. And I'm not happy. I've been fed up with being here for awhile and have looked at getting emancipated but atp, it's better to just wait it out unfortunately. But I've also heard the things shes said to his mom (who's entirely on my side??) and she basically made me out to be a spoiled brat, saying she should stick to her gut about him not seeing me and that I'm acting out and if I get what I want (this trip) then it'll just prove that I can get whatever I want by acting out. I've never crashed out unless it's a good reason. Anyone that knows me, knows this. Another note, both me and my mom have BPD. She takes shit seriously, and if she thinks someone's mad at her, the world is ending. She also projects. Bad. Now, back to what I said earlier about me always getting what I want if I act out, doesn't that sound familiar? Anyways... I'm not sure what to do and she hasn't talked to me since our conversation from earlier. But I don't know when I'll see my bf again because of his work and my school. Wasn't planning for it to be 6 months which is what the minimum will be. And I wasn't mentally prepared for this. Especially during exam week. It sucks because we used to be so close and now I can't look at her the same. But no matter what she's done, I can't help but feel guilty for being angry with her. It's always been that way. I just want to get out truthfully \ud83d\ude2d. I think that's it but if I forgot anything, I'll edit this post. I'll also update on the status of him even getting to see me next week. I hope I'm not just being a dramatic teen on all of this.",

    "selftext": "Hello, I (21F) am looking for advice. Every day for past few years, I have been very apathetic. I feel \"dead inside\" as some say. I find no joy, excitement or hope in anything anymore and I do not know why. The past few years when our family went on our annual beach vacation, I felt no excitement, which I usually would when I was younger- but I feel nothing. The last time that I have truly felt happy was at age 12. I have almost no physical energy either, and very low stamina. I recently went to the doctor to address this and all of the bloodwork and tests came back perfect. It is hard to explain, but I don't feel sad, I just feel like a zombie going through the motions. I see some say \"enjoy the little things\" or \"enjoy the journey\" but I don't feel anything to enjoy.\nYou can read context about my current life and my life growing up below.\nAn issue that I have every day, is that I try to squeeze every ounce of time and turn it into something \"productive\". I struggle with procrastination because sometimes I do not want to focus on my goals. One of my to-dos is to write a journal about my life to remember the times when I did feel something, and because I have noticed a decline in my memory. I wish I could get my to-dos done, because I tell myself \"you can live life when you get this done\", but I have been trying for years to get the list done.\nAnother problem is that when I try to sit down and be with my thoughts in silence, and try to listen to my \u201cinner voice\u201d, my mind can't focus. Because of this, I don't know what I want in life, I don't know anything at this point. I watch self-help YT videos like \"getting your life together\", \"how to be more productive with your time\", \"how to know if your goals\nare from a place of self-love or self-hate\"\netc. Right now, I need to know what I want in life, because I have to decide on a degree to\nfurther my education (I graduate soon with a Business degree) because this current degree is not going to cut it. All I know right now is that I want a job that has a flexible schedule, remote and decent pay. All of these motivators are extrinsic, I have no idea which job is right for me and it is overwhelming with all of these career choices that I have no interest in. The only interest that has been consistent throughout my life is being an artist (traditional painter) but that isn't realistic and not many people become successful enough to make it their full-time job.\nAnother thing that I am wondering is why I have no empathy for others, and I only think about myself- not sure if I was born this way, but I don't remember ever having empathy.\nWhat I have noticed is that since I don't feel anything inside, when I talk to people, it feels forced like I have to put on a smile because I feel nothing. Even when I talk to my 2 friends, it is fake enthusiasm. I am okay with having only 2 friends though because sometimes it feels like having friends is a chore since I have to fake my emotions.\nI am a people-pleaser, I have trouble telling people \"no\" and end up doing things that I don't want to do. When people describe me, they say that I am a great listener, but it is because I feel guilty when I do talk about myself. Many have said that I am really humble, talented, and all of the good things. I know that I am a good person, I know that much. I hate to be the center of attention, which might be a reason why I don't like to talk about myself.\n\nFor some context in my current life, I have a loving family and we all love and care for one another. I have wonderful sisters, both of my parents and a little brother. My family is the greatest, we are really close-knit and hug each other good morning, good night-that type of family. We go on an annual beach vacation and my mom makes us all food and life is great and I know just how fortunate I am in life, truly. I never thought that I had a bad life- I am just wondering why I have such a fortunate life and I feel almost no emotion. There has been times where I thought my life was boring but that is it.\nA typical day in the life of mine would be that I wake up and feed my dog, greet my family, make breakfast while chatting with family, go to my room to do school or work on my art, later make some lunch, might walk on the treadmill for cardio, sit outside to soak up some sun (if it is not cold) and do something productive out there, then come in for dinner, family meetup, might play a video game with my brother or watch a movie with a sister, then get ready for bed and meditate, plan out the next day (what my tasks are or goal to complete), pet my dog and go to sleep. Throughout the day, I will check my phone sometimes, and scroll youtube or instagram in my distraction. A few times a week, my grandma and I call and talk too.\nI have instagram because I have an art account where I post my paintings (in hopes of creating an audience to sell to) but I rarely use instagram to look at other's lives. Sometimes I catch myself comparing my body to others, but I mainly look at other art. I create traditional art to pass the time and simply because I do still find peace in creating art. I still find the feeling of inspiration when it comes to nature, like plants, landscapes and the beauty of wildlife. I listen to music, I love my classic rock and 70s music, so I guess that is some sliver of emotion.\nI switched to a whole foods diet in hopes that I would see improved energy, but the main reason I started eating healthy was to change my body and get rid of some fat that I have around my midsection and legs (I am small though, at 112 lbs) so I could stop being so self-conscious every single day. After 9 months on this diet, I feel absolutely no difference or boost in physcial energy at all which is disappointing.\nMy current social life is almost non-existent, but I am okay with that I think (Again, I don't know what I want in life). I am an introvert or \"homebody\". I don\u2019t have trouble keeping a conversation going and I am not shy when I do talk to people though. I have a part time job in childcare where I interact directly with people and that is fine, other than that, I have 2 friends. \n\nIf I had to guess, I would say that simply realizing that life is just \"get a job that sucks the least, do that job for decades, retire, then die\", my obsession with \"being productive\", my body dysmorphia, and maybe something else contributed in a mixture to my apathy?\n\nHere is some context growing up if anyone wants to read:\nAs a child, I had a spark for life as many do. I was obsessed with reading about wildlife, wanting to know everything about animals and dinosaurs and this continued from age 6 until about age 11. I loved to learn- the local library and the zoo were my favorite places growing up. Age 6 is when I developed my passion for creating art and drawing the animals that I was learning about. I wanted to be a veterinarian due to my love for animals when I grew up. I had no trouble making friends in school, I was never bullied, my friends were awesome and I had many of them. My grandparents would bring me every year on a road trip to a different state. And overall, I had a wonderful, THE BEST childhood ever. After the 4th grade, our family switched to homeschooling which is another discussion. When I turned 11, I was given my first tablet. For the first 2 years of having one, I only played mobile games on it and watched youtube sometimes but it was to watch an animal documentary or something educational. When I turned 13, I \"grew out\" of this, and started bed-rotting on Youtube, mindlessly scrolling and watching videos like people telling storytimes. I was no longer interested in learning about animals. I think homeschooling definitely exacerbated this because we were home all the time. In the same year, I became extremely self-conscious of myself, I hated the way I looked and I was compared to my cousin who is 1 year younger than me all the time (growing up, we were like sisters, and she was my best friend for years). I became jealous of her looks and how everyone would compliment her curly golden hair, she had so many friends (After being homeschooled, I didn't have a lot of friends anymore), she was beautiful and I wondered how the \"awkward phase\" didn't seem to affect her. I think that this had something to do with my self-conscious ways that have not left since I turned 13. This and my introduction to the internet and seeing everyone's opinions on everything. Fast forward to COVID, and for the first few months, I enjoyed it. Not having to go anywhere, staying inside the house was perfect for an introvert but it wasn't fun anymore after a few months. 2 months after COVID and my grandpa dies, which I really really think affected me, I don't know how, but it probably did. I started getting these depressive episodes that would last sometimes a day or two which was completely out of the norm. In these episodes, I would just wonder why I was here, every day is the same, those kind of thoughts. I would completely dissociate from life it seemed. Luckily, I have not had one of those episodes in about 2 years, which is great.\n\nANY ADVICE is appreciated, thank you.\n\nTLDR: I have a great life, and I used to have a love for life from birth until age 12. Now at 21, I feel like a zombie going through the motions. I physically have little energy, despite the doctor\u2019s tests coming back fine. I feel like I have to fake my emotions in any social setting and I am wondering why I feel this way at my age.",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I received a Snapchat request from someone I didn\u2019t recognize. They wouldn\u2019t tell me who they were right away, only that they had \u201cfeelings for me\u201d and talked about how they admired me .  The first message they ever sent me was creepy it was \u201cI know you see me just like I see you, but I'm not ready to step out of the shadows yet.\nNeither are you I know you're a private person, but there's something about you that pulls me in every time, even from a distance.\nI'm someone you know, but I can't say who I am yet. Just know that I see you in a way that's deeper than you might imagine bye l'm\nBlocking you \u201cAt first, I didn\u2019t think much of it. I thought maybe it was just some random person who had seen my profile and was curious. But as the messages continued, they started to feel... strange. The person was saying things that made me uncomfortable\u2014things that made it clear they were watching me. They would mention things from my life that only someone who really knew me would know, and it started to feel like I was being stalked. And to be clear I\u2019m 19 and I never had a boyfriend never had my first kiss was homeschooled and moved into a new city so no friends either .\nThey kept texting me for weeks, sometimes daily, and I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something was off. But I was curious. I didn\u2019t want to seem paranoid, so I kept responding, hoping maybe they\u2019d reveal who they were soon. They kept saying they wanted to \"talk\" and that they had a lot to say, but I kept putting it off. Honestly, I was scared. I knew this wasn\u2019t just a random person\u2014it felt like they were trying to make me comfortable, only to reveal something I wasn\u2019t ready for. It was only after I was pretending to enjoy talking to him and after months of cryptic messages, the person told me their identity. When I saw the name pop up, I felt my stomach drop. It was someone I knew my entire life. Someone I thought I could trust. Someone who had been a constant presence in my life.\nIt was my uncle.\nI was in shock. How could this be happening? Everything started to make sense the way he told me who he was was unsettling he said he thought I was ready to know who he was and said he\u2019d share a memory we\u2019d had together and it\u2019d all click for me. He said \u201cSushi express\u201d I was confused, a memory popped up but I thought no way so I asked him to give me a more specific one he then said \u201csushi express failure \u201c my heart dropped. Cause the only memory I thought of was when my uncle would take me to eat sushi express for a series of times sometimes with his wife and sometimes with just me and my brother and one day we went to a new sushi express place and we went in and we didn\u2019t like the place and walked out I had always known him as someone close to the family, someone I saw regularly. I had known him for as long as I could remember. But now, it all started to make sense\u2014his strange behavior, all the hints that he gave me, the manipulative comments. It was him the whole time.\nBut that wasn\u2019t all. The first day he added me on Snapchat, the day he first reached out to me, was also his birthday. And that detail, looking back, felt like a punch to the gut. Why did he choose that day? Was it planned? Was it a way to manipulate me even further?\nThe more I thought about everything, the more the horrible truth hit me: This wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d crossed boundaries with me. When I was a child, he sexually assaulted me everyday for I don\u2019t even remember how long.I buried those memories for so long, told myself I was just being dramatic, that it didn\u2019t matter. But now, the pieces were falling into place. He had been trying to manipulate me all along, using this new online persona to control me.\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to do. I knew I had to tell someone, so I went to my aunts\u2014his sisters(I didn\u2019t tell my mom cause she was pregnant and i didn\u2019t want to stress her). I thought they\u2019d be my allies, that they\u2019d stand up for me. I told them everything, and I expected them to act. I expected them to confront him, to take some kind of action. At first, they seemed supportive. They promised they would confront him, that they wouldn\u2019t let him get away with it.\nBut as the weeks passed, nothing happened. Not even a word from them. One aunt sent me a voice message explaining that she had been thinking about confronting him, but she still hadn\u2019t done it. She kept saying that she needed to find the right moment, that she didn\u2019t want to approach him too suddenly. Meanwhile, I\u2019m left here, feeling like I\u2019ve been forgotten, waiting for someone to help me while he\u2019s out there, still living his life without consequences.\nShe said things like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to catch him off guard,\u201d and, \u201cI\u2019m trying to think about how to say it so he\u2019ll actually listen.\u201d It felt like she was more worried about his feelings than about what he did to me. She even told me she wanted to talk to him privately, at her house, where she thought it would be \u201ccalm,\u201d but weeks have gone by, and nothing has happened. It\u2019s like no one is taking me seriously, and I\u2019m just expected to keep waiting.\nI\u2019m done waiting. I\u2019m done feeling like I have to justify myself to anyone. He thinks he can get away with this, and he probably feels like I\u2019m too shy or quiet to speak up. He\u2019s wrong. The next time I see him, I\u2019m going to make it clear that I\u2019m not afraid anymore. I\u2019m not going to pretend everything is okay. I don\u2019t care if he feels uncomfortable. He doesn\u2019t get to control the narrative anymore.\nI\u2019m done with the silence. I\u2019m done hoping that someone else will fix this for me. I\u2019m going to take control of my own story, no matter what. He doesn\u2019t have power over me anymore. The truth is enough.(There\u2019s so many other details that I thought were too much to add but lmk if yall wanna know )",

    "selftext": "I have been dating and living with my GF for 2.5 years, both in our 40's. About 9 months into our relationship I started seeing some red flags. I went to a funeral away from home, I had been gone for less than a week when she called and blew up on me about not calling her sooner. I was there for the funeral of a woman who was my 2nd Mom, she told me she would be better off with her ex or dead than with me. It really crushed me. I decided we needed a break and she ended up coming we got back together, no apology from her.\n\nThe past 2 years have been tumultuous. I have taken my time on lots of things but anything I do is met with intense screaming and the most insane rage fits you can imagine. Throwing stuff, breaking walls. Its insane. If I go away for work, I don't love her and am cheating, if I go visit my child in another state, even worse.\n\nI went to visit 2.5 weeks ago and the 2nd night I was here was just hell. 2 hours of her telling me I'm a pos, all I do is hurt her, I'm a horrible man, I suck. That Friday she told me if I didn't come back Saturday or I break up with her, she'd take revenge, another huge red flag. \n\nOn to today, I called her, if I don't I'm a pos. She starts asking wtf do I want, I told her well if I don't call you get mad. We started sort of talking and she said are you going to be back tomorrow? I told her probably not, she then proceeded to say, verbatim, \"If you do not come back, I will destroy your entire family.\"\n\nThis shocked me. I made my mind up then and there that we are done, I her that is it. She then said are you serious, you could have came back and have a fresh start, but yet the whole time I'm gone it has been \"I'm going to make you pay for hurting me and will put you through hell.\" \n\nI know she was manipulating me, but I really love her. I still do. When she isn't angry, she is the best woman I know. I feel so guilty to end it. I've spent all night crying.  It just sucks.",

    "selftext": "I (28F) met a sort of colleague (21M) this week at a work conference, we both work for the same parent company but come from separate sister companies. We went out as a big group at the end of the second night for drinks and one of his coworkers (F, not sure on age, maybe 40) was telling me all about him and how he was single, I of course think \u201cwell this is great\u201d because he sounds like an absolute freaking sweetheart. Spoiler alert: he indeed is. I could feel his eyes on me for the rest of the night, we chatted some, when a few of us left to go back to the hotel we were at across the street, we linked arms. Hugged in the elevator with a few flirty back touches, held hands in the hall as he walked me to my room. Nothing happened beyond that, I had already decided nothing would as we both had been drinking and while we were completely lucid, it wouldn\u2019t have been right. We briefly chatted the next day (which was the last day), I had also messaged him via Teams to thank him a little while after we separated for the night because it was really sweet that he made sure I got \u201chome\u201d (as he called it) safe. I haven\u2019t had anyone do that for me before. Now I have a gigantic crush on someone I really barely know, I followed him on LinkedIn and he viewed my profile but that\u2019s it. Do I just leave it now? I don\u2019t want to come across as weird, I found him on instagram and debated following him but I am suspecting that will be too far. I just want to get to know him more but does it seem like that ship has sailed? I\u2019ve never had my head twisted up like this before. It\u2019s a bizarre feeling.

Because growing up abused can do that to some ppl so I had to prove my sincerity. I was always interested in the him. And I wanted him to be interested in me. I was very loyal. Some questionsble stuff happened but trusted him but I was still loyal to him. I don't know what he was really doing. We aren't 'official' it's a technicality but I was still loyal. \r\n\r\nI knew it like you but I didn't know how much. You would come over all the time and it's been a lot of time together. We we play video games and fool around every once in awhile but there is really no official talk on whether to date or not. I was in love with him still but I didn't know if he felt the same way. He was the type to bottle up his emotions and when the time was right boom all the emotions came out at once.\r\n\r\nIt's those tender times when ppl get very honest. He was sweet and I enjoyed what we were doing. But nothing compelled him to say I love you, so I was hurt. I mean you're with somebody you love and you enjoy what you're doing I feel the natural tendency is to tell them you love them. But everybody is different. I think there was an ample opportunity for him to tell me how he felt about me. Something tangible, something concrete. Something I could hear. That's all I wanted to hear. \r\n\r\nI've said before in other relationships it's after everything was over. I'm usually tears because everything was so intense but I knew deep down in my heart that I love them. Saying I love you are powerful words and I don't ever say then lightly. I have to know it before I say it. So it means a lot for me. It's a moment of pure vulnerability.\r\n\r\nI was just hurt for a long while. It just caused me to grow quiet with depression. I kept thinking I love this man. And I know he loves me too, I think. Him saying I love you became a tug of war. It's was a competition. An iron will to not say it. Yeah, we're kind of stubborn. It's fun for like a week but it it continues you just lose all hope. I should have asked him but I know if you're not compelled to say it on your own or you'll feel pressured. I wanted him to spontaneously say it. Just cut the environment with a knife. \r\n\r\nI still love him. And I would totally try again if he came and asked me. But it seems like he has moved. And I'm sad. I'm very broken up but him leaving. I don't chase and I don't beg. I look to Mel Robbins for advice, and she says, 'If they want to leave Let Them'. It's his decision so I just have to accept it. I think about him everyday, all the time. And I can't help but wonder if he really does love. I think I'll always wonder. I know I would never marry and I would become an Old Maid and sadly, being romantic, I would wait forever for him to tell me it loves me.\r\n",

    "selftext": "I don't know how to do a mood spoiler but potentially very triggering, sorry I just don't know what else to do\n\nMy (26F now) first suicide attempt was at 10. Got (in my opinion, MIS-)diagnosed and put on meds and placed in therapy. Cool, maybe this will help? Hated the way meds made me feel. Second suicide attempt at 16. Inpatient mental health, more meds, more psyche appointments. \n\nMy mom  was my rock through it all, she suffered with her own mental health struggles through her life, but that motivated her not have me go through the pain she experienced growing up. She was my best friend and roll model. While i was in the psyche ward and during her visitation, just seeing her cry over me wanting to end my own life really changed something in me.\n\nI poured everything into truly trying to want to live. regular therapy, meds, CBT, group sessions; everything.\n\nMy next attempt was at 20. I barely remember it, but what I'm told, it's the closest I got.\n\nThrew myself back into therapy. More meds that made me feel worse. After now 10 years of therapy and medicine after medicine, I was so over it and so sick of it. Sick of it all and the whole process. I learned all the stupid techniques and mind tricks and there was always a barrier because I knew if I said the wrong thing they'd send me back to inpatient. \n\nHonestly, for a while, I was doing good. I was using the healthy thinking tricks and all that jazz.\n\nThen my mom died.\n\nSuicide is a permanent solution to an impermanent problem? false. The state of problems is constant and i just want it to stop.\n\nI've been fighting my whole life to want to live, I'm just so tired of fighting to cling to a life I don't even want. \n\nI'm barely even going through the motions anymore. At this point I hope I just get hit by a train or something. Did you know most successful suicides involve firearms but most women chose poison / OD?\n\nNo one in my life knows it's this bad. They know I'm hurt, and depressed, but they don't know how deeply it goes and there's no way I'm going to make them suffer like I am\n\nI want to believe things can get better. But at this point the only way way i see a better future is with no future at all.",

    "selftext": "I (22F) broke up with my (20M) bf yesterday\u2026 I know it\u2019s a long read, hopefully my writing skills are engaging enough!!! \n  \nFor the last 1.5 weeks my bfs family has been visiting. \nFirstly, I got into a discussion with him, his sister(Bella), and his friend(Jack) earlier in the week. During which Bella called me a bitch, saying that she doesn\u2019t trust me, that I\u2019m disrespectful to her, and her entire family, and that I\u2019m manipulative towards her brother. She has a history of getting wayyy too involved in our relationship, this I\u2019ve talked to my bf about multiple times. Even his friend Jack started ganging up on my bf and I. They both stated that they get extremely uncomfortable when him and I are around each other and can\u2019t stand when we are at all physical with each-other. Oh btw Bella started f**** Jack about 3 weeks ago (who is my bfs roommate, even though bf has stated how it makes him feel betrayed and like he\u2019s going to lose Jack) She has ruined multiple previous friendships of his due to her sleeping with his best friends and dumping them. (This convo was the first time I had heard any of this from Bella or Jack) After the convo, I tried to express to her that we should talk more to try and resolve things so there is no animosity, despite the convo not going well. (Btw my bf never protected me in that argument what so ever and never called his sister or friend out at all, even after I talked to him about it) \n  Continuing forward I felt uncomfortable around the entire family (I regularly felt left out, or treated as if I don\u2019t exist, and often ignored even before this) I clearly stated this to my bf and there wasn\u2019t much said on his end other than sorry. For the next few days I felt alone for the most part and started to emotionally detach to protect myself, I made sure to let my bf know. I reached out to him multiple times afterwards to tell him how I felt, almost everyday, I asked for his support and how I felt he wasn\u2019t protecting me. I told him it is his responsibility to make me feel safe with his family. He insisted that I come hang with his family, leaving me felt unheard and ignored, knowing that I\u2019m uncomfortable around them at this point 100%. I wanted him to set boundaries with his sister, his friend and his family so that we can just have a happy relationship and worry about our own issues. A few nights ago, his mom said she wants to have a chat with everyone. Instantly I did not want to go. I talked to my parents about it and thought \u201cmaybe I should see what they have to say\u2026\u201d mistake\u2026 my bfs parents were instigating the entire convo, bringing up things I\u2019ve done in the past in MY relationship like falling asleep on my bfs couch while he wasn\u2019t there (one time, and my car was stuck in the snow at that time) His mom and dad attacked me, saying \u201cYou\u2019re not his roommate, you don\u2019t need to be there if he\u2019s not) \n  Furthermore she said\u201d The last few times I\u2019ve seen you, you look unhappy, with no joy in your eyes, you look stressed.\u201d His dad said \u201cdon\u2019t hinder him, don\u2019t be tied down to him at all.\u201d And stating \u201cif you guys are arguing or have any negativity now it\u2019s only going to get worse.\u201d Also attacking my bf saying there is something wrong with him because he feels anger sometimes. I told his mom that I need boundaries, she said, \u201c If everyone is just nice to each other you don\u2019t need boundaries.\u201d So, that night after that convo, I felt awfully attacked, my bf said he was going to come over to my place before that convo, so afterwards I said okay I\u2019m ready to go. He said he can\u2019t go because his mom wouldn\u2019t give him permission and it would make his dad unhappy\u2026  To make this situation worse they all just moved into new apartments (my bf, Jack, and Bella) where they live next door to each other\u2026\n  In the end I told him that I needed him to prioritize our relationship and protect me. And that I deserve to be his best friend\u2026 not put on the back burner. I felt I had already tried to tell him so many times how I felt with his family that it\u2019s better to be a short and sweet reasoning. ",

    "selftext": "2 months ago I did the LifeAlert Limbo and fell down the stairs like a granny. Terribly embarrassing, but it was significantly worse when I realized I was going to puke. I had gone from vertical to horizontal in record time, smacking my head with a couple hundred pounds of force about 5 times while I did some carpet sledding down the stairs.\n\nThankfully, my wife knew right away I probably had a head injury but also knew that there wasn't shit that the ER could do unless I had signs of a brain bleed (I did not, and she works in the ED and knows they would just give me tylenol and call it good). She monitored me closely and I woke up the next day in denial, feeling...off. She didn't believe me that I said I was fine, but I really insisted it and would not entertain the idea of going to see the doctor. Looking back on it, my reasoning was seriously impaired and I had suspicions that the doctors were evil somehow. It gets worse.\n\nI would describe it as almost being in a paranoid nightmare. I was determined that nothing had happened and I was overreacting (because that's what my parents would've said). I dropped everyone off and went to work like normal, getting madder and madder at various people for imaginary/small slights, mostly for no reason at all. I started to spiral into a delusion that people were plotting against me and I was stuck in fight or flight mode all day. It got worse on the second day when I was working from home and I caught myself writing an angry email.\n\nI had this horrifying moment of clarity. Wait, that's not my writing. That's not me. That's not something I would ever do. This deep sense of dread overtook my whole body and I knew I had to confess my fears to my wife.\n\nI remember when I went downstairs and she thought I was having a stroke. I babbled something about \"concussion\" and \"tell my boss I need a break for a bit\" and honestly...it's a huge blank past that point for weeks after.\n\nWhat I heard from other people was that I went to the doctor and they confirmed I did manage to have quite a concussion, bordering on moderate TBI because I had impaired speech, memory, eye focus, coordination, etc. Because I had gone about those two stressful days just as hard as I normally do, that did major damage that set me back for weeks at least.\n\nI lost memory from December-half of February. It's just gone. I only suffer the consequences of whatever deranged nonsense I was up to during that time.\n\nI was unable to read or write without help or profound effort for...a while. Not sure how long. I was definitely totally unable to drive safely as I forgot how to judge distance, speed, and how hard to push the accelerator.\n\nI went to a specialized TBI clinic and they confirmed that there's not really anything you can do except rest and participate in physical therapy to learn how to use your body again. They said it was a \"functional injury\" rather than a \"structural injury\" so we don't have high enough resolution scans or some shit. I just wanted something. ANYTHING. Nope, just painkillers and lots of rest.\n\n\"Rest\" was agonizing. Being in the darkness with nothing but silence was actual torture. It made it worse, but I craved some kind of stimulation to keep me out of my paranoid and angry thoughts. I spent way too much time working and on screens. So much more than I should have. It kept setting me back. It kept causing me pain, but it was better than feeling alone, isolated, and psychotic.\n\nI had to relearn how to move my body because my body felt like a mech suit I was controlling remotely. My senses felt distant and unfamiliar. My eyes followed their orders as if they were suggestions, not commands.\n\nMy emotional regulation and impulse control reduced to that of my toddler. When he would scream, I wanted to as well even though I used to be cool as a cucumber. When he would flip shit, I had to go storm off not to overreact. I couldn't stop myself from inhaling half a box of Oreos merely because they were there.\n\nThere's so much more but my eye and brain stamina aren't keeping up right now. I will say that I think I'm at 80% now. My speech is mostly normal and my coordination is almost back. I suddenly remembered how to drive a couple weeks ago. The main struggle is overall stamina and sensitivity to light/noise. If I push too hard, I will get a migraine or throw up. But until that point--I'm nearing normal again.\n\nI attribute a good chunk of my recovery to the fact I have been continuing low-dose ketamine therapy. I have a quarter to half of my typical dose and I suddenly get a big jump in progress a day or two after. Makes a lot of sense because its whole thing is neurogenesis but WOW this is an under-researched area. I got called a pioneer for merely having the balls to see what would happen :D\n\nLife lesson: don't be me",

    "selftext": "Imagine trying to brush your hair, but your hand won\u2019t cooperate. Imagine trying to cook a simple meal, but every movement turns into a painful challenge. Imagine loving art, music, or any other hobby, but every attempt reminds you that your body doesn\u2019t function the way it should. These aren\u2019t just passing moments\u2014this is my life with Erb\u2019s Palsy.\n\nDaily Challenges: The Simplest Things Become a Battle\n\nEvery morning when I wake up, the first thing I face is pain. Not just mild discomfort, but a sharp, electric pain that sometimes jolts me out of my sleep. The stiffness and weakness in my arm make even the simplest tasks\u2014getting dressed, tying my hair\u2014exhausting and time-consuming.\n\nCooking, for example, isn\u2019t just a fun activity for me; it\u2019s a test of patience and endurance. Chopping vegetables, holding pots, or even just stirring a pan can be tiring and painful. Every task requires planning, adaptation, and a new trick to overcome the obstacles my body puts in my way.\n\nPity\u2026 The Feeling That Bothers Me More Than Pain\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing I hate more than the pain itself, it\u2019s the pity in people\u2019s eyes. There\u2019s nothing more frustrating than seeing that look of \u201cpoor you\u201d or hearing the unnecessary sympathy in their voices.\n\nFor example, I love video games, but I rarely tell people that I play. Why? Because I know what happens next. As soon as they find out I have Erb\u2019s Palsy, their behavior changes. They start making things easier for me, avoiding real competition, treating me like I need special kindness. That\u2019s not what I want. I don\u2019t want to win anything out of pity\u2014I want to be treated like everyone else, judged by my actual abilities, not my disability.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just an occasional experience; it happens in almost every social interaction. Even when people don\u2019t say anything, I can see it in their faces\u2014they feel sorry for me, as if my life is over. But the truth is, I\u2019m living my life in my own way. I don\u2019t need their pity to remind me of what I already know.\n\nThe Psychological Toll: More Than Just Physical Pain\n\nMany assume that the hardest part of Erb\u2019s Palsy is the physical struggle, but in reality, the mental and emotional toll is much worse. Knowing that my body limits me, watching others do the simplest things effortlessly while I have to work twice as hard\u2014it\u2019s a heavy burden on my heart.\n\nThe hardest days are the ones when I feel helpless, when I need assistance with things I wish I could do on my own. Those are the moments when frustration, sadness, and sometimes even anger hit the hardest. Not because I don\u2019t accept myself, but because I wish life was just a little bit easier.\n\nFear of the Future\u2026 Will Anyone Ever Accept Me?\n\nOne of my biggest fears is that I may never find someone who truly accepts me for who I am. How can someone see me as a real choice for marriage when even I sometimes struggle to see myself that way? In our society, marriage is often associated with perfection\u2014with someone fully capable, with no \u201cflaws.\u201d And I can\u2019t help but feel like I fall short of that standard. I constantly see myself as less than others, as if I\u2019m not enough. My confidence is shaky at best, and instead of embracing who I am, I often find myself hiding\u2014avoiding situations where my condition might be noticed, dodging conversations that could lead to awkward stares or unwanted pity.\n\nI wish I didn\u2019t have to feel this way. I wish I could believe that someone will see me for more than just my arm, that they will look past my physical limitations and recognize everything else I have to offer. But deep down, I fear that my condition will always be a barrier, something that makes people hesitate before choosing me.\n\nThe Burden on My Family\n\nI\u2019m not the only one affected by this\u2014my family lives through it with me. I see them trying to help, I see the worry in their eyes when they notice my pain, and I know they wish they could do more. And that feeling\u2014that silent acknowledgment that I\u2019m a source of concern, even if they never say it\u2014hurts in a way that words never could.\n\nEven when they don\u2019t express it, I know they carry the weight of my condition too. They want to see me happy, independent, and free from pain, but they also know that my life will never be as easy as they wish it to be.\n\nSports and the Never-Ending Pain\n\nExercise, something that should be a way to relieve stress and strengthen the body, is just another struggle for me. Some exercises are impossible, others require modifications, and even when I find something that works, the pain is always there to remind me that I\u2019m different.\n\nA Visible Condition\u2026 and the Mistake That Ruined My Life\n\nErb\u2019s Palsy isn\u2019t just a hidden condition\u2014it\u2019s obvious. My hand didn\u2019t develop properly, and the difference in strength and size between my arms is noticeable. This only adds to my challenges, making people immediately aware of my condition, leading to more pity, more questions, and more situations I don\u2019t want to deal with.\n\nAnd the worst part? This didn\u2019t have to happen. This was all because of a medical mistake. The doctor who delivered me pulled me out by my arm during birth, even though a C-section was necessary due to my mother\u2019s condition. But he didn\u2019t explain the risks, didn\u2019t tell her how dangerous this could be. Instead, he kept pulling, damaging the nerves in my shoulder and leaving me with a lifelong disability.\n\nHow can one careless medical decision take away someone\u2019s future? How can a doctor make such a reckless choice without fully informing my family of the consequences? This is my reality every single day. Every time I struggle with pain, every time I fail to do something simple, I remember that this wasn\u2019t supposed to be my fate\u2014this was caused by someone else\u2019s negligence.\n\nWhy Am I Sharing This?\n\nBecause I want to raise awareness about Erb\u2019s Palsy. Most people don\u2019t know about it or understand how much it affects a person\u2019s life. They see someone who looks mostly normal but don\u2019t realize the battles they fight every day.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about seeking pity\u2014it\u2019s about understanding.\n\nIf you know someone with Erb\u2019s Palsy, remember that they face challenges you may not see. And if you have it yourself, you\u2019re not alone. There are others who understand your pain, your frustrations, your fears. And together, we prove that even when life is unfair, we can still live it with strength and purpose.",

For context - my dad is 71 and mom is 50. They got divorced when I was in college about 4 years ago. My brother is in his 40s (we share a dad) and my sister is 30 (we share a mom). I am the only child between my two parents. I am the only person in my family to get a bachelor\u2019s degree except my dad, who got his in the 70s. I am now about to graduate with my master\u2019s degree. Ever since the divorce, my mom and sister moved to my area, leaving my dad in my childhood home over 5 hours away. I have been living part-time with my mom and part-time with my boyfriend (29M) of one year. My boyfriend and I are not ready to fully move in together yet, and I want to get my own apartment after graduating. \n\nNeither my parents nor my grandparents support this decision. My sister doesn\u2019t care and I cut off my brother a few months ago. Outside of my boyfriend, I feel really lonely. I have always been a people-pleaser, especially when it comes to my parents. I never wanted to rock the boat and I just wanted them to be proud of me. \n\nI know I am incredibly privileged - my parents love me, my mom specifically pays for my health insurance and helps me pay for my car, I was able to get a higher education with their help and support. I know so many people do not get that from their parents, and I try my best not to take that for granted. \n\nThat being said, I often find myself feeling indebted to them, when in all actuality, I didn\u2019t ask for any of these things. I want to be more independent. I want to find my own confidence outside of constantly appeasing others. I pay for all of my day-to-day expenses, but I want to have more responsibility. I want to grow as a person on my own. \n\nI am sure that I am going to move out anyway, but the feelings I have just suck. I\u2019m tired of trying to alter my life to please them - and I try to stop doing that but it\u2019s insanely hard to draw that line. Both of my parents emotionally depend on me a lot of the time, which adds another layer. \n\nOn top of that, they don\u2019t agree with the work I want to go into after I graduate. They want me to do something they deem as \u201csafe\u201d and not something \u201cheavy.\u201d However, I didn\u2019t go into my career (social work) wanting to avoid the hard stuff - in fact, it\u2019s the exact opposite. And these two opinions that my family have just really leave me feeling overall unsupported. \n\nI know this issue is so minuscule in the grand scheme of the world, but I had to get my feelings out somewhere.

    "selftext": "Alright, I guess I got a story to come clean about. Back in 84 a buddy and I were staying at the MGM Grand, before it was the GSR, and we were at the roulette table at 2 am. We were of course plastered and as we were losing everything at this table, two exotic looking women came up to us and got real touchy.\n\nNext thing you know we're doing Peruvian cocaine off of their asses in our hotel room, and hours later we were all shooting up heroin in the bathroom. They told us their names were Lynn and Ronnette, and they had this plan to murder Ronald Regan, who was supposed to be in the area within that week.\n\nMy buddy John was so hopped up on coke and heroin that he got so immersed in this idea, and for the following week we lived in this room in the MGM planning out our assassination. I wasn't too into the idea, I guess I was more bored than anything, but I was still there to help. Somehow these two women had an endless supply of drugs and we just kept spiraling. I don't think i slept for that entire week.\n\nWhen we got to the day before Regan was supposed to be here, there was news that he wasn't going to be in Reno due to an accident, and the two women freaked the fuck out. They burst into our hotel room and got on top of John, stabbing him repeatedly, saying he was working with the FBI, saying he was a snitch, saying the plan was ruined all because of him.\nI still picture the blood splattering onto my face, and my horror as Lynn tried to strangle me after killing my friend.\n\nWe had a pistol under the bed, and as Lynn was trying to kill me i just kind of rolled over so we would both be on the floor. I took the gun, turned the safety off, and blew Lyr brain out. Ronette watched in horror.\nWe both had killed our best friends that day, and we had realized what we had and just let eachother live. I saw her again sometime in the early 90s at a Motley Crew show.\n\nSomeone in the reno subreddit asked about our darkest casino stories, and I figured i should share here too. ",

    "selftext": "So how am I feeling? I feel pretty pathetic, worthless, I literally provide no value to society. I am an old geezer while everyone around me is doing great. Honestly as the title suggests, I've lost hope\n\nWhere do I even begin, I guess I will start where the this saga currently starts which is when I graduated late for my cohort because I failed a few classes and had one exam left which I did so that left me finishing my degree Dec 2019 as a Computer Engineer. I took a job that allowed me to travel which I did but we all know what happened in March 2020 and I had to cut my job and travel short which led me home. From 2020 to 2022 was a lull, I did nothing and was just vibing. I definitely regret it now with everyone who was putting in the work so that when the jobs came back, and they did, they'd be ready. The tech wave was upon us and I while on paper should have been good, was certainly not able to capitalize on the opportunity. When things started to open back up, I was still ill-prepared. I applied haphazardly, I clearly didn't have the skills to program but I was pretty aimless in my job application. Looking back, I definitely should have been productive since this was the tech boom and I was riding the wave in certain parts and made some money but still, never had a full-time job. The year goes by and I decide that I needed to escape so I spent a bit of time not being productive and just doing random things that would check stuff off my bucket list. I thought that time would be able to reset me into a head space of getting a job. So when I came back mid 2023, I again applied to many but no luck. Same thing different day, 2024 comes and goes, I try the same thing of leaving my city to get a fresh perspective and start. During this ordeal, I did manage to get some interviews and more with help with a few connections but they all led to dead ends. I am now back at home and as of right now I have a better routine, better path and now have some help with my progress but still everything looks bleak. I thought the change in scenery would help push me, and also my desperation would help push me to actually get a job but I failed.\n\nOver this time, I've accumulated a large amount of debt. I know that once I get a job, I know I can clear it but with this long stretch of taking L after L after L, I am losing hope. I have gotten some interviews within the last year but on top of the job market being rough and my own incompetence, it has led to not getting any roles. I have gotten many great life experiences in the last 5 years but the core pillar of life I would say, finding a bloody job has been an impossible mission for me.\n\nI do not know where I am going with this, I just wanted to share how I got to where I am today, and how hopeless I feel. If you've made it this far, thank you for reading. I hope to be able to update you all on better news sooner rather than later but the current world climate is looks to take a turn for the worse. Man life feels and looks bleak lol\n\nI'm putting this into the void mostly as an outlet for the overwhelming sense of failure I've been carrying, but I'm also curious if anyone else has navigated this particular kind of limbo \u2013 where time keeps passing but your professional life feels frozen in place. Sometimes I wonder if there's something fundamental I'm missing, or if this is just the brutal reality of trying to enter tech after a gap. Either way, it helps knowing I'm not alone in this particular rough patch",

    "selftext": "This happened 10 years ago, It was my fault, I shouldn't have snapped. It still eats me up from the inside every single day. If I could go back and do things differently, I would in a heartbeat.\n\nTen years ago, when I was 16 years old, this new kid started at school. I was really into Minecraft back then, and he was wearing a Minecraft t-shirt. I didn't have anyone to play with, so I approached him and tried to start a conversation. He was really hesitant and shy at first, but when I asked him about the shirt and complimented it, he lit up. We got to know each other a bit and planned to play together.\n\nWe played together for quite a few times and had fun, but eventually I got bored of the game and went outside with my friends instead. My friends didn't like him, so we never invited him; and that's when he started to get a little clingy, he would constantly keep asking to play and wouldn't take the hint if I said no. He had also asked our friend group if he could play outside with us quite a few times, and I didn't mind him and would have welcomed him, some people in the group didn't want him there, so I went along with it.\n\nHe started following me around a bit later and pestering me quite often. He would follow me around and talk about memes, YouTube videos, and Minecraft, often talking about it nonstop for up to 10 minutes without even giving me a chance to speak.. This kept going on for quite a while, and the whole time, I was getting more and more irritated, yet the more we spoke, the more I was getting irritated. I was too scared to back out of the conversation politely, which led to my irritation building up over time.\n\nThen I had one bad day, which took away a life.\n\nOne day, we were at the bus station, and he approached me and started chatting. At one point, all the anger built up over time inside me exploded, and I snapped and I told him:\n\n\"Just shut up! I was never your friend, we just played Minecraft together a few times. You are extremely annoying and nobody likes you\"\n\nThe next day, the teacher sat us down and told us that he had committed suicide, my entire world shattered. I instantly knew that what I said caused this and that I had caused him to commit suicide.\n\nI was invited to the funeral, during which his parents spoke to me and revealed an extremely important detail about him. It turns out he was very autistic and had severe trouble making friends all his life, and he was obsessed with MC. When he met me and we played, he became really happy and wouldn't stop talking to his parents about how he finally made a good friend, they knew me as his best friend.\n\nThis shattered my world, I didn't know he was autistic and considered me his only friend, I didn't realise how important our sessions playing together were for him.  But that doesn't justify what I did, I should have never said that. I still can't play Minecraft after a decade.\n\nToday is the 10th anniversary of his death, and I needed to post his because it should have been me, not him.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the kind support. Many have been suggesting therapy, while I do think it's a good idea, I don't know if it will help. I can't change the past, but I can be a better person than I was.\n\nAnd to those telling me this is AI, this is just how I write, think what you want but it doesn't matter to me. Yesterday was the anniversary of his death and a lot of fucked up feelings resurfaced, and I wrote this in an emotional state, I didn't want to keep it bottled up and I really needed some sort of way to let it out.",

    "selftext": "My ex common law wife of 21 years have been on the rocks and fighting a lot since August. On Friday morning we officially ended it and I feel relieved. I loved this woman, still do but can\u2019t let myself, and she has been gaslighting me since August. She denies having gaslit me, but our child called her out on it. The child is 16 and has witnessed all that has happened in the last few months. They have seen that I have tried to live my ex, that I have tried to be here for her, that I have tried. They also notice that the ex has not. This is a relief to me that I\u2019m not the only one to see it. We have a lot to work out over the next while, but right now we are both in the not speaking stage. She has been medicated for well over a year, and never told me until August. She has been hiding in her bedroom, we are lucky enough to have the space for a spare room, while I have been out in the house. I won\u2019t hide, she left me, if she doesn\u2019t want to be around me that\u2019s on her. I pay most of our bills out of my pay, she has always been a minimum or barely over works type person. And while I loved her, that was tolerable, but not now that we aren\u2019t together. I told her she was going to have to step up and pay more bills. I have always been the higher payed of us. And have always covered her part if she couldn\u2019t.  I never complained about it, I waited my other half to have a good life. \nShe started getting ill, found out she has gluten and lactose intolerance. Anyone with either knows it can get expensive to make it work, especially since she had her gall bladder removed. So many of the gluten free items were also off the table do to ingredients. She has no idea how much our child and I sacrificed in our diet and such for her, all without complaint. Actually the opposite, because it has forced us to eat healthy. I have alway been our household chef, can\u2019t even get her to boil some Kraft dinner on days she\u2019s off and I work, but I have learned soooooo many her diet friendly dishes, and spent soooooo much $$ on her diet. When I told her I was no longer going to supply her food and that my food bill just got so much cheaper. I pay for our child, I am the father and will take care of them no matter what, but I\u2019m not paying 2.5 ways any longer. Anyways I told her that and she gave the child a ride to school. Child told me after school that mom had a panic attack while driving that she had fuc*ed up and had to get another or better job now. To be frank, this is something that had always been a sore spot in our relationship. I was fine taking care of things but I did ask her to help more so WE could do more vacation like things. I can cover life, but not save for fun as well. Now she\u2019s afraid because I took her caretaker away. She isn\u2019t upset she broke my heart, she just cares about the finances. I cannot love her any longer after this. So now I need to get some booty, which has been *maybe* once a month for the last 16 years. Get that, have a blast and move TF on. \nYes this post is positive, I am accepting that this is my new life and I am relieved. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve felt relief. \nIf you got this far, thanks for listening. Enjoy life, it\u2019s too short as it is!",

    "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been together for a couple of months now and he has eaten me out a few times. I really like when he does this and I think he\u2019s pretty good at it honestly, but sometimes I think he doesn\u2019t want to/doesn\u2019t like it and I feel like it\u2019s because of me or my scent? I am the first girl he\u2019s been with and done anything with so it could be that maybe he\u2019s just getting used to it or something. But the first time we did this I wasn\u2019t showered (I wasn\u2019t expecting to be doing anything sexual with him at that time it just happened) and I know it was a new experience for him but something came up later about the scent and it being new to him and needing to get used to it. He has eaten me out a few times since then and says he likes it and wants to do it for me, but something is telling me that he doesn\u2019t really want to and I really believe it\u2019s because of my scent. Though I\u2019ve never had any complaints about my smell down there, it\u2019s always been an insecurity of mine (body odor in general but especially my vagina). This is mostly because of being molested when I was younger and my parents not caring to bathe us properly also I just always have felt like I didn\u2019t smell good and that I was nasty. But I shower regularly, I know how to wipe as a woman, drink plenty of water, wear cotton underwear etc. I\u2019ve also been to the gyno a lot just due to pregnancy, child birth and other things. I\u2019m clean as in no STDs and I always ask the doctors about my smell/ if they smell it or everything being okay and they always say I smell normal. I am very sensitive in that area so things do throw off my ph easy so I have to watch my sugar intake, certain foods, dyes in clothing/towels, products I use and put around it. I never feel clean enough though and want my boyfriend to like my smell and really enjoy eating me out for me but also for him. This has kind of hurt my feelings, not because he was rude about this or tried to make me feel bad but just because of my own insecurities with smells  and feeling like he doesn\u2019t want to go down on me because of this. Other guys I have been with have really liked eating me out and have even came from eating me out, but this is the only person I care about what they think and I crave for him to go down on me. What can I do to make this better for him without forcing him to do it? And is there anything else I can do to make myself smell better for him? I can\u2019t use scented lubricants because of how sensitive I am! But I don\u2019t want to feel so insecure about this with him, especially when I know he wasn\u2019t/isn\u2019t trying to make me feel insecure. ",

    "selftext": "I (20F) have been babysitting for over a decade, and I\u2019ve worked with all kinds of kids. But this was the first time I left a babysitting interview feeling genuinely unsettled. The more time I spent with this child, the more I felt like something wasn\u2019t right. Maybe I\u2019m overthinking, but I can\u2019t shake this feeling.\n\nAt first, everything seemed normal. The mom was nice. she was very welcoming. however, a few minutes into our conversation, she casually mentioned they had a previous babysitter, and \u201csomething bad happened.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t explain because her daughter \u201cpicks up on everything.\u201d That immediately made me wonder what I was walking into.\n\nWhen I arrived, the little girl (almost 5) wasn\u2019t just shy\u2014she acted like she didn\u2019t want me there. I brought a small coloring book as a gift, and she ignored it completely. While we wrapped a present for her best friend, she rejected every suggestion I made (adding stickers etc.) I understand that meeting a new person who could potentially be in your life can be a huge transition for a child. I just felt like the vibe was a little bit off.\n\nThen things got\u2026 weird..\nShe grabbed a drawing she had made, asked her mom to hold it up, and out of nowhere, she stabbed the mouth with scissors. Then she stuck her fingers in the hole and called it a \u201cpaper puppet.\u201d That threw me off. I gently tried to redirect her energy by making a small Hello Kitty puppet from the coloring book I brought\u2014something fun and lighthearted. luckily, I was able to divert her attention from the violent behavior and towards something more appropriate.\n\nAt one point, she got red marker all over her hands and refused to clean them. Instead, she ran around touching everything while her mom begged her to clean up. Eventually, her mom was able to get her to wash her hands but it really made me pause and think.\n\nLater, in her playroom, she randomly said, \u201cMy mom\u2019s dad died.\u201d That alone wouldn\u2019t have been so strange, except he passed away before she was even born\u2014she never met him.\n\nAfter that, every single make-believe game revolved around hospitals, dying, and things not coming back to life. One of her characters even faked being sick just to go to the hospital. It wasn\u2019t just one dark-themed game\u2014it was every game.\n\nThen came the moment that really unsettled me. \n\nWe were playing ball, and she kept telling me to back up. Every time I did, she told me to go back more. I turned around and realized I was standing right in front of the staircase. And then she told me to keep going. For a split second, I genuinely felt like she was trying to make me fall back. I stopped and told her I couldn\u2019t go any further. \nAt the end, she also threw the ball at the cat..\n\nI left feeling really conflicted. And then the mom texted my boyfriend\u2019s mom saying, \u201cOmg, she\u2019s so sweet! She\u2019s so, so good with kids!\u201d And while that was nice to hear, it left me feeling\u2026 stuck. I always do my best to be patient and kind, but I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something was off. Part of me wants to give this another chance and perhaps talk to the mom about it.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to feel about any of this. Have any of you had a situation like this? Am I overthinking? Or were there actual red flags here?\n\nedit: any thoughts on how i should go about calling the mother tomorrow? I want to be honest but I only met her once. It\u2019s only out of concern.",

It's only wasting my big heart, pining after someone who stopped loving me a long time ago.\n\nWe met too young. You were depressed from your parents' separation and your dad's infidelity. I helped you get off antidepressants. You never went to prom so when our university threw a formal dance, I asked you to go with me. For your birthday, I bought you guitar lessons with your favorite musician and we drove all the way to Kentucky so you could take them. During a hurricane in Florida once, we got under the same poncho and made out while it rained. We went to six countries together and I moved halfway 'round the world to be with you after we got engaged. You wrote me songs and gave them to me as presents. \n\nI never told you this but my biggest regret with you is a small moment that meant so much to me. We were visiting a cave in Spain and as we were walking out, you wrapped your arm around my waist and said \"I love you so much.\" It was one of the happiest moments of my life...and I should have told you how much I loved you back, but I was too choked up to speak, so I just clung to you.\n\nSix months later, you got bored, called me \"unmysterious,\" and dumped me. I'd moved halfway around the world with you, which meant I had nothing set up when I got home. Had to basically start from scratch.\n\nEven these few years later, I still get teary-eyed thinking about it. About you. \n\nFor a long time, I kept hoping you'd realize what we had. When your family told you \"you'd have a fun life with her.\" When your friends said \"she's the kind of girl you marry.\" I kept hoping you'd realize your mistake.\n\nBut you didn't. Not even when you butt-dialed me when you were with your next girlfriend. Not even after she dumped you. Not after years of me occasionally sending you little \"check-in texts,\" -- my way of leaving the door open for you to talk to me if you wanted.\n\nYou haven't married, you aren't dating. Your mom sometimes still talks to mine and gives updates. I heard through our mutual friends that you told them you think about me a lot, miss me even. But still you haven't reached out. \n\nI feel embarrassed now, for leaving that door open for so long. Even if you came back now, it's too late. I'd feel like an afterthought. I deserve better than \"I was lonely and thought of you.\" Or worse, \"I never found anyone better and I'm scared of being alone.\"\n\nYou're the person I've compared every other guy to, but in the end I think I loved who I thought you were, not who you are. That's my mistake, and one I don't want to keep making. \n\nSo I'm lettin' ya go. I'm putting all my thoughts of you into a little paper boat and setting it to burn as it drifts away on the sea. \n\nI hope you have a wonderful life, my friend. \n\n(Throwaway just in case.)",

Viewing the chronic harrassment I endured as a child with my logical adult brain means realizing just how insane and pathetic it all was. All the family members that swore they loathed me and wanted me dead were literally obsessed with me, but none compared to my youngest brother.\n\nmy brother absolutely tormented me like my tears were his only water supply. He would sneak into my room and steal my personal belongings, spend hours outside my bedroom door laughing and giggling with his friends to keep me awake at night, destroy any art supplies or technology I was given on birthdays or holidays, and he just generally on a daily basis, could not leave me alone for one second. Once when I was forced to clean his room as punishment for a fight he started, I discovered that his closet was literally just a massive pile of my stolen things.\n\nHe was STOCK PILING THEM. I wish I was kidding, or making this  shit up. It was weird af. I remember getting this weird knot in my stomach like I couldn't fathom why a person who spent so much energy hating me so much, would want to hold onto all my personal belongings, and just feeling really strange about it. I tried to point out how obsessive his behavior was to my mother, but she favored him as he was the \"baby\" of the family and would never hear it, and was convinced I just had it out for him, and even when I found physical evidence, she would just refuse to even look at it.\n\nHe was deeply envious of my hobbies, especially my art and actively sought to destroy anything I drew until I became deeply protective of my art, hiding it away in school notebooks where he wouldn't look just so he couldn't find it and rip it up. Eventually I transitioned to digital art and he would just resort to trying to steal my devices, whatever I had he wanted it and would throw tantrums about how unfair it was that I got to have it and he didn't; which was really strange because the very few nice things I was given by my mom and aunts were always for my hobbies, namely art. In comparison my youngest brother had zero creative hobbies but was given anything else he asked for, such as numerous gaming consoles. He took terrible fucking care of them btw, often breaking them on purpose just for the power trip and was always given a new one in a heart beat..\n\nIt wasn't openly talked about but my mother didn't agree with me having technology basically at all and had about the same attitude with my sisters, as a result, I was only permitted to have devices like a cell phone or laptop very sparingly, and I was often discouraged from playing video games in favor of my brothers. I only remember once or twice anyone in my family openly saying the classic \"video games are for boys\" nonesense, but it was pretty obvious that was what was going on as it was extremely rare for me to get a turn on the Xbox, and I begged and pleaded for DS for years and years while my brothers received new ones every year if not every six months or so.\n\nThis is all to say, my youngest brother got way more priveleges at home than I did but for some reason he was wildly envious of anything art related that I had and he didn't despite the fact that he had zero interest in my hobbies whatsoever. He never drew anything, never painted anything, never wanted to make digital illustrations, animations, nothing, even ranted about how \"stupid\". But all of it, he was deeply determined to destroy and take from me for some reason. At one point he even got my mother to forcibly take away my laptop that I used for animations and give it to my youngest brother, which is insane- just the fact that my mother fed and vindicated this obsession was by far the weirdest part. - But once he finally had my laptop which he had obsessed over and attempted to steal or destroy several times over by now, he didn't have anything to do with it, because all the games he liked playing could be played on other consoles, he didn't even like PC games, and the laptop was a basic one with no special gaming upgrades.   \n  \nSo, shocker! The Laptop dedicated to my basic 2D digital drawings and could barely process even that, was not necesarily more exciting or useful than a basic smart phone or ipod touch for someone with literally zero original ideas. So once he had it, he just destroyed it, smashed it to bits with gardening tools like a deranged maniac, so determined to upset me when he realized it didn't benefit him in anyway. He was that obsessed, that he would destroy something that was literally now his, just to upset someone else.\n\nI caught him numerous times sneaking into my room and I begged my mom to give me a proper lock and key to keep him out but she would just refuse saying then I could lock her out too ( she was also a nightmare but that's neither here nor there). \n\nSometimes he would spy on me and then tell others something embarrassing I did while I thought no one was in the room like sing a cringy song or something like that, which was just so weird, as if he just had nothing better to do than fucking watch me do boring cringy shit. \n\nLooking back on all this, it's certifiable. My youngest brother didn't just loathe me, he borderline stalked me. I want to contextualize that many of this happened when he was 10 and I was 16. It's just insane that no one ever took any of this seriously. There were more things like this that just made me feel really weird but I have trouble remembering them as I've buried them.",

    "selftext": "Little more than a week ago my best friend and I confessed our feelings for each other. We agreed to take some time to think about it, because both of us had bad relationship experiences in the past and we didn't know if we were ready to commit to one another. \n\nWe've known each other for about 2 years and instantly became close friends. He's by far the person who knows the most about me and I about him, we would talk for hours and not get bored, we are so compatible I would have never thought it possible. I know his bad sides and his good sides, he really is my best friend, my confidant. I love him. But I guess it was inevitable to catch feelings for him when we spend more than 4 days a week with each other.\n\nThe problem is that even though I feel this way, I can't be with him. The direction our lifes are headed are too diffrent and I can't commit to a realtionship if I know deep down I have to end it. Giving up my dreams in order to be with him would probably work, but only for a time before I'll resent him for it and that would not be fair to either of us. So I have thought long about what I would say to him even before we confessed, but in the moment I was just so swepped up and overwhelmed that I couldn't reject him. Before, I was so sure but right there and then I was uncertain, I wanted to say yes and try a relationship.\n\nLast Wednesday we spoke together with a trusted friend of ours, he's like a counselor and asked him what we should do, we are young and inexperienced and this friend is very wise and gives good advice. Not only was I uncertain but my best friend did have his doubts too, he's aware our paths lead somewhere else but he was willing to compromise his wants in order to try this relationship. After a bit of theoretical back and worth I told him I can't give my dreams up, eventhough I wish I could.\n\nWe dont want to lose each other as best friends and I still love him, but how do we recover from this. We see each other at least 2 days a week, we are in the same course. We like to talk to each other and still do, but it is diffrent and he said he needs time and space, away from me. So we don't hangout anymore. He gets different when I talk about certain topics and I understand, he's heartbroken. He needs time and I want to respect that, so I give him space.\n\nBut I it's not that easy for me, I struggled a lot with self-esteem and self-worth some time ago and still feel like that from time to time. I feel like I'm a broken human. For the next thing you have to know that I don't drink (unless at weddings or similar events), I don't smoke, I don't party or do drugs, you could say I'm boring. But when things get bad, like it is now, if I don't know how to handle it, I'm so close to going down the deep end and ruining my life. \n\nLike I want to drink so much till I blackout, I want to start smoking, I want to get addicted, I want to not feel anymore, I want to hurt myself, to destroy myself. Don't get me wrong I'm not suicidal, but I think it's because that would be to easy, I feel like i need to suffer, that I don't deserve anything better. It breaks me to know that I have to keep my distance from him, so that he can heal, because that voice inside me tells me I\"m worthless and that I'm bad for everyone around me, that I don't deseve to be happy. \n\nAnd I'm just so close on giving up, so close to doing all those things. I think I have just the worst comping mechanism if those are my thoughts when things get tough. I do have a past with self harm so I guess that is deeply ingrained in me. But I dont think I'll do those things, I have friends and family and I don't want to make them worry, that would start a spiral of selfloathing that I don't think I could return from. Then there is also my religion that keeps me from destroying myself, the thought of betraying God is something a can barely entertain, it would break me so deeply because I love Him so much, but then again it is that self hate that I think I deserve. I guess if I go down, I will go down bad. And it's the hardest thing to not listen to this voice inside me, because it's me, I think I deseve nothing better, at the same time I know this is not true. It's like a fight within me and I want to lose and win at the same time. When it gets late it's particularly difficult not to give in.\n\nAnd nothing of all of this can I tell my friends, since I don't want to worry them, I don't want to impose my baggage on them. And the one person who I could have talked to is deeply hurt because of me. \n\nWell I guess thats why I wrote this post on here, to get it of my chest. I hope I didn't violate any rules, since it's my first time posting here. Though I'm sorry if you read all of this and wasted your time. And I apologise for any mistakes since english is not my first language. I hope you have better days than I do. Cheers\n\n",

    "selftext": "Right so uhm I'm a little ashamed to be here so I'm using my burner account. Hoping nobody finds this lol. \n\nI have a best friend, let's call him James. I met James at church because I started going around the same time he became a member of the youth group they hold. I was new to this specific church and James was the one in charge of showing me around, since, as I said, first time there. We bonded over having the same favourite saints. We also both listen to the same music and we have the same favourite composer. It'd be an understatement if I were to say that we were close, we bonded immediately and have been inseperable. Now, James is currently studying theology, but I'm not in university as of right now. \n\nWe also both bonded over wanting to become members of the church. Or uhm I guess like, he wants to become a priest and I want to become a carmelite. English is my 5th language so I'm not sure what you guys call people who are in the church like that. He's felt this calling for a very long time, so have I. We had similar stories to how we came to the holy revelation, so we bonded. \n\nHe's still getting his theology degree, so he's still waiting on that. I, though, have been frequenting our local convent (not Carmelites, not sure what denomination they are) to decide if I want to become a postulate in a discalced community or an ancient observance community. For anyone not religious: discalced carmelites live in isolation, while carmelites of the ancient observance typically have more of a community. I'm leaning towards discalced because I believe it's my calling, but I'm praying on it. \n\nThe problem came in when I realised I started thinking of him every day. Waiting on his calls and texts back. Looking forward to mass just to see him. Essentially, another revelation came to me. I'm in love with him. I know this is,, well not ideal. I've been sitting on this for a while now and I can't seem to let go of it. Not even prayer helps. \n\nI know I need to let this go but I can't seem to. I've always been against the idea of marriage for myself but now it's all I can think about. And this isn't even some phase, I've felt like this for months.\n\nI don't know, any advice? I'm thinking about telling him since like.. he's going to become a priest anyway. I don't know, this is scary. I thought I was asexual and completely aromantic for almost my entire life. \n\nI came to Reddit as there isn't someone in my life to tell. So like uhm.. what do I do? I would ask if anyone is the same situation but I know you're not... ",

    "selftext": "So a bit of background information which is needed for this all to make sense. My first proper relationship was when I (17,F) was 13 with a boy the same age as me and for this to make sense in my head I\u2019ll make a fake name Leon. Leon and I started dating the week before I turned 14 and had been intimate within a month, baring in mind this was my FIRST relationship and probably his 10th. Within 3 months of us dating he was cheating on me with other girls and it wasn\u2019t just like 14 year old cheating it was like sending intimate pictures of himself to these girls. Obviously me being like head over heels, first relationship, I was easily influenced into thinking that this was okay. We were so toxic and my mental health got so low. I wasn\u2019t allowed to leave the house, he would break up with me when I went to my friends house (who was a girl and I am straight), he would pressure me into doing things I didn\u2019t want to do. I obviously thought this was all part of relationships as my parents live together and barely speak to eachother so I\u2019ve never really experienced what \u2018normal love\u2019 is like. We dated for a bit over a year and this was a constant. When we finally broke up he was straight to another girl. Obviously being a heart broken 15 year old I was going out with my friends to get over this. I went to meet my friend and ended up at her friends house who were boys. I posted a photo of us on BeReal(\ud83d\ude02) and he sent me threats saying he will leak personal photos of me and then got these girls (who he knew I was TERRIFIED of) as they used to bully me to \u201cmake me never want to go to school again\u201d with my anxiety and stress at such a high , I did stop going to school and only went in every now and again and to take my GCSEs. During that 2 years, we had been on and off getting back together; would be intimate, would message for months saying how much we missed and loved eachother, then he would get with another girl and then come back everytime it didn\u2019t work with her. For the last couple of months of school I became super close with this group of girls (fake names: Grace, Mary, Laura) Laura, I have known since I was born like we were basically sisters. Would go on holiday together, we like did everything together and we had finally become close again. Mary, I was so close to like we got close so quickly and we\u2019re inseparable. Then Grace we were also really close and we had so much fun with eachother and we knew the ins and out about eachother that we wouldn\u2019t tell the other girls. I would tell her things about my ex and about how much I wished I could get back with him because of how much I loved him and she\u2019d always listen in full confidence and we would trust eachother with everything. Literally 2 days before prom they had this party that I wasn\u2019t invited to but my ex was. Obviously I was upset but it wasn\u2019t them that planned it so it wasn\u2019t their fault. We were getting our nails done for prom and they then were talking all party like what they were going to wear, where they\u2019re spending the night, and that obviously upset me and hurt as they were doing it so blatantly in my face because I wasn\u2019t going (bearing in mind I still wasn\u2019t at school full time so they could easily talk about it when I wasn\u2019t there). That night I ended up in hospital and not one of them checked up on me (they weren\u2019t at the party it was the day before) but my ex did which obviously made me feel AWFUL as he does not care that much about me! The next day they went to the party blah blah and then it was prom. We went together and had a good time until the after party when one of our mutuals told me (he was hammered) that they were talking about how I was faking being in hospital and that I was basically just an attention seeking wh0re. Obviously I have literal documents and stuff of all the medication and treatment I had to have that night so I was not faking and if I was doing it for attention I would\u2019ve done it so blantantly to make them feel bad and I never even mentioned it to them. I left it and then 2 days later we went on a leavers trip to a theme park, all was fine again and I had an amazing time until the bus ride home when they didn\u2019t save a seat for me (we were an inside group of 4 but had a larger girl group of about 10) so I had to sit by myself. They then were shouting about planning anotjer party but the main girl saying it was Laura. I just sat back and let them do this hoping they would invite me but that never happened. I looked like a fool. 2 days later the party was going to happen and it was in a heatwave and we have a lake about 45 mins away from where I lived and we all planned to go together. I called Mary and I told her how the girls who bullied me was going to be there and she reassured me that everything was going to be fine. My grandma had to drive me to the lake and I was waiting for the girls and when they got there I messaged Mary and Laura asking to meet them and then they just flat out left me. I was stranded in this town with people who hated me. My grandma had left and I was just sat balling my eyes out and I was so embarrassed. I just blocked them all and got picked up luckily! The minute I blocked them I was so happy I literally did not care at all that I had no friends anymore. I started working at the local primary and fell in love with it. My life has been on such a high since June 2024. But\u2026 I found out yesterday, again being no contact with them all, including my ex, since June and hearing nothing about them. Grace is dating Leon. I really just don\u2019t know how to feel. I\u2019ve been so happy recently and for the whole of the day I just haven\u2019t been able to feel anything. Working today was the first time I just wished I wasn\u2019t there and I just wanted to curl up in a ball and cry. I\u2019m not sad about it but it just feels like a bit of a kick. My family are just telling me to \u2018be the bigger person\u2019 and I am but it almost feels like I\u2019m not allowed to be upset about it. I just don\u2019t know how to feel rn and any advice would be so so appreciated. I just feel a bit lost and now I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do. The thought of them together makes me feel ill and I know in a couple months I\u2019m going to have to see them at this local festival I work at and I\u2019m terrified because I know it will just upset me and I won\u2019t have work to distract me as it will be during the summer holidays. Please let me know what I should do. ",

    "selftext": "A few years ago, in 2019, I went over to a friend\u2019s house to complete a project. While there, I noticed she had some cats roaming around her yard, and she mentioned that her family also had a few dogs. The dogs were medium sized, and the cats were of normal weight and stature; and I assumed that when the weather became extreme, they would be brought inside for safety and comfort. I barely spared them a glance, trusting that they were cared for. At the time, I didn\u2019t think much of it. Animals are a part of human life, and in the low-income neighborhood that my friend lived in, it was common for pets to live in backyards or spend a lot of time outside. She clearly seemed to love her cats, even though they were not inside the house, and it would be rude for me to question how things were done in her family. In some Florida neighborhoods, it is common for dogs and cats to spend their days outside - the continuously warm environment with the occasional rain is perfect weather for those who can\u2019t afford to have more occupants in already small houses. \nIt was two years of being friends that led to our first sleepover. That was when I started noticing a few odd things in my friend\u2019s household. For instance, her family had recently found a kitten on the side of the road and had taken it in. At first, I thought it was a heartwarming act of kindness. They allowed the kitten to sleep in their beds, cuddle with them, and receive affection. However, as soon as the kitten grew older, they just put it back outside to fend for itself. It struck me as odd, but I dismissed it, thinking perhaps they just didn\u2019t want a full-grown cat inside. This happened with several cats, and they just found a new kitten a few months ago. I didn\u2019t like it, but it wasn\u2019t exactly illegal.\nThe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back was in 2023. It was an extremely hot summer, the hottest it\u2019d been in years. I went over to her house, per usual, but this time with another friend. We decided that before we\u2019d come in, we\u2019d say hello to her dogs. Usually she would tell us that the dogs weren\u2019t important, and would always steer us away. But this time, we wanted to play with them.\nThe dogs were confined in an unbearably small cage\u2014about the size of a wheelbarrow. The space was far too cramped for even one dog, let alone three. They had no shelter from the relentless 100-degree heat, and there was no shade to offer them any respite. The food bowl was empty, devoid of any evidence of kibble, meat, or any form of sustenance. The water they did have was dirty, contaminated with feces, and entirely undrinkable. Feces were scattered all around the cage, indicating that they had been living in these conditions for a long time.\nAs soon as they saw us, the dogs started panting and wagging their tails, shaking with excitement at the sight of people. They were desperate for attention, for care, for relief from their miserable existence. It was heartbreaking. No animal should have to endure such neglect. These dogs weren\u2019t just suffering\u2014they were being denied basic necessities: space, clean water, food, and protection from the elements.\nMy friend\u2019s reaction to our concern was even more shocking. When confronted about the state of the dogs, she simply walked away without a word. There was no explanation, no sign of guilt or concern. It was as if she didn\u2019t see anything wrong with what we had witnessed. I was horrified. I knew I could not ignore what I had seen. This was not just a matter of differing opinions on pet care\u2014this was neglect. Leaving animals in these conditions, without food, clean water, or shelter, is not only cruel but could be considered animal abuse under the law.\nThis experience changed the way I felt about her from then on. I had reported it to animal control, but they did nothing and her family ended up moving the dogs into the garage - a humid, stuffy garage without windows to open and let air in, but bigger than a wheelbarrow, so progress is progress. Animal control did not take the dogs away as I expected, but instead gave a warning. This is one of those stories with no real happy ending. Some people don\u2019t deserve the love animals give so freely. And sometimes, walking away from a friendship is the only right thing to do. We still keep in contact; after all, she was my best friend. But every time I see her face, I\u2019m reminded of those moments, and it doesn\u2019t feel good.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Throwaway because you never know. On mobile so may be weird formatting.\n\nI have decided that after last night, I'm going to break up with my girlfriend. Truthfully, this should've happened a long time ago, and I should've never gotten back with her after the first time.\n\nI (22M) have been dating my soon to be ex gf (21F) for a little over a year and a half. Last night, we had an argument because I decided to stay an extra day at my aunts since its the beginning of spring break. I see my aunt once a year, twice if I'm lucky. Initially, the plan was for me to leave yesterday evening to drive back to my uni town, as I have work all this week. My aunt convinced me to stay, as she said she'd pay me whatever I make in a days work. She lives on the coast, so why wouldn't I take pay to fish for another day off of her dock?\n\nWell, I text my gf this. And she's not happy. Whatsoever. She was at work and said she'd call me after she was off. Well, once she gets off, she proceeds to yell and argue with me. To boil it all down, this was her argument:\n\n1. I never have enough time for her. (I see her almost every evening during the week.)\n2. I bailed on our plans. Again. For family. (My family comes first, especially those I hardly see. We are not married, so I'm not going to prioritize someone I've known maybe 3 years over my family I've known my entire life.)\n3. I'm a liar. (I was up front with her about the entire ordeal of me staying.)\n4. I don't respect her or her time. (I am going to see my family for every second I can.)\n\nFamily is very important to me. I had an gf a long time ago that physically separated me from them and I told myself I would NEVER let anyone do that to me again. I tried to articulate to my gf that this was a spur of the moment decision. She again called me a liar and said that I planned this from the beginning. That when I stay late with my parents and younger sister, I plan from the beginning that I'll lie to her and stay late. Which isn't the case.\n\nThe entire thing just made my blood boil. She was saying that \"It's not because of my family or me seeing them,\" but what else could it be? I see her almost every evening. The only times I don't are because I am VERY involved on campus, have hard classes and need to maintain a good gpa for grad school so I study, or am practicing a hobby OR working. I mean, she's painting it, at least to me, that she wants me all to herself and I can't do that. I won't do that.\n\nThis isn't a new thing. It's been like this for many months. Everytime I go home to see my parents and younger sister (once a month or so), this happens. She gets mad. She calls me a liar. Says I don't respect her or her time. I'm fed up.\n\nI've already talked to her about this. We had a conversation last week about this. I'm done. I'm tired of it. I no longer see a future with her and she is no longer the woman I thought I loved. \n\nI'm leaving my aunts tonight. I'm going to send my gf a text on her cell (we usually use Snapchat to talk), and then block her number once it is delivered. I am going to articulate that I will not put up with her behavior and her driving a wedge between me and my family for her, as I already told her I wouldn't do that ever again for anyone. I'm going to say that if it's an issue, then she needs to find someone else that isn't me. I had fun while it lasted and I hope she does excellent in applying for vet school and her future endeavors. I do not want to talk to her or hear from her again. Even though we live in the same apartment complex, I do not want her at my door ever.\n\nMaybe I'm over reacting. Maybe I'm being harsh. But I've already had someone divide me from seeing my family and I won't let it happen again. I'm just so tired of it all.\n\nTL:DR, soon to be ex gf (21F) gets angry and argues with me (22M) for staying an extra day with my aunt that I hardly see. After an argument last night, I've concluded that this isn't ok and I will be breaking up with her this evening over the phone.\n",

Truthfully I don't know, I don't have any interest in anyone, I am an introvert I love staying at home watching kdramas, reading novels, sleeping. At the end of the call I told them if I had to wed someone it will be best if it is a Lavender marriage or with someone with kids(age doesn't matter).I love kids but I am not ready to have one not now not In the near future.

Many of my close friends knew that I am a trans before I told them so. I am not sure if I truly identify the situation or not but hope that you understood. \n\nI was dating with a girl who seems masculine. She is cis-het even though I did not think so when I met with her. We were doing okay. Cute dates, romantic bonding, sexual tension... Everything was fine as I wish. One day she refereed me as a man, which I hate to hear. I thought she said it by mistaken. Did not talk about it until it occurred a few times more. After the third time, I decided to talk with her about the pronunciations. \n\nps: In my native language we do not use pronounces. Though, still a person can be called as a man or a woman, which hurts me in this context.\n\nIn a proper time, I told her to not call me a man or mr and she asked why. I explained everything I discovered about myself. She was shocked by the things I told her, said that she has no idea what to do and  doesn't know even what to think. I said it's fine, you have time etc. to relax her. \n\nA few days passed and everything was fine as I expected. I have never faced with a negative things after I told my identity crises to my friends. Until 14th of Feb aka. Valentines day. In the morning she text me that she feels awkward due to the situation and wanted to talk to me. Then she called me with a crying sound. Did not say anything new, though it was impossible to feel the uncomfortable feelings of her. We had a planned date at night which she canceled. \n\nTwo days after that day, we broke up. Just because I am not comfortable with he/him pronounces. I feel ashamed and useless. I have never been ashamed this much. The only thing I told her that do not use man as she describes me. It led us to break up. I was left alone, since I said truths about myself.  \n\nI feel anger against her, want to take a revenge.

My(19) sister (28, I\u2019ll call her Lia) had a daughter with her bf (29, Jay) a couple of years ago, and they tied the knot about three months ago. \n\nI love my sister, I love my brother in law, and I absolutely adore my niece, but I really, REALLY wish they hadn\u2019t gotten married. \n\nAbout a year ago, Lia ended up breaking off her engagement after she found out what his parents thought of her (spoiler: it wasn\u2019t good), and how often they were talking shit about her, even to their grandkids!! And they\u2019d always treated her terribly, blaming her for problems that their son caused, but she stuck it through for her family because she loves em. But yk, after she finally heard what they\u2019d been saying about her she\u2019d had enough. \n\nSo a couple weeks go by, she and Jay coparent their kid, and for the first time since I\u2019ve literally met her, (18 years), she was glowing. She was so happy and so much more confident and comfortable, and as much as I loved Jay and my niece, if seeing them less was what it took to see my sister finally happy, I was okay with that. And there was always a chance that after they\u2019d both take time to work on themselves and feel better, they could try again.\n\nBUT THRN. It hasn\u2019t even been three weeks, and I hear they\u2019re back together!!! And as soon as they are, my sister lost that spark in her eye. Like. Call me crazy for not caring about Jay as much, but there was nothing they could say or do to convince me that getting back together was the best option for both of them. Maybe for Jay, but most DEFINITRLY not for Lia. \n\nI was opposed the entire time, ended up telling Lia that I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea, especially if Jay\u2019s parents were still being jerks to her, because her emotional/mental health would always be more important to me than a man\u2019s ego. But I also said that because I cared more about her, I would always support her decision no matter what, because I love her and she\u2019s the most important to me. \n\nUgh. I seriously do love Jay, and I\u2019m glad they worked out, but I wish they had taken a lot more time apart, because Lia deserves everything in the world, and she\u2019s my whole world, and I wish Jay had taken the time to tell off his parents and given Lia more time to focus on herself. \n\nThen about three months later they ended up eloping, and the wedding pictures were so cute and Lia looked so beautiful and so happy so obviously I was happy for her too, but I didn\u2019t find out until after the wedding, that Jay has never stood up for her in front of his parents. Like ever. Both of them are close to 30 and he still can\u2019t defend his wife, the mother of his child, the woman he chose to spend his life with, because he can\u2019t stand up to his mommy?? And It\u2019s still a problem!!! She literally made another comment about Lia on Saturday, so this isn\u2019t even old news!!\n\nI\u2019m happy that they love each other and that they\u2019re together and that they\u2019re married but I really wish they had at LEAST waited until she had more time to enjoy herself and he finally stood up to his parents because she doesn\u2019t deserve any of the shit they put her through :(.\n\nTL;DR: my sisters in-laws treat her terribly and her husband doesn\u2019t defend her, I wish they hadn\u2019t gotten married, or at the very least, waited until he stood up for her.",

    "selftext": "Throwaway account! This happened about 6 years ago and it still haunts me to this day. It was my at the time boyfriend\u2019s prom night and i was planning to go as well. We weren\u2019t going together but i graduated from the same high school the year prior and was going with my old classmates as a reunion thing. My boyfriend had been acting weird all day. It felt like he was trying to keep me from going to the event. He kept saying things like \u2018oh but you really don\u2019t have to come if you don\u2019t want to\u2019 but i was like no dude i\u2019m not going for you i just wanna see my friends. I went anyway and had a fun time but i barely saw him all night. We did plan to go home together so we met up to take a taxi to his place. Apparently he had been sitting in a car with his friends for hours so i asked him if he did any drugs (i don\u2019t really care and he knows that) but he said no. During our taxi ride home he was so distant and it was like he was completely ignoring my presence. He seemed sober so this really confused and hurt me since i had no clue why he was acting this way. We went to bed (i was still very confused) and i tried talking to him and asking if he was okay and what was going on. He didn\u2019t even bother responding so i started crying but he was still ignoring me, pretending to sleep. \n\nHere\u2019s where it gets really weird. After a while he got up to go to the bathroom. He was gone for a while so i went to check up on him. When i opened the bathroom door i didn\u2019t know what to expect but it was definitely not this. He was standing there holding a bunch of toilet paper with smashed red fruit on it. I looked in the toilet: smashed red fruit. I looked in the sink: smashed red fruit. He said \u2018i got a nosebleed\u2019 BUT IT WAS SO CLEARLY RED FRUIT like it was slightly pink and i could see the seeds and fibers and everything. It was strawberry or raspberries or something. It looked like he had chewed it for a second and spat it out everywhere. It also didn\u2019t look like vomit since it looked like pure fruit but i still asked him if he ate red fruits and threw up but he said (in the most normal and calm tone) \u2018no i didn\u2019t eat any fruit today, what do you mean? I just have a nosebleed?\u2019 I kept asking what was going on but he kept playing it off and saying i should go to bed. I was exhausted at this point so just went to sleep. \n\nThe next day and the following weeks i asked him so many times what was actually going on and he kept switching between \u2018just having a nosebleed\u2019 to straight up denying anything ever happened??? He also denied ever acting weird or distant. He made me feel like i was going crazy. To be fair, we did break up a year later cause he was a manipulator, a liar and lowkey abusive, but i still just want to know what was going on?? I\u2019ve told this story to so many friends and everyone is equally confused and intrigued. If anyone has any insight or theory i would love to hear it lol. Also if anyone wonders, i was sober during the events and he seemed too but not 100% sure. I\u2019m not in contact with him anymore but sometimes i\u2019m tempted to ask him again lmao. Any ideas??",

    "selftext": "It's been a few years since this happened, I had to quit college and end my studies because of it. I have mostly pretended it never happened, but I've recently been looking back and processing it, and I need to talk to someone about it. I don't have anyone to talk to about this, so I decided to come here.\n\nMany years ago, I was 17 and had just started college. I befriended a girl, let's call her Emma. Emma started dating this Bisexual girl, let's call her Jenny, and once she came into the picture, the three of us formed a friend group.\n\nWe were a good friend group for a while and had lots of fun hanging out and studying together. Still, at some point Emma's and Jenny's relationship started to go really sour, Jenny had BPD and their relationship had started to become really unstable. They had arguments almost daily, even at our college. And during these times, I became the therapist; whenever I individually met them, they would rant to me about each other. And Jenny and I really bonded and became good friends since she actually listened to my rants too.\n\nThe day **it** happened, the school had organized a disco party. Emma was working and had to get home, get ready, and head straight to the party. So Jenny had invited me to hang out at her place before the party, get ready together, hang out, and then head over to meet Emma at the party.\n\nWe were just hanging around, typical college kid age things and everything was light hearted. But suddenly things got really weird, she started talking about sexual things; asking me about my kinks and fetishes, asking me about all sorts of sexual questions and it somehow evolved to her taking out her computer and showing me the kind of porn she watches, and yes, when I say showing I mean putting on the actual videos of her favourite porn and asking me to show mine. From there it kept escalating into much weirder sexual things; after the porn she started talking about Emma and telling me what they do in bed, then she pulled out her phone and started showing me nudes of Emma, **without Emma's permission or knowledge of it.**\n\nThe next part, which I feel extremely uncomfortable thinking about and trying to forget. Her parents were downstairs eating dinner, after showing me a bunch of nudes of Emma without her permission, she opened the door and at that point her parents could probably hear whatever we were talking about. Then she sat down next to me, started talking about how much she misses being with a guy, put her hands inside my pants, and Sexually Assaulted me while making remarks about how much she liked \"feeling me.\" Eventually her parents started to come upstairs. She stopped, and at that point I said I had to go and went home, skipping the party.\n\nI didn't want any of that. I only saw her as a friend, and I didn't consent. I just..froze. Many people have asked me when I tell this why I didn't stop her, and said to me that I \"Consented\" by not stopping around the part she started showing porn or Emma's nudes. But I was dissociating the whole time. I can't really explain it, but I was in shock the entire time.\n\nAfterwards, the next day when I came to college, she had told Emma at the party that she cheated on her, told her I had made a move on her and she reciprocated it. This broke our friend group entirely and I was left alone with no friends.\n\nIt all went completely sideways when a mutual asked me about what happened to our group, and once I told her the story, she asked me \"Isn't that sexual assault?\" and that's when it hit me what it really was, to which **I said yes**. Not too long later, that person talked to Jenny about it. Jenny told her a completely different story that she was the victim of SA and I was the one who did it, she twisted the whole story in a way where she told people I did all the things she did that night; the kink questions, porn, begging to see nudes of Emma and then I assaulted her.\n\nNo matter how much I told the truth. No one listened, they all believed her.\n\nIt didn't take long for the whole school to believe her and paint me as a sexual predator, I became an outcast and everyone treated me like a monster, It led me really close to suicide and I dropped out of school and have never gone back, not long after I dropped out I developed very heavy substance abuse and have been struggling with it until recently, I am sober for around 9 months now.\n\nI really don't know how I feel about posting this, but I genuinely just needed to tell my story, I just needed to vent. I'm sorry if this is too much. I hope you all have a good day.",

I spend a lot of the time feeling resentful about the amount of cliqueyness, ableism and body shaming that goes on, as well as a significant minority (not most people, but certainly enough for me to notice) coming out with bits of pseudoscience.\n\nI'm not one of these people who's looking to be offended. Instead, I actually wonder if I'm using it as some weird kind of self harm, since I so often go home feeling upset. I spend at least 90% of the time wondering why I'm there since I should've known I'd hate it. But I chose to be there.\n\nI've spent quite a lot of time googling for events, hoping that I'll finally found something that really works for me, and as a result I get social media adverts for even more of them, most of which annoy me just reading the adverts. It's all feeding in to a vicious cycle.\n\nI really need to stop.",

    "selftext": "This is horrible and hard for me to write. I (37F) have been with my partner (42M) since 2016. We met all the way back in 2014 and I didn\u2019t actually like him. He lacked manners, never wanted to pay for anything and so I ghosted him. We did have fun together, but it was all those other things that really annoyed me. For some reason I reached back out to him in 2016 and gave him another chance and wound up falling in love with him. We have a 2.5 year old daughter, who we both love so much. He takes great care of her and is a great dad, but he is lacking in so many areas. He lost his job, cannot make money. He never went to college. I\u2019m carrying the family in NYC on only $100K a year. He never compliments me or buys me anything. We have never had a single date night. He does all the cleaning, laundry and cooking, but overall I feel like the husband rather than a wife. I\u2019m so sick of him. We have been trying to have a second kid and it\u2019s not working and I am the one that will have to pay for all fertility treatments alone. I just feel like he is not good enough and it\u2019s a horrible way to feel. I\u2019m stuck and I don\u2019t know what to do. This feels like it will be my life forever, having non-passionate sex with someone I can no longer stand for the sake of my child. I\u2019m not getting any younger and realize meeting someone else at my age is an uphill battle when men just want young women. Advice please?",

    "selftext": "I was on a second date with a guy who I liked. We had met before once, it was fun, and we had hooked up but didn't have sex, because I am a virgin and I had clearly told him I am not ready for sex.\n\nThis time, he didn't give me the same fun vibe, but I wanted to hookup with him again because it was fun the previous time, and honestly I was trying to let loose a little, since I have usually been very uptight when it comes to dating. I went to his house after, and ofc things escalated. \n\nI accept that I showed equal interest, unlike last time, and I was teasing him, and flirting with him, and kissing him. But this time, it was more about him, and he didn't seem that interested in kissing me again and again, like the first time. He slightly persuaded me to give him a blow job, which I really didn't want to, but after one point I couldn't say no. But I wasn't able to, and I kept gagging, and i remember telling him i cant. He then got in between my legs, and I told him that I wasn't ready for sex. He reassured me that he wasn't going to do anything, and he was just teasing me. I remember telling him multiple times that I didn't want to have sex, and I wasn't ready. I trusted him and let him, slightly penetrate me without going in. But then he kept pushing in further. It was hurting, and again i tried stopping him, but not very firmly. He asked me if he could just feel me from the inside but would not thrust. I don't think I said anything to that. But eventually we did end up having sex. \n\nAnd in fact, he kept asking me to help guide him, which I did as well. So now it's a very blurry line for me, because I said no and I told him that I wasn't ready, but then I also gave him a helping hand, and also didn't say no while we were actually having sex. The next morning also I didn't say anything, and I in fact kept kissing him. But later after coming home and finally processing, i confronted him on text, and called his upbringing into question. He lashed out at me, and said that I could have stopped it at any time, and he just wasn't the one who was into it.\n\nAnother thing to note with be that he didn't show me any comfort, or affection or asked me how I was feeling after sex. In fact he didn't communicate with me at all. He tried to cuddle me once, but I got up and went outside to process things, after which he didn't hug me properly even once, or tried to cuddle me. We slept separately the entire night, and i felt so vulnerable and sad. I never expected my first time to be like this. Now I am just confused and sad and regretful at this point.\n\nAlso, he did not use a condom, and it was much later that I realised and when I told him, he said he will pull out which he did. I asked him in the morning if I needed to take the morning after pill, and he said no. But I ended up taking one anyway after reaching home.",

    "selftext": "My dog and I had been through a lot the past couple years. He was a stud at a puppy mill and was abandoned then found by a rescue. My sister found the page for him and I fell in love with him immediately. A wheaten terrier with a torn ear who was scared of everything and everyone. It took some time, but he became the sweetest dog I'd ever seen. Still easily scared, but god was he a good boy.\n\nThere are so many moments from my time with him that I look back and wish I'd cherished more. He had so many oddities, and I loved him. He never demanded attention, but he always wanted to be present. No matter what room I was in, he wanted to be there. I set up blankets for him around the house so no matter where I was, he could hang out with me.\n\nHe got sick a couple years ago and because of a really bad vet, the underlying condition went untreated for a long time. After some surgery and a lot of medication, we got it under control. He required constant care, but I never complained. I loved taking care of him, and given the life he'd lived before me, he deserved to be loved and taken care of. I knew when I adopted him (at 6 or 7 years old) that he'd get old and sick, in time.\n\nDuring that time, my marriage to my partner fell apart. I learned after we separated that she'd cheated on me with her boss, which led to the end of his marriage as well. She'd lied to me, manipulated me, and abandoned me. I was miserable, but I still had my sweet boy. She demanded so much in the divorce. She took so much from me financially, physically, and emotionally. But I still had my sweet boy.\n\nWell, in January, the divorce was finally settled and I was so ready to move on to a new chapter. But my dog's regular checkup revealed some unfortunate news. The medication he was on made him susceptible to UTIs and a drug-resistant strain took hold of him and basically never let go. He needed surgery, he needed medication, he needed so much but when none of the three antibiotics we tried worked, he didn't want to eat, he didn't want to drink, he just wanted to rest. I realized it was time.\n\nI work from home and I haven't gotten out much with everything going on. So all day, every single day, he was a part of every facet of my life. My morning routine, my work routine, my bedtime routine, my meals. His bed next to my desk. The sound of his collar jingling or the little whimpers when he was dreaming. At home, he was my whole world. Everything I did, I did with him. And now he's gone. I haven't been this alone in ten years.\n\nIt doesn't just feel sad, or empty, or lonely, it feels *wrong*. It feels like these patterns in my life made sense with him in them and without him, every room in this house feels like it's missing something. My personality makes me very focused on problem-solving, and I feel like I'm sitting in a problem that can't be solved. I just have to exist in it until it doesn't feel like a problem anymore. And I don't know if or when that'll be.\n\nI just miss my dog. I'm thankful to have had such an incredible creature be part of my life, but I just miss my dog.",
