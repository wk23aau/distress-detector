    "selftext": "I have been going through some issues. My mental health is broken; I am emotionally unstable, the fact that my 3 female friends just ignored me all of a sudden at first I thought it was nothing, but when weeks passed I sensed something was wrong as I am very sensitive to change so I knew something was going on between them and me.  I acted normal to make sure I was just overthinking but apparently, I was wrong. Even when my Muslim friend wasn't there anymore, they would still push me away, and respond with very few words which is not their usual type.\n\nThey would act normally with others but to me, they were cold, ignorant, and hurtful, one even pushed me and had a very judgemental and angry look, as if I had done something, and of course, this broke me. The other day, I tried to confront them and they ignored me and went away. Because we only always see during the school day, I told them that I would bring them to the guidance counsellor if they wouldn't talk to me, and reassured them that I would reach out to our advisor first before even going to that extent. They finally talked to me.\n\nMy Muslim friend, let's just say girl 1 told me that they were not talking to me because they were bonding as girls and that she was a Muslim and of course, I understand that. BUT SHE WASN'T EVEN THERE to begin with. She was not the problem but the other 2. We were close friends, especially girl 2 who I've known since childhood. I told her that she wasn't the issue, because I've been respectful to her and didn't talk to her nor get close to her after her transition. I exclaimed to them why didn't they tell me then, instead of ignoring me, and on top of that I asked them why the two were ignoring me when girl 1 wasn't there. She didn't say anything and didn't look at me, ignoring me completely during my confrontation I told them that I was an open book and they could've told me, I said that they were like fake friends acting like they didn't know me, and I was crying as we talked.\n\nPart 1",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI (30m) started posting some of these incidents in AITAH but it soon became clear that in some of these cases she very clearly is TAH and there's no point in even asking.\nSo I've come here just to list all the effed up things that have happened to me in the final months of 2024.\nI anticipate this will be very long, have fun.\n\nSo for some context\n\nIn late 2023 my wife and I bought a house and I was spending a lot of time for a couple of months working on the house almost every evening and weekend I could spare. \nDuring this time my wife started going out with some new friends including this guy J. \nRandomly one evening she looks a bit funny and says to me, \"I don't trust myself around him\".\nI hear this, my heart sinks a bit but I feel like we have a strong relationship and I tell her \"I trust you not to do anything stupid, just be sensible about what time and how you spend time with him\".\nShe liked this and we moved on, but I decided to keep an eye on the situation.\nShe started spending more and more time with him and these new friends, going out and getting drunk while I was working late on the house.\nIt was starting to make me uncomfortable and eventually I said so. I didn't ask for anything, I just expressed my feelings.\nShe said, she understood but they're just friends and there's nothing to be worried about.\nThey keep hanging out until one day his partner, a woman married to another man...., forbade him from speaking to my wife because she was jealous.\nSo he ghosted my wife and she got really upset.\nIt hurt me to see how upset she was for two reasons,\n1. My wife is upset, that's upsetting\n2. She's so upset it feels weird and she's acting like a breakup\n\nShe asked me to proof read a message she wanted to send and I read a bit and had to put it down, I said \" this is a breakup message, I refuse to do this\"\nShe remained adamant they were just friends and nothing more.\nI accused her of having an emotional affair, again she denied it and was adamant they were just friends and that I need to get over this.\n\nSome weeks later J comes back on the scene having broken up with his previous gf. My wife says she's going to talk to him but be very boundaried. I tell her that I'm uncomfortable with all of this, if she's going to see him she should be careful.\n\nA week or two later she comes stumbling in at 5am, I ask where she's been and she explains that she has been out with J, went back to his place at around 2am and they 'played guitar'.\n\nI was hurt and upset, this was the antithesis of everything we discussed. I said \"you can't do that\" to which my wife took great offense accusing me of controlling her and being misogynistic.\nTo be clear, I never forbade her from seeing him, I never tried to tell her what to do beyond please be careful and don't do anything silly and please respect me. That time I said \"you can't do that\" was the first and only time I specifically said what she could and couldn't do.\nAnd to me, it's obvious I wasn't controlling her I was just not saying the quiet part out loud which is \" you can't do that unless you want to ruin our relationship \"\n\nShe is adamant nothing happened, and weirdly I believe her. The issue for me is that she did the opposite of what we both agreed, she disrespected me and my feelings, and she is putting our relationship in jeopardy.\nTo her the issue is that I tried to control her by being upset, and that I'm putting restrictions on her. She pointed out she's a grown ass woman and she can spend time with her friends if she wants to. My being upset about it is a mode of control and I need to stop.\n\nIn principle I have no problem with her seeing her friends, but this guy makes me uncomfortable.\n\nSo that all happened, we were on the rocks, she is clearly having an emotional affair at the very least but adamantly refuses to acknowledge it. I'm trying desperately to find a way to move forward and recover our relationship if we can.\n\nThen, October 2024. My mum died suddenly.\nI won't go too much into it but it happened, very sudden, shocking, it sucks. My dad died when I was young so a lonely time as well.\nThis is where my wife's behaviour started to seriously turn, I'm going to list the major events as I remember them in the order they happened. I will also try to list areas where I was less than perfect but to be perfectly honest, I don't think there are many. Like really, I have to keep checking myself - surely it wasn't all so one sided, surely I contributed meaningfully to this.\nJust doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nAnyway here goes.\n\nThe day after my mum died, we are at the pub with a friend, we are talking about it all. My friend asks my wife how she's doing and she says \" I'm worried everyone is going to forget that my mum died \"\nFor context her mum passed away 3-4 years ago from a long contracted period of illness. It spanned over COVID and lock down. I lived in their house with them over all of lockdown and helped look after her mum, watching her die and taking care of her for over a year.\n\nMy wife had been dealing with this tragic and difficult loss for some time, so I had some sympathy to her reaction. But bottom line, it's a shitty thing to say to your partner who lost their mum one day ago, that you're concerned you're not going to get as much attention any more. That my loss will overshadow hers.\nIt speaks volumes and sets up what is to come.\n\nA day later she says she's going to go and see this J guy I mentioned above. The one I'm really uncomfortable with.\nI made it very clear that I am uncomfortable with this and now is not the time to be testing me like this. I know he's just your friend and there's nothing actually happening (I'm an idiot), but this does upset me and I don't need to deal with this right now. I'd appreciate it if she didn't go.\nShe said she understood but not to worry, this is the last time she's going to see him really. Their relationship has petered out more or less so it will just be the occasional coffee which is all she's going for.\nOh and they had plans to go see a jazz band in a few weeks time but she'll cancel that on account of the funeral. She's barely going to see him, so don't worry.\nI said it was fine. I saw it as, if she's being truthful then I can accept the cost of one more uncomfortable period if the payoff is they really do just leave each other alone for a while. She went and came back a couple hours later, no big deal.\n\nSo the following week we had a spa trip booked, I bought it for her for Christmas. We decided to still go in spite of everything because, why not. I need it.\nIt was great. Had a lovely time, reconnected, I was able to relax and de-stress a bit. \nBut on the last day, we're in a hot tub together sharing a cocktail and she's on her phone. She's messaging J and arranging to meet the next day.\nI took offense and said \"I thought you weren't seeing eachother any more?\"\n\"It's just to study, I'm falling behind on my thesis.\"\n\nSo the next day she gets up early and leaves, we agree she'll be back at lunch. I'm very unhappy about all of this and just basically sulk all morning. I leave my phone upstairs and try to get on with my day as best I can, waiting for her to come home and talk about it.\n3pm comes and goes. I take a nap. 5PM comes and goes...\nI check my phone, a couple messages and a couple missed calls. Apparently she decided to stay out for lunch and asked if it was ok. When I didn't reply she decided to stay out for dinner and drinks too.\nShe didn't get home until after I went to bed. I spent the whole evening feeling miserable and hurt. I don't need this.\nShe comes home and I confront her asking if she thought any of that was ok.\nTurns out it's all my fault because I didn't reply to her and my lack of immediate response was me emotionally blackmailing her to come home.\nIt really wasn't, I just didnt want to have my phone on me and was expecting her to be home at the agreed time.\nMaybe a little silly and selfish in my part. Maybe. But I'm grieving and she's already pushed my boundaries, I needed some alone time to deal with it. I had no idea I was emotionally blackmailing her.\nSo anyway, she stays out all day with the person that makes me uncomfortable, days after my mum died, days after she promised she wouldn't, and I'm the asshole for not keeping my phone on me in case she decided to change her mind.\nGreat.\n\nA week goes by and it's the day before we're due to leave for my home town, ready for the funeral in a few days.\nShe asks me if we can hold off going for one extra day so she can go to this jazz thing with J. I say, \"wtf? you said that wasn't happening? That's why you saw him earlier because you weren't doing this.\"\nShe says she knows but she really wants to go.\nI confront her and say \" I really don't feel like I'm your top priority\"\n\"No, you're not my top priority\"\n\"... Please elaborate\"\n\"Well, I just don't see it as a hierarchy. Everyone's in a circle around me and you're all equal priority. You, J, etc..\"\n\"Right, but I'm your husband and my mum just died. Does that not put me ahead of anyone else?\"\n\"No.\" Looking dead in my eyes. No.\n\nFine! Go to your jazz thing, idgaf.\n\nShe says \"might as well, the damage is already done by me even asking, right?\"\n\nYeah. The damage is already done.\n\nI can't believe what she said to me, so cold, so heartless, so unempathetic, so selfish.\nBtw, this woman is a qualified therapist.. let that sink in. Hope you don't get her as your therapist, good lord.\n\nSo she fucks off the next day and I delay my departure for her social plans.\nI contemplated going down without her but the ensuing drama and questions from family would not be worth it. It was my mum's funeral after all, not my marriage's.\n\nThe funeral goes fine, the week is fine. She doesn't say or do anything shitty. I focus on the funeral and family and everything and mostly not think about the fireball train wreck that is now my marriage.\n\nOn the drive home my wife decides to tell me that she thinks her ex boyfriend (from school days) is \"the one that got away.\"\nI'm dumbfounded because \n1. What a thing to fucking say as I drive us home from burying my mother\n2. It's just patently untrue. So completely ludicrous that I'm not even bothered by the notion that she might be serious.\n\nIt is at this point that it dawns on me that she may be hurting me on purpose.\n\nThe next day we are having coffee and she says to me\n\"I never wanted this house, I never wanted this dog, and I don't want kids.\"\n\nLet's be clear, I did not push her to get the house or the dog. If anything she pushed for both of them but it was pretty mutual. \nShe is now tearing up the entire foundation of our marriage. She is lighting fire to the entire future plans we had.\nThe house and dog that I poured my heart and soul into for her, for us. She never wanted apparently.\nJust brutal. Savage.\nShe acted shocked when I started crying, \"I didn't expect it to upset you this much\" \nIncredible.\nThe next day I go to my friend's place and just cry on her for hours. I am in a complete state. It's all too much, overwhelming, awful, and just confusing.\nWhy is she being so mean? I wondered if she hated me, then I thought.. maybe she's trying to get me to break up with her.\nShe's clearly having an affair of some variety. My mum just died. Maybe she just doesn't want to be the person to break up with their partner when their mum died. \nEspecially a partner who cared for her dying mother.\nAnd especially because she was having an affair.\nShe'd be seen as such an asshole, so rather than just admitting everything and being an asshole she decided to torture me until I pulled the plug myself. Not her fault then, is it?\nAnyway, that thought occurred to me. But I'm in no state to decide the fate of my marriage.\nI'm grieving, I'm distraught, I'm reeling from the various harrowing incidents listed above. Barely enough time to process one before another comes along.\nIt may seem obvious to you and me now, but at the time I just couldn't see clearly what was happening or exactly why.\nMy friend gave me some advice that I didn't need to decide anything right now, that settled me.\nTook some pressure off \nAt around this point my perception of time gets a bit funny. Mixture of grief and brain fuckery.\n\nSo now I'm pissed at her, I don't trust her. I feel badly hurt.\nShe says she's going out with J again. I say I don't care. Resigned to this shitty behaviour, unable to reason with her, unable to discuss it, unable to make the call and leave.\n\nShe comes back at 4 in the morning high AF, they had taken MDMA together. The oxytocin drug.\nUnder the influence of this drug he confessed his feelings for her. She was totally shocked by this and said it was all a little uncomfortable.\nOk, I said. Whatever.\nThe next day we're driving somewhere and I really can't remember what she said but it just set me off. I think it was something along the lines of \" I don't know why you're so upset with me?\"\nI was furious, I was worn down, I was mistreated.\nFor the first time, I raised my voice. I was shouting at her. Listing all of these shitty instances that were cutting me up whilst I grieved.\nI raised my hand, clenched my fist and brought it down on the steering wheel in anger. It made a dull bang noise.\n\nThis was the start of a new narrative from my wife.\nThe scary, aggressive husband narrative. The perfect excuse, in her eyes, to leave me without raising questions about her betrayal and complete lack of empathy.\nYou're scary, she said.\nI was cowering in the passenger seat, she said.\nYou're just like my aggressive father, she said.\n\nI tried defending myself but please remember I was in a complete mess mentally and emotionally. I started to believe her.\nMaybe I did lose control, maybe I am one of those guys. Maybe I threatened her.\nI thought that, yes it was an outburst, but no it wasn't threatening. I'm not a big scary person. I'm just a human being that has been deeply hurt and wounded when they're at their most vulnerable.\nBut maybe that's not a good enough excuse.\nMaybe I crossed a line.\n\nShe sowed the seeds of doubt in my vulnerable mind.\nI started doubting my memory of events, did I black out for a moment and do something really scary?\n\nShe told me that I was 'potentially abusive'. To be clear, she's not accusing me of being abusive, she's accusing me of maybe becoming abusive in the future. And she can't take that risk.\nI'm not safe to have children with, you know the children she said she didn't want before I ever shouted.\n\nI believed her.\n\nWhat a monster I was. How could I be so terrible, I never thought I was like this.\nNo wonder she was having an affair for the last several weeks.\nI shouted at her and hit my hand on the steering wheel in frustration.\n\nShe lent into it but not too far. She was manipulating me, telling me it's ok. You just need to go to therapy and sort yourself out.\nAs long as I'm going along with her narrative, she's all ok my side. If I ever doubt her, I'm terrible and hurtful and potentially abusive.\n\nShe decided it was time to end things, she had the get out of jail free card she wanted.\n\nShe didn't leave me for another man and emotionally abused me when my mum died, she saved herself from an potentially abusive relationship.\n\nMy greatest crime was hitting a steering wheel.\n\nOne of the last things she said to me.\nShe spoke with a friend of hers who had broken up with her partner of 8 years, had two wild years, and then they got back together for several years.\nI asked what she meant by wild years, \"just connecting with lots of people\".\nSo she turns to me and says, I think we're a lot like them, you know?\n\nI wanted to say, I bet she didn't abuse her partner. I bet she didn't hurt him when his mum died. I bet she didn't manipulate him into believing he was abusive.\nAnd the sheer audacity of sitting there and looking to me to approve of her fucking a bunch of people for two years before I take her back.\nI said nothing, she nudged me. Desperate for me to implicitly condone her actions and behaviours by giving even the slightest inkling that I might take her back when she's done fucking around.\nI turned away and left. I was done.\n\nNot two days after our official break up she declared herself in a relationship with J.\nBut to her family, she accused me of being aggressive and scary and forcing her to leave. She denies having had an affair, pretending that her and J are not an item.\nShe goes to my friends and asks them to meet her new partner J. Again, implicitly asking them to condone her actions by meeting this J guy.\nMy friends all refuse, and begin to cut contact with her.\nThey've seen what she's done. They knew what she was doing to me before I did. They won't tolerate her BS.\nI love my friends.\n\nMy wife's sister knows everything, she heard it all from my wife's point of view and STILL she took 'my side'. Then she heard what I had to say.. boy was she pissed.\nShe told her whole family the truth, my wife tried to convince them that her sister was a liar. That she didn't understand. She's pregnant btw.\nMy wife just tried to turn her family against her pregnant younger sister.\n\nIn her attempts to not be seen as a terrible heartless B, that would abandon her husband when he needed her most, she turned herself into an even worse monster. An abuser according to some. A liar, a manipulated, a nasty piece of work.\nSometimes you meet your destiny on the path to avoid it.\n\nI'm 2 months free.\n\nI don't want to let another human being close to me like that again, but maybe that will change with time.\nMy therapist, and my wife's sister who's also a qualified therapist both said that she has been emotionally abusive to me.\nCoercive controlling behaviour.\nI don't know about that, but I know I've been treated unfairly.\n\nThanks for reading this far, I hope it was entertaining.\n\nX",

    "selftext": "Hello Reddit, long time reader but finally posting for the first time so please be kind, also this is on mobile so I'm sorry if my grammar and format aren't very good. Trigger Warning as this might be a hard read for some and contains talk of abuse.\n\nMy (29) life story isnt a happy one, lots of loss, abuse, and loneliness.\nAbit of background, I'm the middle of 3 kids, an older sister and a younger brother, we're all close in age and didnt get along at all as kids but did become closer as we got older, or so I thought.\n My Dad died when I was young, and this had a massive negative impact on my family but especially my mum who became a partially functional alcoholic with lots of mental health issues which she has never gone to or considered therapy for. She also has dated alot of abusive and weird partners over the years so I grew up in a violent and toxic environment, she has not had a successful long term relationship since my Dads death. \n\n I am autistic and have afew mental health problems myself, but I have been in and out of therapy for a long time and have done alot of work to try to better myself and work on my flaws. I have chronic illnesses and chronic pain from degenerative issues which make day to day living hard, I dont want to sound all \"woe is me\" but unfortunately this is just me being honest about what's happened and still happening to me.\n\nI absolutely LOVE animals I have grown up around all sort of animals/pets and honestly I love them more than people, they love unconditionally and my soul pet was there throughout all I've suffered in life, always there to love and comfort me in my time of need, I've never felt more loved in my life than the love I felt from them and I'll always cherish my 10+ years with them. They unfortunately passed away 2 years ago and I still struggle with the loss today. I've lost a fair few animals over the years and grief is nothing new to me, but its never any less painful each time.\n\n I was bullied relentlessly through out my educational years and even in the workplace, I'm abit different and maybe a lil weird but I will never understand why I've been bullied the way I have, I always try to be kind and caring to people and will always have someone's back, but sadly its never reciprocated and I have faced my bullies alone.\nAll this and I still strive to be a good and kind person as for me, kindness is my default and I never want to or intend to hurt anyone. Thanks to all the bullying I have alot of self-esteem and self worth issues that I deal with but will always try and make others feel good about themselves.\n I've suffered through multiple physically and emotionally abusive relationships in my life, I'm not perfect but have never treated any of my partners the way I have been treated. \nI've been put down, called names, financially abused, hit and raped by past partner's and was sexually assaulted by a family friend, I've never received any justice for whats happened to me, and sadly they've all gotten away with it.\n\n My mum has been abusive to me and my sister growing up, shes the typical toxic, narcissistic, gaslighting and body shaming mother who hates all but one of her kids, my ED's started primarily thanks to her and her fatphobia which has inflicted lasting damage on me and my siblings. Shes hit me, verbally abused me, and been physically violent to me from ages 8 upwards, she never acknowledges her actions and has literally never said sorry or apologized to me EVER. Its almost like she is physically incapable of saying sorry to me specifically.\n Shes thrown me out the house multiple times and gaslights herself into saying that I \"moved out\" which just isnt true, the last straw was throwing me out with nowhere to go and I had to figure out everything on my own, I've lived independently ever since and even when I've been homeless theres no way I'd ever put myself through living with her ever again.\n\n I am Queer and Trans, she has not shown any respect for my identity or just me as a person. I've been out as trans for 4 years and it was pretty obvious in my teen years that I was not comfortable with my assigned birth gender.\n Shes not homophobic but is not supportive of trans identities at all and has been very open about her lack of respect for it which has been devastating to my identity and my mental health, I've done so much to help her and financially support her over the years and thanks to therapy I've realized how bad it is and have cut her out my life for good.\n\nMy sister has 2 kids, I absolutely adore them and would do anything for them, their dad has been in and out of their lives so I have helped alot with raising them and I love them like they're my own. I do NOT want children myself, I thought I did growing up but as I've gotten older I've realised that I would not be a good parent and would not want to bring children into the world with a parent that's messed up, no child deserves that.\n\n I moved away from my home town about 4 years ago to get away from the small town racism and homophobia, it was not possible for me to be who I am in that place and have been happier where I live now. \n Unfortunately this has had a negative impact on my relationship with my siblings, they make minimal to 0 effort to see me and its always me travelling to them and considering I'm disabled and they arent, seems abit unfair to me.\n I am very different from them and have different beliefs than them too, this has put a strain on our relationships, our political beliefs are not the same and sadly they're quite closed minded and disrespectful towards foreign, womens, and trans/queer rights. They say the apple doesnt fall far from the tree, but I fell and rolled off a cliff away from them and their beliefs.\n\n So now I'm faced with a dilemma, back away and barely or never see my sisters kids again, allowing them to be raised in this environment, or sit and allow my family to continue to disrespect me, my identity, and my beliefs.\n Its heartbreaking cus I have just 1 friend who understands, loves, and respects me, I have no one else and spending most of my life being and feeling alone is taking its toll. I try so hard to make friends and find partners but I always end up alone. Feeling alienated from my family is awful as family means so much to me but I clearly dont matter to them in the same way. \n\n Sorry this was long but I just needed to scream something into the internet void about how I feel as I cant talk to my family about things as it just causes arguments.\n\nThank you for reading",

    "selftext": "This happened over the passed weekend, and I feel like I'm digging myself out of a ditch I didn't even realize I was in. . .\n\nIt started with a lunch date with my best friend (just gonna use BFF, because I can't be 100% sure she doesn't use reddit) and one of her daughters. She had promised a lunch date to me for my birthday last month, but between her kids getting sick and then her and her husband getting sick, we had to push the date back a while. I had no problem with that, since myself and my husband have been putting out fires (figuratively, we're government/federal workers) at work with all the latest shenanigans happening in the government.\n\nThe lunch date started out great, getting hugs from them, her daughter saying that she misses myself and my husband (their kids call us aunt and uncle), and catching up with how their household is doing. Just before this lunch date, my BFF asked me to talk to her second oldest about possibly getting a job at where I work, as he had a phone interview and was super nervous about what to say/ask. Now the kid is 19 so obviously he won't start off anywhere high up, and he would have to wait for a security clearance background check to go through anyways, but I gave him all the information I could about the culture down in the shipyard where he would be working and what he should ask and what he should steer clear from in his answers. My BFF knows I started in the shipyard as a janitor and knows that I had a great reputation around everyone I worked with, so my name carries a little bit of weight as a hard worker down there.\n\nContext before his interview: My BFF admitted to not knowing how to help her son out, because she had been out of the workforce as a stay at home mom for nearly 20 years. So she didn't know how to prep him for his first formal interview. Hence why she called me.\n\nBut at the lunch date, the first thing she says about the interview is that she was trying to answer the questions for her son, because she was standing right next to him. And then made it a point to tell the interviewer that she was well informed of the interview process because she interviews people in real estate now. I was caught off guard by this sudden admission from her, and just kinda stared at her, knowing full well that she just speared her son's chances of getting into the company. But I didn't want to say anything negative about her or her process in front of her daughter, so I bit my lip and said that hopefully he'll get a call back.\n\nThen we met up at their house over the weekend for drinks and a late dinner, because BFF's husband has been saying he wants to hang out with my husband. And it dawned on my husband and myself that no matter what we said to them, they would never actually listen to us. Once the kids scattered to their rooms and play areas, my husband brought up the fact that he's stressed about losing his new job with the federal government because of the probationary period he's still in. He's a manager and has been working long days to overhaul his department and get them back up to code and has been getting praises from way higher up people, and has been invited to DC to speak about the changes that have to occur.\n\nBut from their reactions, you would think he was a toddler coming up to our best friends with his latest Macaroni noodle art. The two of them just gave a sympathetic grunt, and BFF's husband just said \"Yeah, sucks for you dude.\" And then proceeded to say how he was so busy with his job that he couldn't work his side gig in real estate any more on the clock. . .\n\nAnd the worst offender, was when my husband was talking about a certain email he had to respond to, that everyone in the government has been criticizing. Because, the individual asking for the information is not read into any of the programs and therefore cannot ask for the information that he wants to see. And all BFF's husband could say was \"Well he has a security clearance with NASA or something like that, so he can ask for it.\"\n\nFull. Blown. Brainwashed. We left the house after finishing up the movie we were watching, and as soon as we got in the car, we lost it. Security clearances do not work like that, Need to Know does not work like that, and sharing sensitive information DOES. NOT. WORK. LIKE. THAT.\n\nThe scariest part for us, is that BFF's husband knows this, because he's also federal. The passed few days this was all my husband and myself could talk about, how we weren't taken seriously, how they've never listened to us, and how we have made excuses for them the entire time. My husband has been involved with the federal government for longer than BFF's husband has been, but because I'm the youngest of the group, they think that he is too (He's 45). And that above it all, we were faced with the only outcome of distancing ourselves from our friends, or who we thought were our friends.\n\nAnd what is killing me the most, is that we are invested in their kids lives too. My husband has tried to help the 2 oldest to try and get them into safe-ish positions in the military (he's a veteran and has a lot of connections), but they didn't take it. I have tried to give advice to the daughters about relationships, but was ridiculed by BFF's husband for \"meddling in their lives\". We have tried so hard to help, but have never been heard. So when BFF and her husband would vent to us about these issues we just tried to help them with, we stayed silent. Because they didn't want solutions from us, clearly.\n\nI'm just so gutted that now all I can do is look back at all my interactions with her and suddenly see them for what they were. Anytime I made a new dessert that her husband and kids loved, she had to make it next time and tell me not to make or bring anything, cuz \"The kids weren't crazy about that dessert and probably wouldn't eat it.\" When she was suddenly getting botox, lip injections, and getting her arms and legs done, after I had my own surgery to fix the muscles in my stomach, she would say \"I'll give you my botox doctor and he can add to your lips and get rid of your forehead scar.\" I do have a large scar on my forehead from chicken pox and poison ivy as a 7 year old, but I've learned to embrace it and love it after years of bullying for it. Then recently with the job interview questions for her son; why is what I am and good at a threat to her?\n\nI just feel lost and sick when I think about this stuff, and hate that after 5 some years of friendship, myself and my husband no longer have best friends.",

    "selftext": "\nI have to be as vague as possible because if this company is identified and they figure out who I am, not even kidding\u2014I feel like they\u2019ll come looking. Lol. No joke, this privately owned would be fortune 500, corporate giant makes Black Mirror feel a little too real. Some real Dr. Evil, shark tank with piranhas type stuff, lol. \n\nThe company I work for is responsible for just about everything plastic. If it\u2019s plastic packaging, there\u2019s a good chance it passed through here. I live in a place so small it\u2019s not even a town\u2014it\u2019s officially considered a village. No McDonald\u2019s, barely any businesses, and one massive factory that showed up about 20 years ago and just kept growing. What started as a laid-back, trustworthy workplace with great pay eventually expanded into multiple buildings and became the town\u2019s biggest employer. Then, after a major buyout, billions of dollars started flowing through, and everything changed.\n\nNow, you can\u2019t step into one of the two gas stations or small handful of stores without seeing someone wearing the company shirt they hand out. But when outside corporate interests took over, they started bringing in their own people, handing out management positions to friends, and running the place like a private club. And once a company gets big enough in a small town, there\u2019s no accountability. What used to be a solid job turned into something straight out of an HBO drama.\n\nThe usual corporate nonsense got worse\u2014fudging time cards, sexism, favoritism, and \u201cadjusting\u201d drug test results after major accidents. But it doesn\u2019t stop there. We\u2019re talking covering up assaults, extreme drug use, high-ranking executives (not saying how high, just in case) cheating and keeping mistresses in plain sight in the giant glass HR building, and full-blown criminal activity.\n\nOne of the company\u2019s truck drivers had a history of drinking on the job and multiple DUIs. One day, he drank before his shift and ended up ending a motorcyclist. After what I can only assume was a ton of money changing hands, it was swept under the rug. No company name in the news, just one vague article about a \u201ctruck driver.\u201d In a town this size, that should have been the biggest headline of the year. Instead? Nothing. When you work here long enough, you start to feel like they could make you disappear if you did something they didn\u2019t like.\n\nI\u2019m not some high-ranking executive\u2014I\u2019m just a few steps above entry-level, still working on the factory floor. But over time, I\u2019ve pieced things together\u2014between constantly signing paperwork \u201cagreeing to their policies\u201d, overhearing the right conversations, and befriending a supervisor who introduced me to a high-ranking corporate employee who was a little too trusting with their secrets. I still consider these people friends, but the work environment is toxic, and after enough time, it starts to mess with your sanity.\n\nWe work 12-hour shifts, and if you think workplace screaming matches are rare, try several a night. The corporate systems they claim improve production don\u2019t actually work, which throws everything into chaos. Meanwhile, the building manager\u2014who\u2019s supposed to oversee operations\u2014 regularly sleeps for half the shift, hides in a janitor\u2019s closet, and watches movies. But if we stray from their broken systems? It\u2019s not pretty. You can get written up for not wearing gloves while using a tape measure, and speaking up about only getting one 10-minute break in a 12-hour shift is a quick way to get fired, no questions asked.\n\nAnd before you ask, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just leave?\u201d\u2014well, the pay was really good then, and it\u2019s REALLY good now, and in a small town with almost no other high-paying jobs, that\u2019s not an easy decision.\n\nI want to highlight two specific incidents that really set the tone for what kind of company this is. I have plenty more stories I\u2019d be willing to share if anyone is interested.\n\nFirst, not long ago, an employee\u2014who, to be fair, was very good at their job\u2014had a serious problem with anger and violent outbursts. Whether there was something personal going on, I don\u2019t know, but there\u2019s no excuse for the level they took it to. We\u2019re talking constant verbal abuse to all of his peers, throwing heavy and sharp objects, and even threatening to end multiple coworkers\u2014while openly keeping a weapon in his vehicle.\n\nThe company\u2019s solution? Slap a \u201cNo weapons\u201d sticker on the door and call it a day.\n\nOne time, during a rage fit over a production issue, he threw a metal holder containing a sharp industrial blade. It hit a coworker\u2014fortunately, the injury wasn\u2019t severe, but it was serious enough that it should have led to real consequences. Instead, behind closed doors, the injured employee was convinced to stay quiet, promised that \u201caction would be taken.\u201d Nothing happened.\n\nThat same injured employee weeks later asked for a break after eight hours of nonstop hard labor and hinted that he might speak up about what had happened to him if he didn\u2019t at least get a few minutes to eat. The next day? He was fired.\n\nThe guy who threw the blade? Still works here, no consequences.\n\nAnd the man who was fired? One of the hardest-working, most respectable guys I\u2019ve ever met. This one really gets to me.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about one of the biggest food (specific product not named) companies in the country. My company is pretty much the sole provider of all product for them, and there\u2019s a strict rule in place: a specific banned chemical cannot be used in any production\u2014not just in their products, but in any product we run, period.\n\nTo keep the contract, we get frequent audits. When that happens? A full-scale cover-up goes into motion. That banned chemical is hidden on the highest warehouse shelves, fake labels are created, and paperwork mentioning it is thrown out and replaced after. Employees in charge of this are explicitly told to make sure nothing with the chemical\u2019s name is left visible.\n\nIf this information ever got out, I can guarantee that contract would be terminated immediately.\n\nThe deeper you go in corporate manufacturing, the more you realize\u2014ethics are a PR stunt, safety is a technicality, and cover-ups are just business as usual.\n\nSorry for the long read, but if you made it this far, I seriously appreciate it. Just had to get some of this off my chest.",

    "selftext": "I'm a teacher-librarian at an elementary school in my tenth year and it has become increasingly apparent that this is not the job for me. Despite not wanting to be another statistic in the world of education, I need to get out before I completely lose it.  \n\nReading and libraries used to be my life. I would spend countless hours reading books and browsing through the stacks in libraries. Whenever I traveled, my first stop was always the library. Growing up, no one ever doubted that I'd become a librarian. Life took some twists and turns along the way but I finally finally made it back to the libraries I love. \n\nNow I fucking HATE IT. Along with anything else that used to give me joy in life. \n\nI used to love to go hiking, shopping, working out, just be out and about for no reason at all, but now all I do is crawl into bed and sleep until the next morning. And calling it sleep is very generous. Running on about four hours of sleep has become standard, and don't think that the lack of sleep contributing to my overall feelings about life has gone over my head. Problem is that nightmares about going back to work wake me up and fretting over the students for several hours after makes sleep a luxury for me. \n\nI'm sick of spending the majority of my day managing behaviors. I'm sick of trying to find engaging lessons for the students to absolutely not be able to handle it. I'm sick of the constant NOISE, the SCREAMING, and the VIOLENCE. Why is violence the first thing these kids turn to? I'm sick of these kids leaving the library and the books in pieces, acting as though they haven't had me since kindergarten and know how the library is supposed to be kept. I'm sick of the students acting like it's their first goddamn day on Earth. I'm sick of hearing the phrase \u201cI'm sorry\u201d and just watching them do it again five minutes later. I told one girl that her apology had less meaning than a pig's fart and I don't even feel bad saying that. I'm sick of their entitlement, and how they think they deserve to take every piece of me without giving a modicum of respect in return. I'm sick of getting excited and emotional over a book I bought the students, thinking that they'll like it, just for them to roll their eyes. It's like these kids have only two settings: mean little bastards or asleep. \n\nI used to be a creative. I used to spend my free time drawing, painting, knitting, and writing. Boy, how I loved to write! I looked at some old Google docs of my stories and I miss that girl, the one who could spin worlds out of nothing and create endearing and courageous characters. But that girl is dead. I couldn't write even if you pointed a gun to my head. These goddamn energy sucking vampires disguised as children left me bereft of any emotion, willpower, or desire to do anything. \n\nI can't even distract myself in the company of other people. The single life has plagued me for over two years and I want to get into dating, but I'm such a miserable person that I don't think it's fair to subject someone to the unpleasant experience of being in my presence. I barely want to be in my own company. The only other people I occasionally hang out with are other teachers, so our primary form of entertainment is drinking and trauma dumping. \n\nI don't even like reading anymore. Reading! For a librarian! I pick up a book and it reminds me of school, a straight up hell, and that's enough to turn me off. \n\nThe thought of having to do this for another twenty years drives me to despair. Can you believe I used to win teaching awards? I used to be a good teacher. I don't know where I went wrong.\n\nLike, the only thing that is keeping me here is my dog and she's 13 years old. (But with a lot of spunk!) Once she's gone, I won't know what to do with myself.\n\nSo, like, I don't know what my aim is with this. The jobs here are pay a fucking joke and I already feel like a failure enough that losing my house will definitely send me over the edge. So here I am, day after day, spending the better part of my life with people I hate. \n",

There was no real effort to acknowledge me, apart from one guy who asked me a couple questions. There was no room for me to speak, and when i did id get weird looks. There was just no place for me there. I dont blame them for that, I'm an intruder in their group technically.\n\n  \nSo I get back to the dorm. And I go to bed, and I think; \"I know I don't fit in, but thats not horrible, at least ive got some people to sit with.\"\n\n  \nI go to dinner the following day. I sit down with my food. That group comes in, the ones who i sat with. 'oh, nice. maybe they'll come back to sit with me'. I wait.\n\nThey sit down on the other side of the room. Some of them glance at me while they eat. I tried not to look at them. I don't want to look too desperate.\n\n  \nI walk back to my room. Have a brief panic attack. \n\n  \nIt's been a month, and i am truly, utterly alone.",

How could your love really be genuine, when you said other women were perfect, but I wasn't. You had your definition of perfection and made me desperately want to change to suit that definition when deep down I knew I couldn't be what you wanted. Thank you for showing me what fake love looks like. I saw you are improving to find your perfect one. I'm glad I don't feel love for you anymore, it was holding us both back to find happiness and becoming the best version of ourselves. I forgive you for treating me like an option and not appreciating my love. I'm glad it's over. I wouldn't have said yes to your planned proposal. I hope you'll find your dream korean wife with blonde dyed hair, double E cups, who's willing to birth your child, get drunk every weekend and love your flaws, because I couldn't. \n",

    "selftext": " This happened years ago but I still remember it vividly. Honestly it was one of the worst nights of my life. I was around 13-14 at the time. It was mid December. A week before Christmas. I met him online but I forgot how. He was 19 and average looking. \n\n He lived only a two hour walk away. I remember I waited till it was around 12 pm. He came over to pick me up and I snuck out of the house. (He picked me up). It was very awkward. When we got to his place he told me to be quiet because his grandmother was there or something. Honestly it was so weird. Red flags all around but I was too nervous to do anything. \n\n I remember lil peep- Beamer boy was playing quietly in his room when it happened. It was a messy room. It had red LED strips around the room. We sat on his bed and had a very awkward conversation that I don\u2019t remember. He kept scooting closer and I kept awkwardly scooting away. His bed was in the corner so soon I had no room to scoot. \n\n His phone was ringing over and over but he ignored it and let it ring. Turns out it was his girlfriend but I was too scared to protest. I didn\u2019t want to sleep with him. And him having a girlfriend made me want to sleep with him even less. I did NOT want to be there but everything was so sketchy. I felt I had no choice but to go along with it. After all he was bigger, older and stronger then me. \n\n Anyways I was in the corner of his bed, I was scared but I didn\u2019t show it, or at least I don\u2019t think it showed. I tried not to seem scared. But I was terrified and I was sweating. He was rubbing my thighs and leaning closer and closer. I felt like I was suffocating. Thing is I didn\u2019t tell him \u2018no\u2019. I just kept awkwardly trying to start a conversation. Awkwardly moving his hand away. It was clear I did not want it. \n\n His hands trailed from my thighs to my.. you know. He fingered me for a while. I hated it. I wasn\u2019t even aroused. I did not want it. It was awkward as hell do. I wanted it to stop as quickly as possible so I just faked it. Faked an orgasm because I was worried if I didn\u2019t he\u2019d hurt me or worse. \n\n That\u2019s when he stood up and started undoing his pants. He put a condom on I\u2019ll give him that. That\u2019s when he turned off the lights and all there was, was the glow of the red LED lights, dimmed all the way. It didn\u2019t last long. But I hated every second he was inside me and the phone was still ringing. He didn\u2019t look at me. He didn\u2019t even finish. He got frustrated and pulled out, threw the condom out, and walked me out of his apartment and called his girlfriend and left me outside. \n\n Remember when I told you it was December? Yeah. It was snowing. And no not a light dusting. It was snowing hard. My jacket and pants were still in his room. I had to walk home on my own, alone, in the middle of a storm in nothing but underwear and a long tshirt. No one pulled over to help. I was crying the whole way home. I was too embarrassed and ashamed to call my mother to pick me up. \n\n I remember frantically texting friends to call me. Only person who was awake was someone from a group chat a friend put me in ages ago. I never talked to him personally. But he called me. Tried to comfort me the whole 2 hour walk home. My feet were frost bitten and my legs were cramping and sore when I did get home. My mother was still asleep so I snuck back into my room. He stayed on the phone all night that night. Became my friend. \n\nI\u2019m happy he was there for me. He was a good friend. I was close with him for years. Recently we drifted apart but I\u2019m thankful for him being in my life even if he wasn\u2019t in my life for long. \n\nAnyways I just wanted to tell someone. It has been bugging me for years. If you read it all, thank you and I hope it didn\u2019t trigger anyone. I just needed to get it off my chest. And no my mother still doesn\u2019t know. ",

    "selftext": "Not an English speaker.\n\nSo yesterday i texted on our group chat if someone was free to help me to take my things since i'm moving out of my house to transfer to a new country for my job due to a big promotion. When i texted it i for real thought that maybe a few of them would come cause i know by myself that everyone have his life, his troubles so for real i wasn't expecting much of it but like always they surprised me.\n\nI didn't checked the replies until this morning cause i was busy packing stuff, trying to understand what to do with the house( if selling it or maybe rent it) and while i was at the phone with a friend who is a real estate agent i heard the door bell ring and i thought that a few friends was there to help me but when i opened it they weren't just a few but actually 10 of them were there with boxes ready to raid my house of my things.(i told them for free cause i didn't had time to sell them)\n\nWell i got surprised and after like 3 hours my house was empty of all my things and only the fornitures remained there. During this hours we all joked, laughed and they always made jokes about raiding the house of the rich asshole. I mean it was truly heartwarming seeing how much they helped me with my unwanted stuff and how they were for real there for me when i nedeed the most. After they emptied my house i proposed lunch and that i was paying for it because they helped me a lot and after a bit of hesitation they accepted it.\n\nMaybe sometimes i give for granted the fact that i always have them on my side but when things like this happens i realize for real how lucky i'm to have them with me and how easy is for me having them.\n\nRight now i'm home finishing to pack my last stuff and reorganizing the last things but i can't stop thinking at this morning and thanking to have them on my side.\n\nThis night we have organized a night out with all of us as one of the last moments of all of us together before my travel to my new country and believe me when this things happens, and i take them for granted, i can't stop smiling and saying to myself that i might be overselective with my friends and the poeple i want around me but whenever i ask for help they are always there for me so my overselection have a meaning after all ahahah.",

    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been going out with my boyfriend, both mid 20s, for about half a year now. He doesn\u2019t drink but I\u2019ll be honest, I like to go out and have fun from time to time. I don\u2019t drink often but sometimes when I\u2019m out with friends, I can get a bit carried away. I know my limits and never get blackout drunk but I certainly can get past the point of \u201ctipsy\u201d on occasion. My boyfriend often likes to come along even though he doesn\u2019t drink. When he does come along, he\u2019s my dd, which is very nice of him. \n\nBeing self aware of my flaws unfortunately doesn\u2019t make them go away. When I drink, I hate to be alone. I get unbearably lonely when I\u2019m left alone drunk. I\u2019m a happy drunk, complete life of the party until there\u2019s nobody around, then suddenly it is the most soul crushing experience. Usually I can just go to bed the minute I get home and sleep through the worst of it, but it\u2019s not always what I end up doing. \n\nWhen he\u2019s around and I\u2019ve gotten past the point of tipsy, I end up practically begging him not to drop me off at home. Usually, I flirt and when I do, he listens. He takes me back to his house. Of course, we end up having sex every time. Then in the morning, I always wake up feeling used and bitter. I know I shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m the one who initiates, after all. It\u2019s not like he would ever force himself on me. But I feel like I can\u2019t say anything about it to him because I\u2019m the one who starts things and I would hate for him to feel bad about the whole thing. \n\nAll of my exes refused to touch me when I\u2019d been drinking and they hadn\u2019t so this is entirely new territory for me. I know the real answer here is to stop going out drinking with him but we seriously always have fun when we go out. It\u2019s just the after part that makes me feel bad. ",

We all got drunk and it was clear S was very into us.\nWhat at first was uncomfortable flirting quickly worked on H, before I knew they were both kissing in front of me ...wich I hated, but then H hitted me with the \"join us or we are over\"\nAfraid like the little idiot I was I complied, joined in what is to this day one of my most shameful nights, not only in bed but because they made me lie to N.\n\nFor the next few months I was like dead in life, following H and S with everything, be it more parties, slandering and victim blaming N or hearing them play with other girls.\n\nAt this point is where O appears.... O was the first shining of light in a dark time, we clicked immediately, we talked a lot, enjoyed many things together and Honestly just understood each other a lot.\n\nAt the time I thought \"hey if we are already in a open relationship whats wrong with me having another partner\" well the things was I wasn't, it was one of those situations were the relationship was open for a person but not for the other.\nH and S had both other partners but it was a problem when I did, because then I stopped being their little errand girl. \n\nThe breakup was nuclear, it was 2 months of whole on fighting and cussing at each other, O was there for me the entire time and helped me understand a lot of my own feelings.\nWhile at the same time I had to see H become the worst version of herself, getting drunk and violent.\nProbably only didn't hit me because S stopped her.... cause oh boy she did in previous fights.\n\nI parted ways with both of them, moved cities to be closer to O and let me tell you ...life has never been better, O helped me rebuild a bridge with my family, to rebuild a sense of self confidence.\nWhere I have been fearful or anxious before, O was only supportive and understanding\nShe helped me see many things of my previous relationship how they were, the stoy of lies, manipulation and isolation that i refused to see in the past, with O I feel loved not like a versi\u00f3n of me wich \"I could growing into\" but as truly me.\nO has encouraged me to get into a masters degree and I've encouraged to fix the relationship with her family too.\n\nAnd while I miss the friend H was from time to time, I am happy to be where I am\nI wish both H and S a happy life together too, I hope they don't get to toxic to each other and to grow into better people too.\nTo N, I wish I could apologize properly but understandably she blocked me from any form of contact and Honestly I don't blame her, hope she is having a great time living all the adventures she wanted too.\n\nAnd as for me....Honestly, O is the love of my life and even of we've been together for little more than a year and a half ive decided once I get my masters degree and get the chance to compete for better paying jobs I will marry this person and try to live our best life together.\nI swear i will try to make O the happiest on earth because honestly she already made me the happiest.\nI've never wanted to live my life as much as I do now and it's all thanks to her.\n\nWe are playing yakuza like a pirate and going to watch the new gundam movie next weekend Soni think we are on a great start for a rest of out life. \n\nIf there's is anything to learn here, just remember, you do not deserve the minimum effort nor crumbs of affection, you all deserve to be loved for who you are.\nDare to break free form your status quo and be happy, believe you deserve to love and be loved\n\nP.d.\n please don't cheat on your partners, even polyamory has to be properly consensuated and agreed upon or else is cheating too\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "What do i do? Sometimes i feel like my mom can just be the worst. She can be so rude, immature, and she acts like a teenager. Am i wrong for thinking this? I keep switching between self pity and guilt because i just have no idea if this is normal or not, because all in all she is my mom and i love her very much but sometimes when i witness some of my friends relationships with their mothers i feel tears come to my eyes, literally. Basically for context i graduated from high school four months ago and im only going to university next year so taking a gap year to travel and work and i'm leaving overseas in three months. So basically my day to day just consists of learning the piano, trying to find a job,  reading a bit, organising my OE, and occasionally hanging out with friends. \n\nToday i was watching Tv which to be honest i rarely rarely do, and out of nowhere she comes storming in with a horrible attitude and my heart just immediately starts racing because for some reason, I can never fully relax around her. I'm just always on edge, even the sound of her footsteps gives me anxiety. She starts complaining and getting angry at me, basically muttering 'this lazy bitch' etc to herself because she was working and didnt have time for lunch yet while i was sitting infront ofthe TV. I mean am i wrong for getting a bit uncomfortable and weirded out by that? Just because I feel like she shouldnt be comparing herself to me and it just feels very immature and strange, like is it entitled for me to think yes well your the adult and i'm not sure why your comparing yourself to your teenage daughter? Like she was trying to guilt trip me. Shes just always angry and taking shots at me, and it feels so weird because I'm the one that has to endure her tantrums and I've learnt not to react or give her my emotions and try and just stay level. Its to the point where if she does decide to be nice to me i just get sad, or even angry, because its like i cant even enjoy it because i know it wont last. Its like she flips a switch depending on her mood. It reallly feels like im on eggshells when im in the same room as her and it almost feels stuffy and hard to breathe. Like i just cant enjoy myself or let my mind be at rest, im always aware of where she is and what shes doing and when she leaves the room i can breathe.\n\n I understand to an extent why she is so angry and frustrated with me all the time, but its just upsetting because i feel like i can count on one hand the amount of times she speaks to me nicely in a week. To  be honest my room is a pigstye and i know it and i hate it too but im just in a bit of a rut right now and i know its bad and ive been trying to clear it step by step but its very overwhelming for me and i dont blame her for being frustrated about it. But I was finally makin some progress the other day and packing my dirty clothes into one basket and organising them in the other, and then i go to bed and leave it for the next day to put away. I wakeup and the clothes are thrown everywhere around the room and i hear her yelling that i shouldnt be using the baskets she needs for laundry or something like that. To be honest i wasnt really even suprised or angry. But today i decided to sort of get back at her a bit which i know is immature but i couldnt realy control my emotions and when i get angry i dont yell back or argue i just do something small to the other person which sort of calms down my head, so i squirted a bit of ketchup from my lunch onto the carpet. It was really only a dollar coin size, but i go back to my room and i hear her storming down the stairs and throwing open my door and starting to scream at me about it. I just really am at a loss and dont know if its me or if its her. ",

    "selftext": "I was 18 when I had my first born. Between no support system and post partum depression, I never bonded with her. It was just me and her, I would ask my friends to watch her her while I worked to be able to afford daycare so I could make a life for me and her, yet I still never felt any connection with her. I knew it wasn\u2019t her fault, she never asked for me to be her mother. I told myself I would push through and hope for a better future. I despised her. Her cries sounded like nails on a chalk board and I would end up crying after taking care of her. I still reminded myself, she never asked for me to be her mother, I had to push through. My post partum depression progressed, I never got treatment because of fear. I feared she would be taken away from me because of how we were living. Section 8, a messy house, not having enough food for both of us. I always gave her my meals, what little there was. I went from 150 to 114 in a very short amount of time. I was hungry, tired, overwhelmed, but she never asked for me to be her mother. \n\nHer father came back into our lives when she was around 14 months. It felt like my saving grace. Maybe we could be a little family and have a home full of love and laughter. He was a drunk. I was still alone with my daughter, and now, I had the heavy burden of having someone in my house that *could* help but chose not to. 2 months later I fell pregnant again. I was horrified when I found out. I couldn\u2019t restart everything again. I kept her because of a previous miscarriage. I felt it wasn\u2019t right for me to be ungrateful. I had a rough pregnancy. I was very depressed and had a turbulent relationship. He left me constantly during my pregnancy. He said cruel things. It only got worse when I had to go on maternity leave. I was called lazy and a bad mother for not working up until I gave birth. My daughter was born 10lbs 1oz, I was exhausted and I hurt severely.\n\nMy second daughter was born and everything was so easy. I connected with her immediately. She was such a happy baby. She never cried just to cry. She only cried when she needed something. When I took care of her needs, there was no crying. She was happy and content at such a young age. I realized *this* is what motherhood was supposed to feel like. It wasn\u2019t supposed to feel like a burden, I wasn\u2019t supposed to secretly despise my child, I wasn\u2019t supposed to be angry at a helpless newborn. Havjng my second really changed me. I was so much more nice to my first, I still found her annoying most of the time, but I felt I loved her for the first time. \n\nIt was short lived unfortunately. The post partum depression returned when my youngest was 7-8 months. She was still the apple of my eye, but I turned my hatred to my oldest again. That was the moment I realized I needed to consider adoption. How could a mother hate her child? As the months went on I found myself not giving affection towards her. I would ignore her tantrums and yell at her for them. I would tell her no when she asked if I could hold her. I stopped kissing her forehead or cheeks. She wasn\u2019t an easy child since birth, but it got so much worse as she aged. I laid in bed next to her and admitted to myself, I hate my own child. I hated her as I would hate a person who has done wrong by me for years. The night finally came I had enough. I had been trying to put her to bed for an hour. Hearing screaming, being kicked, having my hair pulled. I snapped. I pinched her. Hard. Multiple times until she fell asleep. Then once more after she fell asleep. The same punishment my mother would do to me. I was turning into my mother. The person I promised myself I would never be like. I had the most rude awakening that night and cried for hours after she went to bed. I took her to the CPS office the following morning and told them I couldn\u2019t be her mother anymore. That was all I said. I left her in the waiting room. I didn\u2019t hug her, I didn\u2019t kiss her, I just left. It ate at me for years and still does. I was the only person she knew in her life. I knew her finding a loving family was better than having a mother like me. I moved a few states away 2 days after. I didn\u2019t want to be found. I didn\u2019t want any possibility of them trying to return her to me because I knew I did this for her own good. It was the only genuine loving gesture I had to offer her since she was born. They never reached out or tried to find me, as far as I knew. \n\nI still carry the guilt and shame. I still cry for her. How confused and scared she must have been to never see her mother again. Why couldn\u2019t I be the mother she deserved? 2 1/2 years of thinking the bare minimum was the most love she would ever receive. I\u2019m glad I gave her up. Not for me, but for her. I searched through multiple schools near my old town a few days ago. I found her. I took the information I had and found her as well as her adoptive family on Facebook. She has an amazing life. She looks radiant in every picture I found of her. She\u2019s absolutely gorgeous. I know I couldn\u2019t have given her that life. I hope this was a selfless act, not selfish. I hope she doesn\u2019t remember me. \n\nI married and had one more daughter. I\u2019m so in love with my 2 other children which brings a perpetual guilt to my life. I wish I could\u2019ve been her mother. I still mourn her. I haven\u2019t allowed myself to feel negatively about giving her up, only for the way I treated her. It was for her. She never asked to have a mother like me, so I gave her to a mother that could love her the way she deserved. ",

    "selftext": "For the record, I have not, nor will I, cheat on my partner. Yes, I do love them, our sex life just really sucks. I would be lying if I said that at least once a day, I didn\u2019t I wish was with someone else because they can\u2019t give me what I want/need. \n\nFor context, we\u2019re both kinky but my partner wayyy over stated their desires regarding BDSM when we first started dating. They also wayyyyyyyyyyyy undersold how intense their specific fetish is. I don\u2019t want to list it here because it\u2019s specific enough you\u2019d likely find them. Regardless, their fetish impacts out daily lives in negative ways because we can\u2019t go out and do things as freely. Disclosure: I don\u2019t mind the fetish, it\u2019s just not my thing. I\u2019ve incorporated it into our sex life because I know my partner likes it, but I\u2019m tired of always giving and never getting. I\u2019m so bored and so tired of bringing it up and getting nothing in return. \n\nI love my partner. We been living together for awhile now. They truly are my best friend and I can\u2019t imagine my life without them. But I feel manipulated and mind numbingly bored where sex is concerned. To the point I don\u2019t even want to handle myself. All the effort in the beginning with the big talk and at least *trying* the things I\u2019m into (it\u2019s honestly not that crazy and they said they wanted it too), it all feels like it was a ploy to get me and get invested in the relationship. Basically once they knew I was all in, rug pull with anything kinky going out the door. \n\nI fantasize daily about being able to come home to my sweet and loving partner after being with a better matched sexual partner. I don\u2019t want them to change. Their sweet and wholesome and kind nature is part of why I love them. Other than our sex life, everything is perfect. I wish I didn\u2019t have these thoughts.

I sit at a computer for so long my posture has gotten terrible. I've tried YouTube channels with timers, a self shocking watch, back straps. Yet it still shows up and bleeds to outside work. I even have a standing desk.\n\nMeals become easy to miss because I wrap myself in work (which comes and goes). So I'm thinner build as result.\n\nMy own self communication and arguably articulation of thoughts has gotten worse from working remotely I rarely interact with anyone except my fiance. \n\nI try not to use social media or be on my phone. I want to reduce screentime but it at the same time i'm almost more isolated and out of touch with the world. I've never had a knack for learning names or being able to follow sports which is arguably the easiest conversation starter so that's a bit of a bummer.\n\nThe lack of exposure to people, and social media I'd arguably say has made me  dumber as a person. I get less time communicating, forming sentences and even articulating my own biased/educated views on topics.

Losing all enthusiasm to life? \n\nDo other people feel this way? I just don't get it. I don't like living like this. I recently bought things to get in shape but I still worry that I'm too uneducated or fell too far behind from my single minded career focused brain. I even get a small fear that I'll let my fiance down by not having meaningful communications if I stay on the track. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm looking for advice, someone to placate me or sanity check that people typically be human easier then me and that I'm actually the issue. \n\nI'm aware I need to be my own change or see a therapist but why not ask a world of strangers first I guess...",

    "selftext": "I\u2019m doing this on my phone, so excuse the formatting! And also excuse the rambling. \n\nUpto 2023, my marriage was on good footing. But then my physical and mental health took a nose dive. I lost interest in sex and I couldn\u2019t explain why to my husband because I didn\u2019t know why. My migraines were coming at 6-7 a week (yes, almost daily and lasting 6-12 hrs long) and I was having issues with bleeding most of the time. I have several other medical obstacles, and I am considered disabled by social security. I closed off thinking my husband didn\u2019t want to hear about my petty complaints. \n\nHousework became his responsibility as well as cooking dinner on top of working full time.  (I can\u2019t work due to my physical and mental health) He was overwhelmed and asked if I could cook dinners again. I did for about two weeks and then I couldn\u2019t because my migraines were making it hard to smell food, let alone eating it. \n\nMy day basically was laying in bed all day listening to audiobooks to try to get my mind off the pain of the migraines. Then at the end of May I had a needle biopsy of my thyroid come back abnormal (most likely cancerous) and that made me spiral more. That\u2019s when I got a text from an angry husband telling me that my husband was seeing his wife. This happened within a few days of finding out I needed to get my thyroid out. It was not a good week to say the least. \n\nI immediately confronted my husband with the text and he confessed it true. I thought it was only an emotional affair but he said it became physical back in April when he went on a Writers retreat with several people (or so I thought). It turns out it was just her and my husband. I completely lost it and was sobbing in his arms. (This was not his first affair) I asked him to break it off and go into counseling with me, but he said no. He cared for her and didn\u2019t want to lose or hurt her. This was a major blow to me. \n\nI had been seeing a therapist for a while, but she retired. So a week before I found out about my thyroid I started seeing a new counselor. On my second appointment with her was a mess. I told my counselor about my thyroid and of my husband cheating. We had just celebrated our 25th anniversary before I had found out. I started having suicidal thoughts and told her about them. I even had a plan to carry out the suicide, involving ODing on one of my meds. She urged me to get a lockbox for that med and give the keys to my husband. \n\nHe still loves me, but was not in love with me anymore. He, our 15 yr old son, and I talked about the drug issue and it was decided for my safety that either my son or my husband would portion out the day\u2019s worth of med about an hour before I was due to take it. We didn\u2019t tell our son the exact reason why it needed to be controlled because we didn\u2019t want to alarm him. \n\nI was spiraling down fast at this point. I stopped going to my water aerobics class and became a recluse. I didn\u2019t want to see anyone. It was hard for me to focus on conversation so I lost interest in talking at all. I was seeing my counselor weekly and my prescriber of my antidepressants, and antipsychotics monthly. That time is somewhat fuzzy in my head. \n\nAugust comes around and they took out half my thyroid. Turns out I had Medullary thyroid cancer in that half. So they needed to remove the entire thyroid ( the other half was taken out in October). That side was clean thank goodness. They had caught it before it could spread outside my thyroid. \n\nMy husband started driving to see his AP on a biweekly basis. We didn\u2019t tell anyone, not even our son for a while. We tried to keep things normalish as to not upset him. My husband and I decided to remain friends at least and he wanted a divorce. We broke the news to our son in December about us splitting up but he was the only one to know. My parents aren\u2019t the most forgiving people so we wanted to keep the news from them for as long as possible. (My relationship with my father is rocky at best)\n\nMy counselor and I were talking on a weekly basis at this point, trying to reason with me that killing myself isn\u2019t the answer. I knew I didn\u2019t want to die because of our son, but that was the only reason I could even rely on. Everything was just falling apart around me. \n\nMy husband moved out of our bedroom in December, so I was sleeping alone. And crying myself to sleep almost every night. We would talk about his day in general and about our son but that was about it. When my depression would spike and I was feeling very suicidal (at one point I tried to find the key to the medicine safe) he would talk me down. I still don\u2019t know if  that was a good thing or bad thing. \n\nAP lives 8 hours from us. So every other weekend he would drive to see her (she filed for divorce a week before they met IRL in April and in her state you have to be physically separated for a year before the divorce is finalized) her ex is an a$$ and kept harassing me and my husband. \n\nSo a year after I found out (May, 24) my husband says he wants to move in with AP so he needs to get a job there. I tell him I cannot stand to stay living in our townhouse as it has too many memories. He suggested I look for another apartment that our son and I can live in after he moves. We did just that. He started working his new job the week after we moved to a flat. (July,24) just before we moved, we had to put down one of our cats (she was fading, and we didn\u2019t think she\u2019d survive the move, plus she couldn\u2019t walk or use the litter box on her own)\n\nMoving seemed to help my mental state. I\u2019m not having as many panic attacks or psychosis\u2019s (hearing voices that aren\u2019t there) I\u2019m able to do some of the housework myself (cooking, vacuuming, keeping the kitchen wiped down, my bedroom, and my bathroom). Our son (now 16) does his own room, his bathroom, the dishes, the trash, and the kitty stuff (like feed the cat, and keep the litter clean)\n\nWe are currently working on a dissolution on our marriage. Since we don\u2019t have much (just a car, really) and our son, there isn\u2019t too much to split.  We are on the same page about spousal and child support (in the state I live in, if you\u2019re married more than 25 yrs, I get 30% of his income for the rest of our lives or until I marry again and child support until our son is 18.) \n\nOur son and I get to see my stbx every 3-4 weeks for a weekend. It\u2019s painful to be separated from him, but it also hurts to see him. I know I failed \ud83d\ude23 and it\u2019s mostly my fault our marriage ended. It\u2019s been like this for about 6 months. \n\nHe wants me to start seeing other people, but after the 2nd betrayal of trust by him, I don\u2019t know if I can trust anyone anymore. And I need trust to get close to someone else.  Thanks for listening. \n\nEdit: thank you all for your kind words. A lot of them made me cry. ",

    "selftext": "\nHey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m really struggling to figure out my career path, and I\u2019d love to hear from people who have been in similar situations. I know I\u2019ve been privileged to have the opportunity to choose between high-earning fields, but I feel stuck because I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t actually like or be good at anything.\n\nMy Main Concerns:\n\t\u2022\tDentistry: I\u2019m drawn to the stability and hands-on aspect, but I worry that the field is becoming too corporate, with private equity firms buying up practices. If that\u2019s the case, would I be better off just going into finance or private equity directly? Plus, I\u2019d be in dental school until almost 30 without making money, which makes me nervous.\n\t\u2022\tLaw/Finance: I have this vision of being a \u201claw/finance girl\u201d working in the big city, and I like the prestige and business aspects of both fields. But I also hear about brutal hours, burnout, and slow career progression. Would it be worth working my way up the corporate finance/law ladder, getting an MBA or JD, and trying to break into something lucrative?\n\t\u2022\tEntertainment Industry: A part of me is drawn to working in entertainment law, production, or the business side of Hollywood because I\u2019ve always found movie sets fascinating. But I know it\u2019s hard to break into, and I don\u2019t want to waste time chasing a dream that won\u2019t provide financial stability.\n\nWhat I Want:\n\t\u2022\tFinancial freedom and stability\n\t\u2022\tA solid career path with structure (not just bouncing around)\n\t\u2022\tGood work-life balance (time for family, travel, and personal interests)\n\t\u2022\tA mix of business and creativity (not just sitting at a desk all day)\n\t\u2022\tPotential to pivot into multiple careers\n\nI\u2019m 25 and feel behind already. I know grad school is an investment, so I want to be sure before committing. I\u2019m not naturally great at science, but I also worry that reading/writing all day in law/finance might bore me. Dentistry would give me hands-on work, but would I enjoy it long-term? Or would business and investing be the better move?\n\nWould love to hear from people who\u2019ve navigated similar crossroads. Did you regret your choice? What helped you decide? Thanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "My mom and dad have been separated since I was 13, and it was because of my dad's abuse and neglect. He has brain damage from a bad car accident and has poor impulse control as a result. Despite this I've tried my best to be on good terms as an adult, but his psycho girlfriend is too much to deal with. Her name is Cherry\n\n He started dating Cherry about 3 years ago. She's had three kids and lost them all to the system because she's too crazy to care for them (bipolar and sometimes else) she's estranged from all of them (important notes for later) she is loud, rude, quick to anger and prone to simple and complex delusions when something doesn't go her way. I'm positive the only reason my dad is still with her especially after she killed his cat (supposed by accident) is because she came into a lot of settlement money from hernia mesh complication. Since then they've been living it up together. \n\n About a week before Christmas Cherry's oldest son got hit on a moped on the highway by a big truck. He felt into a coma and is brain dead. His long term girlfriend (and mother of his son) was given power of attorney aa per his medical wishes. Now Cherry lost custody of him when he was just 9 years old and haven't spoken to her in over 5 years. She had never met her grandson or his girlfriend until she came to the hospital. Cherry immediate assumed she was in control over his medical decisions and requested the plug be pulled and openly discussed lawsuits and burials in front of his girlfriend and son. Girlfriend told her to stop and said she didn't have the right and before long Cherry is banned from seeing him and banned from the hospital as a guest forever. \n\n In Cherry's mind and version of events his girlfriends grandfather forged her sons name on the medical records declaring her to make decisions on his behalf in case of coma, the reasoning is her grandfather works for the county court (as a traffic ticket clerk) and her evidence is \"I know my son\" \n\n She's repeatedly asked my opinion on the matter because I work in critical care nursing and I've explained it multiple times as simply as I can, but she refuses to believe that a common law partner with a child of 10 years would be granted power of attorney over an estranged parent who lost custody for mental health and sex work and drug convictions. \n\n This leads me to the trap I feel in. They've been bugging me about meeting for lunch for weeks to discuss something and every time I'd ask what for they say \"we need to talk in person\" I was going to be in town that way last  Saturday so I agreed and figured a free meal and they'd stop bugging me. The day before my dad ask me to bring my notary stamp (I'm a notary, good side gig) and I press and they say \"we need you to look over some papers\" I get suspicious and stiff out what they're up to. I call them out of it and they insist that it isn't related to it... \n\n I get there we order our food, and they pull out power of attorney forms. They try to say that the court told them they just had to fill these out get them notarized and Cherry would get power of attorney over her son. I explained these forms required her son to sign them and says it doesn't because he's in a coma. I explained this was forgery and her rebuttal was \"well that bitch forged her name to take my son\" and I had to calmly explain that even if it did happen, nothing would change without a lawyer and they don't take this stuff lightly. \n\n Cherry has a melt down and accuses me of \"plotting against her\" and my dad had to get her to stop because at this point she causing scene yelling slamming her hands on the table. I get up and leave and my dad tried to call my four times before he got the message. Today he texted me saying \"why couldn't you just do it, if you're right they won't accept the form noways\" like he didn't ask me to commit a crime for his psycho girlfriend. They deserve each other and feel horrible for her children ever having to deal with crazy crack head. One day I'll never have to deal with her or my dad and I'll celibate with KFC's finest to commemorate the time they tried to bribe me with a 5$ fill up to commit forgery to get control over a person in a coma",

She does so much for me. She loves me. \n\nBut god is she unbearable. She\u2019s the black sheep of the family, so it\u2019s not just opinion. She\u2019s loud. She\u2019s annoying. She\u2019s stupid. She\u2019s a Karen. \n\nJust today she humiliated me in Walmart by nearly getting into a yelling match with an employee over $2 because \u201cit was stocked in the wrong spot and that wasn\u2019t her fault.\u201d She literally took a picture of it stocked wrong for evidence. Wouldn\u2019t let the employees talked and just kept shoving her picture on her phone in their faces.\n\nIn the car she refused to admit to any wrong doing, and she was so upset with how they treated her. I tried so hard to get her to see that the rest of the world saw her the way she saw them but she just couldn\u2019t see a world she was in the wrong. \n\nI\u2019m locked in my room crying from just embarrassment. \n\nI invited her and she visited and she helped me out and bought a ton of groceries and stuff and we had such a great time together overall, but she\u2019s constantly doing little things like this and has a long history of doing things like this. \n\nA small sampling from the most recent years includes:\n*Trying to take me to a preacher psychologist when I came out as gay at 16. \n*Inviting my brothers girlfriends but not my partners to events when I reached similar age milestones. \n*Yell at my aunt because I ranted to my aunt about my mom but \u201cmy aunt was spreading lies about my mother\u201d \n*Threaten to shoot my uncle in a discussion over who would be pallbearers at my grandmas funeral \n*Constantly shove in my face anything she ever does for me as if she\u2019s entitled to worship\n*Make everything about herself \n*Get pissed off that me and an aunt happened to run into my other aunt and see their engagement ring before her\n*Denied that she was sick after coming to Christmas with a \u201ccold\u201d and 5 of us had the flu the next week including an infant she was all over\n*Causing some issue at every single family gathering \n*Shes a little dumb. You can tell her soemthing and she will just not comprehend it and ask you the same exact question 3 or 4 times. \n\nShe tries to help. She tries to make up for things. Deep down I love her. I mean she used to be my best friend before I turned 15, and started to become my own person and come out and flourish. She\u2019s just someone that if she was not my mother, I wouldn\u2019t have anything to do in life. We are very different people and yeah. \n\nI guess I just feel really bad for her too. As much as she just angers me beyond all belief; I know she\u2019s sad. She\u2019s just lashing out. I wish she would get help. It sucks when you feel like you have to parent your parent. \n\nThis is a lot. It feels good to have it off my chest. It feels good to have typed it out. She leaves tomorrow. This gives me enough energy to leave my locked room and deal with her for the rest of the night. I hope the $2 was worth the mental distress she caused her son. ",

    "selftext": "So, I (20M) and my boyfriend (32M) have been in a relationship for about a year. Before I started dating him, I was very active on Grindr and had multiple hookups.\n\nJust to give you some context:\n\nI really think my boyfriend is an attractive man, and he is very sweet and kind to me. Yes, we do have a big age gap (which I initially liked because I\u2019ve always been into older men, but now I feel kind of insecure about it since he already works, has his own apartment, and can do whatever he wants, while I\u2019m in college living with my parents). But that\u2019s not the problem.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been feeling very turned off by him. It\u2019s not that the sex isn\u2019t good, but I really miss going out with different guys, and I don\u2019t know why. I mean, I still think he\u2019s attractive, but I kind of want to sleep around again (even though I felt very empty when I did that before). It\u2019s also been almost two months since we last had sex.\n\nI study medicine and don\u2019t have much time to see him\u2014we usually only see each other on Sundays\u2014so it\u2019s not like I\u2019d have time to go on multiple dates or anything again. But I think the issue is that our relationship has reached that phase where the initial spark has faded a little.\n\nSometimes, when I\u2019m at the gym, I catch myself looking around at other guys. My TikTok and Instagram feeds are basically just shirtless men, and I still follow some of the guys I used to flirt with, so their stories catch my attention.\n\nAt the same time, while part of me wants to break up and go back to Grindr, I also really like him, and I know he really likes me. This is my first real and longest relationship, so I don\u2019t know if what I\u2019m feeling is normal. And even if it is normal, what should I do?\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate some advice, and I\u2019m happy to answer any questions you might have.",

    "selftext": "I don't have any place to share this story because it may be too braggy so I hope to post this here.\n\nI (33M) am the eldest of my family, with my 2 siblings (32F, 29M) and my parents (almost 60). My earliest memory was of my siblings and I sleeping in a storeroom frequently visited by roaches and mice and us playing with street children. Amid this, our parents still found the money to install an AC in the storeroom and got us into the best primary and secondary school in our town. This reflects how my parents worked hard for the family while making sure that me and my siblings are living comfortably.\n\nDue to my upbringing being quite positive and never having  felt impoverished, I always thought of myself as normal, and at times, even rich. It was only during the past few years of maturity that I realised that my parents truly kept the family afloat. \n\nWhile I always wanted to give back to my family, I was assumed to become the poorest among my siblings. We say this in jest, so it was totally fine. My siblings were the business-types and they've saved up enough money to be far richer than me while I am still doing my PhD, hence underpaid. Due to my academic degrees, I've travelled quite a lot, especially within Europe (travel between countries is super cheap!). Each country I stepped into, I always hoped that I could bring my family with me -- I never thought that this would be a possibility because my family lives oceans away, and again, I am a PhD student.\n\nFast forward to last year, I was scanning through LinkedIn and found an AI-related job which completely fits my profile. I have a unique set of skills from my previous MSc and my current PhD which made me uniquely fit for this job -- they literally should have just put my name on the job ad lol. Due to being related to AI and the unique nature of my specialty, the job paid extremely well. Additionally it was a completely freelance and remote job. I applied, and got in and made my way from being a normal worker to becoming one of the heads of the team -- even getting face-to-face with the huge AI companies (yes, those ones).\n\nI was paid weekly and within the first week I was able to comfortably buy the latest iPhone and an ok desk set-up during the second week. I am quite a simple guy who really just wanted a good phone and desk, so the next few weeks, the money was just gathering in my account.\n\nAnyway, my graduation from my European MSc was coming up (it got delayed) and I really wanted to bring my parents. With no hesitation, I invited my parents to the graduation -- all expenses paid. My mother also asked if my siblings can also tag along. At this point, I did not have enough money for everyone but I said they can come. Somehow along the way my siblings also had all their expenses paid by me. Haha.\n\nI worked my ass off while my mother planned the trip. We ended up with a planned trip across 6 countries in 3 weeks. Honestly, I did not expect it to be as intense, but I still said yes. My mother really wanted to visit those countries. And how could I even say no if my mother keeps showing me her planned outfits, beret included!\n\nThere isn't enough space to list down all the things we did, but here are some of the heart-warming ones:\n\n&gt;My father was never the type to express his emotions well and whenever we used to have our local trips, he was mostly unimpressed. For the first time, I saw him taking photos of a landmark (Eiffel Tower) and he was quite lovey dovey with my mother especially in Paris. They were so cute.\n\n&gt;My siblings and I had extremely deep conversations in Amsterdam. About our lives, our family. How proud we were of each other and also reminiscing some of our childhood memories and that \"and look where we are now\" moment. We never really talked to each other in such profound ways and I am so glad we had those conversations.\n\n&gt;Our last stop was in Amsterdam, my family had to take the train to the airport while I had to take the train back to the UK. In the most dramatic way, we found ourselves on adjacent platforms which meant we were waiting at the same bench for our trains (I'm fucking crying now). Their train was about to arrive on the platform so we said our goodbyes. We were not the type to hug, so I just awkwardly said good bye to each of them while waving my hand. My mother was surprised and asked me for a hug instead (imagine her saying it in a stereotypical spoiled brat's voice lol). We did. This was the first hug we had since I've become an adult (damn the onions). They went inside the train and kept looking at me. I HATED seeing them on the train. I did not want them to leave and return to their normal lives back home. Tears starting to form on my eyes and I had to look away. I know, it was truly dramatic. And the timing was perfect because their train ran on that instant and mine came to my platform.\n\nI miss them. The work was a short term one so it stopped around mid of last year but it is starting up again. I barely had any savings but I have no regrets.  I wish I can bring them here again. \n\n",

    "selftext": "I'm a cheerleader on a special needs team, I will be censoring the names due to privately.\n\nWhere about to go to warm us, taking a team picture before we go, I was happy at realizing where my spot was as last time I was worried I was in the wrong spot but my coach thought it was ok, suddenly a buch of cheerleaders started screaming and running passed us, at the time I assumed they way excited to get to warmups, and was about to say why there where so happy being confused/amused, three things happened however, one of the cheer dads shouted at us to run, and I realized that not only was EVERYONE running but they where all terrorfied, and I realized something was very wrong.\n\nI panicked, I was trying to get in the middle of the crowd hoping to shelter me, ran to a secrutly guard, I also started to slow down, both because I was looking for people on my cheer team, and was also in shock.\n\nThankfully another team member found me and told me to go with her (let's call her 1) she was being really rational so I was following her, thought I felt a bit silly since she's a teen. We also  found three more, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nWe where directed to go up to to a place that was more dirty (think a warehouse), where found our coach, she was talking on a phone, I never seen her so scared. Mind you she's normally a very tough cheer coach, she was crying while talking on her phone (later found out it was a her dad) saying that she had to find someone since she can't run (later found out it was another team member, who has cerebral palsy and a bad knee.)\n\nThey where directing us to go over a this thing, it's kind of like a cliff inside of a basement if that makes any sense, sorry not sure how to get call it, where all trying to get coach's attention, eventally I gotten louder and touched her arm and told her to over there, and we all did with some help down.\n\nOnce where walking,  we where told to grab hands, I grabbed the woman next to me thinking she was a member of my cheer team though she was not, she laughed and told me it was fine, things gotten calmer was thinking it all over, and maybe even as 1 said that it was a misunderstanding and there wasn't any gunfire, some people where crying and I told her them it was going to be ok.\n\nBut then people started screaming and running again, I also heard what i thought was gunfire, sounding like \"pop, pop, pop!\" we ran back, again I lost the hand of the cheerleader and grabbed 2's hand instead, she started crying and saying that she didn't know what was going on, I felt really bad for because while where both autistic, she's higher support needs then me, in my head I was thinking there was an mass shooter in here, though I didn't want to tell her that since it would freak her out even more, so I didn't say anything, she also asked if it was going to be ok, and I told her yes to ease her, which seemed to help. I paniced again, and tried to jump over this fence like thing, but I wasn't good enough so i gave up and ran way along with some others.\n\nDuring the chaos, we lost sight of our cheer coach and her assistant coach.\n\nAlso durning all of crisis, I had a couple of thoughts in my head, admitly I was thinking of want to post to trueoffmychest, but I was also wondering, on why on earth a mass shooter came and shot up cheerleaders, like did he had some vendetta\u00a0 against them? I was also thinking maybe it was like 2017 Las Vegas shooting and there was no reason, he just wanted to shoot up a place. (\\*yes I was aware that we just didn't know the motive, but that was the shooting that came up.), I was praying to God that my dad and my other cheermembers where not dead, especialy one of them since she was in a wheelchair, I didn't know where she was, and she couldn't move as fast as 1 in her wheelchair (\\*not her fault 1 is just really fast), she also couldn't run, I felt bad for my dad since I know he was proctive over me, and I left my phone with him (we won't allowed to take with us for warmups) so i thought he was terrofried, and upset that he couldn't even contect me to make sure i was ok, when things where calmer I was also thinking of jokes to make in the group me, such as \"worst thing i thought at first: we might lose worst thing now: literal gun statistic\" and \"in mist of chaos 3 still makes friends\" (she likes to make friends with everyone, and while where walking she started to chat with other cheerleaders)\n\nOnce we got outside things again started to get calm, and I again started to think it was going to be ok, but again they started to scream and run, and I think i heard the popping sound again, where all run down towards the bottem of the bridge to shelter us, I sprained my ankle a couple of days earlier, so it was hard to run on half of hill, especially with holding 2's hand, once I got to the bottem I accidently step into mud, in my daze, I thought I liked my shoes but it was ok. (\\*thinking I was wearing my normal shoes instead of the cheer ones), they again directed towards up to hill and to the fence, at first I didn't want to go thinking it was safer down here since I wanted shelter, 2 kept on tuggin on my arm to go up, I did eventally trusting them, so we ran up again, a cheerleader fall down into mud, I didn't want to go down to hold her up thinking it was unsafe/scary, but I did yelled at to get help, she did to my hapiness, once we got up there things where calm, and thankfully remained calm ever since, 3 at this point was crying, and the cheerleaders she was talking to her contiuned to ask her questions to keep her distrated, I jouned in, I hugged 3 to help her, and she hugged back, I also hugged another cheerleader who was also crying, I saw the women that fell in the mud, and she was fine so I didn't talk to her, but was happy she wasn't dead again.\n\nAt one point, I started to zone out thinking of all the event today, 1 noticed and told me not to go someplace else as she needs me here, I told her ok and I wasn't daydreaming, she was doing breathing excerise to calm herself down.\n\nWe where again directed towards to walk over a bridge, once we got to the other side we set by some buildings, again we talked to other cheerleaders, and coaches I again tried to comfort another cheerleader who was crying along with her friends, one of the coaches's offered to call our parents, though she could ony call/text 3's mom since I didn't know my parent's phone numbers, 1 always had her phone with her since she hide it lol, over time 1's 4's dads came, every time I heard screaming of people calling for their family member, I gotten nervous because at that time I assoalted screaming=running and gunfire, though i did think we where safe since if there was a mass shooter we where no longer by the NCA building, also I looked over there and saw what appeared to be\n\nI asked on her the other cheerleaders where ok, and they said I was too worried to ask about my dad, I was still prying for them instead my head.\n\nEventally my dad,e, I told my dad I was happy he came, later 1's mom came, we sat and talked about the entire thing, the helicopter that I saw that I eventally told them my jokes again, I did say to earleir cheerleaders and coaches, my dad confirmed that the heliopter that I saw circuring around was connected to the corrent issue, orginally I just thought it was normal helicopter, I was wrong about being a police helopter it was news helicopter, there was an active news story so we talked about that, apparantly two cheer parents got into a fight and there thought they pulled out guns, I ended up saying \"nothing says rationality like gunfire\" though officaly my dad and 1's mom says that was no gunfire, I felt like the parnets would be banned for life, and I felt bad for the daughtes because they got punished for something their parents did, the phones where also going off with a warning about avoing the place, and ther was a cheer perfomance that had inturpted for they can be evacuated, my dad also said how people where being trumped, and he saw one cheerleader with her leg bent, I asked if she was alive and he said yes but crying, I asked her if she was going to get it amputed and he said no it wasn't that bad.\n\nThe youngest cheermember came, we all comfoted her since she was hugging, later found out she was crying for hours.\n\nMy dad, 2 want to our moms (we came togather along with 5), it was a long walk and my back and ankle where really hurting, (\\*I have very slight Lumbar scoliosis), there was a misnderstanding and we had to walk back 2's mom meet as half way for she can hug 2.\n\nWe made it back 5 and i hugged and she was crying, my mom hugged me and wanted to take a picture I asked if this was for something (like our family's group text or the prayer team), she said yes I think, I said if it was called \"I'm not dead!\" photo and she laughed and agreeed, later found out was for the group message, though maybe also the prayer team as she today said she made it.\n\nOn the our way there, we read the news story, and how they thought there was no gunfire, but there was a genera agreemtn that they was gunfire, since more then one of us heard it, thankfully no one dead. My mom said even it was no gunfire, it was real to us, I agreed with this I got mad when I found out some people online thought it was funny, the fear was very real, and most of the people there are either teenegers, ND, or maybe even both, and even with that it's safer to get out then risk it not being real.since more then one of us heard it, thankfully no one dead.\n\nWhen I got home I did more reaserch, we talked about in the car but I wanted to read for myself, there where dads and got in a fight, the offical statemnt was that the poles being pushed it was sounded like gunfire, I also heard other things while reading around, like one dad having a seizure is what sounded like gunfire, or the music in the cheer routine mixed up with the fight sounded like gunfire, I'm netural but the general consensus is still among the cheer group, was that it was gunfire, since again we heard it, and my dad said he heard it even outside.\n\nWhere at a pool for parents could have a meeting about it, and we talked more, NSA was going to be put in houstin next year, and 5 thinks it would be from now on, our coach doesn't want to come back to NSA andinto there is more secrutiy, which was pretty surpsing to me, since it where want every cheer season, even whiel I was in Mexico for my brother's wedding, she pushed NCA to march instead of skipping it lol, 5 also says our coach wants us to have the wrist binds/black marker lighting saying our phone number, there's even as statement around the group of her changing the \"no phone role\" but that's not confirmed, 5 also thinks she broke her big toe because while everyone was running someone stepted on her toe and it was really bruised, there was more sayings on the group panic running, but I had no issue with that myself so it was kind of shocking, on the phone thing, I later told my mom about it she said she wants me to memorlized her and dad's phone number, as she didn't realize I didn't know it.\n\nWe also talked about the cheerleading compention most everyone ended up complenting, on sunday instead, except for the special needs teams which was canlled, though even if we didn't, our coach said wouldn't complete anyway since again gun panic, the first day we won't in first place, so the first day team ended up winning, she and her coach assasiant was fighting it since she didn't think it was fair because neither them or us gotten the second day, she even said even if our team won she wouldn't accept the reward for this very reason\n\nWe had a group party planned,we where worried we might have to cancell, if everyon was too upset, but thanfully we didn't and it was fun.",

    "selftext": "Some clarification before: English is not my first language so I apologize beforehand if there's something you didn't understand. Feel free to ask if that's the case.\n\nFor some context first: Me (23M) and my best friend (21F), let's call her Nicky, are friends since first year in college. We started getting along better in second year, and later I started catching feelings for her. \nLast year I couldn't resist and decided to invite her out; surprisingly, she said yes. We got through the talking stage and laid out some emotional things and said beautiful things to each other. Unafortunately, when we finally got to our first date, she told me that she was actually confused and looking for something different than I am. Obviously, I was crushed. I was so over the moon with her and thought it was going well.\nIt took me some time to recover from that, but finally we got to be friends again, which made me happy because, aside from all romantic feelings, I'm very fond of her (or whatever you say when you love someone but not romantically lol).\n\nNow, the main issue here is that some weeks ago I realized I still have feelings for her and it's getting really strong every day, and I'm 110% sure she only sees me as a friend. Still, some part of me has some kind of hope, but even though I feel bad because I promised her to be a good friend with no other interest between, and I'm failing at that. Every time I think about her I smile, and I'm a profesional daydreamer so that happens very often. I can't imagine myself with anyone else but with her, she's just wonderful, I like everything about her. She's charismatic, funny, smart, compassionate, empathetic, and I can keep going. \nSo now I'm lost about what to do, because if I tell her I know that it's gonna ruin the friendship, but I can't keep my feelings hidden anymore, it's killing me. \nAlso, I have no idea if she knows or not. I'm aware my behaviour towards her may have changed and I'm being more... affectionate? but in words, not physical. But I don't know if she can tell or not also because we're talking via text and haven't hung out since like a week ago.",

He was lying on the floor with my mom, breathing heavily and kept pooping himself. I held him in my arms and told him that it was okay and that I loved him. He died 30 min later. It was so random. We\u2019d been having a good couple of days. I brought his ashes home today and it feels like he\u2019s here. Obviously, he\u2019s not but I keep looking for him, making sure not to step on him or wanting to share my food with him, but he\u2019s not here. I know he wouldn\u2019t want me to be sad and that he loved me and that he knew I loved him but holy f it hurts so bad. I don\u2019t know how to be home without him. I was never truly alone because I always had him. But now I lay here in silence waiting to hear him snoring. How do people deal with this pain? I am miserable. \n\nEdit; thank you so so much for all of your kind words. They mean a lot to me and I really really appreciate you all. ",

    "selftext": "I 17f have been dating my boyfriend, 18m, for the past few months and it\u2019s been perfect, it feels natural and not rushed, and so far we\u2019ve established that we want to have a long term relationship together but obviously we don\u2019t know how long that long term is going to be. I would like to see us reach future milestones because he is the loml and I couldn\u2019t imagine life without him, but he has told me that he has certain views on things like marriage because his parents got divorced when he was four and says that marriage is something that he maybe doesn\u2019t see in his future because of the fear of ending up like his parents. But in the past week he has maybe multiple remarks about future milestones, one day we were laying in my bed and he saw my baby pillow and was reading it and saw the part that said \u201cThe proud parents of this baby: A &amp; A\u201d and said \u201cjust imagine this happens to us, it\u2019s gonna say \u201cThe proud parents of this baby: C &amp; C\u201d because like my parents, me and my boyfriend have the same first initial. Another time we were on the phone and he said \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking a lot lately, what are your thoughts of the idea of us getting married some day\u201d which caught me off guard because he said that he maybe didn\u2019t see himself getting married. He\u2019s also brought up promise rings with my friends at work because me and him work together and they have told me about it. And today while we were out to eat he brought up moving in together after I graduate. I love my boyfriend so much but I don\u2019t understand why the switch from having these certain views to changing those views and talking about that stuff and I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s joking about it or actually being serious. I want to believe that he is but with what he has said in the past is confusing me. I\u2019m going to bring this up to him but I don\u2019t know what to say exactly. Is it a sign that he may be changing his views and considering a future with me or is it something I should be worried about?",

Now we talk every few days and have an upcoming hangout planned. \n\nIssue is that I don't know how she feels or what the vibe for the hangout is supposed to be. She's aware of how I feel because I drunkenly told her one day but she responded jokingly by saying that she was \"the one that got away\", I have no idea if I should ask her if this is supposed to be a date or if I should just be happy that she still wants to hang out with me.

    "selftext": "It's been 6 months since my mom has passed.  The first month was the hardest, I didn't have the energy to do much of anything. And then came the nausea. Turns out, I got pregnant by my bf. I was extremely saddened by it, bc I already had one abortion when I didn't think I was ready for it years ago. And I had promised myself that I wouldn't go through with that again. The problem is, my bf is very verbally abusive and cops have been called multiple times bc of it in the past 6 years. Today, he was upset that the gym was too crowded and he kept being negative over the whole thing. That annoyed me and so I just said we should just go since he's killing the mood over nothing. We both were free for like 4 hours so waiting just a bit wasn't going to effect much. \nHe then started driving very aggressively and that bothered me further since I am pregnant and he's supposed to be more careful on the road. He kept saying things to me, none of them were questions or anything I could really say anything to. That made him start yelling at me and calling me an asshole for ignoring him. I told him to stop calling me that and that began a screaming match. I felt my baby going crazy in my womb, so I told him to stop the car and I walked out a mile and a half away from home. I ignored all the calls and texts while I walked. I read my Bible to calm down my thoughts and the baby. I also stopped to grab a green juice and a tuna wrap since I hadn't eaten anything. I'm torn about the whole ordeal.  He won't listen to me about basic respect and I'm scared that the baby will have to deal with his antics as well. I'm not looking for advice really, I just needed to vent. Thanks for listening. ",

    "selftext": "For context: I am 29 years old and I grew up in an extremely abusive household. My dad nearly tried to take my life on several occasions, and knew that my brother was sexually abusing me and did nothing about it. My dad constantly threatened to either kill me or himself, and would not let me move out or live my life even through my 20's. He would pretend to be poor and ask me to help him with bills all the time, but he was sitting on a half a million dollars and just didn't want to use it.\n\nIt got to the point that even in my early and mid twenties, he tracked my location, my credit card, bank account, etc. and would abuse me (choke me, punch me, threaten to kill me) if I spent any money on anything. Once, I even asked to move out and he grabbed a kitchen knife and said he'll either kill me or himself if I ever leave.\n\nI ended up getting cancer and my dad never even helped me with any of my bills for treatment and still continued to ask ME for money/help.\n\nFast forward to last year, I finally ran away. I changed my last name, my phone number, moved to a different city and took my dog and left. I went one full year without contact - filed restraining orders and everything.\n\nMy dog has been my only consistent family my entire life. He has been the only support I've ever had, and is my emotional support dog. He was just diagnosed with cancer and I BROKE down. Out of sheer emotion, I called my dad. Which was the dumbest thing I've ever done.\n\nHe was so elated to have me call him and back in his life, that he offered to pay for my dog's surgery to help him be cancer free. I let him, and I was so happy to have support.\n\nI NEED to cut him off again because he's already talking about wanting to leave his wife (my mom) and move in with me so \"we can leave happily ever after.\" He makes comments like \"we can get a second puppy and raise him together\" (as if we are a couple and we would live a life together).\n\nMy father is making me EXTREMELY SICK and I am reminded why I had to cut him off.\n\nAnyway, I was told my dog may need a round or two of chemotherapy. Giving him chemotherapy could give him a matter of YEARS of his life back, versus only months. My dog is in EXCELLENT condition - couldn't even tell he was sick. He IS worth saving.\n\nMy dad is offering to pay for the chemotherapy. Because he thinks he will be able to keep me in his life by doing so. Am I a bad person if I accepted his financial help and then cut him off all over again right after? Is that morally wrong? Would I be the AH?\n\nI'm learning how to live life at 29 years old for the very first time, and barely making it. I was never taught financial literacy or how to manage my money because my dad did everything for me. And didn't let me take charge of my own life. I never knew how to cook, or do ANYTHING. They took my life away from me because they wanted me to live with them forever.\n\nI need this financial help to save my very best friend, but I also don't want to do something that would make me a horrible person. I could TECHNICALLY afford his chemo but it would pretty much make me have 0 savings. So.... WIBTA to take his money and then run?\n\n(I also considered telling him that I'd only accept the money if he knew it was no strings attached and that he has to be fully aware that I am not letting him BUY a relationship with me).",
