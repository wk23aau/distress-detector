"t3_1j5ucsq","I think I am in love with my friend and it is ruining my life","Me (26F) and my friend (25M) met during university, but we didn’t talk much back then. He had his own friend group, and I had mine. It wasn’t until a few years after graduating, when we ended up working together, that we became inseparable, because our cubicles are right next to each other.

I have pretty bad abandonment issues, but I also get attached to people way too easily (a deadly combination, I know). So when we started hanging out more, I didn’t think much of how close we were. I was just happy to have such a good friend.

I didn’t realize I had feelings for him until my birthday. He was running late to my party, and I caught myself looking at the door constantly, waiting for him to show up. I felt this ridiculous relief when he finally arrived. At the time, I had just gotten out of a really toxic situationship, so I dismissed my feelings. I told myself I was just trying to replace what I had with the other guy.

Then, a few months later, he told me he was interviewing for a job on the other side of the world. I had a full-on breakdown. That was the moment I realized how deep my feelings for him actually were. I can’t even tell you how many nights I cried over the idea of him leaving. In the end, he got the job, but still chose to stay.

Some part of me thinks maybe he likes me back. He’s told me before that he thinks I’m pretty, he cooks for me, listens to me vent, spends whole weekends with me, and just shows up in a way that no one else has. Sometimes he makes comments that imply he does want something with me, but then he also says he wouldn’t date someone outside of his culture (we are from two very different countries). So I don’t know if he’s sending mixed signals on purpose or if I’m just reading too much into things.

To make things worse, he recently started messaging back and forth with a friend of his from high school, and it seems pretty flirty, he seems excited. It’s killing me. I don’t know what to do or how to deal with it. I want to cry every single day. He is going back home for vacation soon, and I’m terrified that he’ll come back and tell me he has a girlfriend.

I know now that a relationship isn’t possible, and I don’t want to lose him as a friend. But I don’t know how to deal with these feelings.","3","5"
"t3_1j5hrwp","My mom always prioritizes my sister in the weirdest ways","Preface, this happened around the holidays, which is the only time I’m ever around my mom. We have little to no contact outside of when I visit my siblings.

I (26F) told my mom that I think my boyfriend (28M) is going to propose to me.

She responded with “Can you wait so I can recoup some money after your sister’s wedding?” Not a “congratulations” “i’m happy for you” nothing positive at all. I immediately shut down and stopped talking about it. It’s been on my mind a lot recently because my sister is no longer in that relationship (he was an abusive alcoholic) and my mom doesn’t understand why it’s still bothering me.

I would never allow her to even attempt to pay for it because she would hold it over my head forever. She doesn’t attempt to speak to me or have a relationship with me, she doesn’t speak to him at all, she would try to control everything about it. She honestly probably won’t even be invited at this point, but it deeply bothered me that it was somehow made about my sister.

This is the same woman that didn’t tell me that my cat had passed after having him for 10 years and refused to even talk about it or acknowledge it when I was upset about it. She has been unkind my entire life, but like.. what?????","20","6"
"t3_1j639z5","Drawn to insecurities and psychological weakness like sharks?","Okay it's weird but just hear me out.... I'm not boasting or flexing or anything I need to figure myself out.

You know how sharks can feel it when there's bl**d in the water? Like physically feel it- I can feel it when someone has insecurities...like not even talking about them- falling back onto their insecurities, thinking about them while saying something else, drawing from them, the way they phrase certain things, the way they keep repeating certain phrases- it's the small things. And it's not even just insecurities it's the psychological weakness. I can physically feel it-that's the best way to describe the rush- it's like being pulled towards them like sharks everytime they psychologically bleed(that's the best way I can put it).

Now I know every human is empathetic and we can all feel to certain extents but I'm pretty sure most people don't go around feeling it like I do. I'm pretty sure most people wouldn't be able to tell how deep someone's insecurities run after one text conversation and immediately go 'yes I want this one'. And yes I understand it's f*cked up but help me understand it","1","2"

"t3_1j5am4f","Getting my messages with my groomer forensically checked tomorrow. I'm terrified.","After countless of procrastinating, I ended up telling my mom I was sexually exploited by a man many years older than me. She was honestly very supportive, and let me go on with the police investigation.

Tomorrow I'm getting my messages forensically checked between me and him, and oh god am I shitting myself. The messages I had with him were VERY sexual, and I feel guilty as I kind of just let everything happen as I liked the attention. I know everything will be okay, as it is apart of their job, but it still scares me that someone will be checking these very intimate messages. There's also the fact that someone's gonna have my phone for a while, and will be able to check my stuff which is also making my heart pound.

For anyone who went through a similar experience with their phone being forensically checked, how'd it go?","61","6"
"t3_1j5fth6","I hate my parents for not letting me have surgery for pectus carinatum.","First of all, I want to apologize for my poor English since I’m doing this through a translator. I’m a 19-year-old guy who has had pectus carinatum his whole life. It has brought me a lot of teasing and stares, and even though I have the mildest case, I have a small banana-shaped protrusion on my sternum. I’ve wanted surgery since I was 14.

As a first option, they wanted me to wear a compression brace for a year, which is complete nonsense. I knew it wouldn’t fix what I have, and even the doctor said so. I fought for years to get surgery until one day they took me to the sub-capital to see a doctor. The doctor told me it was a very mild case and that the surgery was very simple: they would cut two cartilages, push the sternum inward, and that was it. This happened in June 2024. I was very excited about the idea of having a normal chest.

My experience with this condition has been horrible and has caused me a lot of insecurity. Every time I wear a t-shirt, the lump is noticeable, making me look much fatter than I actually am. I’ve been training for five years, and it’s horrible to see how I can’t make progress in my chest because this damn protrusion sticks out—it’s all I’ve seen in the mirror for five years.

Going back to what I was saying, my parents postponed the surgery until 2025. I got angry with them and gave them an ultimatum: “Either I get the surgery, or I leave the house.” I want to clarify that this was the only thing I was asking for, the only thing I wanted. I’m the youngest child, and I have a 29-year-old sister who is studying her second degree because she realized that the first one wouldn’t get her a job. My father has always helped her with her apartment and university expenses. I’ve always known she was the favorite, and I wasn’t asking for much—just this surgery.

Today we went to see a doctor in our city, and instead of agreeing with the previous doctor, he said they would have to break my abdomen, cut all the cartilage, and insert a prosthesis. I suspect this was all planned because my father is a doctor, and I have a feeling he talked to this doctor to make me change my mind or to have an excuse to say no. I walked home because I was so angry at them. I’ve been fighting for this surgery for about five years, and they found the perfect excuse to deny it.

Tonight at dinner, I ate in my room. I’m so tired of them—they are the most vile, cruel, and arbitrary people I know. I hate them for making me go through my entire adolescence and now my adulthood with this lump in my chest just because they don’t want me to have surgery. They have no idea how much I’ve suffered or how much I wish with all my heart to die. I wish I could just wake up one day and no longer exist in this horrible world. I hate the parents I got, and I hate my sister for being the favorite. If I could, I’d take a gun and blow my brains out so I wouldn’t have to endure this anymore—but I will make them pay. As soon as I get a job, I’ll leave this place and never speak to them again. When they’re old, I’ll put them in a nursing home—and I’m being generous. I should let them rot in their own filth.

I’ll update if there’s any news.","26","1"
"t3_1j5wpag","i told my friend that she needs to stop victimizing herself and i dont really feel that bad about it.","keeping events and names vague on purpose.

i have a very close friend, A, who i love very dearly, but shes been in bind after bind. her family had disowned her and she has been in like 5 horrible relationships in the past two years and both the places she has worked at in the past two years have gone out of business. none of this stuff is her fault but i think it puts her in a shitty place where she feels justified in her own mind to just not hang out with friends or justified to be rude to friends in a way.i love hanging out with A and i love just sitting around and chatting and watching tv with her while i do art and such like that, but i also love getting out of the house on occasion if im invited.

for example, As roommate, B, invited Bs GF, me, A, and another friend out to go get food. we got all ready and then A was like 'i actually dont have alot of money so im gonna sit this one out.' and we were all super sad and then we all look in our wallets and agree we could chip in a few bucks each to cover As meal because shes been in hard times so much and we go tell her and shes like 'no... i dont want to...' so we go out to eat without her and have a great time and come back and even bring her food back from the restaurant and shes all angry and depressed and sad she didnt get to go.

Two weeks ago, B took a bus to stay in her GFs dorm for a few days and when she came back i picked her up from the bus stop, we got some fast food, even got some for A and then came back home and me and B were talking and being silly when A goes 'i hate hearing you talk and have fun like that when you got to go do something fun while i had to work for all those days with no break.' and then A goes back to her room. I went to class and didnt hear anything for a few days but i know that A and B argued.

then some friends from me and As highschool that we still regularly talk to texted me and said theyre gonna do something fun over this coming weekend and i was like hell yeah i love hanging out with my friends and they told me to ask A if she wants to join in and i call up A and ask her and she goes 'idk... i dont have my work schedule yet...' and i said 'ok could u text ur boss and ask for the day off? we really all want to hang out with you!' and she says 'ill see'. weekends coming around and i just texted A to ask if shes gonna hang out with us and she goes 'no i have work' i say 'oh im sad you couldnt get work off' and she goes 'oh i didnt really try... they (highschool friends) didnt directly ask me so i figured i wasnt invited.'like girl.... i literally asked you because they wanted you there? and i showed her the texts from our friends asking if A is coming because theyre so excited to see her, both friends live a ways away so we dont see each other often and one of the friends hasnt seen A for about 4 years due to moving states and then coming back. and we were all excited and waiting for her to join us. but i go 'ok... i wish u could have joined us maybe we can pick u up after u finish working and hang out?' and she just goes 'no i think your all going to have fun without me'and i kinda was a bit pissed w her so i said she should have take the day off when i asked a while ago and shes just like 'oh. i could  have. but i didnt.' ??? girl?this is around when i told her she needs to stop victimizing herself.

i hung out with her roommate later that day and we discussed how shes kinda been and B said she would talk to A about how she needs to stop isolating herself. I also ended up inviting B to hang out with us over the weekend instead as the highschool friends have all met B in passing and like hanging out with her. ik this is gonna piss off A a bit but like A could have also hung out with us.... and then A is gonna be mad and not want to hear about what weve all done for a while.im just so tired of her self deprecating behavior where she always HAS to be the victim who just CANT hang out or CANT do anything fun and all that bull.

TLDR; exactly what the title says. i told my friend that she needs to stop victimizing herself and i dont really feel that bad about it. thats the end.","2","0"
"t3_1j5v3gk","I'm flirting with my teacher, but he doesn't know","I've been thinking about this a lot. I haven't told anymore irl, and I'd like to have outside opinions.

I work as a cashier. This new guy has been coming to my store regularly. He’s friendly, a bit flirty, and kind of cute. Issue is, he was my teacher when I was ten-ish years old.

I really don't think he recognizes me. I've obviously changed a lot since then, I only saw him two hours a week for a year, and it's been a decade.

Should I tell him? I think it would make things weird, and it could make him feel grossed out with himself. Objectively, we're just two people, but it's still strange.

Also, this won't go anywhere, (especially since I'm moving in a few months) but I do enjoy our conversations.","2","2"
"t3_1j5o5qn","Is it ok to be confused and overwhelmed when figuring out what you want?","A year ago I was stressed and scared that being a software engineer would ruin my plans to try and be creative.. I was dead set on it, but I watched the creative industry crumble and I see how corporatized it really is.. it makes sense why people go indie.

So I shifted focus because of the news and I’m just questioning what I want to do and how. Now I just don’t care or stress about being creative.. I don’t mind doing it on my downtime even if I suck at it. Ever since I traveled across the country, I feel myself wanting to find a new place to live.. a place that vibes with me (especially outside the US).

But I’ll likely need to advance my education, become a genius to be considered a hire for an overseas business. I’m just not fit with my associates degree. So, I feel stuck. I may bite the bullet and get a software engineering degree, but only so I can live somewhere cool and feel at home..

Edit: I moved from one interest to another and I’m feeling overwhelmed because of the news and I just want to find what’s right for me, but it will take a lot of work.","4","2"
"t3_1j4fr1m","Update: I started washing and putting away my roommates favorite mug whenever she uses it. When she caught me I lied about why.","Good morning yall! A couple days ago I made a post at 3 in the morning to confess to doing my roommates dishes because I secretly love to watch her do a happy dance when she sees her favorite mug is clean for her to use again. That post changed our lives and I'm only being a little dramatic by saying that.

I gotta say thanks to everyone who upvoted and commented on my original post, I'm still shook at just how many people read about me and my mug happy best friend. The amount of people saying my post made them smile or reminded them of their own friendships or significant others has kept me smiling for days. I'm kind of into making people happy, if that wasnt already obvious, so the fact that so many people had even a moment of positivity because of me has been awesome.

When I made that original post it was because I just wanted to tell someone about the mug dancing but I knew Gwen wouldn't like it if I told anyone we knew so I came to reddit to shout to the void and oh boy, did the void shout back. There were so many comments asking if I really thought we were just friends, and I'll be honest when I made that post we absolutely were just friends. We had never talked about being more than friends and I was happy being friends because we have an amazing friendship. I hadn't really thought about there being a possibility for more because dating was always something I planned to do when I had my life together or when I had more money. I never let myself consider what I was missing out on by waiting for the ""right time."" Her finding my post opened up the chance for Gwen and I to talk about things that we hadn't before and over breakfast that morning we found where we stood with each other and what we thought things could look like moving forward depending on what we both agreed was the best course. We didn't make any solid plans or decisions and didn't want to rush into something that would ruin the good we already had going for us, but I'll admit I was hoping for a specific outcome.

There was one comment on that first post that had really caught my attention. To paraphrase, they told me to think about how I would feel if someone else got to see Gwen do her happy mug dance instead of me and it hit me so hard. I didn't mind the idea of someone else seeing her so happy. I just dont know if anyone she dates would notice what I did and decide to do what I did. What if they didn't care or didn't think it was that important or any of the other things I do to make her laugh or smile. I really didn't like the thought of not being there to make sure she has that extra reason to smile in the morning. (Gwen wants me to admit that I'm a sappy moron because I teared up writing this. Im a sensitive man in touch with my emotions and you know you love it so shut it you 😝.)

To all the people saying it's possible for platonic relationships to be like ours you are absolutely correct. Our friend group is very open with physical and verbal affection and we help each other all time with big and small things. We all say I love you to each other, it's just normal communication for us as a group, not just between Gwen and I. Honestly, if I hadn't made my original post I'm not sure when or if we would have gotten to the point we are now. Maybe we would have continued as we were and that would have been just as happy of an outcome, just a different one, like a choose your own adventure with multiple options for a good resolution.

Which brings me to the actual update. Gwen and I agreed we want to try dating. We aren't putting a new label on our relationship yet, but our first date is next week. I'm making it all a surprise. Gwen helped write this post and will be reading the comments so I can't give any details, but it's going to be the best first date she has ever been on, or I'll eat my candy corn patterned socks. I think she might be the one for me and I'm going to take every chance I can to make sure she thinks the same about me.

Yall are the best and we love you. Do something kind for your loved ones for us and everyone can and should find something to happy dance about, it makes life more fun.

Love Gwen and Peter 🩷🕸","5925","369"
"t3_1j5zzni","I want to get him out of my brain","I don't know where to begin, but it's been eating at me for a while and for the sake of myself, I gotta get it off my chest.

I (f19) met this guy in 2023, he randomly blocked me a little less than a year ago, and we lost contact. It's been 9 months, and although I don't ""think"" about him anymore (in the sense where I'll openly think ""oh I miss him"" out of the blue), I still feel like I see him in everyone. I've moved on, I don't think about him randomly, hearing his name doesn't upset me anymore, nothing about him hurts me anymore.

The problem is just that certain gestures that he'd do, certain things he'd say, every time someone does the same or does something that reminds me of him, he comes to mind immediately. Mostly it's the way he'd word stuff, and for some reason whenever someone says the same thing or acts similarly, it's like I have to tell myself it's not him. Nobody had ever made me feel the way he did, which I find weird cause we never dated. Kinda feels like I found my soulmate but lost him, if that makes sense.

It sucks, because I'm in a relationship, and I love my boyfriend to bits. We've been dating for around a month now, but despite that he's my favourite person. Being with him and being able to know him is the highlight of my life, so why does that one guy still haunt me? I feel so incredibly guilty writing this, because although it's not something I can help, I feel like shit about it. I feel like the guilt is eating me alive, and I'd bring it up with my boyfriend, but I know what he's like. If I do he'll start telling me to break up with him, even though he could say the same exact thing to me, and has actually admitted to feeling this way about someone before, and I'm not mad about it because I understand.","1","0"
"t3_1j4gx9o","I hate my life as a muslim woman","Throwaway for obvious reasons but I hate the fact that I have to live this way. I believe in God, I wear a hijab etc and that is all fine but it's insane how muslim men treat women.

My own father used to beat me whenever I wore an outfit that he deemed too ""sexy"" and would then make weird comments about my body or call me a whore. Mind you I dress modest and as I said I even wear a hijab since age 15.

My brother is even worse I once caught him masturbating and sniffing my underwear and pantyhose and he then blamed me for owning ""whore clothes"" instead of apologizing for being such a freak.

"t3_1j5td4z","Why are all doctors offices so fucking ass","I swear they’re all the same it doesn’t matter how well you communicate with them these fuckers just ignore your calls and if they do get back to you at all you’re lucky if they even listened to your message at all.

"t3_1j5zk2e","I hate the only boy in the friend group","Okay so there is this boy in our group and he pisses me off so much to the point I’d rather watch paint dry than talk to him or hear his annoying voice and I’m not even trying to be funny. I really think it would be more entertaining and less stressful.

He makes me want to rip my hair out. He just talks rubbish. Once he said you could go skiing in the Maldives then proceeded to say we were wrong and no he wasn’t talking about jet skiing. He was talking about SNOW SKIING! another is, is that he only talks about 3 things boys, his hair and his home country. He talks about boys like they all want him. They don’t! He says he going to dye his hair, he has been saying this since I’ve met him he hasn’t done anything to it. Then his home country. On multiple occasions he has lied to us about going back or buying plane tickets to go back. It just annoying.

Then he lied to us about making plans. We invite him everywhere and he says he will come and never dose them proceeds to lie and say we never invited him anywhere. Which riled me up and to the point i shouted at him and I did take it a bit to far and rude and I hold my hands up to that it was wrong of me but then I apologised for that but he’s now started it agian after I invited him to my birthday and then said I never invited him. The only reason i invited cuz everyone said I had to.

I just can’t deal with him.

"t3_1j5zag2","My life has been turned upside down, and it's not worth enough for anyone to help.","I was in a car accident in November of last year. Or rather, a car accident happened to me. I was on the interstate when I suddenly saw a set of headlights facing the median. They were in a T-bone position with the truck to my right. Before I could react, both vehicles slammed into me, totalling my car.  Thankfully (or so i thought) I wasn't injured. I got photos, names, insurance information, license plates, everything I could think of. I was told by two of the adjusters involved that I pretty much did their job for them. After 4 months of being pulled around, being told that I was not liable by all parties involved, that the claim was going to arbitration, then in subrogation, and finally being told that my insurance didn't cover damage to my own car, I am so frustrated and exhausted. I have a part-time job an hour away that I haven't been able to go to for the past 3 months. My husband has his own business that uses the only other car we have. I was told by so many people that I just needed to wait for liability to be settled and I'd get payment for my car. But today I was told that I am fully shit out of luck, that because insurance hasn't paid anything for repairs or a rental or anything that there's no point in paying for my car. I understand it's because I had basic liability, but I can't afford another car right now.

I've been trying to find a lawyer to help, but I've been told by literally everyone that it just isn't worth it to pursue. That the lawyers fees would be more than I'd get in a settlement. I've tried legal aid, the local law school, referral after referral, and as soon as I mention I wasn't injured it's over. I'm at such a loss. I don't know if it would be worth it to try and represent myself, or just leave it alone, but even the few thousands of dollars I could get for the value of my car would make things so much easier. I'm so frustrated that something so detrimental to my day-to-day is just not worth it for absolutely everyone. That I can lose my only asset, be told I've done everything right, and still be on the losing side because I wasn't injured.","1","7"
"t3_1j5ox11","Boyfriend wants to get married and I’m indifferent towards it","Back story I’m (F28) and my (M30) wants to be married. We were on and off from the years I was 19-20 and when I turned 21 we got together offically and I was convinced by him and his mom to move in since I was living alone and my parents are retired in a different country.

From the years 19-22 he was just not nice very rude and he would always choose his friends over me and his friends were always females. In the early stages his friends or family will tell him to leave me and he would do it and then be adamant on staying friends when I would say no. He also kept crying to me about his ex and how much she hurt him and he hid the fact he would talk to her mom like once a week. When I found out he stood his ground and said no to cutting her off. He only agreed to cut her off because I was pregnant with his child.

When I turned 23 during Covid we fell pregnant although I took Plan B I didn’t realize I was ovulating so it didn’t work. We kept our son but he was just so rude during my pregnancy he took it upon himself to be there for a female friend all because she was dating a guy and needed “help” and instead of her going to her female friends my bf was always available. He went as far as to stay out all night and get drunk with her and their other friends and the guy she was dating when I didn’t want him to and when he returned home he cursed me and his mother out because I held him back in life. I also had told him for years how important marriage was to me and he was just so whatever about it. I told him while I was pregnant just ask with a ring pop since we didn’t have too much money and I wanted to be married before having a kid and he came home a few days later and as I was lying on the couch he threw the ring pop and said “ you going to say yes right “ I said no because he made it seem like a chore or obligation rather than him wanting to. He also spend all my pregnancy mad at me because I didn’t want to name our son after him. When I’ve told him since I was 19 and even before when we were sort of friends at 16 that I do not want to name my son after their father name.

Fast forward our son is born and he is currently 4 and throughout these 4 years he keeps wanting to be married and I told him unless he has a career were he can  care of the home expenses what is the point. Since our son been born I’ve made almost all the money paid our rent our bills he’s has jobs here and there.  He just made one year at his current job and he does pay his part but even before our son and now I’m also paying like 60/70% and he pays the rest and theirs been times I’ve paid 100%. I told him if he becomes a police officer id feel okay and comfortable marrying him since it’s a good paying job and he can support us and he wants to and he’s doing it for him and for us to be married. But I also feel so indifferent like I don’t see the excitement in calling him my husband since we skipped over the step. Sometimes I feel like it’s my fault and I should of ignored that he threw a ring pop at me and other times I feel like if I would of accepted it I would be open to constant disrespect from him in the future.

Him as a father: super good and kind he takes our son to school and picks him up he lets me sleep in and sleep whenever. He tries to pay for dates when we are out our son and him have a strong bond. He gets me flowers offers to cook even it it doesn’t taste the greatest. Overall him as a dad and a partner is nice I do feel spoiled. But because I can’t let go of how he treated me I’m always going to have this fever he’s going to revert back.","3","9"
"t3_1j5on2i","I Don’t Know If I’ll Make It Past April","I don’t know why I’m posting this. Maybe I just want someone to know. Maybe I want to feel like my existence mattered to someone, even if just for a moment. Even if by strangers.

I’ve had a specific date in April marked as my death day. I’ve tried to get help. I reached out for therapy at multiple locations. I’ve contacted help lines and end up feeling like a waste of space on the line. I contacted a couple more places and even I told them they were my last chance. But every single place has waiting lists. No matter how much I say, “I don’t have time to wait,” they just tell me to hold on. I don’t think I can.

I’m drowning, and I can’t breathe. This feels like it.

I don’t know if I actually want to be saved or if I just want people to understand that I fought. That I tried. That I didn’t just give up for no reason.

I feel invisible. Even when I’m here, I don’t feel here. It’s like I’m just moving through the motions, waiting for the date to come.

My whole conscious life has been abuse. I can’t get everything out of my head. I’m an adult now, I have to move on but I can’t. I’m stuck and I can’t get help. Real help! The last therapist I had was in my late teens and she said one day I would just go and kill myself. I wish I could tell her how right she is! I tried to prove her wrong and failed!

I don’t know what I want from this post. Maybe just to feel like someone sees me before I disappear. Maybe to feel like I wasn’t completely alone in this. April is coming so fast and I tried but I can’t anymore.","3","2"
"t3_1j5l1e7","Sister in law keeps taking my stuff","Just couple months ago I(23F) and my husband (24M) decided to move in with my husbands family till we’re able to afford to buy a house. It’s just his parents, his sister and her son. Recently his sister (19F) has been using my clothes and shoes without asking. If I leave it in the living room or anywhere else that’s not our room she’ll use it. I left my jacket and a bunch of clutter from the car in the garage cause we were cleaning the cars out and I kept putting off when I’d put everything away. Next thing I know my jacket is upstairs and it’s clear she wore it cause it reeked of her perfume and her bag was on top of it, whatever not a big deal I take it to our room. But this continues to happen with a bunch of other shirts, jackets, whatever.

Next instance, she broke her one pair of sandals and started using mines which I honestly didn’t mind cause I have at least 5 pairs and it was peak summer time. Next thing you know I don’t see my one pair I usually wear and I just start wearing a different one, eventually I find it in MIL car with the strap broken. My MIL doesn’t wear my stuff and his sister uses her car constantly. Clearly SIL broke it and never mentioned it to me but okay cool whatever. Then another pair go missing, okay cool she probably got hungry or something idk but whatever I can get new ones so I let it slide.

It’s now colder out now so I go out and buy some ugg tasman slippers and she starts wearing that. This is where I start to get a little annoyed cause I’d get dressed according to what shoes I’m gonna wear and when we’d head out to the garage my shoes aren’t there and she’s gone. Okay moving on. My husband bought me a pair of pandas that I rarely wear, I wore it out one time and switched to sandals so I kept the shoes in the garage next thing I know they’re upstairs and SIL had just came from somewhere. Okay now I’m definitely annoyed cause literally sandals are fine but sharing shoes is gross.

And that brings us to today. I’ve been looking everywhere for my black leather ankle boots I last wore on Christmas and haven’t seen since. For some reason I decide to stalk her Facebook and I see a picture that she posted from 2 months ago from a trip she took to Vegas and I could see the top of her shoes and it literally looks like my boots. Same dent, same scratch. She doesn’t own any shoes like that either. I’m not confrontational so I ask my husband to ask her if she has my boots and she says she doesn’t know and that she “doesn’t wear boots”. So now I look like the crazy person and my husband thinks maybe I misplaced it. It’s literally no where else in the house or the car. He’s been aware of her taking my stuff and never says anything to her and the one time I ask him to ask her, he gives in and sides with her like she hasn’t been taking my stuff for months now. This seems so stupid and petty to get mad over cause she’s younger than me but literally just ask. She’s the youngest and grew up with all brothers so I understand the entitlement but I grew up with all sisters and it’s not hard to just ask.","5","8"

"t3_1j5xxsw","I’m starting to hate my bestfriend","Pretty much the title

They snap at me constantly, for no reason whatsoever. I’m so sick of it. Tuesday I was having a shit day and accidentally snapped at them, only to find out they complained to their friend about it and I got sent an email saying “OP, I dont know your story or what your going through but you shouldnt snap or yell at friend. Friend didnt do anything. so just stop yelling or snapping at people.”

And when I told this friend they don’t know what I’m going through and that friend is basically a hypocrite and to not email me again (why are we emailing?? I don’t know.) I got this “hey its friend-of-friend i just wanted to say this is totally unacceptable if you don't appreciate when people snap at you why do it to others or better yet communicate that you don't like it but if you enjoy pushing away everyone who cares go ahead struggle on your own or pull yourself together and reach out communicate or get the help you so clearly need honey“ (im in therapy three times a week but she doesn’t know that bc she doesn’t know me)

And today, my friend snapped at me. Again. I asked if they were ok and got “IM FINE!”

Ok, you fucking hypocrite. I’m just so done and starting to truly hate them. Sorry for the word soup I just needed to vent

Edit: forgot to say this but the end of the day Tuesday, when I was feeling slightly better: I APOLOGIZED. Something my best friend has never done unless prompted (they blame it on their autism - I’m autistic too… and I apologized without being told to…)","1","0"
"t3_1j5xpao","The Weight of My Own Mistakes","There was once a boy who believed in love—not the fairytale kind, but the kind that made the world feel right. And for a while, he had it. A girl who stood by him, who saw the best in him even when he didn’t see it himself. She loved him with a kind of loyalty that was rare, a love that never wavered even when he gave her reasons to walk away.

But love isn’t just about feelings; it’s about choices. And one day, fear made him choose wrong.

He let go—not because he didn’t love her, but because he was afraid. Afraid of not being enough. Afraid that one day she would leave, and it would hurt too much. So instead of holding on, he let himself drift away. He convinced himself that if he stopped putting in effort, if he stopped making her a priority, then maybe, just maybe, it wouldn’t hurt when it finally ended.

But she never left. She stayed. She still believed in them, even when he had already started moving away. And then, he made a mistake he could never take back—he gave his heart to someone else before he had truly let her go.

At first, he thought he could move on. But something inside him shifted. After some time in his new relationship, he finally understood his mistakes. He realized how deeply he had hurt the one person who had truly loved him. But he never knew how to make it right. How do you fix something after breaking it beyond repair? How do you face the person you betrayed, knowing no apology will ever be enough? He wanted to go back, to do something, anything—but the guilt held him back.

And so, he stayed.

Not because he had moved on, but because he was afraid—afraid that if he left his new relationship to make things right, he would once again be the villain in his own story. The guilt consumed him, so instead of looking back, he convinced himself that staying was the only way forward.

And in his guilt, he changed.

Determined not to make the same mistakes, he became kinder. He tried to treat the new girl right, giving her the love and care he had once failed to give. But kindness, when given to the wrong person, is easily taken for granted. And she did exactly that.

She manipulated him, gaslighted him, twisted his guilt into a weapon against him. She made him believe he was always wrong, always at fault. Every time he questioned her actions, she turned it around, making him doubt his own reality. Whenever he felt she was wrong, she made herself the victim and made him feel like he was the one to blame. Slowly, he lost himself. The person he once was—the person who understood things clearly—began to fade.

And as you already know, he never spoke up.

Regret became his shadow. Guilt, his reflection. He had apologized to the one he had hurt, over and over again, but some wounds don’t heal with words. He had hurt someone beyond repair, and now he was paying the price—not just through his own pain, but through the way he was now being treated.

He wanted to move forward, to leave it all behind, but no matter what he did, the past followed. Every quiet moment became a reminder of what he had lost. Every time he tried to love again, he feared he would be taken for granted, just as he had once done to her.

Maybe this was karma. Maybe this was what he deserved. Or maybe… just maybe… he still had a choice.

As he stood at the edge of everything he had been and everything he could become, he realized something: he had no idea what came next. Would he ever forgive himself? Would he ever find peace? Or would he always be haunted by what he had done?

He didn’t know.

But for the first time in a long time, he was ready to find out.","1","0"

Last night I was so insanely horny that I couldn’t stop thinking about my coworker who could like me but could also find me repulsive for all that I know. Genuinely thought about texting her and asking if she wanted to go out sometime. Probably would’ve led to some pretty bad shit for me, and I love my job too much.

"t3_1j58nd7","I saw CSAM on “X” today and it just ruined my day and pissed me off","Probably gonna delete this soon as I just wanted to get it off my chest and have no one to talk about this with. I’m sorry if this is too explicit.

Kinda embarrassing but I have a personal porn account on twitter just for reposting videos that I find hot and stuff like that, probably my fault as this stuff is the wild west but I’ve had that account for almost 3 years and have NEVER seen any CSAM EVER.

I only watch videos of adult couples who are promoting their stuff so that type of thing never pops up.

One of the accounts I follow but never really see had been sold and taken over or something and reposted a sexually suggestive video of a girl that was very obviously young as fuck like 12-13.

I clicked on the original account to see if all the videos were like this and it was literally just a bunch of young girls maybe 10 to mid teens with some in EXTREMELY explicit situations.

I was absolutely disgusted and reported the account IMMEDIATELY and the account that reposted the video.

Then worst part is that the reposted video had over 1k likes and 350 reposts, I looked at the reposts and it was HUNDREDS of GROWN ASS MEN and a bunch of fake OF accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers (obviously not run by whoever’s pictures they’re using) just mindlessly reposting whatever.

I’m just disgusted, this is the type of thing you hear about but never really see for yourself. I can’t stop thinking about those poor young girls and how they must be feeling and how they hell they were taken advantage of to get into that position. Also the poor young girls who were probably groomed into sending explicit vids and don’t know those videos are floating around on the internet, or perhaps they sent them to another teen and they got leaked. Sad and disgusting. I hate this world. 🤮

I know this is partly my fault for watching porn online but it honestly jumpscared me seeing that, I don’t really watch porn that much anymore but this has scarred me for sure. 🙃","36","18"
"t3_1j4mzu2","My ex best friend tried to ruin my life because my brother rejected her 10 years ago. She won’t stop.","This started years ago now and I’ve pretty much let it go, but I never talked about it fully with people (out of trying to not pull people into it) when it was happening so here goes. Warning-It’s long lol

I met this friend through another friend, and we quickly became close. We ended up working together as well (for my parents, another area of my life I needed to have boundaries but I was 19 and thought it would be fine), would hang out after work… we called each other “twin” because we had a lot in common. We got hired for a creative project together as we were both into photography. We worked on personal creative projects together… we were together CONSTANTLY.

We were teenagers, and as teenage girls often are, we were constantly talking about different guys we were interested in, and I found out she was interested in my brother. They went on a date and my brother very quickly realized they were not compatible. This is where I can pinpoint a change in our friendship.

She stopped asking me to hang out. I would ask her to hang out and she would be busy. She would constantly hang out with our mutual friends. At the time, I thought reaching out and asking if I had done anything wrong to warrant not being invited places I had previously been invited to was the right choice, and got told “don’t worry about it, everything is good.” I was getting married at the time and had already asked her to be my maid of honor, so I assumed that maybe it was a rough patch, I was stressed, etc. (tip: don’t assume everything is fine, she’s in all my wedding photos now lol)

The REAL switch to trying to ruin my life was after I got married. I have been photographing for years, and decided to try to pursue it as a business as my parent’s business had closed. She HATED that because she did photography too, and suddenly any similarities we had were me “copying her”. I posted a story on IG about prices, she posted “the original is always better than the copy.” One of her friends (that I didn’t know was her friend at the time) modeled for me, and she posted that “people always try to undercut your business.” At one point, I posted something (I don’t even remember what it was at this point) and she posted within 5 minutes and said “Okay, she’s obviously copying me right?”

Now, full transparency- I did not handle this well. I tried to talk it out with her, tried everything I knew, and she would smile to my face and tell me everything was okay and then continue to do this. I found myself looking at her posts constantly because she would never say what I had done to hurt her to my face but would post consistently, so I felt like at least I could try to piece together what had gone wrong (and also, if she felt I had been copying her, I wanted to make sure I didn’t post anything similar to her because I genuinely just wanted it to stop.) We talked a couple times, tried to make amends, but she still would post about me often.

A couple years later, I did a photoshoot with another photographer modeling for me for a concept around a pregnancy loss. I have chronic health issues and so does this photographer, and I decided to center it around healing. It was a beautiful project. The DAY I posted about it, she posted a video on TikTok that said “if you want to be me just say that.” I didn’t follow her, but with her being a contact in my phone sometimes her videos would still pop up. That was it. After all the posts and all the years of just dealing with it, I was done. She had tried to isolate me from members of my husband’s family, she had deleted texts and then posted screenshots of our “conversations” and I had just turned the other cheek… but if she could somehow take a photoshoot about MY pregnancy loss and make it about her, I was done. I blocked her on everything. And then I started seeing friends of hers looking at my posts, so I blocked several of them as well.

I’m 28 now and have a wonderful life with my husband and our son. I do photography part time now so I can stay home and take care of him. I have talked to her once since, and I asked her why she did all of that. She told me that it was because she had a hard time with her dynamic with my brother and my family after working for my parents. I asked her specifically what I did, and all she said was that I was “clingy and she wanted other friends”. I personally have let a lot of it go, but there’s always little reminders of it because our circles are so intertwined and tonight I feel like it’s okay to talk about to strangers on the internet because I never said anything to anyone else when it was happening except for my husband and a few friends, never did anything about it and just prayed she would stop.

So there’s that. Just a big ol’ “get it off my chest”. The biggest thing I learned from it is friends that aren’t willing to talk through it are not friends I want to have, and that sometimes you just need to block and walk.","1050","17"
"t3_1j5uigi","I feel invisible to my partner and it hurts","I have been with my partner for over a year. I honestly don't even know how to describe the feeling. I feel invisible. I feel like they don't care to know me or care enough to notice something is wrong until I'm at my breaking point.

I sat here trying to convince myself that if I give it more time they will know me more. I know everything about them, their likes, their hates, what could make them smile and just tiny things about their life. Some of it I write down so I don't forget and other times I just remember.

The other day, my partner just found out what my favourite animal was, but it wasn't the first time, i told them before. This happened 2 separate times and all they said was that ""my memory is really bad"".

When I try to talk about any part of my life they start kissing me as if they want me to stop. Now I'm here sitting across them and realising that I am invisible to them. I've been having a rough time, they haven't noticed. I noticed when it happens to them.

I keep telling myself that this is the healthiest relationship I've been in and that we communicate well and that maybe this is something to just talk out and hope it gets better because whilst I dont feel important to them, they're are important to me and I don't want to lose them.

It makes me extremely sad that I feel this way and a part of me wants to accept this as my life now because maybe this is the best love that I deserve? Maybe this is karma for the things I did wrong.","1","1"
"t3_1j5u6ov","Why I don't support or celebrate Specific Group Celebration Holidays? (Men/Women/Mother/Father/Pride/Black History/etc)","I want to start by saying that this is a personal opinion and I understand and also support personal opposing views on this topic regarding individuals who believe the days to be an ""exemplification"" of feelings rather than the notes listed below.

In the past few weeks I've been hounded on a LOT about not celebrating valentines day, mothers day, or International Womens Day by people other than the ones I'd celebrate them for. Ranging from people telling me I'm an awful human being for not appreciating my mom or women in general(despite this being wholly inaccurate) to people threatening to assault me because i didnt do something special for my mom on mothers day. I wanted to hear from random strangers online if my reasoning is sound and makes sense as toward why I don't celebrate them specifically as when I explain it in person, people seem to get quite upset with me regardless.

I would like to note that around the holiday, not on the holiday itself all the time, just around that time period, I still put more effort and care into the relevant individuals, but I just don't like to celebrate the days themselves for the reasons listed below.

My reluctance to celebrate holidays like Father’s Day, Mother’s Day, International Women’s or Men's Day, and others that specifically celebrate a group of individuals stems from a few key personal beliefs and feelings.

Forced Social Expectations

I often feel that these holidays create an obligation rather than a genuine expression of appreciation. Society dictates that on this specific day, I must express gratitude or admiration, even if I already do so in my own way throughout the year. It feels performative—like I’m expected to participate just because it’s a designated date, rather than acting on my feelings when they naturally arise.

2. Commercialization Over Meaning

These holidays have been heavily commercialized, turning what should be a meaningful moment into an opportunity for businesses to sell cards, flowers, gifts, and expensive dinners. It feels less about genuine appreciation and more about fulfilling a marketing-driven expectation. I don’t like the idea of my relationships being tied to consumerism, where love and respect are measured by the money or effort spent on a particular day.

3. Personal Connection to the Honored Group

Sometimes, I don’t have a personal connection that makes celebrating these holidays meaningful. For instance, if someone has a complicated relationship with their parents or lacks a strong figure that fits into the holiday’s framework, these days can feel alienating rather than celebratory. It’s a reminder of what someone might not have, rather than an opportunity to appreciate what I do.

4. Selective Recognition Feels Arbitrary

Why do we elevate specific groups on designated days while overlooking the everyday contributions of others? It feels arbitrary—why celebrate fathers on one day and mothers on another when both play roles throughout the year? Why single out women for one day rather than advocating for equal treatment and appreciation daily? It seems more symbolic than substantive, and I prefer actions that carry meaning every day rather than confining appreciation to a calendar date.

5. Pressure to Conform

There’s an implicit pressure to participate in these celebrations, whether it’s through social media posts, attending gatherings, or giving gifts. If I choose not to, there’s often an assumption that I don’t care or that I’m being inconsiderate. But in reality, I simply prefer to show my appreciation in my own way, at my own time, without feeling compelled by external expectations.

6. Not Everyone Experiences These Days Positively

For many people, these holidays can be painful rather than joyous. Someone who has lost a parent might struggle on Mother’s or Father’s Day. Someone who has faced discrimination or hardship might not feel comfortable with the broad generalizations made on International Women’s Day, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, or International Men's Day. These celebrations assume a universal experience that doesn’t exist, and I’d rather avoid engaging in something that might inadvertently bring discomfort to others.

7. Personal Values and Approach

Ultimately, I value sincerity over tradition. If I appreciate someone, I want to show it naturally, in a way that feels right to me, not because a calendar tells me to. I don’t need a designated day to tell my parents I appreciate them, nor do I need a specific date to recognize the struggles and achievements of any group. I’d rather express my respect, gratitude, and admiration in everyday moments, through my actions and words, rather than as part of a structured societal ritual. For these reasons, I tend to avoid participating in these kinds of holidays. It’s not out of defiance or lack of appreciation, but rather a personal preference for authenticity over obligation.","0","3"
"t3_1j4vi0l","I'm a male escort and I have a crush on my client: Part 2? (Tiny update on my plan, and back story)","I just want to say thank you for all the replies. Honestly, it’s really opened my eyes. I think I was very lost in my feelings, and I truly appreciate everyone encouraging me to go for it, as well as those who reminded me to be careful and respect her boundaries. That’s really important to me. The last thing I want to do is make her feel uncomfortable or like I’ve overstepped, so I want to be very mindful of that.

I also just want to say thank you for all your love and support. I'm a bit shocked. You guys are incredible people.

Someone suggested a book for me to read, and someone else suggested that I HEAL... Yes. I do think this is the crux of the matter. Thank you for that. I looked into the book and honestly, I think it's exactly my current experience.

I got a lot of DMs asking for my personal experience and also, how to become a male escort. I thought I'd give a tiny update on what I plan to do, and then my story, in case people might be interested.

Sorry of its long and jumbled. I've only ever really spoken about some of these things with my current client.

Okay so my idea: I don’t know if it’s going to work, but I think it allows me to put the idea there in a careful way. Based on how she reacts, I might then make the decision to drop her as a client because I don’t think this situation is healthy for me. Some people have pointed out that this isn’t a great way to do business as an escort, and I completely agree.

Honestly, if I’m being real, I don’t think I'm a good escort anyway 😄 businesses wise.

So, here’s my plan. My birthday is later this month, and there’s a company in our area that specializes in theatrical productions. They have a live performance at a restaurant where you get dinner and a show all in one. From what she and I have talked about, this is exactly the kind of thing she values. She loves theater, singing, opera, she’s very cultured in that way. And it’s something that appeals to me, too, for my own reasons, which I’ll write in my back story, in case someone is interested.  She also knows this is something personally meaningful to me.

So, I’m going to buy two tickets, but I won’t invite her outright. Instead, I’ll reach out and jokingly reference the terms of the boyfriend experience she paid for, something like, “You know, technically part of the package is me checking in on you, and I haven’t heard from you in a while (haha)"". Depending on how she responds, I might then say something like, “I was actually given two tickets to this event, but I don’t have anyone who would really appreciate it. Would you maybe want to come with me?” She knows that’s true. I really don’t have anyone else for something like this.

The reason I thought this might be a good approach is because a lot of people pointed out that her paying puts her in control of the dynamic, which I completely agree with. But in this scenario, there’s a disconnect from that. It’s something separate... What do you think?

Here's my story:

I grew up in a small rural town, close to where I currently am. My home life wasn’t ideal, a bit of a mix of financial instability and neglect. I didn't finish school and by the time I was around 16, I was doing odd jobs, mainly in auto repair.

I learned from the older men in town, working informally in backyard garages. I guess I figured this would be my future. Everyone in this town was kind of like that. Grew up there. Married someone who lived there. Never left... Everyone has dated everyone, kind of thing. I was never really interested in dating.

There was a girl a bit older who only showed up on weekends and during school holidays. She was visiting from somewhere bigger. She went to school in the city. We weren’t close or anything, but just knowing someone like that existed, that could... Leave the town? I don't know. I think it gave me hope or something.

Later on, I got an opportunity to work as a farm laborer in the area. The farmer was an older man, past retirement age but still running around and working. He had a wife and two adult children. I was fixing fences and machinery, driving tractors, hauling feed, digging in the dirt with spades, but eventually the farmer saw, I don't know, potential? In me. He gave me more responsibilities, and a few years later, I had some kind of a foreman role.

One day, I was about to go into the farmer’s office when I overheard him and his son talking about me. I ended up eavesdropping, probably shouldn’t have, but I did. His son is more 10 years older than me, I'm not exactly how much older, and he was basically saying that me and my whole family were low class.

And honestly? It hurt. But also because I felt like he wasn’t wrong. We were low class. But my mom was trying her best. She wasn’t around much, but that was because she was working constantly to make ends meet. And I have my own complicated feelings about her, but I also recognize that she was doing what she thought was best for us.

What really got to me, though, was the son has had every opportunity handed to him... His family is wealthy, he can travel wherever he wants, study whatever he wants, never worry about money. And yet, he does nothing. I don’t want to sit here and judge someone else’s life, but he sleeps until 10am every day, barely does anything, then goes out drinking every night.

Half the time, he’s passed out on a couch, sometimes puking from drinking too much. And that’s the person calling me low class?Someone who’s never had to fight for anything, never had to struggle to survive?

But maybe he has his own demons he’s dealing with. Maybe this is just his way of coping. I don’t know. What I do know is that comments like that stick with me. And I do know that I’m not that guy passed out on the couch. I’m out here trying.

Eventually the farmer offered to pay for a GED for me. I took the opportunity and I'm so grateful for that man. I took a GED course that was offered by the university in the next town over. The ""big city"". But it was actually just a bigger town 😂

It opened my eyes. Suddenly, the world felt bigger. I had savings from working on the farm, and I wanted to go further, get a degree, but I needed a way to make some more money.

That's when I kind of considered escort work. I don't really have some dramatic story. I just Googled ""Male escort agencies near me"" 😅

I was surprised by how many results popped up. At first, it was just research, out of curiosity more than anything. But found a website that seemed legit (or at least, more polished than the sketchy looking ones). I sent an email, attached a couple of photos. And then a few weeks later I got a call and I met up for coffee with two men. One was the ""manager"", the other was an escort himself. They explained the business was small, just a handful (lol) of guys. Their clients are men and women. They weren’t high-end, but they aimed for discretion and professionalism.

At first I wasn't sure. But I did like these men and the way they carried themselves. They were confident, polished, almost like businessmen who just happened to be in a very unconventional business. They made it seem... professional. I decided to just give it a go. Why not...

They provided me with a handbook of some sorts. It had information on how to conduct one self as an escort. How to negotiate with clients. Self defence... Information on drug use. How to identify and avoid STDs. Things I always need to take with me when seeing clients. How to dress yourself. Some legal aspects that might arise. Honestly it was all very helpful.

My first client was a woman in the middle of her PhD. I didn’t know what I expected... But I guess it was not was I was expecting? She was blunt, straightforward, and treated the encounter like a business transaction. There was no awkwardness, no false pretenses. It was surprisingly easy. She was my client for a long time. I saw her maybe twice a week.

Over the next two or three years, the agency changed. More men joined, some left, and eventually, the guy managing it moved on to other things. The few of us who remained started working more independently but still using the agency’s reputation, but mostly managing our own profiles.

That brings me to the current situation, I guess.

Some people have asked about my future plans, whether I’m thinking about a different job or what happens if things pan out with my client. So I thought I’d write something about that here.

From the beginning, my business as an escort was always slow. It seems like the escorts who take both male and female clients get more work, but I was only comfortable working with female clients, so maybe that played a role. Either way, it was never something that fully supported me. There were times, especially over the last year and a half, when I didn’t get any work at all. It was really just a side hustle, something that sometimes worked out and sometimes didn’t.

I'm trying to focus on getting my degree. I’m older than most of my classmates, of course.

In my second year, I got the opportunity to work as a pharmacy assistant. The pharmacy was close to my university, so I could walk over after class. I’m really grateful for that job because it helped me a lot financially. Then, from there, I landed an internship at a company in my field. It’s part-time, but they’re paying me to work there, and there’s an understanding that once I graduate (which, if all goes well, should be by the end of this year), they’ll offer me a full-time position.

So, escorting was something I turned to as a way to earn extra income, and for a while, it did help. But I always knew it wasn’t sustainable, and I’ve been slowly stepping away from it. In fact, before this specific client, I hadn’t taken on anyone in quite a while. I had a few once off clients here and there.

Some of the comments suggested that I should let my client know that I’m quitting escorting and that if she still wants to stay in touch, we could. That’s something I’ve been thinking about too. Because the truth is, I am stepping away. The agency doesn’t really exist anymore and it’s basically just a bunch of us still lingering. But I think I’d like to make this official. It feels like the right time to close that chapter and fully focus on what’s next.

As for why this event that I want to ask her to is special to me:

It ties back to something from my childhood. When I was growing up, there was an old lady in town who played the organ at the church. My home life wasn’t great, as I've said. But to give more context, my mom was raising me, my sister, and my sister’s baby, my niece, who was unfortunately born addicted to heroin. My dad was... somewhere, but not in the picture.

I had a cheap bicycle and used to ride around town a lot. One day, I rode past this lady’s house and saw that she had a dog. I don’t know why, but I just went inside her yard and started playing with her dog. I was about eight or nine at the time. She invited me in for tea and cookies. She was a retired music teacher. She actually called my mom to let her know I was there, and my mom was absolutely livid, telling me how inappropriate that was. And yeah, maybe it was. But the old lady seemed to like me.

I ended up going back a few times, I guess I helped her around the house and in the garden sometimes. She was a widow and her son was living overseas. She tried to teach me how to play the piano. I never really got good at it, but it became something special to me. I sometimes go to concerts when I can, sometimes there are music concerts at my university.

So this specific even that I want to invite her to, really resonates with me. I don't know if it's the right thing or not. I guess we'll see.

If you've made it this far, thank you for time. I think I really needed this and I needed all of you.","168","31"
"t3_1j5tyun","I lost $10000 to a scammer today due to my stupidity, and my naivety.","The scammer called me through my phone and said he is a police in my city and read all my personal information like name, age,... he said I was involved in a money laundering scheme and I said I was not.

He then proceed to pronounce the name of the people that actually got involved in a money laundering scheme, they first asked me if I know this person, I said no and he told me that because of my personal data was leaked, they used my personal information to impersonated me and told me to cooperate with the scammer. they even gave me the online newspaper link and it was real, the actual legit online newspaper website about the actual money laudering scheme.

The scammer then told me to went on zoom and make a video call, He showed his police uniform, name badge, etc... and I am so foolish that I even believed it was real.

The scammer then became like a father figure, a friend, talking friendly, etc... the scammer made sure I trust him.

He then later told me that he will clean my profile on the police database. He also need proof for all my funds, no dirty money, he told me to transfer the money to a strange bank account.

When the transfer is completed, another person was in the video chat room and said :""the money is transfered to the goverment for checking"" ""yes sir"" the scammer said.

This is the part where the scammer is the biggest asshole in the world, he told me to transfer more, I didn't have enough money, he told me to sell the laptop then transfer the money to make proof that it's also not dirty money.

After that I just told him to go fuck yourself and fuck off and give all my money back, but it was too late. I report to the police station after that.

I wish I could kill him right now, punch him in the face, also sell all his organs to make some money.","0","35"

Ive been working 50 - 60 hours a week for two years doing this sort of work and it's extremely mind numbing. There's no challenge, there's no getting better at my job. I am a body. That's it. Anybody, literally anybody, could do this job.

Any attempts to move into a higher position have been shot down because someone more senior wanted it or my employer decided to hire outside the company. Looking for a new job feels hopeless since it seems like no matter what I take, I'll be taking a significantly lower pay (something I can't afford to do). I can't even go to school part time to move into the industry that I want to because I don't have a consistent schedule.

I still remember the time when you were always at my parents house for that sniping game and i always beated you making you angry as hell. I miss those days in school when you never left me alone being in troubles. We were very different, you a fucking clown and me, like you used to call me, ""mister perfect douche"".

Believe me bro it was... it was a fucking torture seeing you in that hospital bed fighting with cancer and knowing that you couldn't win this time. You couldn't see it but when you died a part of my heart broke. Even when you asked me to take care of your daughter( Sofi) like she was mine i was in a mix of emotions. Scared and honored. You didn't deserved cancer(and your ex to leave you in your weakest moment) believe me when i say that i always wished to take it instead of you. You had a daughter, a gf and a life to be build brick by brick while i was just trying to figure out what the fuck to do with my life. 6 years passed by and i might sound repetitive but i wish you would be here for only 1 minute to see that your best friend tried and is trying his best for your daughter, i wish you would be here to see how much she is grown and how absolutely sweet and kind she become.

You bastard left me! And even now while i'm writing this you are making me cry you asshole. 6 years bro, 6! I still miss you like the first day.

I just hope you are somewhere happy, calm and with 0 regrets. I wish too you are still practicing at that sniping game cause when i would be there with you the match would be a must!

I saw an old photo of us today when we were 7 and like always together! Don't worry bro we will always be together and we will always be in troubles together like a team.

"t3_1j5janh","People with digestive malfunctions, I understand you. Lots of people do.","Three years ago, I experienced strong health issues regarding my digestive systems. Basically, I was unable to eat, and had diarrheas (all evenings from 6pm, which is very weird, your digestive system ain't supposed to work that way) I had tests running, and nothing worked. Nor they found what I had (I had like deep tests, including bloods and cameras in my stomach). It caused a depression (or the depression caused it? Who knows?). I was belittled by my GP who was like ""you've got nothing dude you're fine, in fact you're overreacting"". (I was willing to kill myself at the time because I had no hope I'd able to have a normal life) Then, I changed my GP, she gave my antidepressants, and it went slowly better. I finally recovered after like 8 months in hell. I was able later to enjoy my life.

Now, as I am about to do something thrilling in my life for a few months, symptoms are back. It's been one month. I'm unable to eat, and I want to puke like a lot (like I have no appetite at all, I have dark thoughts, eructations...) Don't know why, might be after a COVID infection I had (but like I've had 6 of them till 2020 so I don't know). Or a changing environment. I left my city. It's bad, but that time I got antidepressants quick, whereby I hope my symptoms will get better. I searched on the Internet, might be dyspexia.

Si if anyone is experiencing something similar (or generally troubles with their intestines yk), you're not alone. We are a lot struggling with a society that does not understand us. I always had the feeling that, for people, when you don't have something killing you like cancer, it's no big deal you are overreacting and complaining for nothing. Cancer is terrible, worse for most of them, but our troubles count. Especially when you can't enjoy a meal, a party, or just hanging out with friends because of that.

Gotta wait one week for the effects of my antidepressants, we'll see. The only good thing is that it disappeared one time, so it can disappear again.

"t3_1j5j3ag","I'm Tired of Not Having Friends","Just here to vent.

I (29m) have never had any real friends. I've always just had people that I know. Now, I'm at the point where I realize that I don't have anyone at all. I thought that I had friends at various points in my life, but they never stuck around for one reason or another. They were only ""friends"" with me out of convenience, meaning that they didn't have any of their actual friends around and buddied up to me to pass the time. Then there were those who were only ""friends"" with me to get what they wanted out of me before ghosting me or flipping out when I stopped providing what they wanted and ditched me. Those ""friends"" who wanted rides or money or favors that monopolized my time and resources to the point where trying to tell them that they were asking too much of me made them lash out. Those ""friends"" who wanted everything from me, from a listening ear to a walking atm, but who wouldn't do nearly the same thing for me. Those ""friends"" were some of the worst, but, honestly, the worst ones were those who tried to buddy up to me because they ""felt bad that I was all by myself"" because friendships built out of pity have the least amount of respect for the one being pitied.

Honestly, I'm tired of it. I'm tired of feeling and being alone in crowded rooms. I'm tired of not having anyone around who cares about me and actually wants me around. I'm tired of being made to feel like it's a chore for others to talk to me. I'm tired of caring more about others than they do for me. I'm tired of being so lonely.

I haven't had any real social connections in years and it's, obviously, starting to get to me. I just want to have people to talk to about random, every day crap. Or, better yet, I want to have people to have serious conversations with about the universe and life or whatever over a bonfire or in a random spot in the middle of the desert on a clear, star filled night. I want to have people who don't look at me funny when I say we should go on a random adventure to a museum that I think looks cool or some gimmicky attraction that I found that looks like it would be fun. I like gimmicks and museums and want people around who aren't going to call me weird for liking them and wanting to go experience them. I want someone to go fishing with who isn't going to say they're bored every five minutes or tell me we should just go to a bar because ""it's the same thing."" It's not the same thing and I don't drink. I just want to have people around who take as much interest in me as I do in them without calling me or my interests weird or creepy or boring or lame.

I want to go to museums and attractions with people. I want to go on random adventures to random places; maybe go randonauting or urban exploring- there's plenty of places to see. I want to go fishing with people. I want to watch football and baseball with people; maybe even go to a local game together. I want to have people who'll play basketball or badminton or Pokémon Go with me. I want to go bowling and to the arcade and to the put-put spot with people. I want to play billiards with someone who isn't going to call me creepy for loving to play it. I want to drive around aimlessly listening to true crime podcasts or creepypastas (Creepsmcpasta specifically) or just with people who'll share music with me and not call my taste in music weird or old-fashioned. I want to go have lunch in my car in the Sonic stalls with someone (don't know why, it just sounds like it'd be fun). And on that note, I want to have someone who's willing to go try new food places with me. I want to have someone to talk to about anything and everything. I want to be able to talk to someone about who's the best Robin or how Anissa is the worst character in Invincible (even worse than Immortal). I want to have someone to talk to about some random occult things that I read about or saw on the internet. I think it'd be kinda fun to pull out the Ouija board or some tarot cards or something. I want someone to share random fun facts with me as much as I like to share with them. I want to be tagged in random posts on social media or actually have someone acknowledge that we did something together or, better yet, have people who'll want to take pictures with me without telling me that I ruined the picture by smiling weird or just telling me that they don't like taking pictures with me. I want to have a barbeque by the pool in the summer; maybe throw a football around in the street. Or maybe have some random potluck and I'll make some Currywurst for people to try. I want people to teach me some of the languages that they speak or maybe want to learn one with me or I'll teach them some German.

Honestly, as long as I had someone around who would share with me what I share with them, then that would be enough. Looking back on what I've already written, none of that would actually matter in comparison to just knowing that I had a friend. But, writing this all out and venting just makes me feel pathetic. It makes me feel even worse than having my family question me when I go out because I don't have friends so why am I out. That hurts on it's own, but the vibe of desperation that this seems like feels worse than that. I don't know. I've gotten this far, but it feels like none of it even matters and there's no point regardless. I'm just that person who doesn't have friends and it's just one of those things that needs to be accepted even though it hurts. It is what it is. It's really not like it matters anyway because if the rest of this year plays out how I'm expecting it to, I won't be here by this time next year anyway, so that just makes it easier, I guess. So, why not vent and ruminate for a while and see how I feel later on? Maybe things will be different and I'll feel differently. Plus, thinking about everything makes me think that I'm just better off alone regardless, but, even then, it doesn't make the pain of that loneliness go away, so at least having some type of outlet helps in it's own way. It's better than nothing and just keeping all of this bottled up at least.","4","2"
"t3_1j5saoz","My girlfriend said she'd cheat on me and now I feel worthless","I(MTF 19) and my girlfriend(F19) have been together for about 4 months now. I know it isn't a lot of time but I really felt something for her. She was the only person with who I could share my deepest secrets without judgement. She knew me, I didn't have to wear a mask around her and that made me comfortable. We lived 8 hours away from each other. We met every month or even more frequently. I helped her with her struggles at the beginning. She was freshly after a breakup with a guy she lived with, she was extremely emotional since they guy seemed not to have cared for her. He promised to visit her, but didn't and only like 2 months after their breakup he started relentlessly calling her. Nudging her to go to therapy etc. He even joined her friend groups discord server and that made her so emotional she quit the internet for a week and only talked to me through phone. I helped her through this period, i was always calling her and wanted to spend every minute of my time with her. First off it was good. We talked, we played games, we watched movies. She had her weird habits but i got used to them. Eventually we started arguing, a lot. I mean I really did all i could for her. She was my priority all of the time. I called off parties to want to spend time with her. I went on a 10 hour train ride just to see her and comfort her in a place she didn't really have a lot to do. But the thing is, she never really cared for me the way I did for her. I reserved time for us during new year's eve just so I could see her and she had a mood swing or something and called it off since she thought I was getting attached to quickly. We were to meet about 2 weeks ago but she called it off too since our conversations wasn't good. I am not going to lie, It was not a pleasant conversation but a honest one, nothing to get offended by. Just us talking about us in a slightly sadder tone. I get really emotional and jealous, like she was talking to her friend that he has to watch something and that she's willing to watch the entirety of it with him. I just thought, well, why doesn't she want to watch things with me? Why does she want to visit him, not me? I was her girlfried at the end of the day and that guy called everything she recommended ""crappy"". It's like I gave her all this attention and she didn't even care enough to visit me. This morning she wrote me an ominious message ""Would you still want to be around me if I had kissed someone else in the past month"", I replied that if she would give someone a kiss on a cheek or something, which is kind of normal in my part of the world, I'd be okay with it but if it was romantic, something that could be classified as cheating I would leave. She then said that it is going to happen and that she would have done it a long time ago if it hadn't been for that that she doesn't go out much and is pretty asocial. I mean that kind of broke me. I never had any meaningful relationship, I was always hiding a part of myself and when a person that accepted me came along they stab me in the back in such a heinous manner. I already got cheated on once. I know how it ends, there is no redemption, no coming back to what once was. I really loved her, gave her everything I could but that still wasn't enough.","1","7"
"t3_1j4tynm","Everyone thinks I'm a domestic abuse victim. I'm not, I just literally walked head first into a door...","Basically, I'm a clutz!

I'm very grateful to doctors and nurses who care about their patient's overall wellbeing, not just about their injury. But when you're me, that can lead to some serious problems. Showing up to the hospital with a severe nosebleed, two puffy, black eyes and a bump on my forehead that puts comic books to shame, I absolutely understand they're worried. And especially when the explanation is ""I walked into a door"".

Here's the thing though: I ACTUALLY WALKED INTO A DOOR!!! Not only that, I was wearing crocs. And yes, I know: ewww crocs! But my mum bought them for me and they're really practical when I just need to put some shoes on to run to the mailbox.

In case you're unfamiliar with crocs, they're like bouncy rubber balls when you wear them and hit your foot on, let's say, a door! So here I am, in a bit of a rush, shoving my feet into said crocs and then attempting to run out the door. Only, I somehow misjudged the distance to or the size of the door? Maybe? Whatever the reason, when I pulled the door open while simultaneously rushing at it, my foot hit the corner of the door. So the door stopped instantly, but my body didn't, resulting in my face smacking straight into the side edge of the door. Impact no 1. As if that wasn't bad enough, my leading foot was between the door and doorframe, so when the door bounced off my back croc, it hit my front croc, bounced back and smacked me in the face again. Impact no 2. It then bounced into the front croc, and back again. Impact no 3. I'm pretty sure that's when my nose got squished. I'm not sure how many more times it happened, but it sounded like a machingun was going off! I was so disoriented, seeing double, blood flooding out of my nose, my eyes rapidly swelling shut, and it felt like my forehead was splitting down the middle.

So yeah, I don't blame the hospital for thinking my ""I walked into a door"" was a lie...","172","84"

You’re probably wondering why I’m still with them. I don’t really know, I’m starting to hate them and I’m starting to feel deep resentment towards them. I honestly thought we were going to get married and have kids and idk why I thought that when they have fought me at every step. I’ve realized I wouldn’t want to have kids with them as I wouldn’t want them exposed to my partners bouts of explosive anger. I wouldn’t want them thinking the way I’m treated is acceptable and I wouldn’t want them thinking that not wanting to be a better person is okay. I say all that but I am deeply in love with them, I don’t really know what to do because leaving is hard for me and for them but I can tell at this point that’s what’s needed. They are very clear with their actions in showing me they don’t care for me the way I care for them and my self esteem is shot to hell. Sometimes I envy they’re ability to treat me poorly and still feel like they’re a good person, but then I remember there’s a reason every person they’ve ever been with has left, and I need to follow suit because everyday I fall deeper into the cycle of nonsense and bullshit. I love them deeply, like I’ve never loved before but maybe that’s bc we’re addicted to each other’s toxicity.

I want to leave I promise I know I need to for my mental health and for theirs, I just don’t know how…I just wanted to get it off my chest. I’m having a really hard time coming to terms with this relationship failing for some reason and I’d honestly do anything to go back in time and figure out how to make it work but I can’t so this is just how it has to be ig.","1","1"
"t3_1j46bn8","I proposed to my fiancee and this is what my mom said when I told her.....","So, this happened 3 years ago. But it hasn't left my mind. I (23 F) at the time, proposed to my fiancee (25 M) at the time. After I proposed we got into the car and called my family and his to tell them the news. I called my grandma first then my granny. Then we called his mom and dad. Then I called my parents.... I asked my mom to put me on speaker and it went as followed.

Me: Momma, Daddy, I'm getting married!

Mom: I'm not paying for it.

Me: ...... Okay?

Dad: Congratulations missy.

Followed by a awkward uncomfortable pause. Then I just told them we had to call other people and hung up... my fiancee and I looked at each other in disbelief. I knew growing up that I wasn't the favorite but... I never asked for anything or that I wanted them to pay for it.... it just broke my heart... Only my husband and best friend know she said this to me... I'm already low contact with my parents...","7255","181"
"t3_1j59s2n","Influencer Marketing Agencies Are a Scam – I Worked for 3 of the Biggest Ones","I worked at three of the biggest influencer marketing agencies over the last decade, and now that I don't, it's finally safe for me to speak the truth without risk to my career - I need to expose that whole industry as a scam and no one is talking about it..

""Influencer Marketting"" agencies make almost all their money NOT from sponsorships but from influencers paying them monthly fees to FIND them sponsorships that never happen. I was shocked each time I got a new job at a new ""influencer marketing agency"" to discover they all work the same way- colleagues who mentioned it were fired or made redundant. It's kind of like a pyramid scheme... Out of thousands of influencers paying monthly ""subscription fees"", almost no sponsorships actually happened in the years I was there. All of our workload was dedicated to finding more influencers to sign up rather than sponsorship companies.

Think about it- why would we need sign ups in the first place if we can find sponsors? We'd obviously take a cut of sponsorship as that would make more money- right??!! What's going on is dishonest & takin advantage of the poor.

Most people think that a large following of 500K+ followers, makes that person wealthy. The reality is that 99% of people with 500k followers on insta and tiktok (and in many cases, youtube shorts), make nothing. I’ve worked with influencers sleeping in cars, couch-surfing, living below the poverty line for years, incredulous to the fact they aren't making anything, while my colleagues persuaded them to continue building a following and that sponsors were ""just around the corner"". We would be told to persuade these people to by dangling carrots like this. Many of them worked 20 hours a day to build a following- often from uplifting or positive content- and weren't narcissists- it is not a pleasant life, and I knew of so many like this.

I don't like how the industry is taking advantage of these people. Websites like SocialBlade are hilarious - the number of times I've seen them claim people are making $500K+ per year but in reality, they're earning nothing... It happens all the time.

The key is that most audiences aren't monetisable no matter how big they are, and the ones that ARE monetisable (e.g. ""technical"" topics), are nigh on impossible to persuade sponsors to bite because they're all so stuck in the past (they think of social media as something ""free"" and will only pay to advertise on TV or via traditional routes).

To make things worse, 99% of companies reaching out just want free advertising. They offer “exposure” or a cheap free product and refuse to pay. They all think that someone with a large social media following is a philanthropist millionaire, or can eat ""free products"", didn't work full time to build that following, and doesn't need income.

Meanwhile, marketing agencies exploit this situation by selling influencers false hope and taking their money with no return. It has to be biggest public perception vs. reality mismatch I’ve ever seen.. on such a grand scale.

No one is talking about this. Agencies won't talk about it because their income comes from maintaining the lie. Influencers themselves won't talk about it as they fear it might destroy their chances of getting a sponsor in future (which is never going to happen!!). So I had to get this off my chest, now that I don't work for them anymore. I'm frankly amazed these ""companies"" haven't been shut down.

I'm sorry but I can't name myself or the companies for obvious reasons, but they're all the same (afaik), and I can't give examples of specific social media accounts for similar reasons unfortunately. Therefore, you don't have to believe me on this, but I speak the truth & just happy to get this off my chest.

My advice to you if you're unable to find sponsors for social media following:- Don't waste any more time on it. Views can't pay your bills. Don't waste your life..- Don't trust any social media ""marketting agency"" that requires a monthly subscription fee from you (if they are genuine, they'll operate on a percentage of sponsorship deals that they obtain for you - NOT a monthly fee from you)- Don't trust when anyone tells you ""you're just marketting wrong- it's impossible to have no income on 500k followers"" - they don't know what they're talking about unfortunately. Most influencers even in the 500k braket make NOTHING, but none will admit it for fear of it sabotaging their future chances.- Spend your time re-skilling to do something else that will make a living, don't fall for this scam.- Even monetisable accounts with monetizable topics are VERY HARD to get sponsors for, that's why so many don't have a sponsor for years.- Don't fall for the ""if I get a big following I will automatically find ways to make an income"" trap

There. Off my chest!","17","0"
"t3_1j5f159","I’m going to visit the place I’ve always wanted to move to and I’m not telling anyone","Basically the title, I 22F am going to visit the city I’ve always wanted to move to. I want to visit not in a tourist way but staying in the areas where it would make sense for me to live in. I will decide if it is a fit for me and if it is I will start going around and looking for jobs. I have an idea how to get a place there (finding a sublet for a few months and eventually trying to lease). I have lived in a similar city so I have an idea of how to go about it. I currently live with my dad and I have come up with a complete lie to tell to him I am visiting my college town to see friends for a birthday. I am going 1000 miles away from there 😭 I have lived with my dad for the last year and I’ve enjoyed it but I need to be alone, I feel like an adult and I want to act independently and be able to be myself. I just feel like he will be angry that I am going to this city when I live with him because if I can afford to do this then I should be helping out more. I will be honest I partially took a term off so I could focus on moving out because I find this more important at this point in my life. I do not think I can be open about it since the city seems “unrealistic” in his eyes. The last time I moved when I went to college he said “you’ll be back in a year” and when I had to move back due to tuition issues he said “I told you so.” I didn’t stay with him for long that time but I bounced back. This time when I move I wouldn’t have to worry about tuition, I would be focused on making sure I make 3x or more on rent (which is why IF I like it I will be looking at jobs) and be able to figure my life out as woman in my 20s. I am so excited, I guess I wanted to share my excitement to go with someone so I’m doing it with the internet. I know this sounds like I’m more anxious which I am but I know I’m doing the right thing.","7","2"
"t3_1j4p77p","My (22F, south asian) friend (22F, white) said white men are not attracted to south asian women.","I moved to the US a year ago. Recently one of my friends have been trying to set me up with one of her mutual friends. She showed me and my other friend pictures of him. He's white. My other friend, also white, immediately said that this might not go well because she's certain that all white men prefer white girls or east asian girls. I was a bit taken aback and asked her what exactly she meant. She said that that's just how things are and that white men are not attracted to brown girls.

Lmao. Idek how to react. I know that's a massive generalization but also, does what she said have any merit to it nonetheless?","383","308"
"t3_1j5kfc0","Officially lost","I lost my best friend to suicide in November. I feel so alone.

Now I'm 30, I don't know how to make friends like that anymore, I don't think I ever can, definitely not one that was like him.

"t3_1j4hyop","I'm a ""rent man"" and I think I have a ""crush"" on my client","Warning: slightly sexually explicit. Probably NSFW.

I don't really know how to say any of this but I know I need to write it somewhere. I'll probably delete this at some point after.

I'm 27M and I'm a ""rent man"". Another term for what I do, is ""male escort"". But I live in a small, sleepy town, and we just don't call ourselves escorts.

I decided to get into this because I needed some money to help me finish my degree. I'm also in good shape so I thought it would be an easy side hustle. I didn't/ don't have a partner and I haven't been interested in dating.

Business is generally very slow. When I first started, I only had 1 client who I would visit every week. After that, she moved away and I had two more clients that I would see periodically. It was always a very clinical and mechanical experience (Get in, do what needs to be done, get out).

Things were quiet for about a year and a half. I wasn't really providing services anymore. But a few months ago, I got a message on my profile from a lady who was interested in my services. She was just reaching out, asking how it works.

We spoke for a bit and we decided to meet up. My services are customisable and she selected a variation of the ""boyfriend experience"".

I went to her house and I was... Surprised? She had a really nice place. In a rich neighbourhood. I'm sure this might not be out of the ordinary for other male escorts but my previous clients weren't situated in rich neighbourhoods. I didn't grow up rich.

She was very welcoming. She was a few years older than me. She seemed to have a successful career. We sat in the living room and just talked. She told me that she's had sex for her whole adult life, and she's enjoyed it for the most part. But she's had some kind of sexual awakening recently and she's looking for someone to explore this with. She said she doesn't even care if we didn't have sex that night. She wanted to talk to make sure that we would be a good fit for what she had in mind, and if I was okay with it. That was also a first for me. My previous clients didn't really care what I was okay with.

Anyway. Lots has happened since then. I see her maybe once every two weeks. And it's always an incredible experience. I can't explain it. Sometimes we have sex. Sometimes we dont. Sometimes we eat pizza and watch movies, sometimes we drink and have sex. It's so passionate. Sometimes it's primal. Sometimes it's lazy and intense. It's not the mechanical sex that I'm used to. She truly turns me on. She likes it when I'm satisfied.

Sometimes we just talk and nothing else. I've opened up to her about my life. She pays me every time. I've even started insisting that she doesn't need to. But she believes in me and my future and wants to support me in finishing my degree.

The problem is, I no longer see this as a professional relationship. I really like her. And she seems to really care about me, as a person.  We know so much about each other but I feel so weird to say that we're friends... She pays me for my time so are we really friends?

And sometimes I let my mind wander... What if we were more?

She's quite an incredible woman. And we've had many deep conversations. She's been through a lot.

One of the topics that came up was her previous relationships. Because I was wondering why she would approach a service, instead of exploring this with perhaps, a romantic partner? And I guess, long story short, she was in a relationship with a man who absolutely destroyed her. She no longer trusts people enough to share her life with.

She wants to be alone. Forever. But she desperately wants to explore her sexual side. I guess that's where I come in.

By the way. I know who this man is. It's a small town. F*ck you for what you did. You had such a great woman. What's wrong with you?

I haven't heard from her in a while. And I desperately want to reach out to her. I'm trying not to lose myself in this situation. I keep telling myself, she's just my client and nothing more. This is just me doing my job. But I know that I feel a certain way. Unfortunately, I don't think she'll ever see me as anything more.","1127","76"
"t3_1j4ypt0","The girl best friend is always the issue","I (20F) just went through my boyfriend (21M) of seven months phone for the first time. I have my face in his phone, and he’s told me multiple times that I can. However what I found has hurt me and hit my confidence in myself and my relationship.

I know that some girls have felt it too, that little nagging feeling that something is wrong. When I looked, I went straight for the girl best friend. And that is exactly where I found messages between them, Sexting.

It was about a year ago at this point that these messages were sent, however, they were saved in chat. He is still best friends with this girl and did not tell me about this because he said that he didn’t wanna lose her.

To give a little context, I have been cheated on with the girl best friend before, twice. So this immediately raised some red flags for me. To top it off too, recently the amount of times we are intimate has severely decreased(once a week or sometimes less)

I cried for a bit, and then I woke him up to talk to him about it. He apologized, and I was very mature and tried not to let my jealousy show. I told him it’s OK that he is still friends with her. I just wish she had told me.

However, a couple days later here we are, I can’t stop thinking about it, and how she’s everything I’m not. She’s skinny with blonde hair, he sexted with her and never does with me, and he seemed to be way more attracted to her than me. I can’t help but overthink and be jealous.

Edit:

thank you for all of the advice. I talked to my boyfriend and we have started to work it out, and set some boundaries so we can move forward. I am a firm believer of not having friends of the opposite sex but I also would never want to make him choose between us. He is an amazing guy and hopefully this just ends up being something we look back on. We have some growing to do of course, we’re young and new to this relationship, but we want to work it out together.

To clear some things up, no he did not cheat, just saying I have experience that issue with girl best friends in the past, and saying that I invaded is privacy is wrong. He put my face in him phone and told me I can look through it if I needed to. Yes, I’m crazy jealous, yeah I have some self doubt, but I was just venting about something that was bothering me, so then I could put words to paper and evaluate how I wanted to go about handling this.

Just want to remind some people that everyone is different, along with their relationships. I hope you have the day you deserve <3","56","88"
