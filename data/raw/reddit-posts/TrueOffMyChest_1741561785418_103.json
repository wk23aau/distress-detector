    "content": "We were close friends when I was younger,  between 20 - 25, he's 5yrs older. I trusted him. He raped me while I was drunk, unconcious. I didn't talk to him much after that, only at his fathers funeral, and my dads 70th birthday, trying to act normal. No one knows what he did 15 years ago, well I guess my dad knows now.\n\nMy dad called me on friday, letting me know he's not well and my parents and brother will visit him today,  one last time. Asking me if I wanted to join them, I said let me think about it. Yesterday I told my dad no, I will not be there because cousin did something I can't forgive. My dad's the best, I saw his face change but he didn't ask or press for info. He said he understood.\n\nIt did rip open an old wound. Honestly the guy's been dead to me for so long. I buried what happened in the back of my mind. Kind of blamed myself for being dumb enough to get so drunk and trusting someone to not take advantage. Now I realize this wasn't my fault. Today he will figure out I do not forgive him and never will. He will rot in the ground and I will spit on his grave.",

    "title": "I wouldn’t marry my husband of 17 years if given a do-over.",
    "content": "Four years ago, I felt like I had achieved all goals, happiness, and was married to my best friend. For context, I (35f) and my husband (38m) have been married for 17 years. I met him as a teenager, we dated, and married promptly after my 18th birthday. I felt like we had really worked through a lot of issues to build a good marriage and life together. I don’t have a strong support system of people in my life, so it was just him and me against the world. Well, that changed, and I’ve been beating myself up about it for a while, and trying to navigate my feelings, or just ignoring them, idk. I started to have feelings for a co-worker (I know, typical). He has been a friend at work, and is married. There has been nothing romantic between us, and I don’t get any indication from him that he is interested in more. He has just been supportive as my co-worker and a friend, and that friendship doesn’t extend outside of work at all. I have no interest in pursuing a romantic relationship with him either. I don’t want to have infidelity in my marriage or try to convince someone else to be untrue. And breaking marriages for another person just means a worse marriage.\n\nThis has really led me to contemplate my life. Why, when everything was feeling so right, did I start catching feelings for someone else. I looked back at our relationship and started seeing all the negative. I questioned if I was just looking for reasons to justify how I felt. I came to the realization that our dating relationship was abusive (and early years of our marriage). More than just bad, or two stupid kids. He was very controlling, pushed sex on me before I was ready, and even used a sexual act two different times as “punishment” (that was painful). Anytime I’m alone with my thoughts, I think that so much of how I am today in my relationship with him was shaped by the bad times. He isn’t that person any more, he isn’t controlling, and treats me better overall. But, I don’t have friends, am scared to make him mad, scared to talk about my feelings, am super agreeable to avoid any conflicts. He has been explosive and mean in the past when he gets angry, although that hasn’t been too recently. (Nothing ever physical.) I still feel like a terrible person for thinking about another guy, and feel some blame for wallowing in the past. I think if I would do it all over, and there’s no way I would stay in the relationship if given a do over. If I had a daughter, I would teach her how to avoid this and reach out for help.\n\nI feel like my eyes have been opened to the truth of our past. I tried to bring it up with him by asking what he thought about our dating relationship. He said he doesn’t really think about it, and I said that I thought it was bad. I brought up some things, and he didn’t want to talk about it. He said he had apologized and I just hadn’t forgiven him for it. He got mad, and I got upset and cried. I remember him giving an apology several years ago, we both got drunk and he said he felt bad about things and I consoled him, but I’m just now realizing it was abusive. I wanted to get confirmation from him that he agreed it wasn’t a healthy relationship, just for healing. But there was nothing productive about it.\n\nI find myself lately being depressed and bottled up. I work full time and my husband hasn’t had a job for a few years now. I really don’t care if he works, but want him to contribute to our relationship in some way. Instead he spends a lot of time sitting around the house on his phone making a mess and spending excessive amounts of time on hobbies. And no, I don’t think there is any chance he is cheating. I think he is also depressed. My guilt and frustration are overwhelming. I love him and he loves me, but I’m spending too much time in my head not dealing with my feelings, just hoping things find their place and go back, even though I know that’s not likely. I know I could use counseling to work on past trauma and learn to be a better partner myself. So maybe I’ll finally do that.",

    "title": "*FINAL UPDATE* I 21F found out my husband 33M has been having an affair with my mother, and I don’t know where to go from here?",
    "content": "Hey so this will be my final update on everything as I believe the situation has finally come to an end and I’m in a really good place.\n\nI left off where I was in a shelter and had made a lot of friends. Well the girl who I was gonna move somewhere with she ended up going back to her Mom and step Dad, and so I was back to being stuck on what to do. That was until I got a message from my grandma that her mom (my great-grandma) needs someone to care for her, she said that her brother would be happy to have me stay with him as long as I care for my great grandma. I decided I have nothing left to lose and decided this would be a good gig till I find out what I wanna do. I arrived in Miami 3 days ago and have been enjoying it greatly so far. I never really knew my dad’s side as he wasn’t that close with his family and after he passed it was hard to keep contact. My great-uncle is very nice and very accommodating and his wife is really nice, they live in quite a nice part of Miami as well near the beach.\n\nI haven’t seen my great-grandma in over 10 years and she was so happy when she saw me. She can’t speak that much English as she only really speaks Spanish. I’m aware I said my dad was white, but that’s was only because I was scared of my identity being revealed and that wasn’t a 100% lie. My father was Cuban and was born and raised in Miami, however, he was most likely a descendant of Spaniards. Anyways, my great grandma has been teaching me Spanish and as well through the help of translating of my great uncle stories about my dad. She told me that he would fall asleep on her lap at family gatherings and how he would make the whole family laugh imitating her accent. It made me tear up seeing all the photos of him as a kid with his whole family. She told me that when he got on drugs and ran away from home, it left everyone in complete distraught. She claimed my grandma would cry everyday.\n\nMy Mom never had a relationship with them, and that was her choice they wanted to meet her actually. They told me that they weren’t shocked what happened to me as my Dad told them later on my mom would cheat on him all the time with other men. This made me furious as my mom always claimed my dad was her “soulmate.”\n\nI have not heard anything from my mom, however, my cousins wedding went ahead yesterday as my aunty posted it on Facebook. My mom was there and she seemed completely fine from the photos. The wedding looked boring anyways, my cousin is marrying his first cousin from Pakistan (in-laws side) and no one is smiling. It made me laugh actually seeing my mom with all these people who are deeply religious and conservative. Seeing my mom next to my grandma and other female relatives who wear scarfs and are deeply religious, compared to my mom who sleeps with anyone that gives her an ounce of attention really cracks me up.\n\nAlso no word from my EX-husband, however, his sister sent me a text apologising on behalf of her and his parents.\n\nSo yeah that’s the end I believe I’m taking care of my great-grandma and will work out what I wanna do in the mean time. This will most likely (hopefully) be the final update as I believe I’m in a really good place.",

    "content": "When I was around 12 I touched my dad in his sleep. It happened like two more times until one time he woke up and I just pretended to sleep. So I knew what I was doing is wrong. For a little bit of background although I don’t want to justify anything my dad is a huge narcissist asshole. Abusive towards my mom and sister he hit them and they were more than often afraid for their lives. He also sexually assaulted my mother when she denied him sex and she was always very tired the next day. He watched openly pornographic content on the tv in the living room. While me and my sister as children were seeing this and when my mother confronted him I still remember him saying that he has to get his arousal somewhere. Also I vaguely remember while till I was 12 I came in the night in my parents bedroom to sleep there when I got scared and almost always he made sexual advances towards my mother and i interrupted him to sleep in between them. I also remember i kept going to sleep with them even when i was 12 and no longer scared to sleep alone just to protect my mother since my dad didn’t let her sleep in peace and continued sexually assaulting here. So I strongly feel all this played a part why i suddenly touched my dad in his sleep. I don’t know but something psychologically happened as a result but to this day i still feel bad about it and disgusted with my self and have a hard time understanding my own sex drive since i only associate it with bad things. I also don’t want to talk about it with my sister or mom since they are both already traumatized enough I don’t want burden them with another thing. So I don’t know maybe some of you guys could help me process this or give some advice. Thanks\n\nEdit: Thanks guys your comments helped me a bit. I‘m starting therapy in two weeks because I noticed my thoughts became too much to bear for myself. My sister is a bit older than me and around my age she started to attempt and it was up to me to stop her but I don’t want the same for me. But I wasn’t sure I could ever bring this topic up in therapy out of fear of judgement from the therapist since I am so disgusted with myself i only found it logical to expect the same from others.",

    "title": "My (F23) friends think my boyfriend is a predator and want me to break up with him",
    "content": "I (F23) grew up as one of the oldest in my family, so I practically raised my younger siblings. I never really had a childhood I was always the responsible one, making decisions and taking care of everything. I’ve always been independent, maybe even a little on the masculine side. My parents were either working or not really present, so I took on the role of babysitter and homemaker. Between school, work, and looking after my siblings, I never had time to just enjoy life. No boyfriends, no social life just responsibility.\n\nNow that my siblings are older and independent, I finally moved out to focus on myself. That’s when I decided to try Hinge, and I matched with this guy (M32). We hit it off right away and have been dating for almost eight months now. He’s handsome, intelligent, kind, nurturing, and, for the first time in my life, I feel like I have someone I can truly depend on. It’s a feeling I never knew I needed.\n\nBut over the past three months, I’ve noticed some changes. He started calling me his good little girl at first, it caught me off guard. I even cringed a little. But at the same time, I felt this weird, unexpected warmth from it. Like a part of me liked it, even though I didn’t understand why.\n\nHe also started buying me cute, feminine dresses and pretty heels things I would never have picked for myself. I was hesitant at first, but when I tried them on, I actually felt beautiful. Feminine. I was shocked by how much I loved it.\n\nThen there are things like he packs me lunch on his days off and drops it off before I go to work, even though I usually just eat at the cafeteria. No one has ever made me lunch before, and it makes me feel so cared for in a way I didn’t realize I was missing.\n\nHe even brushes my hair. I have really long hair, and he’ll braid it for me sometimes. I thought I would hate it, but now I love it. I crave it. There’s this part of me that never got to experience these kinds of gentle, affectionate moments, and I feel like I’m healing in ways I can’t even explain.\n\nHe pats my head, gives me so much affection, and honestly, I feel like I’m going to explode from happiness.  He’s so patient and gentle with me.\n\nEven our sex life has changed it’s filled with love and praise. I never knew how much I would love being praised. It makes me feel so happy, like I just want to be my best for him.  I do whatever I can to make him happy.\n\nI know this all sounds a little strange. In a way, he feels like a father figure, but obviously not in a weird way. I don’t see him as my dad or anything like that, but I don’t know how else to explain it. I never thought I’d have a daddy (if that makes sense).\n\nI told my two close friends about us and they said how it’s creepy and wrong and I should break up with him before it’s too late, calling him a predator. Also I am too inexperienced to know better.  They said how they don’t know me anymore because I changed a lot.\n\nYes I I have changed, I dress more feminine and I feel pretty.  I’ve always been the yes girl in our friendship but  lately I’ve been creating boundaries and more vocal about what I want sometimes and apparently it’s creating friction in our group. And due to that I’m now self centred they are icing me out unless I listen to them.\n\nThis is the happiest I’ve been in my life and I’m sad they can’t see that. I don’t know what to do.\n\nEdit: I am financially stable with out without him.\n\nTL;DR I’m dating an older guy and my friends think he’s a predator because of our age gap and how he treats me. Now they want me me to break up with him.",

    "title": "I was in an aya cult. I told his wife and she didnt believe me.",
    "content": "After returning home from an ayahuasca ceremony, I got a message from a friend of mine whom I considered a \"spiritual brother\". He wanted to meet up. I was still in that post-ceremony glow—full of energy despite the late hour—and I wanted to socialize.\n\nI live down a long dirt trail, a 15-minute walk from the nearest road. When I got there, he was waiting in his SUV. I was excited to talk with him. Right away, he offered me some hard liquor, saying, “This is what the indigenous people drink here! It’s very good for you.” But I had just returned from drinking ayahuasca, and he knew that. He wasn’t speaking clearly, but he started telling me stories about indigenous cosmology, which fascinated me—until the conversation took a turn.\n\nHe began talking about how husbands take other women and how normal it is. Then he told me he needed someone “spiritually on his level” so they could have a deeper connection than with their actual partners.\n\nI told him flat out I wasn’t interested. But I kept asking questions. Does your wife know about these ‘practices’ you do?\n\n“No, no,” he said, “but it’s better for her. Better for me too. And for our children.”\n\nHe started going on about how we don’t marry the people we are equal to—we marry the ones who are good for having kids. That real spiritual connection is with extramarital lovers. He kept inflating my ego, using spiritual talk to manipulate me. I asked if he had done this before.\n\n“I’ve done it many times,” he admitted. “With many different women.”\n\nThen he put his hand on my leg. I told him I was leaving. But I made the mistake of trying to stay friendly.\n\n“Let me just show you one thing before you go,” he said.\n\nHe stopped me behind the car and hugged me. That’s when I froze. Trauma hit me like a wave. This wasn’t the first time something like this had happened to me, and suddenly, I was simultaneously trapped in his arms and in my past.\n\nHe pulled me tightly against him, ran his hand down my back, onto my hindquarters. At the same time, he started kissing me—lightly, from my ear down to my collarbone. My stomach churned with nausea. I squirmed to get away. He let go. I was in full trauma response, barely able to hold back tears. Then he begged me not to tell his wife. I barely managed a goodbye before I ran back up the hill to my house, praying he wasn’t following me.\n\nA few days later, I saw his wife. Despite my own pain, I felt it was my duty to tell her the truth about her husband. Never mind my trauma—this was her husband. She deserved to know.\n\nAt first, she seemed to believe me. But later that day, I got a message from her. She repeated all his lies. He told her I subconsciously wanted to be with him. That based on our messages, I must have known it was going to be romantic.\n\nBut that couldn’t be further from the truth!!\n\nI was completely blindsided. Now, looking back, I understand things I didn’t back then. At the time, I was in a cult. I believed that everyone in it was a good person, incapable of this kind of thing. If it were me now, I’d know better. I’d understand that if a married man asks a woman to meet him at 2 AM, he’s not looking to talk about life. Full stop.\n\nToday, I saw both of them.\n\nSeeing him again brought everything back- how he lied, how he got away with it, how his wife believed him over me. The anger and pain hit me like a tidal wave. I wanted to punch his stupid mouth, to do something, to make him face the truth of what he did. I even had a thought of role-playing the situation in front of his wife-forcing her to see it so she would understand. But I know deep down, no matter what I do, she probably won't believe me. He has her wrapped in lies. And I'm the one left carrying all of this. I've been crying all day. I feel so much anger, hurt, and grief. I don't know how to process this.",

    "content": "My husband wanted a dog, and I had never had one before. I’ve had plenty of pets in the past: cats, rabbits, and fish, and I loved each one of them deeply. So, we decided to get a dog.\n\nHe did the work of finding the exact dog he wanted, and we drove three hours to adopt her. Even though he took on most of the feeding, exercising, playing, and training, she bonded to me. The bond feels like an obsession. When I’m around, my husband doesn’t exist to her. She never wants to be more than three feet away from me, and often, she’s touching me.\n\nWhen I need a break, I go into the bedroom and shut the door. She just sits outside, waiting. I can put her in the office with my fiancé on the other side of the house, and then go to the bedroom and shut the door. But she waits at the office door, whining and whimpering. My husband tries to interact with her, but she doesn’t care. She just wants me. And I can’t handle this level of attention. You can take her outside, but if she knows I’m inside, she won’t leave the door. If I leave, she panics. A few minutes later, she calms down and does her own thing. She never bothers my husband this much.\n\nI’ve heard mothers talk about feeling “touched out” with toddlers, and that’s exactly how I feel with my dog. The difference is, I don’t think she’ll ever grow past this stage. She’s a dog. We’ve worked with trainers to help her become more independent, but it doesn’t seem to work.\n\nI’m thankful that there’s more nuance in the “adopt, don’t shop” movement. Sometimes, it might actually be better to get a dog from an ethical breeder, as shelter dogs can come with their own set of challenges. My dog has trauma, and that trauma will stay with her for life. It shows up in our relationship, where we’re in a sort of quasi-codependence. It’s frustrating because she’s fine when I’m not around. My husband can take her places, and she’s as happy as can be. If I’m not home, she’s completely relaxed. It’s only when I’m around that she becomes obsessed with me. I don’t get to experience the playful, silly dog everyone else sees because, in my presence, she’s consumed with me.\n\nMy husband takes her to his brother’s farm, and he sends me videos of her. It breaks my heart because I want to see that happy, playful dog too. I want a dog I can sit outside with, playing with toys and rolling in the dirt, without her needing to touch my leg at all times. But I never get that dog. I love her so much, but her constant affection drowns me.\n\nI look forward to when she goes to the farm because I get to be home without her on top of me. I don’t love my job, but I dread going home because, at least at work, I get some alone time.\n\nI love my dog, but I don’t like being around her.",

We share the same room and bed, I felt his hands on me. I don't know why, but I stayed completely still. I could've stopped him, I could've yelled or pushed him away-but my brain just froze. I just lay there and took it.\n\nAfter about 5-10 minutes, I decided to \"fake waking up\" very slowly so he would stop. And he did.\n\nI felt disgusting. I wanted to tell my mom, but he's her favorite, and I was terrified she wouldn't believe me. So, I kept quiet and hoped it would never happen again.\n\ni decided not to and hopped he'd stop.

    "content": "Throwaway account because I don’t want anyone I know to see this. This is something I’ve only ever told one person and I feel deeply uncomfortable to even tell a therapist.\n\nFor context: I have never been a victim of sexual abuse physically, was raised in a super healthy home life, etc. Nothing traumatic has ever happened to me due to another person I personally knew.\n\nWhen I was younger, I purposely would go on a site called KidzChat. I knew that predators would be on that site, and would advertise myself as someone to talk to “F 12”. I was around the ages of 10-14 doing this. Older men would then message me super sexually explicit things. We would sext for a while and eventually trade Skypes to talk or videochat. The biggest instance that I remember was skyping an older man who wanted to show me his jumping jacks. He would jump for a while and then his pants would conveniently fall off.  For some reason that moment is engrained in my mind. I know I’m a victim fully, but I feel weird because I went out looking for it? I guess that’s the cost of unlimited Internet access.\n\nAnother entirely separate thing that bothers me severely, is that one day (aged 11) I had my family dog perform oral on me. The dog didn’t need any coaxing, it liked the smell and went up to it. I remember it feeling awful and I felt so intensely guilty afterward. I never did it again, but I realize that this has deeply affected me as an adult. I absolutely cannot receive oral from a man because it reminds me of what I did with my family dog. This fact genuinely haunts me as I know it was completely wrong and animal.\n\nI don’t even know how to cope with both of these facts as I was a victim and perpetrator. These things still affect me in my sexual life now manifesting as intense fear and guilt to commit certain normal sexual acts with people like being eaten out, sexting my boyfriend, etc. I know I don’t have the guts to tell a therapist either.",

    "content": "I worked for Child Protective Services in a metropolitan area of the US for 12 years. I did both long term case management and later investigations that led to the removals of children. With about a decade of time and reflection, I’ve come to realize the following:\n\nI was a young woman with lots of privilege who did not understand the lives or needs of the people over whose lives I made decisions for.  This now causes me great pain.\n\nTurns out I was dissociating through most of it due to secondary trauma and moral injury. The ability to dissociate (although we just saw it as toughing through back then) was seen as showing that you were a great worker and could “get shit done”.\n\nI wanted to do good in the world and I wanted to help children. And I did. But I also caused harm because I had too many cases, not enough supervision and no real self-awareness.\n\nIt took years of therapy to understand and grieve the harm I had caused and the harm caused to me. I don’t even remember the first few years of my children’s lives because I was so dissociated. I often have to look at a photos to remember events with them.\n\nI still get flashbacks of things I was exposed to and am swapped with pain.\n\nSometimes it all comes back. Just this week, I was contacted by a former colleague and a child who was on my caseload many years ago.\n\nThe colleague reminded me of a child death case we worked on. It was particularly searing because we both had children that were about the same age as the child who died.\n\nShe also reminded me about the death of another colleague (through an aneurism) and the suicide of a couple others. Yes, our work had a death count.\n\nThe girl, now an adult, reached out to me to say she is doing well and to thank me for helping her find an adoptive home.\n\nIt’s a mixed bag. And these memories reinforce in me the idea that nothing in life is guaranteed and I’m just trying to do the best I can each day. I screw up and I repair where I can. I put kindness and compassion into everything I do, but that isn’t always enough.\n\nI don’t really have a purpose for this post. Just wanted to get it off my chest.",

Mexicans, woman, good people. Social Security? Medicaid?\" (I assume he was expressing worry about the continued existence of both programs.)\n\nI just wish I could speak Persian so we could understand each other better.

    "content": "I(F28) and my former friend G( F30) meet during our first term in university, we both came from the same area and went to the same school at one point. We clicked and became really good friends from there. I was an insecure 19 year old at that time and she was outgoing and active in our version of sorority. I was invited to outings that I actually enjoyed and began to build up some confidence. We both had our share of mental problems understood each other, but after taking diffrent courses we stopped meeting as regularly but she always said that I was one of her closest friends.\n\nIn 2020, I became sick. Really heavy burnout, Crohn dieses and bulimia that made me unable to stay in town. I moved back home and slowly began to rebuild my life and health. Now in 2025, I am still sick, but way better and have control of my mental problems. During the last five years I wrote to G every time I went to the university city, asking to meet up and if I could, I set the dates of my travel after her schedule to make sure we could meet(it’s a 5h drive). Every time she said she would love to, and if she was available we booked a date and time. But almost always something happened or she double booked that she remembered 1 day to 1h before. During these five years, we have meet up twice and I have probably asked her around 10 times since I usually go twice a year.  She never wrote to me when she visited her parents or asked me when I was going down next time, which I realise now was a clear sign that I ignored. I once wrote and asked her if she didn’t want to meet up, it was okey and I would understand, time changes people and friendship does not always last. She denied it and said she very much wanted to meet up and I accepted the answer. Telling me how horrible of a friend she is and how sorry she is.\n\nTwo years ago I had a major breakdown when G cancelled on me again. I had been so excited and when she cancelled I was heartbroken. Walking is my coping strategy, especially with heavy emotions, even after 10km I did not stop crying. I was living with another friend  for that weekend and I fully broke down in the end and told her everything. They had never suspected anything cause I always spoke so well off her. She  apparently told my other friends who all are mad on my behalf.\n\nG sent me a snap in May 2024, with the caption ”In exactly one year we are getting married” with a picture on her fiancé. I congratulated her, but I had no idea about their engagement before that. I decided to one last try and asked her of a time during the summer we could meet up, with my vacation weeks in mind. She responded and we decided a week  were she was free, for details to be determined later. As it approached I wrote 1 week before and told her the days, no response. When I finally was at the hotell I wrote again and told her how long I was there and times when I was booked. My friends were a bit angry at me for trying again but I said that this will be the last time.\n\nOne day after I came home from the trip she responded with how sorry she was for not answering. I had enough and told her how I felt through the years, I was nice and civile even said I should have brought it up earlier and not just unload it all now, even asked my friends to read before sending. G answered and told me she understood why I felt like that, I ended it with that if she wanted to meet, she would have to text or call me now, cause I was tired of this being so one sided.\n\nGuess what - not heard from her since. Now I see pictures from the wedding preparations like the baccalaureate and dress fitting and I feel so sad. Probably I had a delusion hope deep inside that I would get an invite and that she would text me. This quenching the last hope of ever being friends again and telling me how little I meant and what friends mattered to her.\n\nMy friends supports my feelings even my boyfriend, but I just feel like I never meant anything. If they are real friends they will make time for you, I know, but in my head I go through all those memories and just wonder if I could have done anything different. Been a better friend, written more, called or if I just was the burden I always was scared of being, also wishing I not been so delusional and naive.\n\nSorry for the long post❤️",

    "content": "Recently my sister got engaged, and she asked me to be a part of her bridal party. Initially I was very excited to have a role in her wedding, kind of still am, but now I'm feeling iffy because she invited our brother, who I don’t have a positive relationship with.\n\nFor context, I’m the youngest out of the three of us and we were raised by a single mother who worked a lot. Because of this, my sister took a lot of responsibility over us when our mother couldn’t. She’s like a second mother to me and my brother even though she shouldn’t have been. My brother, on the other hand, was kind of a weirdo growing up. He dressed alternatively and had “nerdy” interests, something that younger-me at the time thought was really cool, and was all around awkward.\n\nI was maybe 8 and he was 14 when he started getting curious with his body, and that eventually led to him sexually assaulting me. It didn’t happen for long, thank god, but the experience left a disgusting stain on me. Eventually I realized that what had happened to me was wrong, and it wasn't until I was 13 that I finally had the chance and courage to talk to someone.\n\nI was removed from my home and placed in a children’s psych unit, and my case was being handled by a social worker. Of course, they informed my mother, who then told a few others, my sister included. I didn’t know this at the time, but some of the adults around her pressured her into convincing me to recant my statement. So when she visited me, she asked me to do just that. I was obviously so betrayed and angry, she was my role model and the one person I relied on the most at the time. I can’t recall the rest of our conversation, I just remember leaving the visitation area and completely losing it in my room.\n\nBut I was young, impressional, and ruminating a lot at this time, so I did end up recanting my statement. My case worker didn’t agree with my decision but respected it anyway. For the sake of procedure, my case was still investigated, but without the victim’s statement it fell through. It didn’t erase anything that happened to me, but it felt like it did with how everyone else around me went about their lives like nothing happened. It was jarring and fucked with my head, and I slowly started believing that I made the whole thing up for attention. My memory wasn’t the best, and it could’ve just been a messed up dream I had. I started feeling disgusted and I couldn’t trust myself anymore, and I began spiraling.\n\nFastward to when I was 17, I was hospitalized for almost taking my life. For some reason, this was much more serious than before. I was finally put on medication and was put into a program for other at-risk teens. It was through group therapy I started thinking about getting closure for myself, so after a lot of mental and emotional preparation, I confronted my brother. At the last minute I decided to record the conversation without him knowing, and I actually got a confession. I went to my social worker, and after a few days he was removed from the house.\n\nAfter that, I was both relieved and stressed by the events that came next. To be honest I didn’t follow too closely with the court proceedings, I couldn’t bring myself to care what happened to him, all I remember was being interviewed by SVU and getting monthly check ups by social services. But the whole ordeal was mentally and emotionally draining for me and my family. My mom couldn’t believe it at first, and briefly experienced religious psychosis, but no one took it harder than my sister. I guess she felt guilty, because 1) such a serious thing happened between two of her siblings right under her nose, and 2) she didn’t have my back when I first came forward about it. I don’t blame her, or anyone really, for not noticing what was happening. I can’t bring myself to blame anyone, no one wants to believe that someone you love is capable of something as horrible as sexual assault.\n\nA few years have passed since then, and I’ve been working on improving my mental health. My sister was my rock throughout the process, the most understanding of me and my circumstances, and after a while I thought I had made peace with the whole situation, until her wedding. My sister’s decision to invite our brother, after years of no-contact between the two of us, kind of blindsided me. Not because I didn’t expect her to, but because she didn’t tell me. Now here’s the thing, I would never ask my sister to choose between me or our brother. I understand that she loves the both of us despite what had happened, so to ask her to do that wouldn’t be fair. But I would’ve liked a heads-up. I had to ask her myself if he was coming, and I’m glad I did. The thought of walking into the venue and seeing him in the crowd without warning would’ve sent me into a panic.\n\nAnd because of this I started to rethink my relationship with her. She’s done a lot for me, and I’ll go as far as to say that she has a bigger impact on me than our mother does. I want to give her some grace for this, but I still feel so uncomfortable with his presence. He’s also still in good standing with our extended family, who don’t know of the situation, so the possibility of them joking around and having fun with him without knowing what he’s done doesn’t sit right with me.\n\nI most likely won’t do anything regarding my sister’s wedding because I don’t want to ruin her big day, but it’ll probably change the way I see her. Like I said, I won’t ask her to choose between me or him, but that doesn’t mean I can’t. It’s a scary realization that my relationship with my sister can change, I really don’t want it to, but I can’t ignore how she’s willing to look past what our brother has done to me when I haven’t. I want to start by having a proper conversation with her about this first though, after the wedding. I want to fully understand her side of the story and her perspective before making this big decision.\n\nI honestly don’t know what to expect or hope for, but I feel like if I don’t do something then all the improvement I’ve made will come undone and I don’t think I’ll recover this time.",

(bad decision imo, but whatever)\n\nmy dad and mom managed to run a very successful business. like upper class stuff. they got married and had me. (20m). ive always thought that i had a very spoiled life. being able to afford things most people would kill for and even going to an expensive private school.\n\nmy dad did not pay a single penny for child support. it was my MOM who sends his ex wife money. keep in mind, i was kept in the dark about this until my parents eventually divorced when i was 13-14 for reasons i dont feel comfortable explaining. i was eventually told that i have half siblings from my dad's previous marriage. and what's worse is learning that they are financially struggling, all because of my dad abandoning his own family just to have me. and now? he did the same with me. i havent seen my dad in months now and we are living with less money than we had.\n\ni feel guilty. the fact that i was born into a family where i was fed with a silver spoon, while not knowing the financial struggles my half siblings are in. if my dad was not an asshole, i wouldn't've existed by now.\n\nto add salt to the wound. my dad remarried and tried conceiving a baby through IVF. i was so fucking pissed hearing that. he abandoned my 2 older half siblings to have me, and now hes abandoning me for an ivf baby?\n\nmy mom says that despite all of this, i should still love my father as \"hes your father afterall\" but i just cant.  i really... really... cant....",

Lamenting that they wished they had other lives where they could be together essentially. All the while I’m in the same house while these things are going on about each other. He’s adamant it didn’t go any further and he even turned down nudes (I know…very valiant). Obviously I am not really buying that.\n\nI’m just disgusted and this has been the turning stone for me.

I'd like to seek therapy, but it isn't feasible for me at the moment. I think that some amount of it has to do with abandonment issues.

    "content": "My mother (65), who adopted me from Ghana, West Africa, when I was 6 years old, emotionally abused and neglected me throughout my childhood. She's Canadian. Most of my memories are filled with babysitters, while she was living it up, school bullying and therapists, while she refused to believe that any of my problems stemmed from my relationship with her.\n\nUs moving often because of school bullying and money problems also prevented me from creating lasting friendships.\n\nI've been slowly working through my own trauma with a therapist, and now live several hours away from her, and now I work a full time job as a news producer, thanks to one of my amazing former professors.\n\nMy older brother not biological is in his 40s and met my mother when he was in his late 20s. She couldn't legally adopt him but was moved by his story and took him in as a son. He spent some time with us when I was 7 and 8, but ultimately moved to begin his own life. From there, he would be someone I saw in every blue moon. My mother would talk about him a lot, but I never really knew who he was, and still don't.\n\nHe's in his late 40s now and lives in Canada with his family. He absolutely adores my mother and never challenges her on anything despite the way she talks about him and his family to me in private. They talk on a daily basis, and my mother will try to guilt trip me by bragging about how much he loves her and talks to her on a daily basis.\n\nHe use to force himself to connect with other people in my mothers biological family, but stopped when she moved to the U.S., and when my aunt who would often coax him out, passed away from cancer in 2022.\n\nHis relationship with any other family member besides my mother is more out of obligation and love for my mother, and that's how it's been with me for a long time.\n\nHe's basically been a stranger to me my entire life. He never reaches out to me, has never sent me a birthday card, and if he does reach out, it's usually because it has something to do with my mother. My mother excuses and enables his actions by blaming them for his early upbringing.\n\nAll my attempts to build a relationship with him have ended in silence, despite even my mothers own attempts to get us closer. It just won't happen.\n\nHe himself has only seen my mother a couple of times within the last 10-15 years. Whenever something has happened with my mother, medically, I have to be the one constantly giving him updates. My mother says he has money problems, but I find that hard to believe, especially when he's been getting expensive remodeling work done on his house for the last couple of years.\n\nA couple years ago to please my mother, he started doing these weekly Zoom videos with my mother and I, and it's 100% clear it's just a way for him to show my mother that he is making an effort to get closer with me, and even then he's barely engaged. Now it's my mother or I that have to start the video chats.\n\nI'm getting emotionally tired of the charades and have decided to distance myself from him, but I am in the process of not letting my mother guilt trip me when I know I've done nothing wrong.\n\nI started therapy once I found out my birth mother, who would be 47, passed away not too long ago. My biological grandmother is still alive, and I have 4 biological brothers. I hope to reconnect with them someday soon.",

    "content": "I've only told maybe 2 people for my entire life about this, but it's been weighing on me recently. I feel like I need to just shout to the void about it.\n\nI(28M) befriended one of my teachers when I was 14. At the time, he was 35. For more background, I was F at the time (now FtM). He was my middle school teacher and when I switched schools, I added him on Facebook. It wasn't until around my freshman year of high school that we really started to talk.\n\nAt first, I basically harassed him, sending him messages daily, until he started to reply and it became conversational. After about a year, we began messaging each other daily. It was never anything inappropriate; we mainly talked about games, music, art, daily life, etc. (normal friendly type conversation). We never hung out or met up or anything. The only time I saw him after he was my teacher was one time at a school event.\n\nI lived in an abusive home and was a very lonely kid. I always figured he sensed that and that I just needed/wanted someone to talk to who actually cared. He became what I still consider to be my best friend at the time. I eventually started to have feelings for him because of this. I still remember telling him how I felt, and him saying something along the lines of \"I'm very flattered, but that's not appropriate\". The conversation dwindled a bit after that, but some time passed and we picked back up our daily conversations.\n\nOne morning, I woke up to see my father on my computer, snooping through my messages with this former teacher. I freaked out and told him this. We ended up exchanging numbers and started texting because of this.\n\nA while went by (a few months, if I remember right), we continued our friendship and daily conversations. Something happened and my parents took my phone (I can't exactly remember why they took it). I went to lunch with a friend one day, and when I got home, both of my parents were there and I knew something was wrong (they divorced and hated each other). They confronted me about my teacher and I's friendship, saying they \"[knew] everything\". My father had texted him through my phone, telling him to cease contact and threatening to report him to the school board if he ever tried talking to me again. I was heartbroken hearing this and knowing I'd never speak to him again. My parents claim he was \"grooming\" me, but I never felt that way. He felt more like a dad or an uncle, and treated me almost as his kid. Plus, as mentioned before, I basically harassed this man into talking to me. I always got the feeling he just kind of felt bad for me, especially looking back on our conversations and this situation as an adult.\n\nI never spoke with him again after that. It was somewhat of a traumatic experience for me, but only because someone I really cared about just suddenly vanished from my life and I felt as though I had nearly ruined his life because I was a lonely kid. The loss I experienced changed me as a person and the way I view all relationships.\n\nI still think of him often. I want to reach out and ask him how he is, and tell him how sorry I am for putting him in such a bad situation. It's just been so long and I don't want to dredge up the past, especially when I'm sure it was also traumatic for him.\n\nI don't know how to move on when it ended so abruptly and so badly. I have dreams of running into him on the street and getting my opportunity to tell him I'm sorry and hear how he dealt with things afterward.",

    "content": "I really need to take this off my chest because today I f*cked up multiple times and I feel extremely embarrassed.\n\nMaybe I am in my head but I'm definitely somewhere in the wrong.\n\nOk so my day started fine with me taking a ride to the airport. The driver, a super nice guy from Pakistan, shared with me that he is fasting and he will only get to have water or something to eat after 6pm. So what do I do? I get all excited about Pakistani food and ask him to tell me what are his favorite dishes from his hometown. Then I proceed to describe in excruciating detail all my favorite dishes from my country. Recipes, mouthwatering ingredients, the whole thing. By the time I realized that he must be starving (it was 4pm after all), I was already rambling for about an hour already. I apologized immediately and he was super nice about it, but this doesn't make me less of an idiot.\n\nSo after this great success, fast forward to a few hours later - I am on the plane, seated near  the back, squeezed into the middle seat. We are about to depart, the plane is on the move and I realize that my seatbelt gets loose without me lifting the little lever thingy. I ask for assistance and the flight attendant tells me \"Don't worry, the seatbelt will work later\". So I ask him \"How is this possible...?\", thinking that I really don't do well during flights, that I used to get panic attacks, that I managed to control after a lot of therapy and <<OMG I am about to fly and if something happens I will break my neck crashing on the roof of the plane!!!>>.\n\nHe sighs, then tells me he will replace the belt and goes away. Comes back after a minute or so and he says that the plane needs to depart and that there is no time, they will need to move me. There is quickly some commotion, all the flight attendants make some signals to each other and they find me a free row at the front. So I thank them profoundly, I apologize for the last minute chaos that I caused and go to my new princess seat, but the window with extra legroom that I didn't pay for. I sit down, I put the seatbelt on.... and I realize that the new seatbelt ALSO gets loose if I push the metal thing! I test it out a little bit and then it hits me. If I just pull the belt, it stays locked. If I put my finger under the metallic thing and push slightly it gets loose. So that means that I did all this.... for no reason.\n\nI close my eyes and start thinking that it can't be that I'm so inconsiderate today. And how embarrassing. Meanwhile I'm doing my breathing exercises trying to relax. There is turbulence today and my mouth is dry, I can't handle it anymore. I open my eyes and soon as I see the flight attendant handing out chocolates, I ask for some water. She says \"I will check if we still have\", and I'm thinking \"Oh wow, how strange! It can't be that they don't have at least one bottle\". Quickly she comes back, hads me one and finally I drink some water. \"Finally I can try to relax\", I'm thinking. Then I realize must have dropped the chocolate she gave me. I start looking around and then I look to my left and I freeze. On the seat next to me there is yet another water bottle that the flight attendants must have left for me while I was trying to \"breathe iiiiin, hooooold, exhaaale, the plane is safe the plane is safe the plane is safe\".\n\nSo that's it. This is another successful day. I am sitting here patiently, writing this to distract myself and I think I will post as soon as we land.\n\nThank you for listening to my rambling dear reader <3",

    "title": "7-layer carrot cake --- The shame. Not death but pretty similar to a death sentence.",
    "content": "The way \"life\" taught me about sex. Not my mom or dad, or a sex ed teacher. But life.\n\nLet's keep in mind that as humans we have an innate instinct to procreate.\n\nMy dad used to babysit me while my mom would go to work. He would put Asian music videos on in the living room and I would sing and dance to the songs all day long. I was 4. I was a sociable outspoken singing daddy's girl and I loved people because they would dote on me. What I'm really trying to say here is, at 4, I could recognize humans and human beings.\n\nMy dad took me over to his buddy's house. His buddy had two sons. One was about 7 and the other son was about 4 as well. While he and his buddies were hanging out downstairs, the older boy (7) showed me a book his dad had of naked people in all sorts of sexual positions, kind of like a Kama Sutra. He proceeded to usher me into a closet and took off all my clothes. My dad found me naked in the closet and helped me put all my clothes back on and we went home.\n\nAt around 5 years old, I woke up one morning and looked around. My little brother was sleeping in a separate bed in the same room as me. As you know and as I have mentioned above, I loved watching TV because of the music videos, and because of Barney and other things I would watch on TV. So this somber morning, I woke up, walked to my parents room and they were sleeping and I didn't want to wake them up. I walked back to my room where my brother was sleeping. We had a TV in our room and laying around on the floor were a VHS tapes. So I picked one up and popped it in. It was a porn tape. I remembered the naked people from the book that one kid had showed me and this porn tape had the same people. Naked and actively doing things. I somehow knew it was bad. So I turned down the volume, and I watched the whole thing instead of taking out the VHS. Let's just say, curiosity killed the cat and I was the very curious kitten.\n\nThen around the same year, at 5 years old, I was molested by my uncle. He was living in the same house as us in the basement. It happened (to my memory) one time and one time only. I knew what had happened to me the moment it happened. I knew something bad had happened to me, and I knew what sex was but I just didn't know the exact words for what everything was.\n\nThat is my 7-layor carrot cake story. Not exactly 7 layers but it just seems that bad things of a sexual nature kept making its way into my very short life and I came out on the other side too knowing, and too knowledgable way too soon. Every day I wish I had had the chance to be innocent and to be trusting of others and of people. I wish I had the chance to be a happy-go-lucky kid unburdened. But I was denied that. I grew up with no friends at all because of the amount of guilt I felt. The fact I understood sex at such a young age, and being molested, it was like an awkward secret I just kept inside. But secrets weight on you. Even if you don't think they do. It's a physical manifestation and I was not the beautiful child I always wished I was. I was dark, and small, and always was a little heavier than other girls. Because of all those reasons, I still have no friends, I have never made a friend. I still have extremely low self-esteem paired with a high body count.\n\nI'm just not normal. It feels this way at all times. I always stick to myself and I never look anyone in the eye. The shame.\n\nI also want to note, to anybody that was raised around too many males. Just don't. It's not safe for any parent with a small female child to be around that many men/males all at once and even if you \"trust\" them I would say you should always have a considerable amount of doubt and remove your child from danger or harm.",

    "title": "My partner is completely irresponsible with money and I'm considering breaking up",
    "content": "I apologize in advance for any grammar/spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.For context: me (27F) and my bf (25M) have been in a relationship for 5 years and living together in my father's house for 4 (in my country living costs are really high so it's pretty common to still stay with your parents beyond your 20's).At the end of last year my bf decided he needed a new phone for posting content (tiktok and reels) since his current phone's camera wasn't good and his career (gym instructor/ personal trainer) could use a boost from social media. While I agreed that a new phone with a better camera would help and I knew that he had saved some money, I asked him to wait a little longer (1 month or 2) before making any impulsive puchases since I was unemployed at the time and that money could be used for any emergencies.Well, he disregarded everything I said and decided to buy the phone anyway, and to make a long story short, it was a scam in wich he lost almost $800. To say I was disappointed is an understatement because i told him before, that even though the money was his and he could use it any way he wanted, the shop was really suspicious and it was better to buy from an official store if he was going to spend that much in a phone.It was really frustrating but I tried to help him contact his bank to see if there was anything we could do and to my surprise they refund almost half of the money, but my happiness was short lived because the very next day he fell for another scam and lost both the recovered money plus $300 ($250 from his account and $50 from mine). I was livid at this point, the car had broken down (another $600 expense), we had no way to pay our share of the bills plus the repair costs and he had to ask for money from his mother (bless her) to solve everything, but we survived.Well, now I'm employed and things were better until yesterday when he told me he was thinking again about buying the phone, to wich I told him: \"no way, not right now\", since we're not completely stable yet to spend that much money and I thought he would be at least a bit more mindful since we're still paying for his poor decisions from last year and we barely have money for bills, but he didn't want to listen to my reasoning, kept justifying why he needed it and I'm sure he'll buy it even though he knows that if he does that I'll have to cover his share of house expenses and I'm honestly mentally and emotionally exhausted, I feel like he isn't my partner anymore, just an oversized toddler and it's draining me.For additional context: he's been betting his money on soccer games and although he wins most of them, last week he almost lost all of the grocery money :)Our currency is not USD, so those are all approximate values.If you survived my ranting, thank you for reading everything.",

    "content": "When I was a kid, I used to stand and watch the other kids play and I remember the deep longing I had to join in but couldn't because I'm autistic. I went to school and had no idea how to make friends so I just followed people I knew around. Dropped out at 12 and stayed isolated in my empty white bedroom because I felt too undeserving to decorate it. My birthdays have been filled with screaming and crying and shouting at my mom who would insist on forcing me to celebrate and buying a birthday cake I would force myself to eat and then make myself sick afterwards. I see no point in celebrating 21 years of pure suffering every single day. What am I meant to do? Have an awkward gathering with my shitty dysfunctional chaotic family?? There is so much I want to do and so many things I want to see but I can't because I am so lonely. No one understands the agony of waking up alone and going to sleep alone. I wasted 2 years of someone elses life in a weird half abusive relationship because I forced them to date me and promised I'd be a different person when I knew that I couldn't; I just didnt want to go back to being alone again. I made them aggressive and hateful towards me which is no wonder when I behave the way I do.\n\nI mourn the years of my life that I have lot. I feel sick with grief when I see kids playing on their bikes or with their friends or teenagers just existing. I didn't even get to leave my house once. the first time i walked down my road by myself was when i was 19. I'm so pitiful I hate it so much. i am in actual agony i cant take it anymore",

    "title": "I was dumped yesterday but I had been thinking about the breakup for a year, it hurts so much",
    "content": "I (25F) was in a relationship (25M) for almost 2 years. It started off very very well, very dreamy and romantic where I told my friends that I had found the guy I had been looking for all this while etc etc. 2 months after our first date, i lost my job and i realised how emotionally unavailable he was, because all he cared about was his job and his work stress - he didnt know how to empathise with me or support me or help me out (for context the city we live and work in is his hometown) but i thought probably my expectations are a bit much because we are so early in the relationship. But i have known since aug 2023 that this isnt right for me. I am going to bulletise the problems:\n\n• spending time: despite living in the same city, he only saw me once a week, fri-sat, which i initially found weird but adjusted around it. However, because he is an insane workaholic, we didnt do anything special, just stayed in. There were no date nights. When we went out on date nights, i planned all of them, i initiated them, and i convinced him. I wanted to spend more time with him, see him more, but that he told was not possible because it messes with his routines. A lot of his habits and ideas of how we should be were straight up selfish, inconsiderate and disreputable tbh.\n\n• A twisted definition of ambition, different definitions of meaning of life: He has a well paying, reputable, steady job but he wants to start his own thing so that he is doing something “meaningful “ in life. What that means for us is insane working hours, no downtime, no quality time no matter how much i tried to adjust. When breaking up, he said the kind of relationship i want works for people who have job stability and dont want to do much outside of that - and i disagree so much. All i wanted was someone to spend my weekends with, have that quality time. Isnt that the bare minimum? Also, if he cant do this, how will he ever be in a relationship? For me, i am super ambitious and have built a career in a foreign country from the ground up, but for me ambition means being good at job and liking it enough to login every morning to do a good job. Meaning of life doesnt come from the job as i work for the paycheck, but meaning comes from travel, experiences, relationships and friendships.\n\n• His routine: he was obsessed with his routines. Wake up at 6, sleep at 10, gym at 7am, work 8-9 kinda guy. Which is ok, routines are good, but what that meant was he only saw me fridays, and called me daily 9:30-10 (he didnt call me initially at all and we foughjt a lot to get here). Anything outside of that was not possible. This didnt emotionally sit right with me because i couldnt trust, depend, rely on him. In fact, when we were breaking up, he told me he calculated (????) the amount of time he spends with me or talking to me, and thats about 12h/week, which is not possible for him right now. What this translated in my head was, i am not worth the 12h/week\n\n• his spending habits: he lives at home with his parents, earns a LOT more than me, and saves and invests all that he earns to an obsessive degree. He has enough to retire rn, and i respect that. But what that meant for us was, he was extremely stingy and calculative. We split stuff but he just wasnt happy spending - on date nights, dinners, gifts. Heck, he even calculated the transport cost from his home to mine. He even liked to lecture me about how i should spend money, when i already live below my means because i have a loan. He also said that he is saving enough for the both of us, but that never gave me confidence because i saw that as an attack on my independence - i cant live on the money he has earned or saved because it is not mine, he will always reinforce that, and i will have a lesser of a say in how we spend that money. He definitely wanted a prenup if we were to marry which i dont mind, but his general attitude towards money and being too calculative wasnt reassuring\n\nBasically, these were long-standing problems which i identified very early on in the relationship and communicated why i find them problematic. However, after each time i communicated he gave me something new to cling my hope on to, and i hoped things would get better because i genuinely wanted this to work. They never got better, we kept on arguing, until yesterday when he asked the question and i agreed - i felt a bit blindsided tbh because he never told me he is thinking about it too. I guess there are 2 lessons for me:\n\nTo be in a relationship and live in the present and not with the person’s potential and what it could be\n\nTo not be so obsessed with the idea of relationships and building a life and the feeling of home with someone that i keep putting up with shit\n\nHaving said all of this, the feeling of loss is immense and i still miss him and have been bawling my eyes out, when it was me who had been considering breaking up for the past year and i know in my heart he is not the one for me.",

    "content": "Very long and emotional story short (or as short as I can get it):\n\n0-13 - I grew up a daddy's girl. I love my father with my whole heart and cherish his presence. I am inherently anxious and suffer from undiagnosed AUDHD, anxiety disorder and depression, but it doesn't affect me as much because my family is loving and kind.\n\n13 - My mother and I caught my father cheating on her. He told us he stopped and that he was sorry.\n\n13-15 - I didn't talk to my father directly, as I felt betrayed and hurt. This was made worse when my mother kept trying to stand up for him. (I later learnt she was trying to stop the mistress from contacting my father so that she and him could work on their relationship)\n\n14 - My mother is diagnosed with cancer, but they cant tell what kind or how far along it is.  My father grows even more distant from us, and the arguments increase.\n\n15-16 - My mother is hospitalized and my father starts talking to this woman on his phone. I start to feel more anxious. My mother advocates for my father, but it just makes me more mad and hurt. They argue more now, and I find myself becoming emotionally distant from my father.\n\nLate 16 - My mother dies and I shut down, as well as shut myself off from my family, friends and peers. I am angry at my father as he does not seem as affected and was also the cause of my mother's stress before she died. My older brother tries to soothe me and we traumabond. My father tries to relate to me, as his mother died a few months before mine, but he doesn't understand that it isn't the same.\n\nMy father 'dates', moves in and then marries a woman I have never met in less than 8 months. His friends, my trusted adults, all support him, as well as his family and peers. I am hurt, but I pass it off as him just grieving differently. I was sure it was a phase and that they would break up/divorce soon enough. I later find out, its the same woman he cheated on my mother with, lied to us about, and then continued to talk to while my mother was battling cancer. I confront him about this and he says that he thought I knew who she was (despite us never being formally introduced to her. To this day, I know next to nothing about her. Only her first name, where her mother lives, and the name of one of her children.)\n\nFather's wife is emotionally and verbally abusive towards me and my brother, but I, being the younger and more emotional one, take it harder.\n\nShe tells me that I'm killing my father by arguing with him, and that he will end up dead, just like my mother. I yell back at her to defend my father, as I take it very seriously when someone wishes death upon another (even indirectly), but my father takes her side and berates me for defending him.\n\nHe does a myriad of other things; threatening to sell off my cats, locking them outside and causing one to die from the cold as punishment for me not agreeing with him, as well as pretending not to hear when his wife flat out threatens to kill me. He was right next to her when she said it, mind you.\n\nUnder the advice of my older cousin from my moms side, I report the wife to the CPS but he denies hearing her threaten me to the social workers, which makes me look like an emotional teenage girl. We get placed into family therapy, but the therapist is borderline sexist and just wants us to be a family unit, regardless of the woman's blatant disregard for my safety.\n\nI ask my father why he's choosing his wife's needs over the safety of his biological children, whom he claims to adore, and he simply says that \"the Bible says wife before children\". I'd argue that doesn't apply to 'wife that you cheated on your children's mother with and who threatens you children', but okay, dad.\n\nI sleep with a knife under my pillow, just in case she tries to harm me. My anxiety and depression levels are through the roof.\n\n17 - 19 - I cant remember much from these years, but it mostly involves me trying to bond with my father, as he's the last living parent I have. I go through 3 relationships, and have no one to talk to or seek comfort from when it goes downhill. My father thinks we're getting better because of him, and not because of the gigantic effort and emotional stuffing-down I'm doing as even being near his wife makes me anxious to the point of insomnia.As angry as I was before, I still love my father and want him in my life. I tell him that he can pick any other wife, just not her, and I would be genuinely happy with that. He doesn't care, and only treats me well when she's not there (away on vacation or at her mother's house). When she is around, though, he is more distant, and visibly more tense.\n\n20 - My father announced that he wants to split our house physically (half of it is to go to me and my brother, as it was built when my mother was alive and she paid for and designed it). I tell him that I don't want him to do it, as it will just drive us further apart, but his reasoning revolves around his wife and her comfort. My brother and I have long assumed that his wife is just with him to benefit from his money, she doesn't treat him nicely, but he doesn't seem to notice.\n\nI know its childish and naïve, but I didn't want him to distance himself from me, even though he has hurt me so much for so long. I still cry (I've actually just stopped crying as I'm typing this) whenever I think about how far we've already drifted apart.\n\nOur relationship went from one of trust, smiles, secret fast-food lunch breaks and long hugs... to me not even being able to tell him about the girl that broke my heart, and how I would love to have one genuine dad-hug from him so that he can tell me its alright. I would love to have him at my wedding one day, but I don't know if that will ever happen.\n\nI don't want to grow up, not in a world where he dies alone and regretful, but it seems that that's the only way for me to not end up living my entire life clinging to his leg, begging him to look back and maybe love me the way he used to.\n\nSo I'm done. I'm done wanting his love and I'm done waiting on him to realise he was wrong, and that I still needed him.\n\nI'm going to be something, and I'm going to love someone and let them love me in return.\n\nI deserve better.\n\nTLDR: My father has hurt me with his actions and his words for too long. I'm going to learn how to live without him, no matter how much it will hurt to let him go.",

    "content": "So when we were in highschool, my dad made us quit any extracurricular activities to make extra money and help pay bills and save for our college, and just put into saving for us. Thats what he told us. But He would take whatever we made and only give us $20 of spending money every pay period. We gave him thousands that went towards the bills and college funds and even built a house back in our home country for when our parents retire. To add to that, we have gotten many scholarships so the majority of our schools were paid for. My sister in question lost her job and has been having a hard time finding another one. My dad used her funds to pay for the first half of her tuition but refused to pay for the second half. The cost is $4k. He said he has no money but yet he JUST bought a new BMW worth 25 to 30k. Keep in mind, we have 3 EXTRA CARS that need about $500 worth if fixing for him to drive just fine! When my mom was trying to talk to him about helping pay for my sister's college tuition, he told her to ask us (the siblings) to help. Since I have money saved, I was able to help pay for her tuition but before I did, I wanted to confirm with him first that he couldn't pay for it. He said he wouldn't answer that question and brushed me away. When I tried to get more from him, he started yelling at me calling me disrespectful. This is an ongoing thing with him. Whenever we try to talk back, he calls us disrespectful. When he is with his friends, he brags about how smart, educated, and respectful his children are, but then in private, he belittles us, sends money to strangers, and constantly puts others first before his own family. I guess we are all sick of it and I want to write this out because I don't know if somebody can see his side of things and tell me what I am missing here. Yes we can move out but the economy is so bad and he knows that so whenever he gets mad, he tells us that we can just leave, knowing that we can't support ourselves. He gets about $1,500 extra in rent from us every month from 3 of us but not from 2 of us cause my sister lost her job and my other sister just started her college as well (she's 17f). She worked very hard and brought about 60k of yearly tuition down to 7k with scholarships and is staying in the dorms. My dad has now refused to pay that even though my sister has worked throughout highschool to make that money. When we argue about money, he stirs the conversation away from the main point and starts going on longggg rants about this certain bill and that certain bill and whenever we cut him off so he can get to the point, he calls us disrespectful and tells us to get out of his room. We know he purposely does this so he can get out of a conversation. And even when he says he never has the money, he is constantly sending money to random people and we feel like he is flexing it. I remember I had to stay at school while my classmates got to go on a fieldtrip cause he didnt want to oay the $5 fee. And then he bought a $20 hat for a funeral he went ONCE! He likes to be constantly looked at and it's so embarrassing when we have to go out. And my mom is constantly arguing with him on our behalf. It's tiring and I feel for my mom who has to deal with his tantrums most of the time.",

    "content": "Hi... this is my first reddit post and I need to get these feelings  off my chest. I just feel so angry and I hate it.\n\nContext -> So around a year and three ish four months ago, my father had died in hospital. All shocking and scary times for me and my mom. I was 16 at the time. So I was quite affected and so was my mom. We mourned for quite some time after his death. And we went through a rough patch for a few months before we recovered.\n\nSo this is where the story starts, my mother began chatting and dating around. To which I was fine with, as I was happy she wasn't mourning over my dad and was healing.\n\nShe dated a one or two guys before she found this guy Bill (not real name) who works as a driver. They started dating and shit. And I was quite okay with it. Despite for a few times I was annoyed and irritated at him.\n\nFor starters, my mom would never tell me if he  was coming over. And normally when I'd wake up in the morning he'd be in the kitchen with my mom drinking coffee. This kinda annoyed me. I didn't like this stranger enter my house where my father once lived. I hated sharing my private personal space with this stranger. I hated and still hate his presence in my house.\n\nHe is quite annoying as a person, his like a kid. Extremely curious and neat picking. He laughs in a weird manner not a proper laugh. He acts childish at times. He's obsessed with my pet budgie named tim (not real name) but he doesn't know how to hold him properly. He constantly stresses my bird out. Which i hate.\n\nAnyways, I always felt like my mother moved on way to quickly from my father. And I quite hate it. I'm aware it's her life and she can do whatever. And that she's healing.. but it's hurts  seeing her do things she never do with my father. My father wasn't physically the most affectionate as in ways of kissing or holding hands. But he loved me and my mom in his own ways. My mom truly loved my dad.\n\nI don't know how to describe the emotions I'm feeling. It's difficult to explan everything. I just don't like him and I hate his presence in my home. I hate him touching things inside my house. I find him irritating at times and annoying. I feel these angry feelings.\n\nI hate the fact I don't have mother daughter time with my mother. As Bill comes over to sleep over like... 3ish to 4 days a week. Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday. I quite missing going out with my mom on Saturday shopping or in town. But now as bill sleeps over in Saturday he spends his day off, Sundays with us. And I hate that.\n\nEvery time I plan something with my mom on Sunday, he always has to crash our daughter mother time. I hate him kissing my mom. Being all lovely dovey. I'm happy for her healing and being happy with someone.\n\nBut it's not the same as it was.  I miss my dad\n\nEdit - forgot to mention, my mom literally babies him. Every time he comes over, she cooks all the time. She never has a second to herself.",

He said I’m everything he wants in a girl but that he doesn’t want to have a girlfriend. Okay, fair enough.\n\nHowever something that bothers me is that he occasionally comments on my dating future. He’ll say things like “you should get back into hiking so you can meet another guy like me” (it’s how we met), or teaching me things “you can use to impress the next guy”, and then after telling me I deserve someone better than him he tells me that “when you do start seeing someone new, send me his instagram” so he can check it out??\n\nThis really confuses me because he says he does have some feelings towards me, but he’s very firm on not wanting to take things further. On the other hand for me I don’t even want to think about who he dates next- it’ll just make me sad and jealous. Why does he bring stuff like this up so much?",

    "content": "I (27F) have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, and after that all to puzzle pieces fell into place. All the emotions, the feeling of not fitting in anywhere, the emptiness and distortion of my self image.\n\nI have repeatedly done stuff that I knew would ruin my relationships, or sabotaged my self, thinking I could prove I was unlovable or unworthy. Because my logic was if that can’t handle me at my worst, they don’t deserve me at my best. Or that I wasn’t good enough for them and couldn’t understand why they cared about me.\n\nA month before my 15th birthday, I tried to end my life, and my boyfriend at the time had an ex that had ended her life a few years earlier. A week before he had told me he didn’t love me anymore, but wouldn’t break up with me at the time, bc “maybe the feelings will come back”. I knew ending my life would make him come to a decision, but that’s not why I did it. He did not come to visit me at the hospital, but his best friend did. A few days later I kissed a new guy and a week after that I started dating that guy. And so on and so forth. I often ended it with one guy, and started dating a new one a week or two after. This pattern lasted from 13 years old to 17 years old, when I got into a relationship with a guy who was 5 years older than me. In my country you’re legal at the age of 16.\n\nOn my 18th birthday I moved in with him, and within 2 months I was pregnant with my son. We can call this guy Aaron. Arron was a drug addicted, alcoholic and violent POS. He severely beat me, raped me and cut me off from my friends and family. I was a terrified pregnant 18 year old with no one to turn to. I left him almost two years after we moved in together. I called my mom after not talking to her or my dad for almost a year. And I asked if I could come visit. I moved back to their house a week after.\n\nAt the beginning of 2018 I moved from my hometown to a little island where I met my now husband (37M) and father to my two younger sons. I admit I tried repeatedly destroying this relationship, he never gave up, just kept on loving me through all of it. Christmas 2023 I had a mental breakdown, planning how to kill myself and writing letters to my family. But making my child cry while he was playing with his new toys, made me get some help. I was in the psych ward for 8 days, didn’t get to see my children other than FaceTime, and I celebrated new years alone. I was diagnosed with CPTSD, depression, anxiety and borderline personality disorder. I had a ADHD diagnosis from the age of 15.\n\nI started therapy February 2024, and DBT group September 2024. And I have finally started getting back to my feet, learning how to feel emotions again, and not look at myself with resentment and disgust. I have not had a big emotional breakdown or reaction since October 2024, and I am so proud of myself. I started ADHD medication for the first time in 13 years, and it has helped me keep up everything in the house, and following my kids closer. I’m so grateful that I didn’t go through with my plan, and I thank my children and husband every day for being “mine” and that I love them more than anything.",

    "title": "I feel left out by my girlfriend",
    "content": "Hello guys. I really have to get this off my shoulders so i decided to make this post on here. already appreciate you guys for reading it.\n\nSo, i am M/22 and my gf is the same age, we are together since three years now and everything did go well for the most part. The thing is, i am an absolute introvert and probably suffer from social anxiety. I hate to go to places where a lot of people are, i cannot eat when a lot of people are around me and i just get exhausted and overwhelmed so fast. this makes my life really hard tbh, and its even harder because i cant understand why i feel that way. like i was grown up in a great, lovingly household, have a good job, and i am basically just a normal guy, who should not complain about his life. However my gf knows all those things and we talk about it and all, she also tells me shes there for me and just tries to help me out as much as she can.\n\nAnd then there was this situation yesterday, it was the 20th birthday of her brother (who is also a really close friend of mine) and he was throwing a party with approximately 40 people. and what can i say, i felt like absolute shit the whole week, my anxiety hit rock bottom and i felt like i couldnt handle it. the night before the party i had a fucking panic attack while falling asleep. So i was talking to my gf, talking about how i feel and how i am getting the worst anxiety ever and so on.. she then tried to make me feel less anxious, she told me she is there for me the whole evening, she wont let me be alone and stuff and idk just trying to pick me up. (thats also one thing, like i feel giga weak in those situations, why cant i handle such things, shouldnt i be the one protecting her? however i am also really insecure about myself).\n\nThe party was on saturday 19;00, in a bar. my heart was racing all day. i tried to calm myself down with playing some video games, some csgo and some league, but nothing really helped. So at around 18:30 i left home and was driving to the party. you can imagine how i felt. when i arrived, we were in a group of maybe 5 people (i really didnt know many people there, maybe like 3 or 4). then i went to the wc, to calm down a bit and when i cam back my gf was grouping with her friend, the other people i knew where also with their other friends, and suddenly i find myself standing in this bar, alone, trying to talk to some people i didnt even know, just to make it less akward. it was my personal hell. However, i couldnt just go to my gf and her friends, because i would have felt ultra weird, when being the only guy there coming out of nowhere. i would have appreciated it so much, if she would have came up the me and just would be on my site. but she didnt. she didnt the whole evening. like in 8 hours, she wasnt coming up to me once. one time she was looking at me, she wanted to ask me if everything was okay by signaling it, i was shaking my head and telling her no nothing is ok, and then she turned around and did go somewhere else. like why? i dont understand that. i feel like the biggest loser on this earth, my feelings are ultra hurt and i cant stop thinking about it. i could have never done it like this if roles were switched. maybe i am overreacting, but honestly i dont think so. like why do i even tell her how i felt like shit because of this party. should i have just came up to her and her friends? idk. i still think it would have been easier for her to come pick me up, then for me to go to them. especially when she knows how i felt.\n\nidk, this evening made me just feel like absolute shit, i feel hurt as hell, i could literally start to cry right now. Why do i have to be such an insecure and anti social person, i just dont get it. however, now i am here, sitting at my pc, listening to music and writing this down. idk if anybody will even read this, but if so, sorry if my english is not the yellow from the egg, but i tried my best.\n\nhave a nice sunday evening",

    "content": "Okay so this might come across as a little sad and bleak, and I doubt that I will get any gentle responses... Might as well be ranting because I have found a haven in Reddit lately.\n\nI often wonder why anyone would like to be friends with me. I struggle a lot with anxiety and maintaining attention, and usually when I offer advice it is not that helpful (usually overly philosophical and impractical). Some people may like to engage in that kind of discussion I guess… I don’t have any interesting hobbies besides going to a cafe by myself and having a cigarette, browsing and looking for jobs to advance my career. I have a very niche sense of humour that can be overly sarcastic and easily offend. I try to pick up hobbies, but I end up wanting to escape my reality via watching too much TV, cleaning/decluttering and spending time with my partner, which I also don’t see why he would stay with me after the initial attraction wears off. I am probably extremely depressed as I grew up with a childhood trauma that I tried to address via therapy but it felt like the benefit wasn’t outweighing the expense and somehow it felt even more depressing as “my only only hope for getting better didn’t look that hopeful”. A few therapists seemed to make me feel like my system was in a kind of a deadlock. I find myself lately thinking often about why anyone would like to be friends with me, even though I don’t think less of myself - I am young (32F), attractive, fit and financially independent. I am well-educated and have a decent-paying job. I rarely lie, gossip and I like to support people by understanding their goals. I like to treat my friends every now and again, but I don’t like transactional relationships. I used to have creative ambitions but quit them and settled into a boring life when I saw nothing was really materializing. How can I improve this sense of isolation helplessness, with years of therapy as a last resort?",

I feel like a total loser. No physical attributes, no social skills, no confidence. Deep down, I blame my mother for it.

    "content": "My (m24) now ex(f26) girlfriend started dating in March last year. I had just come out of a toxic situationship where I take part blame. I was a bad communicator, I’m sure I still am but I gained some communication skills. I really liked her, found my now ex, 3 weeks later. I knew it would be a rebound but it helped so much. Especially considering this girl had been my crush since 8 years ago when I had first started working with her. We had so much fun early on, trips, going out, eating out. It started to feel less like a rebound and something of a real relationship. Unfortunately, it came to her moving out of her mom’s house. She needed a place to go, and me with my somewhat trust issues, was scared to let her move in with her friends which were one girl and two guys. She had been known to “get around” but I trusted her more than most people did and had hope. She was very kind, had many mental issues, but nothing I couldn’t stand, I had grown up with childhood trauma and this seemed like nothing. So me with my trust issues, and wanting to move out of my mom’s house as well, took her offer of renting a place together. It seemed fun and I had just started a career job, so it seemed like a good time. Found out very quickly, it would not be. See my ex, we’ll call Fiona, had severe insecurities and drinking issues, not to mention drug addiction. I had known to some extent, but not to this severity. The first week we moved in, I wanted to have a get together party for our first place together. Turns out, Fiona hates having people in her space. She was very quiet the whole night, and near the end, she stormed off to the room, where I’d get yelled at when I head to bed. She scream at me in bed, as I had work the next morning I told her sorry and we’d talk about it tomorrow. She got up and stormed out the room. I was just happy for the quiet, until I hear her screaming my name and yelling help! Help! I storm out, seeing her wrist covered in blood, with it spilling all over the floors. I help her best I can, she didn’t hit an artery so it soon stopped, but left a nasty scar. After this night, most nights, especially when we went out, I would get no rest, being accused of cheating, or just not giving her enough love. Over the next few months, one of our mutual friends decided a surprise birthday party for her. I honestly wasn’t thinking to hard about it, I just thought maybe it’d make her happy, forgetting she didn’t like people in her space. Same thing happened. She was upset the whole night, stayed in the bedrooms and never came out. Through out the night you could hear her screams saying “get out of my house!” In the most embarrassing way possible. Her sister was there, and tried to calm her down the whole night, which did not work. I eventually got everyone out, because the music was barely covering it up. I went to bed again. Same thing, yelling at me. She got up, stormed out. I was worried but thought that it was a one time thing. Nope, I instantly hear my name being screamed. This time, much worse. I come out to see the cut is even deeper, attempt to stop the bleeding but it just won’t. I call 911 while making a makeshift tourniquet to try and stop it. The paramedics get her after the police, which was someone I knew. I told them about how she was saying before that she wanted to die. I didn’t think this was an attempt, but a callout. I took her to the hospital after the medics said she didn’t need the ambulance after patching her up. Stayed up all night at the hospital, dropped her off at home, then went to work. I was miserable. I couldn’t stand this anymore. I didn’t want to break the lease, but at the same time I also still cared for this girl. I felt bad. I needed a way out, that night was my chance, but you just couldn’t leave her alone, she cried and begged me. So we continued our relationship. A few months later, same thing, yelling at me and saying I don’t give her enough affirmations and accusing me of deleting snapchats and sneaking people in when she’s off at work. Which led to a night that she destroyed my tv in the living room, put holes in the walls, and screamed at me in my face. I was done, I left to stay at my friends house. Told her to leave, we’d figure out the situation after. The day after, she said she needed time to move, and wanted to talk. I went over, and we talked the whole night. She promised she’d get therapy, and help. And I felt so terrible, I truly loved this girl, but it was such a toxic relationship. I gave her one last chance. We decided to stick together, agreeing to talk things out more. See, I still have my trust issues, and being accused of things makes me curious why it’s that in particular. I memorized her password months ago, but never really felt the need to look through her phone. I had it just in case. But I was working one night, straight shift. She went out with her friends. Acted very strange to me, and I just felt something was off. I come home at 7am, find her dead asleep. Couldn’t even wake her up to give her a kiss. She had left her phone on my side of the bed. I felt the urge to look through it. Went through it for hours. Finding hidden messages in messenger of her taking to her ex saying how she thinks about him everyday, and that she needs him. Other messages to her OTHER ex on Snapchat, came across it by chance because it had been cleared and muted. It was of last night being very flirty and him leaving hearts and her pictures with her hearting back. Her saying I miss you, and then a phone call about 6 minutes lasting. I called this number, I asked him to be straight up if she’s cheating. He sounded dumbfounded but said she wasn’t and that they were just friends that use to date. But I found pictures dating only right before we started dating that they were kissing and all over eachother. I woke her up, absolutely heated. Ngl this was probably the angriest I’ve ever been. I told her what I had seen. She of course denied it. Eventually admitting that it was cheating but they never had sex. Which I absolutely think is a lie. But I said it was over, and she took it so easily. She nodded and called her mom, got her stuff in the car, then laughing about a joke she made saying she’s tired of constantly moving. All while I sit and wait for her to leave. Also if I didn’t mention, this happened ALL ON MY BIRTHDAY. She leaves not answering any of my questions like why? how could you do this? Since then, I’ve been sitting here, she still left a few things and needs a truck to come pick them up. She just texted me that she’s coming today to pick them up. I still feel like shit, but can hold my emotions together.",

I understood that it was not the ideal decision and a lot of people would have opinions on it, but it was the only right decision for me at that time. Now it has been some years since this has happened and I’m very happy with my partner today, but there are days when this sadness comes back about those three incidents . This sadness gets triggered by anything randomly. For instance, a friend decides to use birth protection, and I don’t know why I wake up thinking about that time when I had to do what I did. Another time, I could not go through the series, which was depicting in some detail about a couple dealing with the abortion and the decision making around it . While the abortion itself is a horrible experience to go through, the last one that I had was extremely painful and terrible due to some situations . My partner has been extremely supportive about this throughout the years, but I find it difficult to not feel like a burden when all of a sudden one morning, I am in a bad mood and they don’t understand exactly how and why I am feeling like that. So I guess I’m just dumping my feelings here because I’m not really sure what to do with them. I don’t want to burden my partner who already has a lot of pressure from work in everywhere else, and I can’t seem to make this sadness go away.",

I don’t know if I want to try and talk to her again because I don’t want to be at the brunt of another one of her episodes or if I should just cut my losses and just finding a way to move out. If there’s actually something up with her or me that I’m not seeing then please tell me so. Also I should have prefaced that a lot of our “conversations” end up with her yelling at me and making me apologize when she could just leave me alone.",

I'd never be disrespectful like that, but i just wanted to get it off my chest.",

    "content": "Sorry for the long ass post. I would have made it longer but wanted to spare you the novel.\n\nI’m honestly just really lost and struggling so much right now. I’m 25, and suffer from a long list of mental and physical disabilities. I’m not really able to work right now due to my disabilities but am in the middle of a long process of trying to get on disability payments. I still live at home with my mum and brother (dad is deceased), and I just found out last week my mum has stage 4 bone cancer. My partner of 3 years doesn’t live with me but is soon having to move out of his family home so has been putting pressure on me to move out with him as we’ve been together for a significant amount of time and we should be moving onto the next stage of our relationship. I’ve tried to explain that it’s difficult for me to move out as I don’t have a job and the income I do get from the government isn’t going to be enough to pay for rent let alone my food, medications, my dog’s food and be expected to save for my doctor and specialist appointments but also to save to eventually buy a house like how he wants us to be able to do before turning 30. He just keeps telling me to apply for work and I only have experience in retail but due to one of my medical conditions I can’t even stand for more than 5 hours on a good day without being in debilitating pain where I literally struggle to walk. I have no experience in being a receptionist and no matter how many jobs I apply for no luck. He wants me to move out as well as I’m being treated as a stay at home mother looking after my mum and brother (this is well before the cancer diagnosis). I don’t think as well that it’s sitting in for him that I very badly need and rely on being on my mum’s health insurance considering I’m chronically ill and it can turn at anytime for me and sadly I’m having a different surgery at least once a year, sometimes twice a year so idk how I’d be expected to afford that if I wasn’t living at home, with no job. He refuses to live with my family until we can save enough to buy a house because he hates my family and well understandably is struggling to even see a future with me like this but I feel like he’s in between a rock and a hard place with the fact that he does love me and how he doesn’t want to leave me cause I’m sick cause it’d be like leaving someone who’s got cancer which is an asshole thing to do. And it doesn’t help that I’m struggling with my mum’s new diagnosis. On top of everything else I personally am just really struggling with how beyond god damn emotional I am. Late last year I fell down some stairs causing me to be bed ridden for 2 and a half weeks and in turn has caused me to develop or severely worsen potential already undiagnosed OCD. I’ve never been diagnosed before with OCD because truly I don’t say out loud my thoughts and whatever I have disclosed or displayed gets pinned to my autism but since the fall I’ve been consumed with anxiety, depression, anger, guilt, agitation and panic with mess, things not being in a particular order (mainly MY way of order). I feel like a shell of who I once was I struggle to hide anything well, I cry almost daily and have just started to learn either cry to myself when no one is around or wait for my therapist. I don’t ever want to leave my house cause if I stay at my partner’s house, guarantee I’ll be a sobbing mess when I get back cause my mum and brother always make a mess and they never clean up after themselves which in turn triggers me more. I already am a pretty reserved person when it comes to my feelings cause I think it’ll come off over dramatic to others even though I know they’re valid but today I got proven why I think that because my partner asked me what was wrong when I got home and I spilt 1/4 of my thoughts and feelings and I got stopped with being told that “maybe you just like to make things more difficult for yourself than it has to be”. Potentially that’s true but also I don’t mean to, my brain just never shuts up which I’m realising with typing this that yes it most definitely doesn’t shut up. The sadder thing is there’s a lot more to my anxieties and why I can’t take it anymore and maybe I’ll just get a diary and deep clean till I can’t walk. I just want to be alone and lowkey sedated but I got an appointment in a couple days on an update to some scans and if I’ll need surgery or not which is obviously another anxiety. I frankly just feel a lot of pressure from my boyfriend and I feel pressure to look after and help my mum and if I don’t well no one will cause my brother and her partner are useless. I feel pressure on myself with my own mental and physical health, getting a job and what kind of job realistically would even be good for me, I feel temptation to go back into eating disorder tendencies or back into my addiction to smoking weed. I feel beyond insecure about my appearance which I know is a vanity and self esteem issues. I truly don’t know what to do because try and take it day by day but I clearly have some control issues. I’m frustrated cause I don’t want to die, but I also don’t want to be alive or at least conscious.",

I had a thick canvas work jacket on so the teeth barely broke the skin. I carry a folding knife as a habit since I was a kid in boyscouts. I stabbed the dog with my free hand after trying to punch the dog and it ran off back around the corner of the house. A woman and her teenage daughter came around the corner screaming at me and I told them what happened. Apparently they were neighbors there to take care of the dogs. It all happened on the front porch in front of a ring camera. I then left, called my boss and the cops but decided not to take legal action. I guess I felt bad for doing that to the dog. I don’t know what else to say it’s been a few months. I’m pretty sure the dog died and it probably would’ve been put down anyway.",

My brother was 3 when we got him and always treated him as sibling. They were never referred to as adopted growing up. Flash forward I’m 19 he’s 13. He becomes obsessed with me completely out of no where. Starts with cutting the back out of several pairs of jeans attempting to see me exposed. Then one day I noticed while using the restroom there’s small holes chiseled into the wall. Yep peep holes. Parents patch them. He creates more. Mind you he’s in extensive therapy they’re basically begging for help as to why he’s doing this. (Of course the state wants you to adopt and then ditches you when there’s a problem.) He then started exposing himself in weird places in the house so I would walk in on him. Then I worked all night was tired accidentally dozed off on the couch (still am pissed I fell asleep because maybe this part could have been avoided) and he touched me from my butt to my vagina in one quick movement. I wasn’t hardly asleep so I instantly woke up saw him walking away and he admitted to my parents that he did it. (I moved out 2 weeks later) Now flash forward again I’m 25 he’s 17. My parents obviously continue to raise him. there was no punishment because he was a minor (he was sent off for a year if you want to call that something) my parents have a relationship with him and I have a relationship with my parents. He talks about me to mom still which I find very odd. I have not said a single word to him since the incident. Being around him even this many years later physically makes me ill. I hate his guts and quite frankly wish terrible things upon him. I’m no where close to being healed from this and don’t know if I ever will be. He has a girlfriend that he’s been with for awhile she has no idea what he did and it just makes me sick because if that were me I’d want to know and I feel wrong by not telling her but I do not know her and the fight within my family it would cause ugh. I witnessed him today with the gf and he’s constantly in her face demanding affection and overly touchy. Just makes me sick for the girl and any future potential victim. sorry for the long post.

    "content": "I don’t know if anyone remembers me but a while ago my girlfriend and I had a home invasion incident that culminated in her beating the shit out of the intruder. I’m tired of saying my gf so I’m going to call her Diana.\n\nTurns out the guy was a drug addict from the next town over. He was in his 60s and he had an extensive history in jail and mental hospitals. Unfortunately about two months after my post, he passed away. We didn’t know anything about why until we got a chance to talk to his sister, who insisted she didn’t blame Diana and that the doctors even said that he probably didn’t have much longer anyway. (Diana was visibly distressed during this conversation so I’m not sure whether or not the sister just said that to comfort her)\n\nAfter that Diana went on a trip to a national park during a week she knew I couldn’t take off and forgot her meds. She has seizures that look like mild psychosis/magical thinking and ended up refusing to come home at the end of the trip. She kept saying that she felt like she couldn’t leave the woods because she was certain there was something she needed to learn there that she hadn’t yet, and when I asked her how long that might take, she said “some people take a lifetime.” I asked if she was breaking up with me, and she said something about feeling like she was “too attached” to me, her house, her pets, etc and that she needed to meditate on that for a while.\n\nI ended up going to her temple to see if anyone was willing to give me some perspective on the situation since she was seeing things through a Buddhist lens. It was the right choice. A monk actually drove the six hours out to her with me to talk to her in person since she wasn’t picking up calls. I am so, so unbelievably grateful for that monk because Diana started taking her meds again and came home soon after. I’ve never been religious but I started to read the Pali canon afterwards and that shit slaps. Diana was already volunteering her time at the temple so now we both go together when we can.\n\nAll things considered, since then, things are back to normal and going well. We’re both children of divorce so even before all this we were doing prophylactic couples counseling every few months, and for a while after we were going once a week. Diana has started seeing a therapist on her own as well which I am so proud of her for since she’s always hated the idea of individual therapy.\n\nWe also stepped up our home security game. Diana already had plenty of cameras, but now we have door/window alarms and motion sensors. I also convinced Diana to get another dog, so now we have a 75lb puppy…\n\nI know a lot of people were rooting for us to get married, but that’s not going to happen. Legal marriage isn’t something that interests us and it never has. But we did buy each other rings, and it’s been a great comfort to have something physical to remind me of her on my person all the time. We’re also considering having a small commitment ceremony next fall <3\n\nThanks again for all the feedback on my previous post. I got a lot of great advice, and some good criticism. I showed it to Diana and she got a kick out of the comments, and we had a little mutual cry over how kind a lot of you guys were. I asked her if she was okay with me posting this update, and she clucked at me and told me to do whatever I want online as long as I’m being nice (and anonymous lol). So… hope this qualifies!",

    "content": "I’m so lost. I know relationships are never easy, but I’m just starting to think that maybe we didn’t meet at the right time in each other’s lives. I have so many insecurities in regards to being included in outings. Her communication is really lacking and forgoes telling me how she feels about things.\n\nOur most recent disagreement has been in regards to travel - we can’t come to a compromise and find a balance between her travelling with her (and also my) friends with time for us to spend together. We promised we’d travel with each other after this year fell through for similar reasons. Instead, I had to leave it at she will go with her friends instead of me. I’m hurt because it feels like she doesn’t want to go away with me, but she’s hurt because I think that.\n\nShe’s promised to do better and apologised so many times for not communicating. I feel like our bad times are more frequent than the good. I want to push through because she is so loving, caring and sweet but I’ve got a massive piece missing rn and if I explain this to her, she breaks down and stops talking entirely. I’m stuck. I know I am so far from a bastion of perfection in this relationship, but I just can’t help but be frustrated and saddened by this.\n\nToday, I was sick and quite feverish, so I spent a while thinking back to a past relationship. While I’m absolutely over that girl, I just couldn’t help but reminisce about how that short relationship three years ago made me feel. I do hold it in very high regard because I was in the wilderness prior to it - alone and totally confused about my place in the world before she showed me, so I’m now quite nostalgic about what she was for me, especially now my needs just aren’t being met. That girl and I met in the wrong time and the wrong circumstances to last, but we ended very amicably. I know it’s horrible and so unfair for my gf as well as the previous girl to keep thinking like this.\n\nI love spontaneity and random, intimate things (and I have told her this) but never does she ask me to come over for a karaoke drive at midnight with the windows down. Never does she say she wants to spend the night with me somewhere random. I sometimes ask but it’s usually a no. I feel like I’m right back to where I was pre-previous relationship and I’m lost and so sad.\n\nI want to make things better, and I know constantly comparing my last relationship to my current is really poor. I know I’m focusing on the negative things she does. I know I could be better but I’m so fucking demotivated bc she just doesn’t talk and we just don’t go out to do things. Then a rift forms and I have to be the one to try and pull it back, and then she’s extremely upset and scared that I might leave her, or she thinks she’s a bad person. I can’t say how I really feel because of that. It takes days for our usual fun side to return and then there’s a couple weeks of good. Rinse and repeat.\n\nLong-term relationships are loads of battles to stay in love. Some are so much harder, but I do love her. Though, is it worth losing parts of who you are when I’m this age? I’m emotionally exhausted by the constant confusion and stress of slow and lacking communication as well as my physical needs just not being met. I’m 23, so I’m not looking to waste her or my time any longer if this just won’t work. I like solving things but this feels like it’s becoming bigger than me.",

    "content": "It was just my almost 2 year old son and me in the house. Dogs were outside and I was at the kitchen table doing my makeup getting ready for work as I was supposed to leave in 2hrs. The doorbell rang and I ignored it for a couple minutes. It's not uncommon for solicitors to try and sell shit. I slowly walked up to my front door peephole and looked out. There was a man standing with his back to the door blocking most of my view and then a second man was out at my curb back also facing my door kinda looking around. I started to get nervous and slowly turned the lock on the front doorknob so he wouldn't hear I was on the other side.\n\nImportant to note: my mom's transmission went out last week so she's borrowing my car. No cars in the driveway or in front on the street. But the TV was on playing a kid show for my toddler so he wouldn't miss my presence as much while getting ready.\n\nI watched him for a bit and decided he'd probably leave soon and started walking away. That's when I heard my glass door open. I thought I'd hear him knock next but instead I got to watch as my front door knob started jiggling like someone was trying to get in. And then I froze. Instead of getting my husband's gun to protect myself and my child I did nothing. I just froze. He fiddled with the door knob for a bit and then eventually walked away. I peeped out the kitchen window and watched as this dude met up with his buddy and then they started walking away.\n\nI texted my husband instead of calling the police. He's the one that did. He told me to call them because they wanted to ask me questions, and so I did. Then when I tried to call my phone said I had to connect to a wifi or network to make a call. My bill is paid every month on the 2nd and I was connected to wifi. Just another thing that was going wrong. The police had to call me back and ask if I was ok to even talk to them. When the police did show up they said the guys were solicitors and it's illegal in the city to do that. We even have 2 no soliciting signs taped to the glass door. She said her partner found them up the street and was kicking them out of the neighborhood. Since there was no proof they tried to enter the house nothing could be done. The only thing they could do was drive up to the company and tell them that if they walk onto our property again they will have trespassing charges filed and the company will receive a citation.\n\nAt the end of it all I'm extremely shaken. I didn't do anything right except lock the door. I didn't tell them to go away. I didn't call 911. I didn't get a weapon. I just locked the door and then watched as they tried to get in, texted my husband, and then did what I was told. I cried for a long time after. I'm still not doing great. If I hadn't locked that door I really don't know what could've happened. If you've read this far thank you, I just really needed to get this off my chest and out.",

I don't even ask her anymore, cause at that point it feels like I'm forcing her or making it out to be a major fault. I can't even tell what's wrong. What's changed. Every time I ask her it's a different thing. She's not feeling it, she's lost her sex drive (but then a month later, she said that wasn't the issue), there's shit going on in her family.\n\nAnd it's fucking killing me inside. I've started to cook up an actual fantasy in my head. Fantasies of being intimate with her someday have turned into a fantasy of a girl in the future who actually physically expresses love for me. I have shit in my life too, and a kiss from her makes all that go away.\n\nI just feel broken at this point. For 3 years almost, I've worked with this girl, and I genuinely love every inch of her, but somehow this issue itches at the inside of my head and makes me miserable. And I've tried talking to her, but it makes no difference. We reach an agreement and she changed things for a day and then she just reverts to the way things used to be.",

    "content": "My cat loves Christmas trees specifically the fake ones. It doesn’t matter if it’s small or big he will go and try to chew on it any chance he gets, same with my other cat.  Last night I started hearing one of my cats whose name is ace struggle a little bit.  I instantly woke up and turned on my light and it looked like there was something stuck in his mouth. Immediately I put him in my arms and wrapped my blanket around him so he won’t squirm too much and looked in his mouth. At first I didn’t see it then I realized a piece was stuck in his front teeth. It took me a few minutes bc he didn’t like me messing around in his mouth but i eventually got it out and he was fine. We ended up cuddling the rest of the night and I kept a close eye on him.\n\nWhy do cats do this? What is the lore for them to want to do that. I tried getting him a catnip plant but he wasn’t interested at all.\n\n(Also yes I know it’s March and my Christmas tree should already be taken down😭 I want a family picture of my son who I’m currently pregnant with and my family by the tree so that’s why it’s still up he’s due in less then 3 weeks)",

    "content": "For the past 2 years I’ve been smoking weed, almost daily. I recently went through a lot of changes, and in that I quit smoking and started taking supervised urine tests. (Among other things) I knew that taking these tests meant I couldn’t take my drivers license for at least a few months, and that was okay with me. What I didn’t know is that it meant I couldn’t drive at all, until these tests were finished - which is 6 months - even tho I am clean.\n\nMy doctor failed to tell me (or I failed to remember) that I can’t use the license for my motorcycle that i already have.\n\nI recently met a guy who made my passion for driving motorcycles light up again. I was so ready to get back on the bike, bring it out of the garage, change out the oil and have it in pristine condition. I was so excited to spent a summer on two wheels while getting my life back on track - and this time with someone to share the joy with. In some ways it was part of my motivation for staying clean, and having it ripped away in the span of a few google searches made it that much harder.\n\nI feel so angry, and stupid. I feel like I should have known, and I feel like it was obvious. Yet I thought in some magical way that I could keep my excisting licence, just not take another drivers test. I was so ready for the freedom of driving to work, and going on road trips. Or just driving to the store without relying on commute or friends, or having to walk for 15 minutes.\n\nI know it really isn’t the end of the world, but the next 5 months is gonna be that much more challenging knowing I could have been on a bike if I hadn’t admitted to my doctor that I smoked weed. Im gonna call the doctors office tomorrow to see if I’m correct in thinking I can’t drive my motorcycle, but I’m scared of getting my hopes up. I’d rather sit with knowing I’ll get told I can’t drive than be let down again tomorrow.\n\nBut on the other side of things, I probably wouldn’t have quit if it wasn’t for having to do this at some point either way.\n\nIt just sucks that I’ll be done with these tests in September, at the very end of the season.",

Our relationship is going strong, but that’s not the point.\n\nFor some context, I’ve been very sheltered throughout my life, which has made me extremely introverted and anxious. I just started college, and I have no friends from school because, about two years ago, my mother decided I should be homeschooled and demanded that I cut off contact with my friends.\n\nWhen I got into college, I ended up in a group of friends who were super shallow. Being around them gave me terrible face dysmorphia and a spending habit from mirroring them. From the outside, it looked like they had loads of fun together, but I was with them for four months, and it was terrible.\n\nI had a friend in class, but we drifted apart because she became best friends with this one girl who was no better than Regina George. We still talk amicably, but not often.\n\nI’m friendly with my roommates, but there’s a language barrier since they share a common mother tongue, so there’s not much connection there.\n\nI was best friends with one girl, but she would get mad at every little thing. On top of that, she would spread other people’s secrets to unrelated parties, which was a huge turnoff. We had a final confrontation, and that friendship burned out.\n\nI’m friends with two other girls, and as nice as they are, they’re closer to each other. Honestly, they’re a lot like me, but I’m so self-conscious around them that I don’t feel like myself. They’re super open, and the hesitant vibe I bring to the table just doesn’t fit well with them.\n\nThe only real support I have is my boyfriend. I have online friends and people I talk to occasionally, but no actual close friends. He isn’t isolating me—he actually encourages me to talk to people—but I just can’t. I know I need to put myself out there, stop caring about embarrassing myself, yada yada, but it’s way harder than it seems. I feel out of place.\n\nI just feel so lonely. I have no one to attend events with, no one to meet up with in the evenings. I pretend it’s by choice, but honestly, I’m just fucking lonely.\n\nMy favorite festival is a week away, but i know my bully will be there and i have no friends to back me up. it will be the most joyous occasion and it hurts to know everyone other than me will be celebrating. my boyfriend cant come bc of restrictions imposed by college",

    "content": "It ended two years ago when I had a traumatic experience after a party. Since then, I’ve had health issues and mental issues. I used to get panic attacks every night and I lived completely alone abroad with no support system and no one to check on me. I went back home, and the psychiatrists made me take 3 different antidepressants which messed up my brain.\n\nEveryday feels like survival mode to me. I used to be such a social person, now I get anxious of social situations and avoid it. I used to love going out, but now I get scared of being outside. Every small task feels scary to me. My intrusive thoughts are also still there despite me quitting drugs a year ago. I have no hope anymore.\n\nAnd on top of that, I met someone I loved during this shitty year of my life. We ended things because he just couldn’t deal with so much from me anymore. I feel so guilty every single day for not being able to show him the version of who I used to be before drugs and experiences messing me up.\n\nI’m 23 now. It’s been 2 years. I moved back home for a bit, even though I hate it here.\n\nThe past month I’ve been feeling very down and thinking of sometimes ending it, even though I would not act on it. I just feel like I can never become the person I wanted to be again. I keep trying to think there is light at the end of the tunnel, but it never comes.",

    "content": "Ok so this is advice for how to survive these places. They are helpful, but in a weird way, but it sucks, and it’s traumatizing. But it’s very isolated and weirdly desensitized, so in there you aren’t effecting anyone you have personal attachments to. So first official tip, just make it to your release date, and you will be just fine.\n\nNext, a lot of people coming in to these places may have drug issues, or self harm. When I was in the ones I went to, I was too. And I was put in a terrible place with people on stimulants and benzos; along with a very odd amount of persistence and survival “methods” You will likely turn to snorting cheeked meds, drinking hand sanitizer and god knows what else. So go in with at least a little safety net. bring yourself alcohol wipes, an extra sock, and then a condom, if you are afab and haven’t had any surgeries or anything like that then this can work for “transportation” but the condom has other uses too. Not for sex.\n\nPlease don’t have sex oh my god. Just jerk off or something, everyone there is fighting literal demons. You do not want to end up in bed with them, I know that sounds stupid, but two people going through a mental health mess will have a very weird and toxic dynamic.\n\nI should also say that people are going to be judgmental. They are judging themselves so they are also projecting it. So I just don’t think you should form attachments or like preconceptions. You should talk to them though, it will really help to hear about someone’s life the closest you ever can. It makes you feel less alone. And it’s incredible to know you’ve seen these people be horrible and they the same for you, and you will never see each other again, and they know the most and least about you.",

    "content": "Three years ago, I met a girl online, and we hit it off instantly. We texted every single day, flirted shamelessly, and honestly? It was one of the best connections I've ever had. We never did video calls though, so neither of us knew what the other looked like. We're both introverts, so it never crossed our minds to FaceTime (weird, I know, but that's introvert life for you). Despite that, we developed a crush on each other, but we decided to remain flirty friends who sometimes roleplay sexy things because we're both not relationship people and and long-distance relationships are a hard pass for us. So we just kept texting and gaming together.\n\nSince I didn't know how she looks like, my brain started creating an idealized version of her and I imagined her like this alluring, confident, intense and mysterious femme fatale.\n\nOne day this girl disappeared without saying anything. Poof, gone, she deactivated all her gaming socials. She was always quite depressive so my mind started to jump to the worst conclusions, I was very worried. And I endlessly tried looking for her everywhere, but I only knew her name and country so I got nowhere.\n\nI eventually gave up looking for her but she always remained haunting me in the back of my mind  because of the way she had disappeared and the fact that I didn't know what happened to her. So I kept thinking about her throughout the 2 remaining years, replaying our last conversations to look for cues, and all of that led me to dead ends. It was frustrating. And it was like a mystery that I needed to solve. Alexa play \"oh whooo is sheee?\"\n\nSo one day, I decided that enough is enough. I was going to find her and I was going to get my answers even if I have to become the FBI myself. I believe in manifestation and law of attraction so I spent a whole night visualizing me finding her personal socials (the socials we had each other added were not personal socials, it was gaming socials, so I wanted to find either her Instagram or Facebook).\n\nAnd it worked! Next day, I went full FBI detective mode. I said the only information I had about her was her name and country, so I used those leads and somehow I managed to stumble upon her real full name! (I think this was the manifestation and law of attraction at play or some kind of witchcraft I dunno). It turned out that the name she had given me was a fake one but that's understandable so I don't hold it against her. Whatever. With her real name in hand, I found out where she went to school, where she went to college, and of course her personal socials.\n\nSo I opened up her Facebook and Instagram, filled with anticipation because finally I would be able to put a face to the ghost who'd haunted me for 2 whole years! And when I laid my eyes on her, there she was... THE SHEER REFLECTION OF MY GRANDMA WHEN YOUNG!\n\nNo, really. Like not kind of, not a little resemblance, I mean copy-paste, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, a perfect genetic duplicate of my grandma in her youth. ...I had spent years chasing this mystery woman, only for my brain to go, \"Wait a minute… is that… grandma?\"\n\nI WAS FUCKING IN LOVE WITH MY GRANDMA! FOR YEARS! Years of mystery, longing, idealization GONE IN A SECOND. My attraction to her? Instantly killed. Biggest turn off of my life. All the sexy things she had ever told me were no longer sexy and I just couldn't picture us physically together anymore...\n\nWe used to roleplay fear play scenarios AND NOW THE FEAR PLAY TURNED INTO FEAR FOR A DIFFERENT REASON. Like, instead of \"I'm going to hunt you down and devour you\" being hot, now it’s giving \"Eat your vegetables, sweetheart\" and I'm just sitting there like NOOOOOO, THE MAGIC IS GONE.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that would send Freud into overdrive. \"Tell me, how does this make you feel?\" LIKE SCREAMING, FREUD. IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE SCREAMING. My brain had built up this intense, mysterious, alluring figure, and then boom! grandma vibes! And I ended up in some kind of weird family reunion, yay!\n\nThis is for real one of the biggest plot twists of my life. I basically turned 3 years of longing into a detective saga with a twist ending, and instead of crying, I'm laughing about it. At this point I'm just happy because I can finally close this chapter but at the same time I feel shallow for losing attraction towards her immediately after seeing her. Oh well, not everyone can be attracted to their grandma.",
