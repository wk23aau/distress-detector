I didn't talk to him much after that, only at his fathers funeral, and my dads 70th birthday, trying to act normal. No one knows what he did 15 years ago, well I guess my dad knows now.\n\nMy dad called me on friday, letting me know he's not well and my parents and brother will visit him today,  one last time. Asking me if I wanted to join them, I said let me think about it. Yesterday I told my dad no, I will not be there because cousin did something I can't forgive. My dad's the best, I saw his face change but he didn't ask or press for info. He said he understood.\n\nIt did rip open an old wound. Honestly the guy's been dead to me for so long. I buried what happened in the back of my mind. Kind of blamed myself for being dumb enough to get so drunk and trusting someone to not take advantage. Now I realize this wasn't my fault. Today he will figure out I do not forgive him and never will. He will rot in the ground and I will spit on his grave.",

    "title": "I wouldn’t marry my husband of 17 years if given a do-over.",
    "content": "Four years ago, I felt like I had achieved all goals, happiness, and was married to my best friend. For context, I (35f) and my husband (38m) have been married for 17 years. I met him as a teenager, we dated, and married promptly after my 18th birthday. I felt like we had really worked through a lot of issues to build a good marriage and life together. I don’t have a strong support system of people in my life, so it was just him and me against the world. Well, that changed, and I’ve been beating myself up about it for a while, and trying to navigate my feelings, or just ignoring them, idk. I started to have feelings for a co-worker (I know, typical). He has been a friend at work, and is married. There has been nothing romantic between us, and I don’t get any indication from him that he is interested in more. He has just been supportive as my co-worker and a friend, and that friendship doesn’t extend outside of work at all. I have no interest in pursuing a romantic relationship with him either. I don’t want to have infidelity in my marriage or try to convince someone else to be untrue. And breaking marriages for another person just means a worse marriage.\n\nThis has really led me to contemplate my life. Why, when everything was feeling so right, did I start catching feelings for someone else. I looked back at our relationship and started seeing all the negative. I questioned if I was just looking for reasons to justify how I felt. I came to the realization that our dating relationship was abusive (and early years of our marriage). More than just bad, or two stupid kids. He was very controlling, pushed sex on me before I was ready, and even used a sexual act two different times as “punishment” (that was painful). Anytime I’m alone with my thoughts, I think that so much of how I am today in my relationship with him was shaped by the bad times. He isn’t that person any more, he isn’t controlling, and treats me better overall. But, I don’t have friends, am scared to make him mad, scared to talk about my feelings, am super agreeable to avoid any conflicts. He has been explosive and mean in the past when he gets angry, although that hasn’t been too recently. (Nothing ever physical.) I still feel like a terrible person for thinking about another guy, and feel some blame for wallowing in the past. I think if I would do it all over, and there’s no way I would stay in the relationship if given a do over. If I had a daughter, I would teach her how to avoid this and reach out for help.\n\nI feel like my eyes have been opened to the truth of our past. I tried to bring it up with him by asking what he thought about our dating relationship. He said he doesn’t really think about it, and I said that I thought it was bad. I brought up some things, and he didn’t want to talk about it. He said he had apologized and I just hadn’t forgiven him for it. He got mad, and I got upset and cried. I remember him giving an apology several years ago, we both got drunk and he said he felt bad about things and I consoled him, but I’m just now realizing it was abusive. I wanted to get confirmation from him that he agreed it wasn’t a healthy relationship, just for healing. But there was nothing productive about it.\n\nI find myself lately being depressed and bottled up. I work full time and my husband hasn’t had a job for a few years now. I really don’t care if he works, but want him to contribute to our relationship in some way. Instead he spends a lot of time sitting around the house on his phone making a mess and spending excessive amounts of time on hobbies. And no, I don’t think there is any chance he is cheating. I think he is also depressed. My guilt and frustration are overwhelming. I love him and he loves me, but I’m spending too much time in my head not dealing with my feelings, just hoping things find their place and go back, even though I know that’s not likely. I know I could use counseling to work on past trauma and learn to be a better partner myself. So maybe I’ll finally do that.",

    "content": "When I was around 12 I touched my dad in his sleep. It happened like two more times until one time he woke up and I just pretended to sleep. So I knew what I was doing is wrong. For a little bit of background although I don’t want to justify anything my dad is a huge narcissist asshole. Abusive towards my mom and sister he hit them and they were more than often afraid for their lives. He also sexually assaulted my mother when she denied him sex and she was always very tired the next day. He watched openly pornographic content on the tv in the living room. While me and my sister as children were seeing this and when my mother confronted him I still remember him saying that he has to get his arousal somewhere. Also I vaguely remember while till I was 12 I came in the night in my parents bedroom to sleep there when I got scared and almost always he made sexual advances towards my mother and i interrupted him to sleep in between them. I also remember i kept going to sleep with them even when i was 12 and no longer scared to sleep alone just to protect my mother since my dad didn’t let her sleep in peace and continued sexually assaulting here. So I strongly feel all this played a part why i suddenly touched my dad in his sleep. I don’t know but something psychologically happened as a result but to this day i still feel bad about it and disgusted with my self and have a hard time understanding my own sex drive since i only associate it with bad things. I also don’t want to talk about it with my sister or mom since they are both already traumatized enough I don’t want burden them with another thing. So I don’t know maybe some of you guys could help me process this or give some advice. Thanks\n\nEdit: Thanks guys your comments helped me a bit. I‘m starting therapy in two weeks because I noticed my thoughts became too much to bear for myself. My sister is a bit older than me and around my age she started to attempt and it was up to me to stop her but I don’t want the same for me. But I wasn’t sure I could ever bring this topic up in therapy out of fear of judgement from the therapist since I am so disgusted with myself i only found it logical to expect the same from others.",

    "title": "*FINAL UPDATE* I 21F found out my husband 33M has been having an affair with my mother, and I don’t know where to go from here?",
    "content": "Hey so this will be my final update on everything as I believe the situation has finally come to an end and I’m in a really good place.\n\nI left off where I was in a shelter and had made a lot of friends. Well the girl who I was gonna move somewhere with she ended up going back to her Mom and step Dad, and so I was back to being stuck on what to do. That was until I got a message from my grandma that her mom (my great-grandma) needs someone to care for her, she said that her brother would be happy to have me stay with him as long as I care for my great grandma. I decided I have nothing left to lose and decided this would be a good gig till I find out what I wanna do. I arrived in Miami 3 days ago and have been enjoying it greatly so far. I never really knew my dad’s side as he wasn’t that close with his family and after he passed it was hard to keep contact. My great-uncle is very nice and very accommodating and his wife is really nice, they live in quite a nice part of Miami as well near the beach.\n\nI haven’t seen my great-grandma in over 10 years and she was so happy when she saw me. She can’t speak that much English as she only really speaks Spanish. I’m aware I said my dad was white, but that’s was only because I was scared of my identity being revealed and that wasn’t a 100% lie. My father was Cuban and was born and raised in Miami, however, he was most likely a descendant of Spaniards. Anyways, my great grandma has been teaching me Spanish and as well through the help of translating of my great uncle stories about my dad. She told me that he would fall asleep on her lap at family gatherings and how he would make the whole family laugh imitating her accent. It made me tear up seeing all the photos of him as a kid with his whole family. She told me that when he got on drugs and ran away from home, it left everyone in complete distraught. She claimed my grandma would cry everyday.\n\nMy Mom never had a relationship with them, and that was her choice they wanted to meet her actually. They told me that they weren’t shocked what happened to me as my Dad told them later on my mom would cheat on him all the time with other men. This made me furious as my mom always claimed my dad was her “soulmate.”\n\nI have not heard anything from my mom, however, my cousins wedding went ahead yesterday as my aunty posted it on Facebook. My mom was there and she seemed completely fine from the photos. The wedding looked boring anyways, my cousin is marrying his first cousin from Pakistan (in-laws side) and no one is smiling. It made me laugh actually seeing my mom with all these people who are deeply religious and conservative. Seeing my mom next to my grandma and other female relatives who wear scarfs and are deeply religious, compared to my mom who sleeps with anyone that gives her an ounce of attention really cracks me up.\n\nAlso no word from my EX-husband, however, his sister sent me a text apologising on behalf of her and his parents.\n\nSo yeah that’s the end I believe I’m taking care of my great-grandma and will work out what I wanna do in the mean time. This will most likely (hopefully) be the final update as I believe I’m in a really good place.",

    "content": "I (F23) grew up as one of the oldest in my family, so I practically raised my younger siblings. I never really had a childhood I was always the responsible one, making decisions and taking care of everything. I’ve always been independent, maybe even a little on the masculine side. My parents were either working or not really present, so I took on the role of babysitter and homemaker. Between school, work, and looking after my siblings, I never had time to just enjoy life. No boyfriends, no social life just responsibility.\n\nNow that my siblings are older and independent, I finally moved out to focus on myself. That’s when I decided to try Hinge, and I matched with this guy (M32). We hit it off right away and have been dating for almost eight months now. He’s handsome, intelligent, kind, nurturing, and, for the first time in my life, I feel like I have someone I can truly depend on. It’s a feeling I never knew I needed.\n\nBut over the past three months, I’ve noticed some changes. He started calling me his good little girl at first, it caught me off guard. I even cringed a little. But at the same time, I felt this weird, unexpected warmth from it. Like a part of me liked it, even though I didn’t understand why.\n\nHe also started buying me cute, feminine dresses and pretty heels things I would never have picked for myself. I was hesitant at first, but when I tried them on, I actually felt beautiful. Feminine. I was shocked by how much I loved it.\n\nThen there are things like he packs me lunch on his days off and drops it off before I go to work, even though I usually just eat at the cafeteria. No one has ever made me lunch before, and it makes me feel so cared for in a way I didn’t realize I was missing.\n\nHe even brushes my hair. I have really long hair, and he’ll braid it for me sometimes. I thought I would hate it, but now I love it. I crave it. There’s this part of me that never got to experience these kinds of gentle, affectionate moments, and I feel like I’m healing in ways I can’t even explain.\n\nHe pats my head, gives me so much affection, and honestly, I feel like I’m going to explode from happiness.  He’s so patient and gentle with me.\n\nEven our sex life has changed it’s filled with love and praise. I never knew how much I would love being praised. It makes me feel so happy, like I just want to be my best for him.  I do whatever I can to make him happy.\n\nI know this all sounds a little strange. In a way, he feels like a father figure, but obviously not in a weird way. I don’t see him as my dad or anything like that, but I don’t know how else to explain it. I never thought I’d have a daddy (if that makes sense).\n\nI told my two close friends about us and they said how it’s creepy and wrong and I should break up with him before it’s too late, calling him a predator. Also I am too inexperienced to know better.  They said how they don’t know me anymore because I changed a lot.\n\nYes I I have changed, I dress more feminine and I feel pretty.  I’ve always been the yes girl in our friendship but  lately I’ve been creating boundaries and more vocal about what I want sometimes and apparently it’s creating friction in our group. And due to that I’m now self centred they are icing me out unless I listen to them.\n\nThis is the happiest I’ve been in my life and I’m sad they can’t see that. I don’t know what to do.\n\nEdit: I am financially stable with out without him.\n\nTL;DR I’m dating an older guy and my friends think he’s a predator because of our age gap and how he treats me. Now they want me me to break up with him.",

    "title": "I was in an aya cult. I told his wife and she didnt believe me.",
    "content": "After returning home from an ayahuasca ceremony, I got a message from a friend of mine whom I considered a \"spiritual brother\". He wanted to meet up. I was still in that post-ceremony glow—full of energy despite the late hour—and I wanted to socialize.\n\nI live down a long dirt trail, a 15-minute walk from the nearest road. When I got there, he was waiting in his SUV. I was excited to talk with him. Right away, he offered me some hard liquor, saying, “This is what the indigenous people drink here! It’s very good for you.” But I had just returned from drinking ayahuasca, and he knew that. He wasn’t speaking clearly, but he started telling me stories about indigenous cosmology, which fascinated me—until the conversation took a turn.\n\nHe began talking about how husbands take other women and how normal it is. Then he told me he needed someone “spiritually on his level” so they could have a deeper connection than with their actual partners.\n\nI told him flat out I wasn’t interested. But I kept asking questions. Does your wife know about these ‘practices’ you do?\n\n“No, no,” he said, “but it’s better for her. Better for me too. And for our children.”\n\nHe started going on about how we don’t marry the people we are equal to—we marry the ones who are good for having kids. That real spiritual connection is with extramarital lovers. He kept inflating my ego, using spiritual talk to manipulate me. I asked if he had done this before.\n\n“I’ve done it many times,” he admitted. “With many different women.”\n\nThen he put his hand on my leg. I told him I was leaving. But I made the mistake of trying to stay friendly.\n\n“Let me just show you one thing before you go,” he said.\n\nHe stopped me behind the car and hugged me. That’s when I froze. Trauma hit me like a wave. This wasn’t the first time something like this had happened to me, and suddenly, I was simultaneously trapped in his arms and in my past.\n\nHe pulled me tightly against him, ran his hand down my back, onto my hindquarters. At the same time, he started kissing me—lightly, from my ear down to my collarbone. My stomach churned with nausea. I squirmed to get away. He let go. I was in full trauma response, barely able to hold back tears. Then he begged me not to tell his wife. I barely managed a goodbye before I ran back up the hill to my house, praying he wasn’t following me.\n\nA few days later, I saw his wife. Despite my own pain, I felt it was my duty to tell her the truth about her husband. Never mind my trauma—this was her husband. She deserved to know.\n\nAt first, she seemed to believe me. But later that day, I got a message from her. She repeated all his lies. He told her I subconsciously wanted to be with him. That based on our messages, I must have known it was going to be romantic.\n\nBut that couldn’t be further from the truth!!\n\nI was completely blindsided. Now, looking back, I understand things I didn’t back then. At the time, I was in a cult. I believed that everyone in it was a good person, incapable of this kind of thing. If it were me now, I’d know better. I’d understand that if a married man asks a woman to meet him at 2 AM, he’s not looking to talk about life. Full stop.\n\nToday, I saw both of them.\n\nSeeing him again brought everything back- how he lied, how he got away with it, how his wife believed him over me. The anger and pain hit me like a tidal wave. I wanted to punch his stupid mouth, to do something, to make him face the truth of what he did. I even had a thought of role-playing the situation in front of his wife-forcing her to see it so she would understand. But I know deep down, no matter what I do, she probably won't believe me. He has her wrapped in lies. And I'm the one left carrying all of this. I've been crying all day. I feel so much anger, hurt, and grief. I don't know how to process this.",

    "content": "My husband wanted a dog, and I had never had one before. I’ve had plenty of pets in the past: cats, rabbits, and fish, and I loved each one of them deeply. So, we decided to get a dog.\n\nHe did the work of finding the exact dog he wanted, and we drove three hours to adopt her. Even though he took on most of the feeding, exercising, playing, and training, she bonded to me. The bond feels like an obsession. When I’m around, my husband doesn’t exist to her. She never wants to be more than three feet away from me, and often, she’s touching me.\n\nWhen I need a break, I go into the bedroom and shut the door. She just sits outside, waiting. I can put her in the office with my fiancé on the other side of the house, and then go to the bedroom and shut the door. But she waits at the office door, whining and whimpering. My husband tries to interact with her, but she doesn’t care. She just wants me. And I can’t handle this level of attention. You can take her outside, but if she knows I’m inside, she won’t leave the door. If I leave, she panics. A few minutes later, she calms down and does her own thing. She never bothers my husband this much.\n\nI’ve heard mothers talk about feeling “touched out” with toddlers, and that’s exactly how I feel with my dog. The difference is, I don’t think she’ll ever grow past this stage. She’s a dog. We’ve worked with trainers to help her become more independent, but it doesn’t seem to work.\n\nI’m thankful that there’s more nuance in the “adopt, don’t shop” movement. Sometimes, it might actually be better to get a dog from an ethical breeder, as shelter dogs can come with their own set of challenges. My dog has trauma, and that trauma will stay with her for life. It shows up in our relationship, where we’re in a sort of quasi-codependence. It’s frustrating because she’s fine when I’m not around. My husband can take her places, and she’s as happy as can be. If I’m not home, she’s completely relaxed. It’s only when I’m around that she becomes obsessed with me. I don’t get to experience the playful, silly dog everyone else sees because, in my presence, she’s consumed with me.\n\nMy husband takes her to his brother’s farm, and he sends me videos of her. It breaks my heart because I want to see that happy, playful dog too. I want a dog I can sit outside with, playing with toys and rolling in the dirt, without her needing to touch my leg at all times. But I never get that dog. I love her so much, but her constant affection drowns me.\n\nI look forward to when she goes to the farm because I get to be home without her on top of me. I don’t love my job, but I dread going home because, at least at work, I get some alone time.\n\nI love my dog, but I don’t like being around her.",

Coming from a very conservative Muslim culture this is looked down on, because people assume you are living away from your family as a single woman to do haram (forbidden) activities in the religion. However I just wanted to have my own space and be independent, that’s all. My parents did not take it well, my mother told me I was selfish and deserve everything bad in life for abandoning them.\n\nThis was over a year ago and the relationship is still quite strained. I’ve called a few times since and my mother was super rude and irritated like I was bothering her for calling her. So I stopped, and I haven’t spoken to my family in a few months. I’m not sure how you can claim to love your child and practically disown them for wanting to live their own lives. So I know now I am not loved by them.\n\nIt’s really sad to not receive unconditional love from your parents because you will never get unconditional love anywhere else. Not from friends, not even from your spouse. You will forever feel unloved and worthless. Most relationships are fickle and very conditional. You family is meant to be your rock. But I have none.\n\nSometimes I wonder why I am even in this world.",

    "content": "I've only told maybe 2 people for my entire life about this, but it's been weighing on me recently. I feel like I need to just shout to the void about it.\n\nI(28M) befriended one of my teachers when I was 14. At the time, he was 35. For more background, I was F at the time (now FtM). He was my middle school teacher and when I switched schools, I added him on Facebook. It wasn't until around my freshman year of high school that we really started to talk.\n\nAt first, I basically harassed him, sending him messages daily, until he started to reply and it became conversational. After about a year, we began messaging each other daily. It was never anything inappropriate; we mainly talked about games, music, art, daily life, etc. (normal friendly type conversation). We never hung out or met up or anything. The only time I saw him after he was my teacher was one time at a school event.\n\nI lived in an abusive home and was a very lonely kid. I always figured he sensed that and that I just needed/wanted someone to talk to who actually cared. He became what I still consider to be my best friend at the time. I eventually started to have feelings for him because of this. I still remember telling him how I felt, and him saying something along the lines of \"I'm very flattered, but that's not appropriate\". The conversation dwindled a bit after that, but some time passed and we picked back up our daily conversations.\n\nOne morning, I woke up to see my father on my computer, snooping through my messages with this former teacher. I freaked out and told him this. We ended up exchanging numbers and started texting because of this.\n\nA while went by (a few months, if I remember right), we continued our friendship and daily conversations. Something happened and my parents took my phone (I can't exactly remember why they took it). I went to lunch with a friend one day, and when I got home, both of my parents were there and I knew something was wrong (they divorced and hated each other). They confronted me about my teacher and I's friendship, saying they \"[knew] everything\". My father had texted him through my phone, telling him to cease contact and threatening to report him to the school board if he ever tried talking to me again. I was heartbroken hearing this and knowing I'd never speak to him again. My parents claim he was \"grooming\" me, but I never felt that way. He felt more like a dad or an uncle, and treated me almost as his kid. Plus, as mentioned before, I basically harassed this man into talking to me. I always got the feeling he just kind of felt bad for me, especially looking back on our conversations and this situation as an adult.\n\nI never spoke with him again after that. It was somewhat of a traumatic experience for me, but only because someone I really cared about just suddenly vanished from my life and I felt as though I had nearly ruined his life because I was a lonely kid. The loss I experienced changed me as a person and the way I view all relationships.\n\nI still think of him often. I want to reach out and ask him how he is, and tell him how sorry I am for putting him in such a bad situation. It's just been so long and I don't want to dredge up the past, especially when I'm sure it was also traumatic for him.\n\nI don't know how to move on when it ended so abruptly and so badly. I have dreams of running into him on the street and getting my opportunity to tell him I'm sorry and hear how he dealt with things afterward.",

This is something I’ve only ever told one person and I feel deeply uncomfortable to even tell a therapist.\n\nFor context: I have never been a victim of sexual abuse physically, was raised in a super healthy home life, etc. Nothing traumatic has ever happened to me due to another person I personally knew.\n\nWhen I was younger, I purposely would go on a site called KidzChat. I knew that predators would be on that site, and would advertise myself as someone to talk to “F 12”. I was around the ages of 10-14 doing this. Older men would then message me super sexually explicit things. We would sext for a while and eventually trade Skypes to talk or videochat. The biggest instance that I remember was skyping an older man who wanted to show me his jumping jacks. He would jump for a while and then his pants would conveniently fall off.  For some reason that moment is engrained in my mind. I know I’m a victim fully, but I feel weird because I went out looking for it? I guess that’s the cost of unlimited Internet access.\n\nAnother entirely separate thing that bothers me severely, is that one day (aged 11) I had my family dog perform oral on me. The dog didn’t need any coaxing, it liked the smell and went up to it. I remember it feeling awful and I felt so intensely guilty afterward. I never did it again, but I realize that this has deeply affected me as an adult. I absolutely cannot receive oral from a man because it reminds me of what I did with my family dog. This fact genuinely haunts me as I know it was completely wrong and animal.\n\nI don’t even know how to cope with both of these facts as I was a victim and perpetrator. These things still affect me in my sexual life now manifesting as intense fear and guilt to commit certain normal sexual acts with people like being eaten out, sexting my boyfriend, etc. I know I don’t have the guts to tell a therapist either.",

    "content": "I worked for Child Protective Services in a metropolitan area of the US for 12 years. I did both long term case management and later investigations that led to the removals of children. With about a decade of time and reflection, I’ve come to realize the following:\n\nI was a young woman with lots of privilege who did not understand the lives or needs of the people over whose lives I made decisions for.  This now causes me great pain.\n\nTurns out I was dissociating through most of it due to secondary trauma and moral injury. The ability to dissociate (although we just saw it as toughing through back then) was seen as showing that you were a great worker and could “get shit done”.\n\nI wanted to do good in the world and I wanted to help children. And I did. But I also caused harm because I had too many cases, not enough supervision and no real self-awareness.\n\nIt took years of therapy to understand and grieve the harm I had caused and the harm caused to me. I don’t even remember the first few years of my children’s lives because I was so dissociated. I often have to look at a photos to remember events with them.\n\nI still get flashbacks of things I was exposed to and am swapped with pain.\n\nSometimes it all comes back. Just this week, I was contacted by a former colleague and a child who was on my caseload many years ago.\n\nThe colleague reminded me of a child death case we worked on. It was particularly searing because we both had children that were about the same age as the child who died.\n\nShe also reminded me about the death of another colleague (through an aneurism) and the suicide of a couple others. Yes, our work had a death count.\n\nThe girl, now an adult, reached out to me to say she is doing well and to thank me for helping her find an adoptive home.\n\nIt’s a mixed bag. And these memories reinforce in me the idea that nothing in life is guaranteed and I’m just trying to do the best I can each day. I screw up and I repair where I can. I put kindness and compassion into everything I do, but that isn’t always enough.\n\nI don’t really have a purpose for this post. Just wanted to get it off my chest.",

    "content": "I(F28) and my former friend G( F30) meet during our first term in university, we both came from the same area and went to the same school at one point. We clicked and became really good friends from there. I was an insecure 19 year old at that time and she was outgoing and active in our version of sorority. I was invited to outings that I actually enjoyed and began to build up some confidence. We both had our share of mental problems understood each other, but after taking diffrent courses we stopped meeting as regularly but she always said that I was one of her closest friends.\n\nIn 2020, I became sick. Really heavy burnout, Crohn dieses and bulimia that made me unable to stay in town. I moved back home and slowly began to rebuild my life and health. Now in 2025, I am still sick, but way better and have control of my mental problems. During the last five years I wrote to G every time I went to the university city, asking to meet up and if I could, I set the dates of my travel after her schedule to make sure we could meet(it’s a 5h drive). Every time she said she would love to, and if she was available we booked a date and time. But almost always something happened or she double booked that she remembered 1 day to 1h before. During these five years, we have meet up twice and I have probably asked her around 10 times since I usually go twice a year.  She never wrote to me when she visited her parents or asked me when I was going down next time, which I realise now was a clear sign that I ignored. I once wrote and asked her if she didn’t want to meet up, it was okey and I would understand, time changes people and friendship does not always last. She denied it and said she very much wanted to meet up and I accepted the answer. Telling me how horrible of a friend she is and how sorry she is.\n\nTwo years ago I had a major breakdown when G cancelled on me again. I had been so excited and when she cancelled I was heartbroken. Walking is my coping strategy, especially with heavy emotions, even after 10km I did not stop crying. I was living with another friend  for that weekend and I fully broke down in the end and told her everything. They had never suspected anything cause I always spoke so well off her. She  apparently told my other friends who all are mad on my behalf.\n\nG sent me a snap in May 2024, with the caption ”In exactly one year we are getting married” with a picture on her fiancé. I congratulated her, but I had no idea about their engagement before that. I decided to one last try and asked her of a time during the summer we could meet up, with my vacation weeks in mind. She responded and we decided a week  were she was free, for details to be determined later. As it approached I wrote 1 week before and told her the days, no response. When I finally was at the hotell I wrote again and told her how long I was there and times when I was booked. My friends were a bit angry at me for trying again but I said that this will be the last time.\n\nOne day after I came home from the trip she responded with how sorry she was for not answering. I had enough and told her how I felt through the years, I was nice and civile even said I should have brought it up earlier and not just unload it all now, even asked my friends to read before sending. G answered and told me she understood why I felt like that, I ended it with that if she wanted to meet, she would have to text or call me now, cause I was tired of this being so one sided.\n\nGuess what - not heard from her since. Now I see pictures from the wedding preparations like the baccalaureate and dress fitting and I feel so sad. Probably I had a delusion hope deep inside that I would get an invite and that she would text me. This quenching the last hope of ever being friends again and telling me how little I meant and what friends mattered to her.\n\nMy friends supports my feelings even my boyfriend, but I just feel like I never meant anything. If they are real friends they will make time for you, I know, but in my head I go through all those memories and just wonder if I could have done anything different. Been a better friend, written more, called or if I just was the burden I always was scared of being, also wishing I not been so delusional and naive.\n\nSorry for the long post❤️",

    "title": "My sister invited our brother to her wedding, even though she knows how I feel about him",
    "content": "Recently my sister got engaged, and she asked me to be a part of her bridal party. Initially I was very excited to have a role in her wedding, kind of still am, but now I'm feeling iffy because she invited our brother, who I don’t have a positive relationship with.\n\nFor context, I’m the youngest out of the three of us and we were raised by a single mother who worked a lot. Because of this, my sister took a lot of responsibility over us when our mother couldn’t. She’s like a second mother to me and my brother even though she shouldn’t have been. My brother, on the other hand, was kind of a weirdo growing up. He dressed alternatively and had “nerdy” interests, something that younger-me at the time thought was really cool, and was all around awkward.\n\nI was maybe 8 and he was 14 when he started getting curious with his body, and that eventually led to him sexually assaulting me. It didn’t happen for long, thank god, but the experience left a disgusting stain on me. Eventually I realized that what had happened to me was wrong, and it wasn't until I was 13 that I finally had the chance and courage to talk to someone.\n\nI was removed from my home and placed in a children’s psych unit, and my case was being handled by a social worker. Of course, they informed my mother, who then told a few others, my sister included. I didn’t know this at the time, but some of the adults around her pressured her into convincing me to recant my statement. So when she visited me, she asked me to do just that. I was obviously so betrayed and angry, she was my role model and the one person I relied on the most at the time. I can’t recall the rest of our conversation, I just remember leaving the visitation area and completely losing it in my room.\n\nBut I was young, impressional, and ruminating a lot at this time, so I did end up recanting my statement. My case worker didn’t agree with my decision but respected it anyway. For the sake of procedure, my case was still investigated, but without the victim’s statement it fell through. It didn’t erase anything that happened to me, but it felt like it did with how everyone else around me went about their lives like nothing happened. It was jarring and fucked with my head, and I slowly started believing that I made the whole thing up for attention. My memory wasn’t the best, and it could’ve just been a messed up dream I had. I started feeling disgusted and I couldn’t trust myself anymore, and I began spiraling.\n\nFastward to when I was 17, I was hospitalized for almost taking my life. For some reason, this was much more serious than before. I was finally put on medication and was put into a program for other at-risk teens. It was through group therapy I started thinking about getting closure for myself, so after a lot of mental and emotional preparation, I confronted my brother. At the last minute I decided to record the conversation without him knowing, and I actually got a confession. I went to my social worker, and after a few days he was removed from the house.\n\nAfter that, I was both relieved and stressed by the events that came next. To be honest I didn’t follow too closely with the court proceedings, I couldn’t bring myself to care what happened to him, all I remember was being interviewed by SVU and getting monthly check ups by social services. But the whole ordeal was mentally and emotionally draining for me and my family. My mom couldn’t believe it at first, and briefly experienced religious psychosis, but no one took it harder than my sister. I guess she felt guilty, because 1) such a serious thing happened between two of her siblings right under her nose, and 2) she didn’t have my back when I first came forward about it. I don’t blame her, or anyone really, for not noticing what was happening. I can’t bring myself to blame anyone, no one wants to believe that someone you love is capable of something as horrible as sexual assault.\n\nA few years have passed since then, and I’ve been working on improving my mental health. My sister was my rock throughout the process, the most understanding of me and my circumstances, and after a while I thought I had made peace with the whole situation, until her wedding. My sister’s decision to invite our brother, after years of no-contact between the two of us, kind of blindsided me. Not because I didn’t expect her to, but because she didn’t tell me. Now here’s the thing, I would never ask my sister to choose between me or our brother. I understand that she loves the both of us despite what had happened, so to ask her to do that wouldn’t be fair. But I would’ve liked a heads-up. I had to ask her myself if he was coming, and I’m glad I did. The thought of walking into the venue and seeing him in the crowd without warning would’ve sent me into a panic.\n\nAnd because of this I started to rethink my relationship with her. She’s done a lot for me, and I’ll go as far as to say that she has a bigger impact on me than our mother does. I want to give her some grace for this, but I still feel so uncomfortable with his presence. He’s also still in good standing with our extended family, who don’t know of the situation, so the possibility of them joking around and having fun with him without knowing what he’s done doesn’t sit right with me.\n\nI most likely won’t do anything regarding my sister’s wedding because I don’t want to ruin her big day, but it’ll probably change the way I see her. Like I said, I won’t ask her to choose between me or him, but that doesn’t mean I can’t. It’s a scary realization that my relationship with my sister can change, I really don’t want it to, but I can’t ignore how she’s willing to look past what our brother has done to me when I haven’t. I want to start by having a proper conversation with her about this first though, after the wedding. I want to fully understand her side of the story and her perspective before making this big decision.\n\nI honestly don’t know what to expect or hope for, but I feel like if I don’t do something then all the improvement I’ve made will come undone and I don’t think I’ll recover this time.",

(bad decision imo, but whatever)\n\nmy dad and mom managed to run a very successful business. like upper class stuff. they got married and had me. (20m). ive always thought that i had a very spoiled life. being able to afford things most people would kill for and even going to an expensive private school.\n\nmy dad did not pay a single penny for child support. it was my MOM who sends his ex wife money. keep in mind, i was kept in the dark about this until my parents eventually divorced when i was 13-14 for reasons i dont feel comfortable explaining. i was eventually told that i have half siblings from my dad's previous marriage. and what's worse is learning that they are financially struggling, all because of my dad abandoning his own family just to have me. and now? he did the same with me. i havent seen my dad in months now and we are living with less money than we had.\n\ni feel guilty. the fact that i was born into a family where i was fed with a silver spoon, while not knowing the financial struggles my half siblings are in. if my dad was not an asshole, i wouldn't've existed by now.\n\nto add salt to the wound. my dad remarried and tried conceiving a baby through IVF. i was so fucking pissed hearing that. he abandoned my 2 older half siblings to have me, and now hes abandoning me for an ivf baby?\n\nmy mom says that despite all of this, i should still love my father as \"hes your father afterall\" but i just cant.  i really... really... cant....",

I stayed through so many hard times with him and now I hate myself for it. He made friends with this girl on the game and I asked so many times if he had anything to tell me regarding their relationship. I found receipts tonight and honestly it’s as devastating as it is embarrassing. Two grown adults with children and both with partners telling each other they are shaking and crying over each other. Lamenting that they wished they had other lives where they could be together essentially. All the while I’m in the same house while these things are going on about each other. He’s adamant it didn’t go any further and he even turned down nudes (I know…very valiant). Obviously I am not really buying that.\n\nI’m just disgusted and this has been the turning stone for me. The true victim in this is our 8 month old son who has a stupid mother who allowed herself to be abused for years and now has a split family.",

It's something I am deeply ashamed of, and could never do again. But the thoughts linger and remain. Oftentimes, it'll result in me becoming increasingly anxious. Sometimes I worry that, someday, karma is going to swing back around and my fiancee will one day cheat on me; perhaps that persistent anxiety is the true retribution. I'd like to seek therapy, but it isn't feasible for me at the moment. I think that some amount of it has to do with abandonment issues. I think my brain convinced itself that having more than one person would always leave me with someone if anybody had abandoned me again, in quite an unhealthy coping mechanism for everyone involved.

This meant that I would have to talk to a family member (from my mom's side) to tell her what happened. My mom ended up confessing that she would much rather keep the family in peace and still have a relationship with them, then be with me and support me when I do talk to that aunt.  Since then, I haven't been able to calm my anxiety, I feel like shit every day (I have been in a state of derealization that is driving me crazy). Since my dad left when I was 3 I have always put my mom's needs and feelings before mine, sadly all I have learned during these sessions is that I am not the daughter she wants, that I am always wrong and that she literally can't name 1 good thing about me. It is super confusing because she hasn't stopped helping me pay for uni, she still helps me buy new clothes for my new job, but yet again she won't hesitate to tall me how mean or inconsiderate I am. I am honestly exhausted, I wanted to better our relationship, I am the one who started with the idea of family therapy, but It has become one of the worst decisions of my life.

    "content": "My mother (65), who adopted me from Ghana, West Africa, when I was 6 years old, emotionally abused and neglected me throughout my childhood. She's Canadian. Most of my memories are filled with babysitters, while she was living it up, school bullying and therapists, while she refused to believe that any of my problems stemmed from my relationship with her.\n\nUs moving often because of school bullying and money problems also prevented me from creating lasting friendships.\n\nI've been slowly working through my own trauma with a therapist, and now live several hours away from her, and now I work a full time job as a news producer, thanks to one of my amazing former professors.\n\nMy older brother not biological is in his 40s and met my mother when he was in his late 20s. She couldn't legally adopt him but was moved by his story and took him in as a son. He spent some time with us when I was 7 and 8, but ultimately moved to begin his own life. From there, he would be someone I saw in every blue moon. My mother would talk about him a lot, but I never really knew who he was, and still don't.\n\nHe's in his late 40s now and lives in Canada with his family. He absolutely adores my mother and never challenges her on anything despite the way she talks about him and his family to me in private. They talk on a daily basis, and my mother will try to guilt trip me by bragging about how much he loves her and talks to her on a daily basis.\n\nHe use to force himself to connect with other people in my mothers biological family, but stopped when she moved to the U.S., and when my aunt who would often coax him out, passed away from cancer in 2022.\n\nHis relationship with any other family member besides my mother is more out of obligation and love for my mother, and that's how it's been with me for a long time.\n\nHe's basically been a stranger to me my entire life. He never reaches out to me, has never sent me a birthday card, and if he does reach out, it's usually because it has something to do with my mother. My mother excuses and enables his actions by blaming them for his early upbringing.\n\nAll my attempts to build a relationship with him have ended in silence, despite even my mothers own attempts to get us closer. It just won't happen.\n\nHe himself has only seen my mother a couple of times within the last 10-15 years. Whenever something has happened with my mother, medically, I have to be the one constantly giving him updates. My mother says he has money problems, but I find that hard to believe, especially when he's been getting expensive remodeling work done on his house for the last couple of years.\n\nA couple years ago to please my mother, he started doing these weekly Zoom videos with my mother and I, and it's 100% clear it's just a way for him to show my mother that he is making an effort to get closer with me, and even then he's barely engaged. Now it's my mother or I that have to start the video chats.\n\nI'm getting emotionally tired of the charades and have decided to distance myself from him, but I am in the process of not letting my mother guilt trip me when I know I've done nothing wrong.\n\nI started therapy once I found out my birth mother, who would be 47, passed away not too long ago. My biological grandmother is still alive, and I have 4 biological brothers. I hope to reconnect with them someday soon.",

We used to be extremely close, and always teased each other jokingly.\n\nBut since reconnecting with them, I've just been feeling a lot more sensitive to their comments? It feels silly as I know they don't mean anything bad by their words, but I just find myself wondering if they even really like me as a person or if they're judging me.\n\nCouple of examples: I have pet cats and this friend knows I love them. They've never liked cats, which is fine. They sent over a funny video of a cat, but that somehow devolved into them telling me how much they hate cats, and talking about how they also thought cats made their owners bitches, etc... I just tried to brush it off and joke back, defending my stance on cats a little bit. This isn't the first time I've had to hear about someone's grievances with cats, but it's just such a conversation killer for me. Like cool, you hate the animals I happen to really like. I am so glad you have given me this reminder lol.\n\nThe other thing that bothered me a bit was just a comment that made me feel like they thought I was immature. I said something like \"Oh this slaps\" and they immediately said \"Don't say that, you're 31.\" It's such a small thing but I guess I've always been a bit anxious about seeming \"mature\" enough to people, so it did sting a bit.\n\nI imagine a lot of this is just my own anxieties getting the best of me, as well as the fact that it's been so long that we're almost strangers in a lot of ways.

    "content": "I really need to take this off my chest because today I f*cked up multiple times and I feel extremely embarrassed.\n\nMaybe I am in my head but I'm definitely somewhere in the wrong.\n\nOk so my day started fine with me taking a ride to the airport. The driver, a super nice guy from Pakistan, shared with me that he is fasting and he will only get to have water or something to eat after 6pm. So what do I do? I get all excited about Pakistani food and ask him to tell me what are his favorite dishes from his hometown. Then I proceed to describe in excruciating detail all my favorite dishes from my country. Recipes, mouthwatering ingredients, the whole thing. By the time I realized that he must be starving (it was 4pm after all), I was already rambling for about an hour already. I apologized immediately and he was super nice about it, but this doesn't make me less of an idiot.\n\nSo after this great success, fast forward to a few hours later - I am on the plane, seated near  the back, squeezed into the middle seat. We are about to depart, the plane is on the move and I realize that my seatbelt gets loose without me lifting the little lever thingy. I ask for assistance and the flight attendant tells me \"Don't worry, the seatbelt will work later\". So I ask him \"How is this possible...?\", thinking that I really don't do well during flights, that I used to get panic attacks, that I managed to control after a lot of therapy and <<OMG I am about to fly and if something happens I will break my neck crashing on the roof of the plane!!!>>.\n\nHe sighs, then tells me he will replace the belt and goes away. Comes back after a minute or so and he says that the plane needs to depart and that there is no time, they will need to move me. There is quickly some commotion, all the flight attendants make some signals to each other and they find me a free row at the front. So I thank them profoundly, I apologize for the last minute chaos that I caused and go to my new princess seat, but the window with extra legroom that I didn't pay for. I sit down, I put the seatbelt on.... and I realize that the new seatbelt ALSO gets loose if I push the metal thing! I test it out a little bit and then it hits me. If I just pull the belt, it stays locked. If I put my finger under the metallic thing and push slightly it gets loose. So that means that I did all this.... for no reason.\n\nI close my eyes and start thinking that it can't be that I'm so inconsiderate today. And how embarrassing. Meanwhile I'm doing my breathing exercises trying to relax. There is turbulence today and my mouth is dry, I can't handle it anymore. I open my eyes and soon as I see the flight attendant handing out chocolates, I ask for some water. She says \"I will check if we still have\", and I'm thinking \"Oh wow, how strange! It can't be that they don't have at least one bottle\". Quickly she comes back, hads me one and finally I drink some water. \"Finally I can try to relax\", I'm thinking. Then I realize must have dropped the chocolate she gave me. I start looking around and then I look to my left and I freeze. On the seat next to me there is yet another water bottle that the flight attendants must have left for me while I was trying to \"breathe iiiiin, hooooold, exhaaale, the plane is safe the plane is safe the plane is safe\".\n\nSo that's it. This is another successful day. I am sitting here patiently, writing this to distract myself and I think I will post as soon as we land.\n\nThank you for listening to my rambling dear reader <3",

    "title": "7-layer carrot cake --- The shame. Not death but pretty similar to a death sentence.",
    "content": "The way \"life\" taught me about sex. Not my mom or dad, or a sex ed teacher. But life.\n\nLet's keep in mind that as humans we have an innate instinct to procreate.\n\nMy dad used to babysit me while my mom would go to work. He would put Asian music videos on in the living room and I would sing and dance to the songs all day long. I was 4. I was a sociable outspoken singing daddy's girl and I loved people because they would dote on me. What I'm really trying to say here is, at 4, I could recognize humans and human beings.\n\nMy dad took me over to his buddy's house. His buddy had two sons. One was about 7 and the other son was about 4 as well. While he and his buddies were hanging out downstairs, the older boy (7) showed me a book his dad had of naked people in all sorts of sexual positions, kind of like a Kama Sutra. He proceeded to usher me into a closet and took off all my clothes. My dad found me naked in the closet and helped me put all my clothes back on and we went home.\n\nAt around 5 years old, I woke up one morning and looked around. My little brother was sleeping in a separate bed in the same room as me. As you know and as I have mentioned above, I loved watching TV because of the music videos, and because of Barney and other things I would watch on TV. So this somber morning, I woke up, walked to my parents room and they were sleeping and I didn't want to wake them up. I walked back to my room where my brother was sleeping. We had a TV in our room and laying around on the floor were a VHS tapes. So I picked one up and popped it in. It was a porn tape. I remembered the naked people from the book that one kid had showed me and this porn tape had the same people. Naked and actively doing things. I somehow knew it was bad. So I turned down the volume, and I watched the whole thing instead of taking out the VHS. Let's just say, curiosity killed the cat and I was the very curious kitten.\n\nThen around the same year, at 5 years old, I was molested by my uncle. He was living in the same house as us in the basement. It happened (to my memory) one time and one time only. I knew what had happened to me the moment it happened. I knew something bad had happened to me, and I knew what sex was but I just didn't know the exact words for what everything was.\n\nThat is my 7-layor carrot cake story. Not exactly 7 layers but it just seems that bad things of a sexual nature kept making its way into my very short life and I came out on the other side too knowing, and too knowledgable way too soon. Every day I wish I had had the chance to be innocent and to be trusting of others and of people. I wish I had the chance to be a happy-go-lucky kid unburdened. But I was denied that. I grew up with no friends at all because of the amount of guilt I felt. The fact I understood sex at such a young age, and being molested, it was like an awkward secret I just kept inside. But secrets weight on you. Even if you don't think they do. It's a physical manifestation and I was not the beautiful child I always wished I was. I was dark, and small, and always was a little heavier than other girls. Because of all those reasons, I still have no friends, I have never made a friend. I still have extremely low self-esteem paired with a high body count.\n\nI'm just not normal. It feels this way at all times. I always stick to myself and I never look anyone in the eye. The shame.\n\nI also want to note, to anybody that was raised around too many males. Just don't. It's not safe for any parent with a small female child to be around that many men/males all at once and even if you \"trust\" them I would say you should always have a considerable amount of doubt and remove your child from danger or harm.",

    "title": "My partner is completely irresponsible with money and I'm considering breaking up",
    "content": "I apologize in advance for any grammar/spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.For context: me (27F) and my bf (25M) have been in a relationship for 5 years and living together in my father's house for 4 (in my country living costs are really high so it's pretty common to still stay with your parents beyond your 20's).At the end of last year my bf decided he needed a new phone for posting content (tiktok and reels) since his current phone's camera wasn't good and his career (gym instructor/ personal trainer) could use a boost from social media. While I agreed that a new phone with a better camera would help and I knew that he had saved some money, I asked him to wait a little longer (1 month or 2) before making any impulsive puchases since I was unemployed at the time and that money could be used for any emergencies.Well, he disregarded everything I said and decided to buy the phone anyway, and to make a long story short, it was a scam in wich he lost almost $800. To say I was disappointed is an understatement because i told him before, that even though the money was his and he could use it any way he wanted, the shop was really suspicious and it was better to buy from an official store if he was going to spend that much in a phone.It was really frustrating but I tried to help him contact his bank to see if there was anything we could do and to my surprise they refund almost half of the money, but my happiness was short lived because the very next day he fell for another scam and lost both the recovered money plus $300 ($250 from his account and $50 from mine). I was livid at this point, the car had broken down (another $600 expense), we had no way to pay our share of the bills plus the repair costs and he had to ask for money from his mother (bless her) to solve everything, but we survived.Well, now I'm employed and things were better until yesterday when he told me he was thinking again about buying the phone, to wich I told him: \"no way, not right now\", since we're not completely stable yet to spend that much money and I thought he would be at least a bit more mindful since we're still paying for his poor decisions from last year and we barely have money for bills, but he didn't want to listen to my reasoning, kept justifying why he needed it and I'm sure he'll buy it even though he knows that if he does that I'll have to cover his share of house expenses and I'm honestly mentally and emotionally exhausted, I feel like he isn't my partner anymore, just an oversized toddler and it's draining me.For additional context: he's been betting his money on soccer games and although he wins most of them, last week he almost lost all of the grocery money :)Our currency is not USD, so those are all approximate values.If you survived my ranting, thank you for reading everything.",

    "title": "I'm so cripplingly lonely at 21 I genuinely can't take it anymore",
    "content": "When I was a kid, I used to stand and watch the other kids play and I remember the deep longing I had to join in but couldn't because I'm autistic. I went to school and had no idea how to make friends so I just followed people I knew around. Dropped out at 12 and stayed isolated in my empty white bedroom because I felt too undeserving to decorate it. My birthdays have been filled with screaming and crying and shouting at my mom who would insist on forcing me to celebrate and buying a birthday cake I would force myself to eat and then make myself sick afterwards. I see no point in celebrating 21 years of pure suffering every single day. What am I meant to do? Have an awkward gathering with my shitty dysfunctional chaotic family?? There is so much I want to do and so many things I want to see but I can't because I am so lonely. No one understands the agony of waking up alone and going to sleep alone. I wasted 2 years of someone elses life in a weird half abusive relationship because I forced them to date me and promised I'd be a different person when I knew that I couldn't; I just didnt want to go back to being alone again. I made them aggressive and hateful towards me which is no wonder when I behave the way I do.\n\nI mourn the years of my life that I have lot. I feel sick with grief when I see kids playing on their bikes or with their friends or teenagers just existing. I didn't even get to leave my house once. the first time i walked down my road by myself was when i was 19. I'm so pitiful I hate it so much. i am in actual agony i cant take it anymore",

    "title": "I was dumped yesterday but I had been thinking about the breakup for a year, it hurts so much",
    "content": "I (25F) was in a relationship (25M) for almost 2 years. It started off very very well, very dreamy and romantic where I told my friends that I had found the guy I had been looking for all this while etc etc. 2 months after our first date, i lost my job and i realised how emotionally unavailable he was, because all he cared about was his job and his work stress - he didnt know how to empathise with me or support me or help me out (for context the city we live and work in is his hometown) but i thought probably my expectations are a bit much because we are so early in the relationship. But i have known since aug 2023 that this isnt right for me. I am going to bulletise the problems:\n\n• spending time: despite living in the same city, he only saw me once a week, fri-sat, which i initially found weird but adjusted around it. However, because he is an insane workaholic, we didnt do anything special, just stayed in. There were no date nights. When we went out on date nights, i planned all of them, i initiated them, and i convinced him. I wanted to spend more time with him, see him more, but that he told was not possible because it messes with his routines. A lot of his habits and ideas of how we should be were straight up selfish, inconsiderate and disreputable tbh.\n\n• A twisted definition of ambition, different definitions of meaning of life: He has a well paying, reputable, steady job but he wants to start his own thing so that he is doing something “meaningful “ in life. What that means for us is insane working hours, no downtime, no quality time no matter how much i tried to adjust. When breaking up, he said the kind of relationship i want works for people who have job stability and dont want to do much outside of that - and i disagree so much. All i wanted was someone to spend my weekends with, have that quality time. Isnt that the bare minimum? Also, if he cant do this, how will he ever be in a relationship? For me, i am super ambitious and have built a career in a foreign country from the ground up, but for me ambition means being good at job and liking it enough to login every morning to do a good job. Meaning of life doesnt come from the job as i work for the paycheck, but meaning comes from travel, experiences, relationships and friendships.\n\n• His routine: he was obsessed with his routines. Wake up at 6, sleep at 10, gym at 7am, work 8-9 kinda guy. Which is ok, routines are good, but what that meant was he only saw me fridays, and called me daily 9:30-10 (he didnt call me initially at all and we foughjt a lot to get here). Anything outside of that was not possible. This didnt emotionally sit right with me because i couldnt trust, depend, rely on him. In fact, when we were breaking up, he told me he calculated (????) the amount of time he spends with me or talking to me, and thats about 12h/week, which is not possible for him right now. What this translated in my head was, i am not worth the 12h/week\n\n• his spending habits: he lives at home with his parents, earns a LOT more than me, and saves and invests all that he earns to an obsessive degree. He has enough to retire rn, and i respect that. But what that meant for us was, he was extremely stingy and calculative. We split stuff but he just wasnt happy spending - on date nights, dinners, gifts. Heck, he even calculated the transport cost from his home to mine. He even liked to lecture me about how i should spend money, when i already live below my means because i have a loan. He also said that he is saving enough for the both of us, but that never gave me confidence because i saw that as an attack on my independence - i cant live on the money he has earned or saved because it is not mine, he will always reinforce that, and i will have a lesser of a say in how we spend that money. He definitely wanted a prenup if we were to marry which i dont mind, but his general attitude towards money and being too calculative wasnt reassuring\n\nBasically, these were long-standing problems which i identified very early on in the relationship and communicated why i find them problematic. However, after each time i communicated he gave me something new to cling my hope on to, and i hoped things would get better because i genuinely wanted this to work. They never got better, we kept on arguing, until yesterday when he asked the question and i agreed - i felt a bit blindsided tbh because he never told me he is thinking about it too. I guess there are 2 lessons for me:\n\nTo be in a relationship and live in the present and not with the person’s potential and what it could be\n\nTo not be so obsessed with the idea of relationships and building a life and the feeling of home with someone that i keep putting up with shit\n\nHaving said all of this, the feeling of loss is immense and i still miss him and have been bawling my eyes out, when it was me who had been considering breaking up for the past year and i know in my heart he is not the one for me.",
