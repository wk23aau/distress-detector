"t3_1j6o1h7","Home?","I’ve been struggling a lot since I got back from my tour, and I don’t really talk about it, but it’s been tough. Everything I saw and went through—it doesn’t just go away. My body feels wrecked, my mind’s exhausted, and some days I don’t know how to deal with it.

What made it even harder was coming home and being met with yelling and awful things being said to me. It felt like I was a kid again, coming home from school and getting yelled at. I was already carrying so much, and instead of support, it felt like I was just being attacked.

It might sound silly, but it felt like everyone else got the care and support for their service, but not me. Like I didn’t matter the same way.

I’ve always felt like others got that kind of support from their parents—getting called sweet things like “my marine” and having that care. It’s hard not to notice the difference, especially since I’m a girl.","2","0"
"t3_1j6cogp","It is our anniversary and i know this relationship is done","I just know it. I haven’t been happy for a while but decided to put in the effort and work for us to make it. Because I love her and it has been 2 years now.

I planned for us to spend the day together to celebrate our anniversary. I told her beforehand that I would appreciate it for her not to book the day full with her friends.

This morning she gets up with me, which is unusual so i asked her about it. Not judging, not accusatory, just curious why she decided not to sleep in today. Her response was snapping at me that i had told her i wanted to spend the day with her. Now she makes the effort to get up and ready and as a response i am asking questions. I was genuinely baffled because i was merely asking and as a response i get that.

This isn’t the first time she is snapping at me. She has done this in increasing frequency lately and I can’t do this anymore. I have been unhappy for a while because of a myriad of things. This here was my last straw. This relationship isn’t worth fighting for anymore","14","4"
"t3_1j5r88o","Unauthorized Whataburger visit late in the evening","Last night I went out to do some Instacart deliveries. My wife really wanted me to take her phone and do one on her account as well, so I had both of our phones. After making one delivery on her account and one delivery on my account, I was heading home and was a little munchy. My wife had no way to contact me (unless she borrowed another family member's phone), and no way to trace my location, so I gave in.

I knew Whataburger was open 24 hours a day, and they even keep their lobby open, not just the drivethru. Against my wife's firm directive, I ordered Whataburger online, then went into the building and ATE it. And to top it all off, I didn't even confess to her upon my arrival at home, nor did she detect the distinct burgery smell. That's right, this is now the second day and she still doesn't know of my treachery. In our relationship, this is unheard of. Unprecedented even.","295","21"
"t3_1j6iwr6","My life is never going to get better,neither am I.","PS:I apologize if some things don't make sense as english isn't my first language!!

I'm not sure that anything will genuinely get better.I feel as if I'm a rotting corpse. I'm a 15 year old girl,it may sound childish and dramatic saying this at such a young age,but let me give a backstory.

I've had extreme trouble socialising my whole life. I was a very sensitive child,people could barely speak to me or crack jokes with me without me starting to cry.Regardless,I did have a few friends as a child,but it wasn't the best experience. I couldn't handle insults and staying with people for a longer period of time,I much preferred to stay home and do my own thing,so of course people found me weird. The fact that I wasn't born beautiful didn't make this any better,""ugly"" was peoples favourite insult to use on me.

Once I started school,it became even worse.I still haven't learned to accommodate to people,but I was academically gifted,so people still came up to me,but mostly to help them with their work,aside from that I was bullied and I've never managed to stand up for myself.I would simply sit through all of that,I would say my prayers at night hoping it would eventually become better.

Eventually my mother said she will leave to a different city to find a better job,she didn't pay much attention to me in the first place,it was mostly my grandma taking care of me,so I though this was an opportunity to get closer to her and get a better school life, so I begged her to take me as well and said I could continue school there,but God little did I know it was going to get much worse.

I got bullied a thousand times worse at my new school,and at home there was nobody to comfort me this time.She got a boyfriend,who was and still is a horrible person.He sexually,physically and verbally abused me.She knew but couldn't care less as he had lots of money,plus she was already neglectful,so what could have I expected from her. It was simply too much for me to handle,I started skipping school every single chance I got,if I got sent forcefully by my mom once the teachers started sending her messages,I would simply wait for an opportunity to run away.It somehow never got taken to court,for 4 years I was skipping as long as It was still possible to pass the year with such a big number of absences.Ive developed a sh addiction as well.I would burn,cut,scratch myself,whatever option was available at the moment.

I started causing a lot of trouble as well,I won't go into detail on this one,but it was mostly to have some form of control over my abusers, to make them feel as shitty as I did,so to say.Eventually they got tired of me and sent me to a psychiatrist which gave me some sertraline (I was 13 around this time) and the psychiatrist suggested to move to a new school. They refused to check out another school and just sent me back to my old town.

Now that's where I am.I got back on track and I'm at the top of my class once again,but of course I am still given cruel treatment from my peers. My other relatives are the only people who don't hate me. I am at an extreme form of social alienation.I have no friends.Not even one (in real life) ,I spend all of my time online,drawing & reading books or drinking. I am severely traumatised,I have severe OCD,anorexia,ARFID and Im in such deep derealization,I also have a history of psychosis and I am unable to get treatment. (I've also gotten told I fit the criteria for BPD but due to my age there isn't a possibility to get diagnosed).I also have a ton of health issues. And if I'm being honest,at this point I'm not even sure if I truly wish to get better or to make friends.I hate people and they hate me. I don't speak much either,I only speak once it's necessary,I hate doing it anyway.

I do love spending my time daydreaming though,Im a maladaptive daydreamer and I spend up to 10 hours just daydreaming.I love daydreaming that I am a beautiful and kind girl living an adventurous life with lots of meaningful connections,because Irl I feel hopeless,I feel that I will be alone for the rest of my life.I have no dreams for the future and remembering the fact that I have school makes me wanna commit suicide,but I would never do this to my relatives or to my bestfriend.(though the urge to try once again is STRONG) I sometimes wonder if Ive committed some terrible crimes in my past life and if this life is a punishment for that.  </3 I have no clue why I have always gotten bullied either,but my best guess is that unattractive girls are seen as a societal embarrassment,plus the fact that I dressed and looked ""too weird"" for them.","4","0"
"t3_1j6sqzk","Years ago, I had a close call with a motorcyclist. Now I can't stop worrying about it. Am I overthinking?","I recently remembered an event from the past, and I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. It happened a long time ago, so it’s possible that what I remember is not exactly what actually happened.

A few years ago, in 2022, when I was 14, I was coming home from school with some friends when an idiot thought it would be funny to open my backpack and ring a doorbell without telling me. Immediately afterward, everyone started running. I quickly zipped up my backpack and, for some reason I don’t remember, I decided to cross the road to the other sidewalk instead of running forward. Maybe it was because there were too many people in front of me, making it difficult to run quickly—I don’t know. I really don’t remember.

The thing is, as soon as I stepped onto the road, an older man on a motorcycle appeared right in front of me, just a few meters away. I moved away as fast as I could and got back onto the sidewalk where I had been before. I think I remember the driver swerving a little when he got scared after seeing me (though I’m not entirely sure about this). I didn’t hear any noise that would suggest the man had fallen, nor did I hear a scream of pain—just a “¡Me cago en la madre!” (which roughly means “For f***’s sake!” in Spanish), which I believe means he kept driving (I think).

The problem is that I don’t know if I started running once I stepped back onto the sidewalk, which could have prevented me from noticing an accident if it happened. But it’s more likely that I stayed still after stepping away from the road—at least long enough that I would have noticed if anything had happened. I’m not sure what exactly happened in that moment. It all happened so fast, and it’s been a few years since then.

When I saw the idiot who opened my backpack again, all he did was laugh. I guess he saw what happened in some way, and that’s why he made fun of me when we met again. Or maybe I told him about it, and then he started laughing—I don’t remember. I also seem to recall that I had two other friends behind me, on the other side of the road, and when they caught up with us, they were laughing too. If what I remember is correct, that would mean nothing actually happened.

I got home feeling like an idiot, but at no point did I think I might have caused an accident. I’ve walked through that area dozens of times since then, and while I wasn’t specifically looking, I never noticed any signs that an accident had happened. I also searched online for news from that year in my city, and I didn’t find anything similar to what I experienced. I never heard anyone mention that day again, which reinforces my belief that nothing actually happened.

I recently remembered this incident, and I think I’m becoming paranoid. I’m scared by the possibility that the man could have had a serious accident or that someone nearby might have been hurt, since it was a very busy area at that time, with lots of cars and many kids coming back from school. I’ve been really worried for the past few days, and I honestly feel bad about it.

Do you think I’m just being paranoid? I need someone to reassure me—I’m a bit scared.","1","0"
"t3_1j6snyp","I am so close to unleashing on my elderly mother.","I’m a woman in my 60s who for the bulk of my adult life has been able to keep and cultivate good relationships with friends, family, and coworkers. I have suffered off and on with depression and anxiety that I felt was bad enough to seek treatment for since my mid 40s. I had no shame in admitting this as it was a difficult time for me given perimenopause, a stressful job, kids heading off to college, etc.

Things really began unraveling for me about a year ago. I had gained a bunch of weight, felt like crap, was facing some unexpected backlash from my two adult kids whom I had raised alone and were each facing their own separate personal crises simultaneously, was helping my widowed, aging mother navigate life alone, and a second new and stronger wave of “ideology” was evolving.

I started therapy for the first time in my life and leaned heavily into journaling out my feelings, as I have a love of writing and my therapist felt it would be helpful for me. I dove right in to a shadow work journal with writing prompts that ask you to relate negative thoughts and feelings you are having now to your childhood, in order to heal your inner child. I have written at length on my memories from early childhood and nothing came forward that I hadn’t pondered before, so no big revelations this time… except for my anger.

After a year of processing these events, poking at my anger, examining every piece of it through the lens of this tired and wounded old woman, and having the entire world bursting into flames exponentially more every day, I am at my breaking point. In the past year I have lost my 3 friends to the above mentioned “ideology”, then most of my family, and now, because I am so sad and really suffering from the effects of anger about not only the abuse and neglect I experienced in my past, but the trauma of the problems my entire continent is facing, I’ve got my mother in my face telling me she doesn’t like how it makes her feel that consequences are happening as a result of her actions. Nobody is blaming her for anything, merely mentioning they are losing their job. Or that they are struggling mentally. Or that they’re boycotting hyper consumerism. Or that they’re scared. Or that they feel compelled now to join this movement or become anti-whatever to make a statement and support people who’ve been hurt. She doesn’t like feeling that feeling that comes up when she has to wonder if people actually know her leanings, and maybe even think her actions are causing harm to them. It’s her own thought process guilting her, and outing her at the same time.

It’s so hard telling this without using certain words that are crucial to the story, but hopefully I’ve avoided the flags that will get this story banned.

Now, I find myself on the verge of lashing out at my 84 year old mother the next time she berates me (I see it coming) because I don’t know if I’ll be able to bite my tongue. I carried for 60 years the memory of her attempted suicide in front of me as a 3 year old, where just before losing consciousness, instructed me how to use a telephone to call for help. She doesn’t think I remember. I protected my mother from her own shame of her daughter carrying this secret knowledge all her life, while enduring beatings from her 2nd husband, repeated emotional betrayals from her, being called a slut every day of my teen life. I was shamed mercilessly for my own emotional problems growing up, and was told I’m not good enough constantly. My own suicidal thoughts at 13 were claimed by her as embarrassing, and would make her look bad. I was never allowed to feel my anger and it caused me to make some really poor choices regarding relationships in my life.

Well that rage has come to life and I think if I express it the way it deserved to be expressed all along, it might kill her.","1","4"
"t3_1j6skca","I’m terrible to my mom","I was raised by my grandma with my twin brother and I really only feel a connection with my brother, I’m always so short and bothered with my other family who is trying hard to be a part of my life but I hate to say it I feel like I don’t need them so I simply don’t think about them or want to be around them, even my grandma. My twin is the only one I care about and they can all tell, I know it breaks my moms heart when I’m so short and insincere but at this point that is my natural reaction and thought process. I don’t even think about my dad lmao.","1","0"
"t3_1j6kk2o","I feel numb","I just need to vent. Seek advice. I’ve been seeing this guy for a little over a year. I’ve fallen completely head over heals for this man. I have expressed these emotions to him. I have told him. How I feel. Each and every time I’ve beeen met with the fact that he’s not ready for anything serious. Mind you this man chased me first. He wanted me first….Flash forward we have had so many ups and downs. Where he pulls away and disappears on me. I have asked him upfront if he’s seeing or having sex with anyone else. He tells me each time that no. He just has a low sex drive. I promise you me and this man have only been intimate a handful of times. Mind you just last week he was posted here. Nothing bad was said about him. But it only confirmed my suspicions. That he was infact seeing other woman. Yet i can’t let this man go. I know i need too. I know it’s only hurting me. Well…..Now I’m laying next to him as we speak. His back turned to me. After we have done the dead…. So to speak… i haven’t been at his place for a little over 5 months. First thing i noticed when I walked in… squishmellow. A valentines one at that…. He explained he bought it….. overall i know what I need todo. I just neeeded a place to say it. To vent.","3","1"

"t3_1j6mwea","I understand why people in the west operate on individualism TW: su*cide mention","I always hear a lot of critique about how the western world is too individualist. Well, I feel like I completely understand why now. I’m in Canada for reference.

I have been at my current job almost 3 years now. I have been on contract that entire time. I’ve been fighting to get permanent but no positive movement yet. Anyway, the last position I got was a 2 year contract-which comes to an end this summer. I feel I’ve been a positive addition to the team. The team was short staffed (is short staffed, even now) and I was able to help out with the work load. I’m a quick learner and pretty efficient, and I’ve definitely shown that on our extremely busy days, or days where extremely short staffed (we often have people falling ill or someone is on vacation). With my contract end coming up I asked my boss if there was a future for me. I have also been looking for work-with no luck-in preparation.

Well, this week she told me the chances of me being kept on were slim to none. I cried at my lunch break. Hell, I had panic attacks and cried before all this. I have been trying to find work and it’s rejection after rejection or just not hearing back at all. Even jobs I’m more than qualified for aren’t responding.

What has really hurt and frustrated me, is the apathy of those around me. Friends, coworkers I thought liked me, even family to an extent, could all care less. “Oh damn that sucks. Anyway.”

And I 100% understand why. Why would anyone, even people who like me, give two shits about me? They have their own partners, families, finances, etc. to worry about. People don’t give two shits what happens to anyone around them when they have their own lives. Someone they know could go homeless and it’d just be a “damn how tragic! They were a nice person. Anyway, what’s for dinner?”

I’ve been bullied at jobs to the point of being suicidal. People saw-and looked the other way. Dont want to involve themselves. I’ve complained to bosses/supervisors about workplace bullies only to go ignored. I’ve been chastised for speaking up. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. No one cares-they can like you, but they’re there to get their bag and go home.

I see this a lot in Canada with the housing crisis. People who own their homes have a “fuck you, I got mine” attitude. They don’t care about the rest of us, especially younger folk, who will never be able to afford even a modest apartment. They got their house, they got their family, fuck everyone else. The homeless are just an inconvenience/nuisance to them.

I’ve tried in my life to have a community mindset with helping others, caring, I always would send fitting job postings to unemployed friends who were looking to try and help out, tried to be there for others. No more. Never again. Not a single person around me would give a fuck if I died tomorrow because understandably, they have their own shit to worry about. Only people I can see caring about me being gone are my mom and dad.

I have fought my entire life to try and be better. Grew up with abusive step parents. Didn’t grow up wealthy. Pretty much everything I did after 18 was my own-rent, schooling (with help of loans, which I am also paying off solo), finding jobs, figuring shit out, etc.

I’m done. My hope for finding work in time before my contract ends is extremely low. Even with experience and schooling, companies dont want to hire, or they want to pay you minimum wage for skilled work. And if they can’t get a canadian to go that low they’ll find a TFW who will take below minimum wage (story for another time). Idk what will happen to me but I know that I will not care about anyone else again. Im gonna worry about me only. Good luck to everyone else.","2","2"
"t3_1j6roh8","I’m a culturally assimilated Hispanic, and I see more people struggling because they aren’t. Does assimilation really offer an advantage?","I’ve been thinking a lot about how cultural assimilation impacts opportunities, especially in the workplace. I was raised in a predominantly Caucasian church group in the Midwest/South, where my mom worked multiple jobs, and members of the church helped babysit me. Because of that environment, I never learned Spanish, and I became a native English speaker without an accent. My name and skin color make it obvious that I’m Hispanic, but everything else like my speech, my interests, even the way I present myself is very much in line with mainstream American culture.

I never really thought much about this until I started noticing a pattern in my jobs. I’ve had no issue moving up. I’ve always been recognized for my abilities, and promotions have come naturally. But people I know people who are just as educated and capable tell me they’re being overlooked for management positions or even treated differently at work. Most of them have thick Hispanic accents, and many were raised in predominantly Hispanic communities, even if they were born here.

I live in a primarily Caucasian area, and it’s become clear to me that how you present as Hispanic plays a massive role in workplace opportunities. Whitewashed Hispanics, whether they grew up like me or are half Hispanic with “white” first names, seem to have a much easier time getting ahead than first-generation or immigrant Hispanics who retain strong cultural ties.

I don’t think this is talked about enough. People love to say that discrimination is just about race, but I think it’s also about how comfortable people feel with you. If you fit the dominant culture and don’t challenge their perception of what’s “normal,” you get a pass. If you don’t, you hit a wall.

Has anyone else noticed this?","1","2"
"t3_1j6rl5a","I don’t know what to do!! And I need advice","I (27) father of three lives alone with my three children. Thanksgiving month of last year the mother and I got into a heated argument which led to a back and forth (physically) the most I did was push her to get some space to walk away, because I truly don’t believe in hitting women( unless it’s life or death). Before that even happened, two days prior to this she was already putting her hands on me which led to a big bruise on my back. And a long scar going from my neck down to my back. Once I pushed her away from me she instantly called the cops and said I was the one being belligerent and she wanted me removed from the house. The police arrive and she!! Yes she showed them the camera footage of what had been going on and ofc she was deemed the main aggressor and was taken to jail. Once she got out “apparently” she has a court order to stay off of the property and to have no contact with me. Her name is still on the lease so she helps out by paying her half of the rent and once a week will ask if the kids need anything( she has a friend that reaches out for her). She currently has no where to live but she stays with a friend and still has her job as a nurse and is in school during the day. She gave me the option of getting a hotel room to get the kids because it’s going on four months since she has seen or talked to any of them. I thought the hotel option was a good idea and I even offered to pay for half the expenses. But it never happens because she either to busy with school and work. I would like too take her to court so she can at least help me by getting them and keeping them for a week. I have managed to do what I can with childcare and anything else the kids need so I can work my self and I have managed to do this alone. What do I need to do to get her to court so we can have our time with the kids individually? I understand she is in a situation but I shouldn’t have to suffer because of it. I hope this doesn’t sound bitter on my end but we are not together anymore so she is going to have to start riding her storms out alone now. Im not complaining about taking care of my kids because I love them dearly and I don’t find anything manly about complaining about something you helped bring into this world but I need a break some times and I’m only asking for a week.","0","0"
"t3_1j6r9ab","My one attempt at healthy communication ended horribly and I feel like the worst friend ever","I thought that I was avoiding bottling it up and actually doing the right thing because I was communicating a relatively minor (on my end) issue early on, but it turns out that by not saying anything immediately, I’ve basically reinforced their worst fears about themself. They’re now scared to talk too much to anyone about anything, and now any mention of the show makes them feel sick. They said they feel like a bad friend, and part of them feels lied to because I always said it was alright how much they talked about it - but it wasn’t a lie. It really was alright, the job interview was literally the only incident that made me feel not great about it. I kept apologizing because I never wanted them to feel like that around me, but they’re still really hurt and now we’ve been taking some space from each other for about four days now.","1","0"

"t3_1j6gvv6","my girlfriend makes me feel crazy","this is a stupid throwaway vent, i just need to get this off my chest. i don’t expect anyone to see this i just need to talk.

my (25M) girlfriend (24F) makes me feel like i’m crazy. any time i show a negative emotion, it’s met with annoyance and frustration. or with a look of bewilderment like it came out of nowhere or there was no lead-up.

don’t get me wrong. i love her, and i’m certain she loves me. we have been through some incredibly hard times and supported each other through them all. but i can’t help feeling like she doesn’t care or want to consider how i’m feeling in a given situation. every time we argue (be it something big like family or small like a movie) she continuously hammers the fact that i’m getting defensive, or that it’s not that deep. that i’m thinking too hard into things. i can’t tell her she’s wrong about something without her thinking i’m fully against her. she’s hardly ever conceded a point unless i compromise with her that she is partly right.

i’ve brought this up with her several times, and there’s never been any concession. any recognition of how what she says and how she says things might rub me the wrong way. she doesn’t apologize or acknowledge what she says as pointed or hurtful. only discards it as not being what she meant. she tells me that i interpreted it wrong, and that i misunderstood her. she outlines what she meant in great detail. and sometimes i can tell that it’s not the the truth. she’ll go as far as telling me how badly it makes her feel that i interpreted what she said negatively.

i feel constantly contrary, or like i can’t do anything but agree.

when she’s angry, or annoyed, i need to act accordingly. i WANT to act accordingly. i want her to feel listened to, i want to sympathize with her feelings. i don’t pinpoint where she is mistaken because ultimately the nitpicky parts don’t matter, it matters how i made her feel. i don’t ever want her to feel like something is in her head or not real, or like her feelings are wrong and something to dismiss.

if i brought this up with her again. she would try proving me wrong with things i’ve said that upset her. or tell me how much it hurts that i thought of her in this way.

i don’t know where i’m getting at with this. i love our relationship. i love what we have and i don’t want anything major about the way we interact with each other to change. i dont want her to walk on eggshells around me for fear of upsetting me like im a child that cant handle an argument. i can, i just can’t handle it being one-sided, or with special rules i have to follow that she doesn’t. i just want her to be kinder, or at least Fair. i guess idk.","4","1"
"t3_1j6l8oo","Friendless in college","I'm an introverted person and prefer small gatherings to large gettogethers. But ever since I've joined college, I've not been able to find a friend group. I was close friends with one of my roommates but since I have shifted to off campus accommodation, I've not seen much of her as I used to and she seems to have adjusted well without me. And my mental and physical health got fucked because of severe lack of sleep, partly because of stress and because of my other roommate refusing to switch off the lights. I have fully recovered from my sickness, but am still struggling despite my parents finding a place nearby to stay with me. It seems like nobody except my parents and school friends value me, and even they live such fulfilling lives and are not struggling to make social connections like me. I feel there is something wrong with me because friendly conversations with people in class never progress further into a full fledged friendships, it's as if I'm invisible in people's eyes until I talk to them, and then they go back to their friends and ignore me like usual. I know this isn't the worst situation to be crying about, but it feels awfully isolating. And I was so absorbed in my own mental health struggles that I forgot to check on my best friend, and I feel bad for that as well. But it felt like she had moved on frm our friendship as we hardly saw each other and she would not attend our weekly calls (with her and another of my best friends). It seems like everyone has better friends than me and is having fun with friends but I don't have people like that.","2","4"
"t3_1j6uyfb","The delivery for my mobile phone tripod mount got delayed.","OK, so a bit of background. In college, I took a video journalism class as part of my major. As part of this, I got a tripod and a mobile phone mount for said tripod.

Fast-forward 4 years. I've graduated (December of 2022 to be exact) and am working full-time. I occasionally put my phone in the mount and set it on my bedside table to watch things in bed. this past week, the tripod mount broke. No problem, it's like $12.

I ordered another one off Amazon. It was supposed to arrive yesterday. As you can probably guess from this post's title and the fact I'm even posting at all, it did not. It was delayed to Monday. I had it shipped to the rental office for my housing complex, which isn't open on weekends.

Now, here's the thing, my friends: This alone wouldn't upset me enough to post this. It sucks, don't get me wrong, but these things do happen. However, Amazon showed that the package was out for delivery and the truck was in my neighborhood.

Just needed to vent.","0","0"
"t3_1j6kz1f","im so exhausted","hi, this post is going to sound insane but im tired & ive had like three hours of sleep over the last two days

im 15 and my mum was sick for the entirety of last year. long story short, she lost a LOT of weight and she needs to put on weight. other then that shes fine, shes able to do stuff & she has energy but im still very very worried that if she loses weight she'll become critically ill. we've been to multiple doctors and theyve reassured her shes fine but she needs to put on weight, it still worries me. shes gained weight but shes gaining it veeeery slowly

the problem is that we had a cyclone recently & she was under a LOT of stress. we're not at home rn so she cant weigh herself but i am so so fucking stressed & i cant help but wonder if shes lost even more weight. i dont have a dad or any support, im just on my own.

it feels like everytime i make any progress or my life seems to get even slightly better it all comes crashing down again. its been like this for years & i am EXHAUSTED.

i really dont have the strength to do this anymore. this has been going on for an entire year & it feels like every day is blending together and it keeps getting worse and worse. it feels like im losing my mind. i just want her to be healthy & get better, im so so exhausted of this. its horrible but im so so worried shes just gonna drop dead. i dont know what to do anymore, i really dont","2","0"
"t3_1j5vn09","I was regularly abused and my son knew about it","I was a mess following my mother's death. It messed with my sleep and I was on sleeping pills. My husband used to work in shifts. Our son, 16 at the time, lived with us. He was a very normal kid. We never even treated him any wrong.

Few months ago I stopped taking the pills. My husband was on night shift and son's friend was staying over. I woke up in the middle of the night to his friend with his hands on me. I was scared and screamed. I asked him what he was doing and he couldn't answer. I was expecting my son to come in after I screamed but he didnt.

I went into the living room and called. He came out pretending he didn't hear me or knew what was happening. I just knew he was lying and he eventually confessed that he knew and that his friend pressured him. I was getting raped for almost a year and he said nothing. I didnt tell my husband because I dont know how he will react. I just told him never to contact my son again and threw him out. I havent directly talked to my son since.

"t3_1j6elyg","I thought my boyfriend’s aunt in law was amazing… until I realized she’s a narcissist.","I (29F) have been dating my boyfriend (33M) for 13 years and was really close to his Aunt-in-Law (Aunt Ana). She was like a sister, a friend, even a mother figure and I love her so much... But over time, my bf and I noticed she thrived on gossip, twisting stories, and stirring drama.

The Pattern of Manipulation:

Aunt Sarah constantly gossiped about other AIL(Aunt-In-Law) pitting them against each other.

She spread private conversations that my boyfriend and I had with her.

She was weirdly jealous when AIL Carla got a new car and ignored her.

She twisted the story to make the other AIL look bad so that my boyfriend and I would always be close to her instead of the other AIL.

I and my Bf finally saw her for who she really was a narcissist who thrives on stirring drama.

Now, we’re done.

We were naive to believe everything Aunt Ana told us about other people. We keeping our distance, but the damage is done.

The worst part? I feel powerless. I know she’s been badmouthing me, and I have no receipts to defend myself.

"t3_1j6jf69","Feeling like a second-tier friend, and I don’t know what to do about it.","Okay, so I’ve been feeling some type of way about this for a hot minute, and I just need to rant. Idk if I’m overthinking or if I’m actually onto something, so here goes.

I have these two friends, right? They’ve been besties since nursery, and I joined them in 7th grade. And listen, I never had an issue with that—I knew their bond was stronger, and that was fine. But recently, it’s been feeling like I’m just... there. Like, I’m included, but not really included, y’know?

One of them is dating this guy, and their relationship has been a damn rollercoaster. Long story short, dude was dramatic as hell, dumped her over some misunderstanding, then ran around spreading shit that made her look bad. Back then, our whole group was like, “Nah, he’s trash, you deserve better.” Fast forward a few months, and suddenly they’re treating him like he’s some god-tier boyfriend. Now he’s “so sweet,” “so caring,” “such a gentleman.” Like girl, be so for real.

Now, I’m also dating someone, and every time I bring him up, I get the driest reactions possible. “Oh, he’s nice.” Thanks??? That’s it??? Meanwhile, they’re out here writing a whole PhD thesis about how amazing her man is, even after he did her dirty?? The math is NOT mathing.

And it’s not just that. Even when I ask them basic questions, they either leave me on seen or reply two days later with the most half-assed response ever. But somehow, they have the time to be active af on Instagram, sending me reels??? Calls? LMAO, those don’t even exist anymore. And yeah, they’ve never been big on calling, but even when they promise they’ll call, they never do. And before anyone says “Maybe they’re just busy with college?”—nah, they have time for our other friends, just not me.

And yeah, I’ve tried bringing it up before. The problem? They’ll act normal for like, a week, and then go right back to the same cycle. Atp, I don’t even see the point in saying anything anymore.

Oh, and the cherry on top? I recently got a pink rose from my boyfriend, and I was so happy because I genuinely prefer pink roses over red ones. I shared it with them, and the reaction was so bland. Like, no hype, no excitement—just a casual “Oh, that’s nice.” I know if it were one of them, the energy would’ve been completely different.

Idk, am I tripping, or does this sound off to anyone else? Cuz it’s kinda giving “you’re an option, not a priority” energy, and I don’t know how to feel about that.

(Your opinions are welcome, and if you have any recommendations on how to handle this (or just anything in general), I’d love to hear them.)","2","0"

"t3_1j5ij2t","I wish I had ignored his suicide note","TLDR; I am a sex worker and I let a client get too obsessed. He threatened suicide when I ended things with him and I went to the police on the off chance he was serious. It turned out to just be another ploy to try and get me to talk to him.

Let's preface this with I am an independent sex worker. I do in person sex work by the hour and it's my job because I enjoy it and it gives me a lot of financial security.

My best friend, ""Celia"", also does sex work and we share notes about the job, and even have the same clients on occasion.

She met ""John"" first. John is an obese 300lb man, early 30s, and a high maintenance client. He was very recently divorced because he cheated on his high school sweetheart wife with another friend from high school. He left his wife, only to have his new girlfriend leave him about a month later for another man. Why did he cheat on his wife? Because she had ""gained so much weight that he no longer found her attractive"" (I saw photos of her, she was barely overweight. He on the other hand nearly doubled his weight since they got married).

John is a home inspector for an insurance company. He makes good money by inspecting a high volume of homes, but part of the job is using all the data collected to write personalized reports on each home inspection. When John was married, his wife did the reports for him (this was illegal because the information is supposed to be confidential, but he was able to get away with it because they lived together and she used his work PC to help him out).

So he left his wife, then his girlfriend of two months left him. He was desperate to get her back any which way, and knew she needed money, so he offered to pay her to do the reports for him (which worked out because his wife was no longer willing to do them). He figured out a way to log into his work from her PC, trained her up, and used his position as her boss to make her spend as much time with him as possible so he could potentially win her back (he would only ever pay her in person, for example, and coerce her into spending hours with him before he paid her the money). This isn't important to the story, it just gives background information on his history of inappropriate relationships and manipulating women.

In the meantime, he started seeing escorts to fill the sexual void. Eventually he met Celia and very quickly fell into limerance. For the first time since his ex girlfriend left him, John had a new woman to obsess over. He shared his whole life story with Celia, texted her all the time, and visited her more often than he could afford. She found him exhausting to see (he had strangled dick syndrome from a porn addiction, and struggled to get off, but would urge her to keep trying). He talked constantly about himself, overshared about his childhood trauma, and would stay longer than he paid for, forcing her to have to kick him out each time. She set boundaries about him texting her so much and taking so much of her emotional energy, but he kept breaking them.

So she enlisted my help. I have a few more years experience under my belt, and felt confident that I could handle his neediness. After she talked me up, he agreed to meet me.

The appointment was a success. I was able to work around his strangled dick problem and he began to see us both regularly. But it became obvious that he was obsessive and inappropriate. He talked about Celia non-stop and shared personal details about their time together with me. He also shared private details about his ex-wife and ex-girlfriend.

When he saw Celia, he talked about me and overshared in a similar way.  It made her very uncomfortable and she set boundaries around it. He didn't abide by the boundaries, so she fired him.

He was devastated... But I was able to distract him and help him process the heartbreak. He felt betrayed by her, because she treated him as a client and he felt like he deserved better treatment. I gently defended her actions, but not so much that it would offend him.

By this point I was earning steady money seeing him, so I didn't want to risk jeopardizing that cash flow.

I could see that he needed the full girlfriend experience, so I gave it to him. He was very insecure so I often needed to reassure him that he could count on me, that I would be a stable person in his life, so long as he kept paying my rates for time together. I allowed him to take me to dinner off the clock occasionally, and texted him back on occasion (I didn't get triggered by his incessant texting in the same way as Celia).

It worked out pretty decently for a few months. I felt like I was meeting his needs, and he seemed happier and more stable. Unfortunately, my carefully set boundaries started to erode. He didn't see me as an escort anymore, he saw me as a sugar baby... Then as a girlfriend. He told me he loved me. Often. He started celebrating ""anniversaries"" for us and booking me for holidays.

I, too, found his company exhausting. The whining, the complaining, the bad decisions, the love bombing, the delusional thinking.... It started to be too much. I felt like I was wearing a thick mask while I was with him, forcing myself not to show my disgust. I hated the way he bragged about how much money he made, while breaking the rules to do it. I hated his ""nice guy"" syndrome and how entitled he felt to attention from women. I hated the way he would eat dairy despite being lactose intolerant. I hated the way he binged on McDonald's after eating a large dinner with bottomless cokes. I hated the way he touched me and kissed me. I hated the self obsession, and the victim mentality he had.

I couldn't stand his inability to take any personal accountability in his life. I eventually learned that despite making over 300k a year he was completely maxed out in debt because he had a gambling addiction in addition to his sex addiction. He learned to count cards at the casino and managed to con a younger card counter (I think he was only 21) into lending him tens of thousands of dollars to ""invest"" into being an advantage player at the casino. Unfortunately John lacked discipline and lost everything on slot machines. To his credit, he is planning to pay the kid back, but learning about this made me incredibly nervous and I started to get the sense that I was in over my head.

I hated the way that he would talk about being sexually abused as a child without warning in excruciating and disgusting detail. I hated that he would rather spend money he didn't have on escorts and gambling than see a therapist.

I felt gross and drained for hours or even days after seeing him, and would sometimes have to turn down other work because I didn't feel up to it.

The last straw for me happened Feb 16. We were supposed to see each other on Valentine's day, but I fell ill with the flu a few days earlier. He complained every day while I was sick and pestered me, dangling the money for my overnight fee over my head. He wasn't able to schedule another overnight until March, so if I didn't see him by Sunday, I would lose out on the $2000. Also he just really really really needed to get laid, and if I didn't see him, he'd go see another escort.

So, still feverish and really fucking ill, I let him come see me.

It's important to note that the first time he booked me for an overnight, he touched me in my sleep. This is a hard NO for me, and I let him know. Subsequent overnights, he did not cross that boundary. But this night, I woke up again to him assaulting my body in my sleep. My heart was racing and I felt so violated that I wanted to cry. I didn't want major confrontation, so I just pushed his hands away and told him I was still trying to sleep. But I spent the rest of the night on high alert, only able to doze for short periods of time.

After that, I knew it was time to stop seeing him. Because we planned our appointments for each month up to two months in advance, it did not seem appropriate to simply ghost him. I struggled to find the right way to end it. I knew he was obsessively attached to me and it would be chaotic no matter how gently I tried to let him go.

Then an opportunity presented itself. He saw another escort and fell asleep in his car in her parking lot. He woke up to the police questioning him and searching his car and phone. He cracked under pressure and admitted to paying for sexual services. He told them about me and about her. They chose not to arrest him or press charges, but when he related all the information to me, I decided to seize this excuse to stop seeing him. I told him that for my safety I did not want him to ever contact me again.

At first he said he understood and said goodbye. And then for the next five days, he bombarded me with texts and emails. He also sent YouTube videos of him crying and begging, snot dripping. Or drunk and begging and crying. Then sober and matter of factly laying out the reasons why my fears about his interaction with the cops was unfounded. More texts, more emails from different accounts.

I responded to none of it. It made me feel even more disgusted by him, honestly. I hoped that he would eventually tire and just go the fuck away.

Then he emailed me a suicide note. I didn't receive it until nearly four hours after he sent it because I was busy working. It stated that by the time I received it, it was already too late to stop him. But then three hours after the email, he sent me a YouTube video suicide note, which seemed fishy.

It has my already frazzled nerves in shambles. I worried that I could somehow be found responsible if he was found dead and they traced the cause back to me.

I eventually gave in and called the police. I posed as a girlfriend and I hoped it would be a one and done call, but they kept calling me back for more information (I knew his address and full name and vehicle) and they wanted copies of his suicide letters.

They tracked him down and it turned out he was absolutely fine. He just wanted me to talk to him, and was willing to do anything to make it happen.

I guess the cop successfully conveyed to him that he needed to stop harassing me, because the emails, texts and videos stopped. He did message my friend, but she told him the same thing the cop did - that he had to stop harassing me through her or else we'd go to the police.

I wish I had ignored his suicide note. I feel tricked and I'm still angry about it.","563","36"
"t3_1j6cqoq","I feel stuck, lost, and exhausted, and I don’t know what’s happening to me","I’m a 17-year-old guy, and I’ve always been a hard worker—energetic, supportive, and the kind of person who lifts others up. But for the past eight months, I’ve felt like a completely different person.

(No one knows about this, and this is my first time venting or talking about it.)

Mid-2024, my parents had a huge fight. I thought, they argue all the time, it’ll be fine, but this time was different. My mom fell into depression right in front of me. I took her to therapy, checked in on her daily, and tried to be there for her.

Then my dad shut down too. He locked himself in his office, barely ate, and was cold whenever I tried to talk. My dad is just like me—we hate sharing emotions—so I just sat with him in silence, hoping he’d feel less alone.

Watching the two strongest people I know fall apart broke something in me, but I held everything together. My routine was: wake up, check on my dad, school, gym, study, then spend hours with my mom. The only time I had to myself was 12-4 AM, and that’s when I met a girl online. Our dumb late-night conversations were the only thing keeping me sane.

By September, my parents were worse—and so was I. My grades were bad no matter how much I studied. And the girl who helped me escape started playing mind games, making things worse.

Then in October, my parents got better. They were laughing, eating together, and finally acting like themselves again. I thought life was turning around.

But a few days before my birthday, I got a phone call. One of my childhood best friends had died from cancer. That was my breaking point.

At his funeral, my brother cried. Everyone cried—except me. At the grave, surrounded by people sobbing, I felt like an outcast. I wanted to cry. I should have cried. But I couldn’t.

That night, I sat in the shower, eyes red as hell, trying so desperately to cry. But nothing. I just wanted to feel human again.

I held it together until February. That’s when the girl told me she loved me. I said it back, and for the first time in months, I thought maybe life was finally giving me something good.

But now, for the past eight days, I’ve done nothing but eat, sleep, and doom-scroll. I haven’t gone to the gym. I haven’t studied. I haven’t done anything. And I have an important test in three days. I’m stressed, but I don’t even care.

And to make it worse, the girl who said she loved me is playing the same mind games again. I don’t understand why. I thought I finally had something good, but now I just feel like an idiot.

I feel like everyone’s life is moving forward except mine. I’ve been stuck since July, and I don’t know how to fix it.

Nobody knows anything about this. It’s just me, alone, going through all of this by myself.

I just feel lost, scared, and overwhelmed, so please, what’s happening to me? What do I do?

This was a time before I was saved, so I engaged in fornication with her (she claimed she was saved as well), but I never had intercourse. We went through a lot of problems in the later half of the relationship, and had minimal contact after it ended. A week after she broke up with me, she dated a new person. Today I just found out that after nine months, she’s still with the rebound.

I want nothing, absolutely nothing to do with this person. I want to make that abundantly clear. But the idea that after a 1.5 year relationship that she moved on so quickly and ended up having a successful relationship with someone else really does hurt me, considering that I myself haven’t been so lucky to find someone. This might also be TMI, but I also think about how she lost her virginity to someone who wasn’t me.

"t3_1j6cle7","My mother died 6 days ago","Y’all, I’m struggling. There’s so much, and I’m not faultless. Mother & Daddy divorced before my 5th birthday. Mother “let” my older half-brother* live with his bio-dad once he turned 13. Mother also was diagnosed as bipolar in the 1960s and was treated far too long on lithium. I get this logically, but emotionally.,,I always lost out.

My mother & my aunt/:her sister have always found a common ground. They’ve had typical sister disagreements over the yearsbut have always been each other’s biggest advocates. Point is my mother was not a bad person.

Around my 5th grade year I tuned into fashion. I wanted what I liked, not her cutesy smocked dresses, etc. listen I am now as Southern as can be…I have a ridiculous amount of monogrammed items and would/will happily support a smocked personalized/monogrammed adult dress! There’s no shame in my game. Whatever I buy for my niece will have a matching auntie(or mom) part! ***

When my older half-brother was 12, he went to live with his father. After my older brother’s death when I was 12 myself, I was sent to my father and his wife and my younger half-brothers. To this day, we are all full siblings in each other’s eyes. My daddy raised my older brother, and his final wife helped raise us. This stepmom loves me and adopted me. Today, on the anniversary of my husband’s death, I learned that my bio mother passed away 6 days ago. Our last visit was very pleasant; neither of us drug up the past. However I am struggling with the fact that the hospital (where I used to work, and still love) did not notify me, my aunt, or the temporary Power of Attorney. I’ve been out of reach for a couple of years so a family friend stepped in as mPoA, knowing my mother’s wishes. My aunt & I have consistently been listed in medical records as emergency contacts. No one from the hospital contacted my aunt, me, or the mPoA. My mother’s body has been unclaimed in the hospital morgue for 6 days. 6 days!!! How am I supposed to feel?

TL;dr: my bio mom passed away 6 days ago in the hospital. They disregarded all emergency contacts listed and her temporary medical PoA in my absence. Her body has been unclaimed in the morgue for almost a week. They told my aunt on Monday that she had been discharged(blatant lie). There’s a lot to unpack but she was my mother. We had a lovely visit before I left town 3 weeks ago. I’m so furious that her body has been “unclaimed” in the hospital morgue. Note: I loved this healthcare system. I spent almost a decade of my career in their local hospital Admin. When I was very, very sick, this staff literally saved my life. I’ve been so loyal until this circumstance…","5","0"

So, I use a menstrual cup. I know I should be dumping the blood into the toilet and then rinsing the cup in the sink, but for some reason, my brain keeps going, Nah, let’s just pour it all straight down the sink.

Fast forward to me working on a group project at this guy’s house. I go to the bathroom, do my thing, and—shocker—the blood doesn’t just magically disappear down the drain. I’m guessing there were clots involved because suddenly, I’ve got a plumbing situation on my hands.

Cue me, hunched over his sink, desperately trying to shove my own blood down the drain like some kind of horror movie janitor. I must’ve been taking a while because I hear him call out, ""Everything okay?"" And I, covered in the sins of my uterus, just yell back, ""I’m fine! Thanks!"" while speedrunning my career as an emergency plumber.

After what felt like an eternity, I finally got everything to go down, walked out, and casually told him, ""Sorry, I clogged your sink and had to fix it."" He kind of laughs and goes, ""No worries, I'm just glad it was the sink and not the toilet!""

I have a pregnancy fetish. Essentially I find a big pregnant belly extremely attractive and the thought of the women's breasts, hips butt, getting bigger very attractive. It is purely objective/visual and I have had this ever since I was young. I have always felt very uncomfortable with having this fetish. Pregnancy is normally thought of as an amazing beautiful thing which to most people means 'baby' on the way. I also see it this way but separate to that I have this fetish as well. I worry that if someone hears pregnancy fetish that they will immediately think that this is some sicko thing for unborn babies or just not understand what the hell that kind of fetish is or what it means and immediately feel uncomfortable. Don't get me wrong, I'm not planning on openly telling people but as my peer group enters the 'having kids' stage of life I am feeling weird about it. I know that society has changed quite a lot but fetishes are still very taboo and make a lot of people uncomfortable. Sometimes I wish I didn't have the fetish just so I wouldn't have to deal with the mixed feeling. The only person who knows about it as an ex girlfriend of mine. I worry sometimes that she might tell people about it and I would feel very embarrassed and not know how to deal with it / friends looking at me differently. I know this post might be a bit of an unusual one but any honest and realistic feedback would be appreciated.","4","3"
"t3_1j6cxq0","Cousin missed my birthday","We grew up together. She lives right next to me. She’s my best friend.

I had my 16th birthday a in November last year, I told her we’d all meet at our uncle‘s house, he’s right down the road from us. I told her before I went there. She told me she would. She didn’t show up. Everyone else did.

I haven’t told her, she never apologized or brought it up. I think she forgot my birthday in a whole.

The birthday before that she went, but left half-way through.

This isn’t the first time she ditched half-way through or completely missed my birthday.","3","1"

"t3_1j6i2nt","I don’t know how to overcome my insecurity","Of course, a lot of people would tell me this is normal size or that I don’t have nothing to worry about. But I am white male from europe and my penis size is nearly 6 inchces, lets say 6 inches when I am with the best erection quality. Also I heard girth matters more and there I am with 5.3 inches.

I still don’t know how to feel about this. I was told I am literally hot and I am tall as well so only thing that is holding me back is my size. I’ve been with 5 girls total and every girl always came back.

Please is there any guy that is rougly the same size or any women that is super honest and can tell me what should I do? Thank you","1","0"
"t3_1j6hwbu","I miss my girlfriend, but I want to break up with her","I don't want to break up with her, but I feel like it's the only way we can go from here. I see a future with her but it all seems so far away and idealistic. I love her so much but I don't know, maybe we rushed into the relationship thing too much. It's hard being LDR. Plus, I'm not getting what I need out of our relationship but I'm too afraid to tell her the things we need to work on because I don't want to add to the insane stress she's going through right now. I always preach for communication but it's so much harder when it's between me and my partner. I feel like we don't click anymore. There are always times we don't talk for days at a time because we prioritize academics and stuff. I've come to expect it because we both promised we'd prioritize academics above each other but yeah I believe our relationship may be a hindrance to her studies at this point. I know she loves me but it's just hard to see it, especially during the busiest days. Not even a ""good morning"" or one text for a couple days. I miss her. I miss what we used to be. But I think at this point we might have come to a natural stopping point. I don't really have anyone to talk to about this so I'm just using Reddit as my diary right now. Sorry for my English, not my first language.","1","3"
"t3_1j64ccx","Close friend passed today at 28","You know how we always talk about how great someone is once they’ve passed? This friend was truly one of the best people I’ve ever known, hands down. I truly, honest to god, do not have a single negative thing to say about him. We’ve been friends for 20 years. We grew up together. He was the most himself person with a huge heart. He followed his passions in a way I rarely see, taught children who adored him, and was just such a damn good friend and person.

During the last conversation I had with him over Christmas, he told me he was the happiest he’d ever been. Doing what he loves every day. Pursuing his passions. I was so so happy for him. That day he also met the man I’m going to marry for the first time and told me how much he liked him. It’s hard to imagine he won’t be at my wedding now.

I know there’s no rhyme or reason to death, and I won’t waste my time on arguing with it, but man, if anyone deserved a long, happy life, it was him. I feel extremely sad and just needed to get it off my chest.","11","1"

I never learned how to make friends, and now I have run out of people who feel sorry for me.  I've been in one romantic relationship. When we broke up they said ""I wanted to love you but can't"" and I get that.

I have a job, technically a good job. But I can't afford to survive. I have 6 roommates and I don't have the skills to talk to any of them. I hide in my room and wait til no one's around before I use the bathroom or the kitchen and if anyone sees me I beat the shit out of myself. I know it's not fair for othet people to have to deal with me like this. It is abusive, and I don't want to live if being alive hurts people m

I'm on 3 different psych meds and waiting for an MRI to confirm whether I have MS or just migraines or am just a huge bitch.  I can't afford these and I don't deserve them.

I used to take care of myself through long distance cycling but now I have trouble walking and I can't stay awake longer than maybe 8 or 9 hours at a time.

I'm going to ask my doctor to apply for Medical Assistance in Dying. I know what they will say; that I'm too young, that my condition isn't that bad, that I need to try more medications.

No medication is going to give me the skills I need to be a person.  No pill can make me good.

"t3_1j6d7ec","Something is wrong with my mind","There’s a level of thinking that just isn’t happening. I don’t understand things the way other people do, and I don’t even know where to start. People are taking in information that I just don’t even perceive, despite being in the same room and reading the same material. I can’t articulate myself very well at all. It’s one thing to lack an attention span, it’s another thing to be genuinely unable to comprehend logic, and not even know I don’t get it until other people point it out to me. People around me try to spare my feelings but I can see it in their faces that they know I’m at the absolute bottom of the class.

I’m genuinely so dumb and I don’t know what’s going to happen to me. There’s no point in having confidence if I am confidently wrong. I just feel like I’m at my maximum capacity for learning, and I have no idea how to grow. I get someone has to be the worst. It’s unbelievably crushing that it’s me.","2","2"
"t3_1j6d566","I'm going crazy for a very stupid reason","My sister stole an earring of mine, I'm sure. A long, fringed earring with a rhinestone on the head that I could remove that I bought about three years ago. It was my absolute favorite, basically the only one I wore and I wore it everywhere, it was perfect for everything, I didn't even need another one.

I wore it to a party in December, and I clearly remember taking it off inside the house and putting it in my jewelry box. But when I went to wear it again, where was it? It doesn't make sense. I didn't lose that earring, I put it where it should have been, but someone took it, didn't tell me and to this day has never given it back to me.

I live with my mother, two sisters and my grandfather; and my aunt is the neighbor in the apartment across the hall, and she and her daughter have complete access to my house. I've already gone to everyone, calmly asked if they had taken it, if they had borrowed it and forgotten to return it; everyone said no.

But here's the thing: my older sister is a bitch. She comes into my room and takes my stuff. She's already finished my perfume, makeup, skincare, hair products - expensive stuff. She complains when I complain, she takes absolutely no care with anything. My whole life has been like this with her, and my whole life I've complained to my mother about it - but my mother just told me to keep my stuff away from her. It's kind of hard when we live in the same house, but it's okay.

She's already taken some of my jewelry and broken it. When I was a kid, she took three of my rings and returned them to me broken that same night, but I was a kid and the rings had cost 30 reais in total.

When I was 17, she took a pair of earrings that my aunt gave me for my 15th birthday, big earrings with stones, more expensive, but besides everything else, a gift, the same thing happened, they disappeared and one day, rummaging through her room, I found them broken; She didn't even bother to show it to me. This one caused me problems, but this woman had the nerve to tell me to my face ""I'm not going to buy another one, they're too expensive"" with the utmost disdain in the world, and my mother did nothing. I kept up the conversation for a while, telling her that she was an irresponsible idiot who had stolen my earrings, but it was no use, and at 17 years old, what was I going to do? Sue her for a pair of earrings? Alone, even more so, because my mother wouldn't help me.

Brother, this story about that earring that she broke has been cooking in me all these years and, along with everything I went through with her in my childhood, God, I hate this woman.

Now, the same thing happened. My earring disappeared and there was absolute silence. I know she has it, I know she took it. But it was in December, it's already March. I've asked her on separate occasions if she took my earring and she said no. I've already gone to her room and turned everything upside down looking for those earrings and I couldn't find them (I found other things of mine that I hadn't even noticed were not even with me anymore). I want to look in her bag, but she won't let me, she'll get stressed and throw them to my mother who will be on her side like she always is.

Brother, I'm going to go crazy because sometimes I stop and think about this piece of crap earring that I know she took. I know I didn't lose it, I know where I put it; if it had been my fault, if I had left it at the party where I wore it, if I had put it in my bag and it disappeared, if it had fallen on the street, I know I would have gotten over it by now; but no, it disappeared in my house, in the place where it should be, someone took it. The only person who has the nerve to steal it from me and act like the biggest sly person there is. Practically every week I end up staging fights and fights with her, demanding that she give me back the earrings that I know she stole, but she'll turn the story around and I'll leave like a crazy person because I've already looked in her room and nothing. And I swear that, for real, if I found that piece of shit earring with her I would sue her, now I would sue her. It costs a lot less than the earring she broke, but I don't care. I just want my earring, I just want that bitch to give me back what's mine because I know she has it.","2","1"

"t3_1j6fs50","My girlfriend has been bullied by her dorm mates just because they think it's fun","My girlfriend is the most innocent person I've ever known. She is so sweet and caring towards everyone. And always avoids trouble. Last night, in their dorm, 7 girls started bullying her and making fun of her everything. She texted me saying she was afraid and her hands were shaking. She insisted she did nothing wrong and doesn't know what's happening. I told her to keep ignoring them because they may be waiting for a reaction to start a huge argument and she is afraid of arguments.

They kept making fun and having inside jokes about her right in front of her untill 2 AM.

This morning i went to see her and she was broken. It's so painful for me to see her like this. She is crying like a baby and keeps saying she did nothing wrong to them.

We informed people in charge of the dorm and they said they will check it out! Which obviously means they will never take it seriously.

Last night I couldn't sleep well. I keep thinking of possible ways to take revenge. I don't want this to happen again. And I don't want her to give in without a fight.

How can i teach them a lesson? We are arranging to change her room. She is moving out tonight.

I had an idea to write things on boards in classes the bully is going to be in and get her name on everyone's mouth. I don't know. I'm so mad. She is so innocent and sweet. She is my baby girl....","1","1"
"t3_1j68ybh","My Solo Day Experience – Pure Freedom & Joy!","Yesterday, my parents went out to attend a family function, leaving me alone at home. The first time my dad left me alone at night, I felt a little scared. After all, for a girl, spending the night alone in a big house isn’t always easy. But this time, it was completely different—I felt calm, confident, and absolutely at peace.

What surprised me the most was that my parents didn’t call me even once to check whether I had eaten or done my work. Not because they forgot, but because they know I am responsible enough to handle everything. Being the eldest daughter of the house, I have always been expected to take care of things on my own.

With ₹200 in hand from my dad, I first treated myself to chhole bhature. Later, I managed to earn ₹1000 by sending some rice, so now I had even more freedom to enjoy!

For lunch, I had paneer curry with rice, and at night, I went full feast mode—pizza and pasta while watching Tenali Rama on TV. No one to disturb, no distractions—just me, my food, and my favorite show! After that, I enjoyed gulab jamun and ended the night with a cold Thums Up, making the day feel even better.

The best part? This time, I didn’t feel scared at all. Sleeping alone, which once felt a little uneasy, now felt completely normal.

What I realized was something even bigger. Every night, when my family is around, I feel lonely. But when they weren’t there, I understood that I don’t actually need anyone to feel complete. If someone doesn’t want to be with me, I can still live happily on my own. As the eldest daughter, I have often been ignored because of my younger brother. But now, I’ve finally understood—there is nothing wrong with being alone.

This morning, I woke up, spent some time soaking in the warm sunlight on the terrace, and now I’m making myself a cup of tea. After this, I’ll do some housework, and before my parents return, I’ll prepare a meal for them.

Honestly, this experience made me realize that being alone doesn’t mean being lonely. It’s peaceful, freeing, and fun! No unnecessary stress, no chaos—just me, my time, and pure happiness.","4","0"
"t3_1j638ou","My dads in the icu, my boyfriends planning a trip","This happened in mid January. For context, I am 32F and my boyfriend is 34m, we’ve been together for 3 years and we live together in a house that I own. Now for the story- my dad has been unwell for over a month and my siblings and I (mom died from cancer when I was young) have been taking care of him while we waited for test results and some answers. Last week his condition took a turn for the worst and he ended up being taken to the hospital by ambulance and has been in the icu for a week. He was diagnosed with cancer. We still don’t have all the answers and I don’t know what the future holds for my family. On the third day that my dad was in the icu, my boyfriend was at work and texted me about his plans for the following day that consisted of him meeting up with friends to “plan their trip.” I knew they had been talking loosely talking about potentially going on a trip at the end of the month, but I thought it was common sense that since my dad is in the hospital, the trip would be off…. Well apparently not. Needless to say, we had an argument. I told him it’s extremely hurtful that he would abandon me at a time like this. After a lot of back and forth throughout the day he let me know the trip was cancelled (nothing had been paid for or even booked yet), but at this point I just feel like the damage is done. Who would prioritize a “boys trip” when their partners only parent is extremely sick in the hospital. The obvious answer is to break up, but I don’t know if I have it in me to go through a breakup right now. It’s been a few days now, my dad is doing much better, he’s out of the icu and I’ve been there everyday helping him with his recovery so he can come home. I’ve been off work for the past week and a half during all this and went back yesterday and have been going to the hospital between shifts. My boyfriend has been moping around the house the last few days and every time I ask him what’s wrong he says “nothing” or “I don’t know, I’m just sad.” I said if this is about the trip, then just go. He says that’s not what it’s about. I suggested he goes to talk to someone , a therapist or a friend.. or me. He declined all of this. I asked what I can do to help, he said nothing and “I’m not his therapist” I said nothing and just collected my stuff and went to work. I have a lot on my plate already, and I’m feeling angry that he’s putting this on me now as well. We spent the next few days avoiding eachother around the house which was making my mental health seriously depleted. We finally had a conversation, I told him he should go on the trip because there’s no sense of him staying here if he’s not even going to acknowledge me or be supportive to me and my family anyways. The next day, he booked his flight. I tried to convince myself I was okay with it, but his 5 day trip suddenly turned into 10 days, and I just knew I was done. We had a few conversations while he was away, mostly me crying and telling him how angry I am with him. He came home, and I ended it as soon as he walked in the door. He begged and pleaded, said he “never would have left” if he knew I would end it because of the trip. There was a lot of back and forth and I asked him if he could just leave for a few days to give me some space, which he did. He ended up taking me on a date for Valentine’s Day later that week and things seemed to be getting a little bit better. We planned a night away the following week to try to connect again. During our “romantic night away” he decided it was a good idea to invite his friend and friends girlfriend to join us for dinner (the girlfriend ended up not coming so it was just me, my bf and his friend) ….. and then “surprisingly” a bunch of his other work friends just happened to be at the same restaurant. What was supposed to be a romantic evening to try to repair our relationship ended up being a table of 8 of us, talking about my boyfriends job. We went back to the hotel, got into an argument and went to bed angry. The next day we woke up and he got in the shower and left his Apple Watch on the night stand. I had that gut instinct to check his messages, and there it was. He was been messaging with another girl the entire time my dad was in the hospital and was meeting up with her for “coffee dates “ …. Which I highly doubt is all that happened. So ya, that’s it. He moved his stuff out last week , and the person I thought I knew for the last almost 4 years has become the person whose hurt me more than anyone ever has in my life. I’m on my own again, going to be 33 next month, and starting from scratch. I don’t know what the future holds but it has to be better than this, right?","9","1"

"t3_1j55g68","today I found out my mom was murdered.","today I found out my mom was murdered. blunt force trauma to the head that lead to brain bleeding. she had a migraine for 11 days and vomited daily. I had no idea she was sick. she passed in july of last year, and the county I am in is so backed up that the medical examiner took 8 months to get back to us. we all assumed it was a fentanyl overdose that she may have come in contact with because one of her friends was an addict. it turns out that she had no drugs in her system.

i’ve been waiting for 8 months. i’m only 20. my dad hasn’t been around at all for my whole life. my mom picked terrible men. her whole life has been around horrible men. she was raised being beaten by her father by anything and everything possible he could find. she married a man who got addicted to crack, my father. she then married another man who cheated on her the entire relationship with other men. the final man, a man who had stolen from her in a relationship prior and who has killed 2 of his previous partners indirectly, took her, too.

the only answer it could be is that the final man took her from us. he had never killed them exactly, but both of his previous wives were completely clean before they met him. 5 and 7 years later, they both died of a heroin overdose.

I cut off my relationship with my mom in 2019 due to something I was a victim of when I was younger by the man who cheated on her with other men. he did some fucked up things. a lot of fucked up things. he let a lot of fucked up things happen to me under his supervision. I had caught a disease from what he did/let happen and decided to move in with my grandma because I did not like the man she was now with, the man who (may) have killed her, the final man. I had no contact with her after I got a restraining order.

she and I had started to get along for once in 4 years. I had hugged her (albeit halfassedly) for the first and last time. she cried and cried. I don’t know what I would have done if she were to have passed and I didn’t get on good terms with her again.

I wanted to see her succeed in her life. she spent all of her life desperate to be shown that she was worthy of being loved. I tried to show her before she passed, a few months before, that the way I had loved her growing up was enough proof that she was worthy of love. that if she can say she isn’t worthy of it, then my love I showed her as a kid meant nothing. she finally started to understand.

we were going to go to college together. I wanted to help her get her GED. to start going to school. to make the loser of a boyfriend she has had for years go work instead of making her work 2 part time jobs being disabled and still not being able to make the rent. he did nothing for her other than steal from her and hurt her.

I had to protect myself by moving out those years ago. she didn’t want to listen when I knew he was bad news. i’ve known since I was 14. I just wish I could have done something to save her. I wish he never met her. I wish I could have been there to stand up for her when he hit her.

i’m terrified. i’m so scared of being angry. I don’t know how to deal with the fact that someone took her from me. she was my everything for years. someone so cruel took her from me and made her be in pain. no one knew he had hit her. no one knew her migraine was not just a migraine. she couldn’t tell anyone or go to the doctor because she would have to admit he hurt her. again.

i thought I processed it all when she died. but being told today that she died due to blunt force trauma and brain bleeding makes me feel like I lost her this morning. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to feel. I feel like my world just broke. again. and now I have to deal with detectives, with getting information, with anything that I can do to help them investigate.

I just want my mom back.","1149","27"
"t3_1j61aoy","I'm turning 18 today and i cant even afford a cake.","Today is my 18th birthday a milestone that’s supposed to feel like the gateway to adulthood, independence, and new beginnings. But instead of feeling celebrated, I feel overlooked. Instead of joy, there’s this heavy weight in my chest, pressing down on me, making it hard to swallow the disappointment.

For almost two months now, my father hasn’t been able to work due to a job-related injury. Money is tight so tight that even something as simple as a cake, a small token of acknowledgment, is out of reach. I understand. I really do. I know it’s not their fault, and I know they love me, but that doesn’t make it hurt any less.

Birthdays are supposed to be special, a day when you feel seen. But mine never really have been. I’ve had birthdays forgotten, birthdays I had to share like they weren’t fully mine, birthdays that felt more like an afterthought than a celebration. And now, here I am, reaching a turning point in my life, and it feels like just another ordinary day except worse, because deep down, I wanted it to be different.

What makes it harder is the facade I feel forced to maintain. Everyone around me assumes I’m fine, that I’m well off, that things in my life are smooth. My friends ask me what my plans are, and I don’t even know how to answer. Do I pretend I have something lined up? Do I admit the truth? How do you explain to people that your birthday this huge, symbolic moment feels hollow because even the simplest things are out of reach?

I keep telling myself to be grateful, to focus on what I do have, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t struggling. It’s not about material things it’s about feeling valued, feeling like this day matters, feeling like I matter. And right now, I just feel invisible.

I know life isn’t about birthdays, that one day in the grand scheme of things shouldn’t define anything. But when you spend every other day just pushing through, birthdays are supposed to be different. They’re supposed to be a pause, a moment where you feel like the world sees you. But today, I feel like I’m standing in the middle of a crowded room, screaming for someone to notice me, and no one even looks up.","11","13"
"t3_1j64g7u","Coming to terms with the thought that my sister is not a good person after all","It has been almost 15 years since it's slowly started to dawn on me that my sister never really loved me: she just thought I was so much lamer than her, that she didn't see me as a competiton.

For the context: she is 10 years older than me and for as long as I can remember, I loved her more than anyone alive. I loved her more than our parents, brothers, friends etc. She was my absolute role model and everything she did was perfect.

It is fucked up to compare kids ever, but when parents and relatives are comparing two people who are so different and not even in the same age group, that is especially fucked up. She was always labeled the beautiful one, me as the smart one. She was the caring child, I was the mean one. Her life was hard, mine was easy. Everything that was happening to her was always celebrated if it was good, or we were all devastated together with her if it was bad - and it was never her fault when it was bad. Everything I ever did was considered as luck, or as normal if it was good and my fault if it was bad.

She loved me back and always worked on building my self confidence - but never to the extent of me succeeding in being better than her in any way. This was particularly obvious in her relationship with our parents, where she told me multiple times that our father wanted mom to have the abortion when she was pregnant with me. Any sign of me not liking that thought was being met with the comment along the lines of ""me being too sensitive"" or ""oh, come on, he loves you now"". I reacted explosivelly about that only once, when I told her openely to go fuck herself with those fucked up pieces of info, which, of course, ended with her being in tears, appologizing, and making me promise THAT I WILL NEVER REMIND HER ABOUT THAT EVENT. She made it about her and her feelings and I was told by the involved parties that I shouldn't have been so hard on her.

These were occasional outbursts, when I would always make a conclusion that I over reacted and I would end up crying, begging her to forgive me and promising never to do it again. Bear in mind - we are talking about my teenage yeara here, not adult me.

FF to my 20s: while she had one relationship with her then long-time bf, who became almost like a family member, I mostly fucked around and either didn't really meet reciprocated feelings in guys, or I didn't even want anything serious. She eventually broke up with him - it was a family tragedy, ofc, like anything bad that happens to her - and she somehow put us both together to ""we are never getting married"" file. I mean, she never said it, but it was obvious that she is not supportive of my potential relationships. I kind of knew it, but I became sure about it when I started to date my now husband, when I was 25, and as I became more self-assured because I felt loved, she started to become more and more openely toxic, and she was doing it often. She would use every opportunity to let me know she thinks he is lazy and irresponsible, while I didn't think any of that. She started to hate my hobbies, style, habits (which didn't change much - I just wasn't as miserable as before) and she was suuuuper pissed when she broke with her second bf and I got engaged. She called me and raged about how it is inconsiderate that everyone is saying ""congrats"" on social media, while they are aware of her recent break up. I felt bad because during the last year of her relationship she lost one pregnancy, but I still didn't think that I should hid posts my boyfriend put on social media when he proposed.

After that, it all went downhill. She was good to me either when something super good would happen to her, or when something really bad would happen to me. She hated my wedding day and pregnancy, but she was full of understanding when I had PPD. She did nothing to help, but she was good to me then. As soon as I got better, she was hating me again. In the meantime - all good that was going on in her life was still celebrated and all bad was mourned, while my life was kind of unimportant to our mutual loved ones (mostly).

I started to fight back, but I was rarely talking shit about her to our family, while she wasn't really private about her opinion on me. Every time when she would show her good side again, I would come back to life because I would regain the hope that the most loved person from my childhood is still there.

Recently, I lost all hope that I will ever want her back in my life. Our father died and in his final months, while I was crying my guts out and doing EVERYTHING to help him - as we all did - she told me that I was selfish as always and not showing any empathy towards him. That was the straw that broke the camel's back for me and I screamed at her and told her to get the fuck away from me forever.

We did communicate after that, because there were many things that had to be done with our dad, and I was there for her to be her shoulder to cry on when she needed me, but it was just because I felt I had to, for the rest of our family.

As our dad passed, my feelings of disgust came back and I am back to feeling hurt by our last fight. She mentioned it briefly and said that it was just a dumb fight, as she always does after moments like that, but to me - it wasn't. To me now, none of the fights we had were dumb and they were all about one thing: her wanting me to be the obedient, loser sister that she had when I was from 0 to 20-ish and her from 10 to 30-ish.

I can't stand the thought of her hanging out with my kid anymore. My kid loves her and I was so happy when my sister and I patched our fight from a few years ago and she had good relationship with her niece, but honestly - I have two fears:

She would fuck her up the way she fucked me up,

She would be telling my kid mean things to show me as a bad person, for whatever reason.

One thing I found out later, after my PPD was gone, is that she was planning to take the kid away from me ""because it seems like I am not fit to do it"", but she never considered talking to my husband about it. Like, he didn't have PPD, he was fine - why didn't she talk to him? Why was she planning to adopt the kid who was not out for adoption?

Anyway... I am done with her, but I think I will need a lot of time to process this. Maybe therapy would be beneficial.","7","0"

I wouldn’t put myself in a bad situation in the first place. You see this with single moms a lot. A single mom will talk about how bad her life is and how she’s works all the time and it’s never enough money. Well, she put her self in that situation. No one forced her to have kids.

"t3_1j69hfw","My friend is boring","I love him a lot. Genuinely. We went to high school together and have been friends even since (we're both 24). He is such a sweet and well intentioned soul. He helped me through hard times in my life and I try to always be there for him as well.

But he is just genuinely so boring.

Having an in depth conversation with him is impossible. I don't know why. He doesn't have any opinions on anything or plans about life either other than wanting to move out. He just kind of exists

He has some hobbies, like soccer or watching movies, but he can't really have in depth conversations about those either. Even when he is telling me about them he just says that x and y happened. Our conversations are mostly just him telling me what he ate that day, how his day at work was like and what his parents said to him and he wants us to talk every day.

We do have hobbies together, like roller skating and eating out, but is this really enough to keep a friendship afloat? I sure don't feel like it is, now that I have a job and responsibilities. In depth conversations are so important to me and talking to him feels grating at times

I know that he tries his best, but he's just like this and I don't think that there's a clear solution","3","3"
"t3_1j6bfcq","Why I don’t post pictures to social media and avoid socializing with others. Because of the fear they’ll get my age wrong and trigger my OCD and Body Dysmorphia","I am a 26 year old guy born in 1998. I’m going to sound crazy in this whole rant.

When I was 18 in 2016/2017, I became curious how others were perceiving me. I thought I looked young and still had the teenage look. As someone born in 1998, it wasn’t my turn to be 20+ yet, I was still a teenager. Growing up, people born in the early 90’s and mid 90’s seemed to look more mature than me and I thought it was obvious that I was younger.

I began posting pictures of myself to Yahoo Answers and Facebook “guess my age challenges” and asked people to guess. Every picture I posted, there was at least one person or a few people who guessed correctly that I was 18. That gave me validation Yet I also heard 23, 24, 25 etc and that felt super weird at the time. I felt weirded out and uncomfortable because I just didn’t understand how/why I was being perceived as much older if there were people who were guessing my age correctly. I remember feeling upset even if I heard 20. I suffer from OCD too and numbers are very triggering for me. They were adding on years to my life and that just made me feel very restless and I felt absolutely disgusted. I was like Omg i’m still a teenager and I’m being seen as old??Do I have an abnormal appearance, what’s wrong with my development. But at the same time there were many people online who guessed correctly that I was 18. I remember one picture someone told me I looked like a teen and that she thought I was 14/15 but another person thought I was 23. Another picture, 4 people thought I was 15-19 yet another person thought I was 24. One picture someone guessed correctly I was 18 but another person said “early 20s unless you have brilliant skincare regime”. I also uploaded a picture of myself with glasses once and someone thought I was 17 or 18 yet another person said 20-25. I was like 25!!?? And that haunted me for several years. I constantly kept having intrusive thoughts about these extreme perceptions and suffered so much. I even had to see a doctor and psychiatrist and took medication to try and stop the intrusive thoughts. I made a vow in September 2017 to stop posting.

In real life, many people thought I was a teen in school and asked me what grade I was in but at the same time some people thought I was past university age and doing my masters. It just felt super weird. This kept happening to me throughout university. People asking me what grade I was in (being shocked that I was university) and a few people who thought I was past university age. I will never forget September 2019. A guy born in 1992 told me that I looked younger than 21 to him and still looked like a teen but the day after that, a lady thought that I was older than my then 29 year old sister (1990) and kept saying she looked really young like 22ish and I wasn’t even 22 then like wtf.

As mentioned earlier, I suffer from OCD and constantly had intrusive thoughts that I was filthy and disgusting because years were being added onto my life and I wondered what I was going to look like when I was actually 23-25. These numbers were disgusting in my mind. I also developed Body Dysmorphia and hated my appearance. I didn’t mind being perceived as young but wondered what was it about my face that made me look old to others??? How could I look young and old at the same time?

Then when I was actually 23/24, 2 people asked me what grade I was in and a few days before I turned 25 in 2023, someone asked me if my school was closed for summer break. But then in January 2024, someone asked me if I was 25 and I was like omg have i looked 25 for the past decade?? Am I living in some sort of time warp??

Now I’m 26 and many people ask me if I’m a student of a postsecondary institute (uber drivers, restaurant/cafe owners, people helping me in stores etc) That’s a common perception many people have of me. But I have a sneaking suspicion that history is going to repeat itself in a new context and that a new trend will form that I’ve got to be 30, or 30+ when I’m technically not even in my late 20s yet. This is why I don’t post pictures online and avoid socializing with people. Because I’m afraid history is going to repeat itself again and that I’ll suffer again. I’d much rather be alone than be around people who have the potential to make me uncomfortable in my own skin. I wasn’t uncomfortable withy appearance until I became aware that some people have extreme perceptions of me. I also get really angry like why are most people so stupid and unable to read my face???

Sometimes I just wish I could stay locked up in a tower like Rapunzel away from the whole world so that no one can ever see my face again. I’m also pretending to be Evil Queen now as a coping mechanism. Someone obsessed with her appearance, constantly needing validation and being vindictive towards those who challenge her identity.","2","9"
"t3_1j6bbpc","Sigh... I think my husband and I have different ideas about our family-planning future...","Throw away account.  I need to get this off my chest.  .................................................................................

I LOVE my husband SO MUCH! He is my world, my soulmate, my love, and my best friend. We just went through IVF together, and it was a bitch. Not successful, sadly. I am... okay... I have been so scared of this new US administration that I think my body rejected the fetus.  On one hand, I need therapy; on the other, my husband does NOT realize how FUCKED we're going to be. He's a delusional optimist while I'm a pessimist/""realist""... I really hope I'm not right, but I believe what I believe for a reason. Maybe I need therapy, but it's expensive, so I'm asking for the constructive criticism and support from my fellow internet strangers.

Background: I (36 F) studied climate change in college and am forever fucked in the mind; my husband, who is smarter than me in a lot of ways, I'll admit, has an indominable spirit of hope. It's a blessing for me, and I don't know what for him, but I feel bad...

But I literally cannot buy myself anything without feeling like I'm committing a crime?

Went to get a decent laptop since mine sounds like a jet engine - stood in Best Buy for 20 minutes before panicking and leaving empty handed.

Tried ordering takeout yesterday instead of meal prepping. Canceled the order twice before finally letting it go through. Then felt sick the whole time eating it.

Grew up poor. Like, generic cereal in a baggie poor. Guess that shit sticks with you even when the circumstances change.

Anyone else hit financial stability and still feel guilty spending on basic comforts? Like my brain is programmed to think broke thoughts no matter what my bank account says.

We met on the train heading to the neatest city to us, I had zero idea where I was being taken but it was a small café not too far from a park and museum. We sat in there for around an hour before walking around the park and just talking, the weather did start to turn a little dreary so we went to the museum and listened to an organ for a bit before just walking around to see what had changed since we'd last been there (they removed all the old armour/swords and replaced them with old chairs?)

Towards the end we walked back through the city and got on the train. I got off two stops later than I should have just so I could walk her to her car and then we headed our separate ways.

All in it was a pretty fun day and we're thinking of going out for dinner next time.","5","3"
"t3_1j62rt3","I seriously hate my parents","They’re so fucking stupid and annoying. They bitch at me(16F) and complain every 2 seconds over something small. Every time I’ve tried to tolerate their shit I end up crashing the fuck out.

quite literally ive tried to be nice and help a lot with stuff, I’ve done a bunch of chores around the house, even some chores they have to do, ive even babysat my younger siblings, just to keep them happy and their mouth shut.

but nah, I’m still walking on eggshells with them.There’s been a couple times I’ve been clumsy and accidentally knocked someone over, like my little brother when I was trying to sweep and he snuck behind me and i turned around then he fell over. And when that happens it’s like absolute hell on earth because they yell at me and act like I’m some demon over it.

so, I dress one of my younger siblings for them because he’s disabled and can’t do that for himself, so I pick an outfit out for him for school and all.when I came home today, I got berated over it because the outfits I choose “ArEnT fAsIoNaBlE” or whatever, like wtf?And quite literally if I do anything wrong I’m berated called useless and other insults. I’ve literally went to the psych ward  cuz I was suicidal and my parents decided to snoop through my room and my stuff, and basically When I got back they didn’t even care if they were triggering me or not. They just used it as fucking fuel.I just can’t wait to get revenge on them, I don’t give a fuck about how cruel I plan on getting revenge, but goddamnit I’m gonna make them wish they were never born.","8","22"
"t3_1j68jjz","Just another confused and lost person.","I usually don't post about this kinda stuff online or really talk about it out loud with anyone, to be honest; It's often just a page on a random notebook where I braindump anything and everything that crosses my mind at the moment when I feel like it's too much to handle.

Today is different. I decided to expose it exactly because I never did. Been trying different stuff to see if something changes, in hope that any change could chain more and eventually things get better.

I've always felt sort of an inadequacy around life, if that makes sense; A feeling that I never really belong anywhere or am passionate about anything. I'm currently 30 years old and so far I've been navigating passively. I wonder if there is such a thing as not really fit to being alive. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a cry for help and I'm not planning on hurting myself in any way; Also, I'm not trying to throw a pity party, I'm coming from a place of trying to figure this out logically.

Like I said, I'm currently 30. Turned 30 this year. I still live with my parents, am unemployed but am currently studying computer science at an university. Never really been into a relationship, but I do have some good friends and a loving familt, for the most part. Still, there is something wrong with me. I look around sometimes and hear shared experiences from other people about romantic adventures or success on their jobs and I feel like I want that. It's not jealousy, mind you, it's more of a self questioning as to where have I been if not doing all that stuff?

My current situation is my fault, and I understand it's not good and even then, I don't have the strength or willpower or whatever you may call it to change it. It's like part of me wants to experience the world and... I guess a good way to explain it is, I want to want to do stuff, but I don't know what or how to start.

Starting things is another problem of mine. I know what needs to be done and even so starting things is so difficult that it's insane. Normally that could be ruled out as being lazy or procastination but frankly, I've putting things off for 30 years, the problem has to be something else right? Currently, I know that I should be sitting down to work on programming projects to create portfolios and help me get employes but doing so is... hard. Not as in, programming is hard, it's not that. I'm also not scared of making mistakes, I embrace them as an opportunity of learning. It's a mix of not knowing where or how to start and perhaps a disbelief that it is going somewhere? I even thought at some point this might be related to me playing too much games or watching too many shows but even if I cut all that off, I still won't do what I need. I'll spend time laying in bed, overthinking, planning too much for stuff I never have the guts to get done.

I guess you could call me a leech, but I don't feel like it's the case. I don't take pride nor plan on taking advantage of my dad's kindness forever, but I just feel... lost? It's always been hard for me to set goals to achieve because I feel like I don't really have anything. I can feel content with so little and that's maybe the reason why I never try and get more. I don't consider myself ambitious: Having fancy stuff or being famous or helping people... None of that stuff really pushes me forward. And those are the common stuff that people want so how can I move forward without a good reason to?

There are things I'm interested in, yeah. Like learning languages. But also some stuff I'd love to try and have no money for right now like woodworking maybe, music and theater.

I still feel like a kid, frozen in time watching it go by and desperately trying to grow up but failing miserably. And although I umderstand there is no point in thinking too hard about my past mistakes that led here, I'm scared that I'm forever trapped in this loop of not being able to move on. I want to escape, but am not sure what I should do. Therapy would help I feel but I'll only be able to afford it when I manage to get a job. I'm hoping I'll manage to get my first internship this year and maybe talking to someone would help me figure things out. Sure, I have friends, but I don't feel like I have a safe space to be vulnerable with them or anyone else in my family.

I always thought, back then, that I would have this figured out by now. Sometimes I think all it's needed is a small change that gets other things in motion, so lately I've been trying to do that. Doing things differently, trying to experimenting new stuff. I recently created a routine to try and force myself to do stuff; It hasn't helped much so far because even if I write things down I end up forgetting to look at the list or just can't bring myself to do it but on good days, I actually get a small amount of stuff done.

I'm the kind of person who tries to understand and look for a purpose on everything and this here is kind pointless. This post went nowhere and is not going anywhere. Kinda like my life so far. It's funny to think that. But that's why I decided to do it. I'm not sure things will work out and despite hearing positive encouragement from my friends, still can't see much of a future for me but I'll keep doing what I can and trying my best, even if it's not the most optimal for a normal human being.

If you actually managed to read this far, my apologies for this mess. I wrote as the thougts came, no organization or anything.

I hope someday I understand myself and determine my purpose.","3","0"
"t3_1j66syz","Honestly, this is how I am learning to cope with being single/lonely for a long time","I hate to say that I am that guy who has been single for a really long time despite my best efforts, but I am. I (27M) haven't even been lucky enough to go on a date in like 5 or 6 years, but I have not given up hope even though things do look a bit bleak for me at the moment. I am a really busy graduate student, I try to fit in workouts and other activities too but it is pretty hard. I do not have a lot of extra energy left to put in substantial effort to find the right person for me on most weeks. So the thing I kinda wanted to get off my chest is I have been working on concepts/writing for a (fantasy) novel for a while when I get some time alone. With my life being romantically unfulfilled, I have fit in a relationship between two characters (the MC and another) to fulfill all the things that I have dreamed about. It was not really part of my original ideas for the story but it kinda just happened. Its pretty much all wholesome relationship stuff that I have never really got to have; the hand holding, the closeness, sharing feelings, tender moments, having each other's back, etc. As lame as it sounds, it has been decently fulfilling for me. There are still days that I really could use a hug even from a friend, but there is something about getting all the stuff I have always wanted on paper that has been pretty nice and comforting. Even though adding this stuff in has been satisfying for me, I am a little afraid it makes the writing worse lol, and when its all finished it makes me that much more afraid to show it to anyone. Some of my friends know I have been working on this but have no idea there's romance involved in it. I just really wanted to get off my chest I have been vicariously living out my romantic dreams through my fictional characters because I do not really have a better outlet. I think its been a healthy way to express what I am missing out on?","4","0"
"t3_1j4t53m","Did My Partner Cheat 10 Years Ago and Forget It Wasn’t Me that was with him","My partner and I were in bed watching silly videos when a clip of a comedian popped up, asking people about the weirdest place they'd had sex. Without thinking, I laughed and said, ""Oh, for us, it was definitely the beach! Remember when we used to go there?"" (For context, it was a very isolated beach.)

But then, he looked at me and said, ""Nooo, the weirdest place was in the bathroom at Asda.""

I froze. What?

I stared at him, confused. ""We never had sex in a bathroom at Asda.""

He insisted we did—back when he was living with his brother and I was staying with my aunt. He even painted the scene: our son was asleep, so we snuck off to the bathroom.

Only… our son wasn’t even born yet. I was pregnant at the time. And I am absolutely sure I would remember having sex in a supermarket bathroom. That kind of adrenaline rush would have stayed with me forever.

Yet, he kept insisting it happened.

And that’s when it hit me.

Did he cheat on me and forget that the person he was with wasn’t even me?

This was 10 or 11 years ago, but still, I would not have forgotten this. And I know this because I remember every place I’ve ever had sex in public, even from before I was with him. So this made absolutely no sense to me.

So yeah, there you have it—the truth off my chest.

Edit or update whatever you want to call it

I didn't expect this post to get so much attention. This is my first time posting here. This is not AI or fake. English is not my first language, but I am somewhat fluent. My grammar isn't the best, so I asked AI to correct it, I don't see a problem with that. And seeing how some people are roasting me in the comments for being with a cheater, saying my child deserves better, hoping he's not a doormat like his mom, and that I deserve this I can only imagine what the comments would look like if my grammar was bad! As for those commenting about my child: He doesn't know anything about this. He's never seen us argue, all he sees is what we let him see. Apart from the things I mentioned, we've had a very loving relationship the cheating 5 years ago I forgave and I dont regret that, we have been happy trust is still hard sometimes, but at the moment in the present he has not given me reasons to think that he has cheated or though about it. I understand what people are saying, that he might be abusive or mentally manipulating me but I dont really see it that way maybe when we argue but I don't think he does that on purpose or maybe I'm just blind . Right now, I’m thinking this might be something he's confusing with a dream, or something like some people have said. Thinking back, I have mentally blocked out a lot from that time, I had a very stressful and traumatic pregnancy, and it's not something I want to get into or talk about. I posted this just to get it off my chest.

Please don't offend me in the comments that's just mean, and don't bring my son into it he has nothing to do with this!","5741","275"

We had the carpets cleaned today. My brother broke his bed when moving it a few days ago. So, while I was at class today my grandparents gave him MY bed. They took my chair (had a small hole in the arm from my cat) out of my room and threw it in the dumpster we have rented while packing the house. Without asking me.

I pay rent, my car insurance, and help with the utility bills. Iave a job, I'm almost 19, and in college. My brother is 23, doesn't pay rent, can't hold down a job for more than 6 months, went to one semester of college and dropped out, racked up $15,000 of credit card debt ""fixing"" his truck which still isn't running, and has never lived outside my grandparent's home.

I am exhausted from working my ass off. We had a family emergency, so my one support system, my mom (who is also my best friend), had to fly back to my home state to help out my great uncle and cousin. I don't have anyone right now and I don't know how to cope.","3","0"

I don't have any regrets about having the surgery and I'm excited for it to be done and over.

I did everything I could to make her happy. I even observed Roza (fasting) for her during Ramadan despite not being Muslim myself. I thought we had something real, something worth fighting for. But slowly, things changed.

She became distant, cold, and dismissive. Conversations turned into arguments, and it felt like I had to beg for her time and attention. She started blocking me randomly, only to unblock me when she wanted to talk. It felt like a cycle of manipulation—push and pull.

Our last conversation was painful. She told me outright that she wouldn’t have texted me if I hadn’t agreed with her. And when I told her I didn’t want to compete in arguments anymore, she responded with, “Text me over Insta DM if I feel like it, then blocking back.”

That hurt. It made me feel like I was nothing to her, just an option she could pick up and discard at will. I’ve spent so much time wondering—was I just a mistake to her? Did she ever love me, or was I just convenient at the time?

Now, she’s gone, and I’m left with all these memories. I still hope one day she realizes my love and my value, but deep down, I don’t know if she ever will.","1","2"

I've always wanted to be something big and keep improving myself over time to reach those dreams and goals i have and she doesn't. The only thing she wants is to be a mom, thats it. No drive for a good job, good career, legacy just nothing besides the bare minimum.

Despite all of this i still love her. I'm frustrated with myself cause maybe i did something along the way to make her this way? I'm not sure, but it's heartbreaking and at this point I'm just waiting to get to a good place where I can afford my own house and live on my own. I'm sorry I failed you b.","0","14"
"t3_1j626pw","My chronic illness has taken my will to live","I (22 F) have had a chronic condition for more than 10 years now.

The thing is, it's something I haven't seen mentioned before or other people experiencing it. I feel so alone and I've seriously considered an ""escape route"" in the sense that I genuinely do not have a will to live.

I have a chronic sore throat and it's ruining my life. I cannot drink or eat anything cold without getting ill after. Absolutely anything. I cannot just eat ice cream and enjoy cold drinks.  I always have a lump in my throat no matter what I do. After I eat/drink something cold or when I'm sick, this lump gets thicker and inflammation follows.

But the worst of all is second hand ciggarette smoke and other dense smokes. Just feeling it makes this lump get thicker and I start coughing.

I cannot walk normally on the street and always have to avoid smokers that are everywhere. I cannot go out to bars, hang with people my age because they're all smoking. I am the insane one.

The doctors do not care since there is no concerning inflammation and I've been told to just deal with the smoke and ""avoid"" it as if that's possible. (I live in Eastern Europe) I've also had my tonsils removed, because the inflammation affected my bones and heart, but even after that, there's been no improvement.

The thing that's causing it is a bacteria called staphylococcus aureus and this chronic state most likely developed when I failed to do a treatment properly. I've been desperate to find an explanation for my pain on my own and was able to find just one scientific paper studying the sensitivity of this bacteria to second hand ciggarette smoke.

I wish I could live somewhere isolated without pollution from smoke, but it's not likely since I'm just an average woman. No skills to survive on my own, nor the resilience for that. I am so tired.

I do not see a future for myself. I've never had a relationship due to some other reasons in the past, and I don't see myself having one because of this.

Also sorry if this isn't the appropriate sub for this. I mostly posted this as a cry for help and maybe to attempt at finding people who relate. I'll remove my post if needed. Thanks for reading.","6","1"
"t3_1j5i1na","My sister’s now ex-boyfriend/baby daddy was my abuser.","My sister (f 30), has been with her baby daddy(m 30) for about 15 years now. He’s very much an abusive, manipulative, disgusting person that feeds off of people’s weaknesses. They’ve been together quite literally half her life, since she was in high school and at the time I was about 12 years old. At first he was an amazing brother in law and did all the cool stuff that comes with the brother territory. Then once I reached 14 all hell broke loose. I won’t go into too much detail but my sister’s baby daddy sexually assaulted me from from the ages of 14 until I was almost 17. Her and I had a huge falling out after the fact due to her denying it ever happened even though she was there for a few of the occurrences. He’s a very violent man and has even attempted to murder a misbehaving dog by strangulation that he had owned. I always had a sneaking suspicion that he had been laying his hands on my sister but after two days ago, my suspicions have been confirmed. A few days ago I got a call from my nana(f 71) stating that the baby daddy had beaten my sister pretty badly. He blackened her eye, busted her lip, attempted to strangle her(he left hand prints on her neck), and beat her in the stomach with a broom handle. In a panic, she managed to get away, escaping to a neighbor woman’s house a few blocks away. After he tried searching for her in his pickup truck, he then called my father and stated she was missing. He even tried filing a missing person report for her. Unfortunately for him, my sister had already contacted the authorities and notified them of the attempted murder. The cops escorted her the next day to get her two children from him and she’s currently in a women’s shelter until my nana can get to her.

I don’t wish what she went through on anyone and I hate that she even had to endure any of that. I can only imagine the turmoil and sorrow she feels. Especially having been with someone for so very long. The problem I’m struggling with is setting aside my pride and being there for her in her time of need. We haven’t spoken in 5 years. At this point we’re two very different people.  I think back to me being that scared 14 year old that no one believed or cared to stand up for. I had messages and physical marks on me at the time and the adults failed me. I know she was a victim too, but it’s hard for me to forget her part as well. Any advice would be much appreciated, but please be kind. Thanks Reddit.","93","18"
"t3_1j6ch02","I don’t know how to feel about my girlfriend","I only come on here whenever I’m the most sad. It’s quite depressing but I also don’t have anyone to talk to about it. I truly don’t know if I really love my girlfriend. We were just on call and she said she was gonna call me back but she went out to eat with her friends. Ever since she started school we’ve been texting less and seeing each other less and it almost just feels like we have our own lives. A month ago we hung out all the time and I was so happy being with her. Now she prefer to hangout with her friends or she’s busy and we just don’t have time for each other. She’s a sweet girl but I don’t feel much for her now. I want a girl I can have time for and be with. But she doesn’t seem to really want to be with me. It doesn’t even feel like a relationship. I barely see her, no romance or contact is going on. I crave so much just for us to not be able to do anything. I feel like I’ve lost interest in her and I don’t want it to be that way cause I feel bad. But how can we be lovers when we aren’t lovey dovey or we don’t see each other or anything. It could just be a boring period right now but I just can’t do it anymore. I need someone who I can be with that we will have time for each other and be with each other","1","6"
"t3_1j68vbh","The Wrong Guy","Hey all,

I feel silly to be in this spot making this post but I just needed to get this off my chest.

I (23 M) started talking to Walter (49 M fake name) a few months ago. He found me on an app based around a certain fandom, which name I’ll be leaving off, where we ended up connecting.

I knew he was older, and I know better. But he’s so charming. And I just feel so silly because I can see the red flags but fuck is he so easy to talk to and he makes me so happy.

Walter is not well, he told me he has BPD. He’s had to do two stays in mental hospital in the times I’ve known him. Well, today, we were talking, everything was normal. And then randomly, he texted me that he took a bunch of pills and that he was sitting outside of a hospital and I just started panicking. I mean, what the hell.

I feel like I should state, I too am mentally ill. I just have started making improvements to my quality of life, and I thought Walter was as well. We’ve been bonding over growing as individuals. Trying to keep each other up. Y’know. So I was really worried to see this turn today.

He said he was on the phone with the hotline. I asked him if I needed to call for help. I pleaded with him. I sent him audio messages because he tells me how cute I am. I pleaded. And he just said how cute I was, and asked me to say please like that when we meet.

He kept telling me how much he’s going to miss me and sending me virtual hugs and just complimenting me.

I know. I know better. I know what’s going on. I don’t know why I’m still letting myself fall for him. He’s just so smooth. He makes me feel safe. I feel like he understands me. He listens to me. I just. Is there. And I don’t have many people there for me. And I know that’s not a reason but just. Here is where I am in life. I didn’t think I would find myself in this position but I haven’t heard from him in 2 hours. He said he thinks he likes me. He brought back up when he asked me out, but I turned him down then. He’s just a weird little guy that I think I’m starting to like.

It feels good to say that. I can’t really explain this to people my friends my age. My best friend knows about him, but not that I like him or flirt with him back. I just don’t know if they’d understand. I know what’s happening, and honestly I’m okay with it right now. I probably deserve this happening to me. Because I put someone else through this before. I’ve been the suicidal guy making someone plead for me. I am not proud of that guy I was. And I am making these changes to my life and trying so hard to be better. But maybe before I get better I should go through what I did someone first.

Maybe it won’t be bad. Maybe I’m worried over nothing. But he is truly sweet. Maybe it doesn’t always have to turn bad.","2","0"
"t3_1j6lzc5","I think adults unaccompanied by children that judge at Disney are ridiculous","I have two toddlers. We live in Florida, so we take them Disney. Initially we wanted to wait until they were old enough, but it became hard to find places to go on vacation or long weekends that had facilities for children.

Today we were at one on the parks — and at a slower ride intended for all ages (toddler friendly), when our youngest threw a tantrum (1.5M). It was close 30 minutes until nap time, and he’s been teething.  We decided to come celebrate my eldest’s birthday (3M), and especially since the recent passing of my father left him very sad and aggressive toward others at daycare (he cried seeing photos of my dad and asking where he was).

We apologized to the two women next to us, as my youngest threw things on the ground near them. They started off saying that it’s OK. Then they proceeded to let us know that they never came to the parks before a certain age, and that my kids would be better “just by the pool or something.” Keep in mind, we are in the Disney Junior area. And that drowning is a common cause of death in young children, and I know at least three families that have experienced that loss. I tried to keep it nice and then I finally said “you know, they usually do well with travel, they’re just tired today.” And said goodbye.

Was biting my tongue the whole time and wanted to remind them that this is a ride meant for younger children, and not adults in their 20’s-60’s (the two women were mother and daughter). I never understand the idea “children must be seen and not heard.” At a children’s ride in a theme park that is centered and based on children’s cartoons and film. I don’t care if adults show to the parks, but it’s insane that adults want to also keep children acting like children from children’s spaces.","0","17"
"t3_1j682gi","I like love but dont want to love","To be honest, I just wanted to write down how I been feeling since I broke up with my ex more than a year ago. I (18F) like and enjoy loving people, and I love loving things, have you heard ""Under Pressure"" by david bowie and queen? basically it represents my vision of love. And honestly i really hate how people now forget that love its the thing that moves the world, love for power, money, for people, etc. So i honestly really want to love someone and feel a unique connection even if it last just a week, i want to feel something real sometimes. But then I think about life, specifically in my country where I can only focus on having a decent career a d get money to pay the future bills. I really like being single as I have to give explanations to no one when i go out or stuff like that, but sometimes feeling someone's body close to yours (not in a sexual way) its all you need. Sorry if it makes no sense, english aint my first language 😓, and this is mostly a venting post. Im not sad nor want comfort as i dont think I need it yet i just wanted to express it.","2","0"
"t3_1j5gnd5","I survived cancer and no one around me really cares","Not to sound whiny or anything. I'm in my early 20s and it wasn't a ""you have 6 months to live"" situation. Super high rate of surviving and all that. I finished my treatment last Fall and now I'm just here, stuck at home, recovering.

I'm alright, physically. And I don't expect people to put their lives on pause just because I got cancer. But it's like I beat it and the moment just passed. I know it's not that important to other people and in the grand scheme of things, it's just a blip in a whole lifetime.

For me, though, I'm missing out on a whole year of college and it was going to be my last one. I'm at home and depressed, feeling mentally worse than I have in a while. I'm covered in scars on my torso that will never go away. I'm happy I'm alive and all that, but I guess I didn't realize that cancer just isn't a big deal if you live or it's not one of the more well known ones.

I've just got no one to talk to about it, I guess. In a literal sense I do- my friends and my family. But not really. They don't care that much and then I feel like I'm dragging it out. So, I just finished some late night cleaning and now I'm feeling a bit sorry for myself. A little pathetic and I'm not quite sure what to do now.

Anyways, congrats to me for beating cancer! 🎉","105","60"
