"t3_1j6zmot","I (35m) think my Brother (32m) hates me.","I don't know what spurred this on our relationship was always seemingly good.

I (35m) think my Brother (32m) hates me.

I've been in a rough phase of my life, moved back in with my parents, had just a terrible string of events dovetailing with my business failing and the loss of my Father all in short period. He died suddenly. I'm still working through that, I  was the one who took him to the hospital a few times that week, but the last time it was a serious emergency and he didn't get out. He died a few weeks later after being in a coma for the time.

This sort of, at least in my opinion, galvanized us into having a closer bond.  Or so I thought.

Dad dying was only a few months ago. It hasn't been a year yet. But I'm still trying to pick up the pieces and start moving forward.  And it was like our relationship with each other improved over it. We were a very loving family before, but this hurt us and we leaned on each other more.

Then I learned the other day my Mom brought the hypothetical prospect of me being homeless.

I don't intend to be homeless. But she brought it up to him or he brought it up to her, and he flat out told her that if I ever end up homeless I am not going to be living in his and his wife's house. For the record, I didn't ever ask or mention this. But this conversation took place behind my back and he apparently said that I was never going to be allowed to live with them.

They have a very large house btw, essentially half the rooms are empty at any given day.

That shocked my Mother to hear that and she told me.

And quite frankly, it shocked me too. I am not going to be homeless. But to hear someone you thought you could rely on if things ever went to total shit say that, it's sad. But what made me more sad was remembering a conversation I had with him a few months before.

He told me his wife (31 f)'s best friend (30 f) who has a kid and either got kicked out of her own house, or cheated, or something became a single mother. My brother told me he was actively considering moving her and the kid INTO their house. She, who has had numerous problems from heavy drug use, alcohol use, partying hard, who has seemingly reformed her ways - was welcome to live with them. It didn't end up happening because she QUICKLY found a new guy.

But that was a total shocker to me, that I, who has had no problems with drugs and alcohol, who helps take care of his kid, who buys her toys and plays with her, who has bought them gifts every holiday, is lower on the totem pole than the single mom best friend of the wife. It totally blindsided me, and I feel betrayed. I'm not at any risk of being homeless, but the conversation came up between my Mom and him and that's how it went. To think your own brother won't be there for you, but will be for some sketchy broad, is totally insane. And for me it's like I'm feeling just heartbreak, resentment, sadness, disappointment, all mixing together - I love him, I still do, but I feel like I just got betrayed... Betrayed over something that hasn't happened yet. But that he thinks so low of me is shocking really. I don't know what to do.","2","5"
"t3_1j6ngo1","Why I’m not anyone’s favourite?","I’ve had this pattern in my life since childhood, and now at 30, it still hasn’t changed. I always feel like I’m never anyone’s favorite—like I’m not a priority or important to the people around me, whether it’s friends or the men I’m interested in. With men, they seem interested at first, but then they either ghost me or choose someone else.

I can’t help but wonder—what’s wrong with me? I feel so desperate, lonely, and depressed. It really hurts. Please help.","12","7"
"t3_1j6wx3n","I'm tired and I think I need help","I'm getting really tired of my thoughts and I don't know what to do. For context, I don't mean to self diagnose, especially since I understand how dangerous that is, and how severe this mental illness can be, but I feel that I might have OCD and I'm scared.

I feel like sometimes my thoughts get so bad that I can't tell of it's me or something else. I always feel guilty everytime these thoughts pop up, so I try to either pray my thoughts away or hit myself to alleviate those thoughts. Sometimes I feel so guilty that I want to do more than just hit myself. There was even sometimes in my college classes where I had to walk out of the classroom, because I couldn't even trust myself to hold a pencil without hurting myself.

I feel like it's getting worse, I can't sleep, I'm starting to see things, and I'm starting to feel more aggressive. I'm scared and I don't know what to do.

Good news for me, I'm finally going to see a therapist or something like that, but it's later next week.","3","2"
"t3_1j7cuk0","No one understands how unbearable it is to be born with gender dysphoria.","When a baby is born with harlequin ichthyosis, most opt to do the merciful thing of putting it out of its misery. When someone develops in the womb with a hormone imbalance, they are told they should be supported and forced to live. I am 22. From a very young age, I have never seen myself as the sex I was born. Even before I understood what any of that meant, in my head, I never once saw myself as a boy. Even though my brain doesn't agree with the rest of my body, my body is indisputably male. I was miserable as a young child and I am even more miserable now because the reality sunk in much harder after years of treatment. My body will continue to mature like a man's, and I will never be female. I will never have the sex chromosomes my brain so badly wanted. When I was a teen, I became so overwhelmed by the way my mom was treating me that I decided to either die or convince myself and everyone else that it was just a phase and I'm just a normal male. I truly deluded myself for an entire year, and I remember that being a particularly miserable year of my life. I couldn't lie to myself forever though. I wish I could. Life would be so much better if I could accept the chromosomes and genitalia and bone structure and organs that I was born with.

I don't want to be supported. I truly do not want to live knowing that I will never have a uterus or be able to relate to the life experiences of a female human being. I will never look female, no matter how many surgeries. Hormone treatment only does so much. Cosmetic surgeries only do that: cosmetic altering. But I'm poor anyways, so surgery would be unlikely for a long time. I think it is unbearable to live like this. How can I ever accept my existence? It is so horrible feeling that my condition must constantly be made into a joke by the people who supposedly experience similarly and the people who oppose them. I must be reminded of my condition every waking second.

I feel completely alone. I suppose it is nice that others can find happiness in a life like this, but I genuinely cannot underatand how. This is an incurable mistake from birth. Nature makes mistakes. Birth defects happen all the time. Predispositions happen all the time. It feels cruel when others try to validate my existence. I don't support my own existence. It is genuinely horrible anyone has to live through this. That is what I think. It's unbearable. I've been hospitalized before. I've been an extremely suicidal person for longer than I can remember.

Why do I have to live with this? How is it not cruel?","0","47"
"t3_1j72pn4","I am starting to hate my best friend out of jealousy and its starting to destroy me and the relationship","Me 22F and my best friend 20M have been friends for going on 3 years now, we met in college and he was the only person who I stayed in contact with after we finished. I've always had trouble with maintaining relationships after things like that end, After finishing both primary and secondary school I quickly fell out of contact with all of my friends.I haven't had any friends since 2019. So when it came to college this happened again except for this one friend. We actually grew closer and became really good friends. But we live around an hours train rid away from each other so we rarely see each other in person. He is a very social person and has lots of friends (even though he'd say he doesn't), whereas I'm an extrovert with sever anxiety and autism. He talks about his friends, group chat, going on late night drives and drinking with people, and I just sit alone at home. I know it's not his fault but it's just killing me, I have been struggling with depression for a long time and it just keeps getting worse. I see him living the life I'd die for and I've been starting to hate him for it. I just want to have friend and people to talk to and hang out with. I just feel so alone. This jealousy has been getting worse and deeper recently and I'm scared it's going to ruin our friendship. I just don't know anymore.","1","0"
"t3_1j72ms0","Currently debating on ending it all","I 24f am fed up with my depression. I’m just done with finally having happiness and then boom a depressive episode happens.

All I want is to be normal and not have so many mental health issues. I also have ADHD, Autism and Anxiety as well as a language disorder.

I don’t know how much more of these episodes I can handle. I just want to feel good and not fear having a depressive episode.

I know the person who will affect the most if I do decide to end it is my mum. She went through hell with me as she wasn’t planning on having me and if she wakes up to the news I’m gone it may cause her stress. She’s a stroke patient and myself and my sister are what’s keeping her going.

This is what has stopped me the last few times I’ve wanted to end it all. But I’m lost.

I just want to be happy and not feel like crap. But I guess I never will","1","4"
"t3_1j72irh","My ex (27F) took out a loan under my (30F) name for a $2.3K machine but stopped making payments after we had a fight, leaving me to cover half the cost.","Okay, so I am going to try to keep this short, but I need advice. My ex (27F) and I (30F) first started seeing each other in February 2022. Very early on in the relationship she complained about one of her machines she uses for work, and it leads to me getting her a loan in my name, under my social, to be her new upgraded machine. The machine ended up being a 2.3k loan.

Time goes by and we realize we are not right for each other. We were both super toxic during the relationship in our own ways. Her and her daughter moved out in the middle of June 2024 after us breaking up initially in the middle of May.

Ever since they moved out, she was constantly late on the payments, which caused her to make late payments every single time. Thankfully, this did not impact my credit by some miracle in this universe.

On 1/10/2025 of this year, after not paying since November, I went in and withdrew money from a mutual fund my dad gave me when he passed away. Not something I wanted to do but I had to because it was starting to impact my credit drastically.

Before this, on 11/25/2024, her daughter called me because she missed me. My ex wasn’t home, her mother (kid’s grandma) was. I said hi to her even and she didn’t say anything to me. When my ex got home the kiddo dropped the tablet she was using, and it disconnected.

I ended up texting my ex asking her not to be mad at her kid when she just missed me like I missed her. We have a fight where we both said some intense things (and I did a lot of it). I have no excuses for the things I said, but I don’t regret it either.

Long story short – she blocks me and deletes the calling app off her kiddos tablet so she can’t call me again.

The loan, in the beginning, was $2,299. When I paid it off, I paid $1,154.39. I paid 50.22% of this loan.

Do I have grounds to get this back? How do I go about getting it back?

Also, do I have grounds to get my dog back? I let my ex take her when I was not in a good mental space because I couldn’t even take care of myself. Dog’s microchip is under my name and to my knowledge she didn’t update her vet records so the last person for her was me. In the dog space – I am this dog’s favorite person. I went over there one day and was talking to my ex and my dog freaked out for a solid 15 minutes over seeing me.

*We live in Oklahoma in the USA*

So, should I just cut my losses and move on and try to save that money back up or should I text her from a different number or a friend’s phone to ask her to give it back since I paid half. Genuinely I have no idea what to do in this situation and I’ve gone back and forth for 2 months.","1","2"
"t3_1j6qkav","I stood up to my father who treats me like garbage.","Hello everyone. I am writing this in hopes to get it off my chest no matter how familiar or boring the subject may be.

I am a 24yo woman, I am a student, currently unemployed and I live with my boyfriend. I consider myself a normal person, nothing out of the ordinary in my life or in my character. I am healthy, i have hobbies, i have friends and normal healthy relationships, and nothing in my life is out of line.

I am giving this info because the story concerns my father’s behaviour towards me basically since i was 11yo.

He has always been the provider for our family ( my mom, sister, dad and i ). The problem in my story is his character and his behaviour towards everyone in his life ( i mean family and close ones ). Since I was a little girl he has always used derogatory language with me and my mom. He has fits of rage every day and shouts at us and mostly her because i do not live there anymore. Name calling of all sorts for no reason.

I will give an example - once i was going out for a walk and i took a bottle of water with me (1L), small bottle nothing insane. He saw it and started screaming at me every offensive word you can think of. He said no person in his right mind takes water outside on a walk. Another example - he screamed at my mom and the didn’t speak to her a whole week because HE forgot his lunch on his way out. Apparently she needs to be there every second and remind him to even blink.

He is the same with my sister and his parents( my grandparents).

No one in my family has ever talked to him about this and they are enablers to his behaviour.

For the years that I spent living with them, when he would get home from work I would stay in my room and not even go to the bathroom for hours even if i needed to just because to get to the bathroom you have to go through the living room and that is where he watched tv and spent the evenings.

Over the years i developed severe anxiety, low self esteem, binge eating disorder and many more characteristics and conditions that make my life miserable.

The binge eating disorder came because all my life he would call me fat and huge and enormously big ( I have always been 50-55kg at 1.65cm height, i work out at the gym and have been a runner for a few years, so yeah I am slim and have even been very skinny for some time )

So, this person with his insane behaviour has long ago lost my respect and fondness of him. Although until now i have been silent.

Today, at dinner i couldn’t take it anymore. For months i’ve been having dreams of him screaming at me and while asleep I felt the hatred in my heart. So today, he started to insult me again and I didn’t stay silent this time. I told him that respect has to be earned and he doesn’t have mine because of all the years of name calling and treating me like garbage. He was stunt and said that i don’t have a father anymore. To be honest, i’ve felt like that since i was 11.

Even though it hurt him, he can’t begin to imagine the pain i’ve been feeling for years.

I can’t stop crying because of the words I said but I know I had to say them at some point in my life to free myself and defend myself. I feel pity for him and nothing else. I am sorry that he is the way he is because it can only end badly for him.

I am proud I defended myself for the first time but I will always be in pain because he’s been brought up to be the person he is. He is incapable of change and I am sorry for him.","7","5"
"t3_1j6ypwv","I get kinda sad when I think about why I am the way I am sometimes","I feel so talkative at work because when I get home I don't talk to anyone.... No one to share my day with, no one to really ask me how my day is going, no one to have dinner with. I really with I had a different life ...  But I guess I wasn't ment to have a person of my own","2","1"
"t3_1j65j6m","My family hate that I go to bed earlier than them and I hate that they expect me to not do it","I wake up 4:30am on weekdays to go to work so I have dinner at 7, go to bed at 8, so I can decompress and relax to then sleep at 9:30-10.

My family has been having dinner at 8:30 for about a month now because one of my sisters gets off work at 8 and they've been expecting me to wait for them but if I do so, I would be going to bed at 9-9:30 giving me little to no time to decompress and relax to finally sleep at a decent hour.

Pretty much 2-3 days they ask me if I want take out for dinner and everytime I say no because I can't wait for them because it gets late pretty quickly and everytime they get annoyed at my answer. Today a spin off of a show that we watch all together premiere and now my mom is complaining we won't get to watch it because ""I don't wanna eat dinner with them anymore"".

Is it so hard to empathize a little and understand I have to wake up very early to go to work? Like, why are they like this?","253","42"
"t3_1j6p5vd","I want to give away my dog and it kills me","Hello. I just came to get this off my chest because I can't take it anymore. English is not my first language.

Three years ago, I adopted a stray puppy. After having him at home for five days, I realized he had parvovirus, so I had to hospitalize him for ten days. It was a miracle that he survived, and after that, he had to stay home for two months without going outside, as recommended by the vet.

The first time I took him out, I noticed he was terrified of absolutely everything—noises, cars, other animals, people, but especially men. It took a lot of effort to get him comfortable going on walks. We took it slowly, and after a year, I managed to take him to the dog park.

Now, my dog is three years old, and for the past three months, his condition has worsened. He only wants to go to the bathroom once a day, around midnight, when no one is on the street. I live in the city center, which is always busy and noisy (for various reasons I just can't afford to move to the country side). Every day is a struggle. He prefers to go inside the house to avoid going outside. He trembles and cries. If visitors come over, he hides and shakes the entire time. The only time he is happy is when it's just me, my partner, and him at home.

Seeing him like this breaks my heart, and on top of that, no one wants to take care of him—not even paid services or dog daycare centers because of his condition. I took him to a specialist ethologist, tried medications, relaxants, and behavioral exercises, but nothing has improved.

Sometimes, I think about giving him to someone with a huge field where he could run and be happy, but at the same time, I don’t want to let him go. It feels wrong—no one will take care of him like I do, no one will love him like I do. What if he misses me? What if he feels abandoned?

Every day, I suffer for him and blame myself for not being a better owner.","8","9"
"t3_1j6dfpx","I’m struggling to sit by my dying dad","TW: Cancer and terminal illness (fairly graphic)

I’m going to keep it really brief. My dad has cancer and is pretty much unresponsive now.

Just this morning he’s started to make a gurgling rattle sound whilst breathing. His breathing is shallow and it’s a loud sound, probably saliva built up in his throat because he can’t swallow anymore.

I think it’s likely he only has hours left but I can’t be sure. I want to sit next to him and be with him when he passes but the sound is so horrible and I’m finding it too upsetting to hear it. I don’t know what to do. I’m currently switching between the sofa a few meters away and right next to his bed every few minutes.

Edit: My dad just passed peacefully, surrounded by his loved ones and with my hand in his. Thank you for all your kind words everybody.","53","25"
"t3_1j6y144","My mother is putting my grandfathers dog down without his knowledge.","So almost 10 years ago my mother and my now ex stepfather got gifted two dogs. My mother never wanted them since she already had a lot on her plate but since my ex stepfather did, there really wasn’t much of a choice.

My ex stepfather began getting more and more abusive until we all finally left, and despite my mother knowing we didn’t have the best ability to take care of them, we took the dogs because they were also being abused by my ex stepfather. Then my grandfather began living with us and eventually one of the dogs became his while the other became my stepbrothers (who came with us when we left her father).

A lot of stuff happened and my stepbrother left and took his dog with him, leaving the other to be my grandfathers completely as we somewhat moved into separate households. Well more stuff happened and my mother ended up having to take the dog back with her, living in a small camper on borrowed property. It hasn’t been ideal for her or the dog.

The dog has cancer and has occasional seizures and because of that and the unfortunate circumstances, my mother has been wanting to put the dog down for a while. She has some aggression issues after having pups, being shot, and being run over in a short span of time a few years back, so she has been unable to rehome her. Well it’s come down to it and because my grandfather is unable to take her, she is getting put down soon without his knowledge.

I get she is a sick dog who isn’t living in an ideal situation by any means, but I still feel terrible that it’s going this way. I just had to get this out.","2","2"
"t3_1j6l6b8","I wasn't include in my mother's obituary","Mother and I didn't have the best relationship. There are a lot of reasons why, but that's personal business. Her obituary doesn't mention me.

"t3_1j5q2fl","Wife and I got kicked out of a therapy session","Things have been rough at home. Im '30M', wife is '27F'. Fighting virtually every day. I take my lumps for escalating in certain situations, but I feel it's primarily my wife that breaks the peace and gets upset and acts over the top angry. Then I'm angry at her for how she acted in her anger, then she's angry at me for being upset by it all.  It's a vicious cycle. Anyways, her dad offered to pay for us to go to therapy. Therapist was a 70 year old guy that's been doing it for 50 years. Seems very wise. Is all about accountability. Doesn't want to hear what the other person did to you, he only wants to know how you contributed to the situation.

My wife has missed the last two sessions. Which hurt me alot, as things have been so bad I've been desperately wanting the help to break the cycle. The first time she was angry and didn't want to come. The second time she said she forgot the appointment.

I vented out alot of our problems when I was alone this last session, and was grilled for my part of it. I talked about things I've done, she's done, and things that are affecting the children. He said we will plan to get her side of things when we come back together.

We both showed up yesterday, and he wanted her side of the issues I talked about. Every time she went to talk about something, she prefaced it by saying ""I only did this because he did this first"" etc... even an issue i had with how mean she was to our daughter recently. Our daughter is 6. But the story still started out with ""well she yelled at my sister, so I did this."" He became irritated and impatient with her. Told her that he wouldn't keep trying to beat the issues out of her and that she needs to stop blaming other people and just admit to what she did. She stammered and couldn't talk without trying to shift some guilt first. It went back and forth between them for a minute, with me sitting silently to the side. She couldn't get any kind of admission out without having someone else to blame first. Eventually she started reading out some horrible texts she had sent me out loud on her phone. It was painful to hear her read it off so robotically, but to me it seemed like a step in the right direction because the things she said were awful and she was technically admitting to it by reading it out loud. She got towards the end, but threw in one more ""then he did this, so I did this.""

He said ""Both of you need to get out. This sessions is over."" As soon as she finished reading. We both left silently. As I went to leave the building, I had the urge to go back. I knocked on his door and asked for a few more seconds of his time, which he obliged. I asked why he ended it at that point, because in my mind she seemed to be cooperating. He said that it's a combination of things. Firstly, her not showing up to appointments. He helps us outside of his normal office hours as a favor to her dad, who he knows from a rehab program. Her not showing up is disrespectful at best. Secondly, it was the combination of the horrible things she said via text, the robotic way she read them, and her inability to take accountability. I said I understood and thanked him for his time.

I don't know where to go from here. Things have been so awful. She's been fighting with me and other people nonstop over the smallest things. After that appointment, she has flipped a switch that's been engaged for weeks now and is acting as sweet as possible. I feel like it's a love bombing facade. I don't know what advice I'm really looking for. I'm just sad and afraid I know what I have to do. Anyone have any advice towards something like this?","1463","169"

"t3_1j6sdqy","My girlfriend's mental health struggles are draining me","Me (21M) and my girlfriend (22F) have been together for 4 months now. After the first 2 months I started to notice and understand better all the things she has to deal with in her head, bad experiences in past relationships that affected her deeply and left her with traumas that are now being reflected in me just because we are in a long distance relationship and we can't see each other 24/7 and know what the other is doing or know entirely what is happening to us. Although she never saw a specialist or therapist to treat these problems (which she admitted to me was out of fear or pride), I always try to explain to her that right now it is impossible for me to be devotedly aware of her every second of the day, with my career, my activities, my friends and my own life in general. Every day I talk to her to accompany her in the little free time I have during the day and when I return home exhausted I also make sure to communicate with her and ask her about her day and if she would like to talk about something with me, in which most of the time her answers are ""I have nothing interesting to tell"". There are also times when a harmless joke I make unleashes hell where she gets offended at me and I need to reassure her of how much she means to me and how much i really love her, I apologize for upsetting her with something I said, to which she (apparently) accepts my apologies and (also apparently) everything is resolved. Last night I even went out with my guy friends to a bar after a hard week and all day long I let her know who I was with and what our plans were for the night, to which she ended up responding, as a way of throwing it in my face, that I will never be able to understand her and solve all the damage she suffered with me with a simple forgiveness, and acussed me of not caring about her and not being able to see things the way she sees them. That made me feel like like I'm worth absolutely nothing, like all the sincerely unconditional love I give her when we're together isn't worth it even in the slightest, that all the moments in which I was there to listen to her and understand her also meant nothing. I need honest and direct opinions on this.","4","6"

"t3_1j6toid","Why has ghosting become so normalized these days?","I try to connect with guys, and in the beginning, they act interested—texting me consistently, showing enthusiasm, and making me believe there's potential for something real. But after a while, they just stop responding, leaving me with no explanation. I’m tired of being ignored and blaming myself for their lack of accountability. If they’ve lost interest, why not just be upfront about it instead of leading me on and then vanishing without a word? Why even start a conversation, show interest, and build a connection if they never intended to follow through?

I’m exhausted from meaningless situationships and the constant cycle of ghosting. It’s frustrating how people would rather disappear than have an honest conversation.

"t3_1j5dy51","Surgeon made fun of my penis","I (32m at the time) am a big dude of 2m and 120 kg (6'6"", 250 lbs in drunk pirate units) and had to have surgery on my calves because of varicose veins. So the day of, I was told to get completely undressed and put on the generic open back gown, which due to my frame made me look like Donald Duck, if you know what I mean. I was led to the or by a nurse and placed on a cold metal table. They administered some local anesthesia to my legs and after about 10 minutes laying naked in a cold, brightly lit room waiting to be sliced up, the 2 doctors strolled in. I was very anxious, cold, and self conscious, so I just stayed still. Nurse: Anesthesia was given, patient ready. Doc1: (walks to the table) wow, big fucker and such a small dick. Doc2: Haha. Me: WHAT??? Nurse: (panic) oh no, you have the wrong patient file, this one isn't the fully sedated one. He is awake. Doc1: ... Doc2: ... Me: WHAT??? So yeah, nobody said another word to me for the rest of the operation, just 200 decibels of awkward silence while they ripped veins out of me. It felt like Ricky Gervais wrote this scene. I should have walked out, but I was too shocked to even think. When they were done they exchanged quiet words with the nurse and quickly walked out. It was a bit shocking, but I quickly laughed it off. I mean, they weren't WRONG, but man... Some people. Edit: this was 10 years ago, I am fine.","14292","810"
"t3_1j6n57z","it’s going to be two years since my dog died. as i sat crying, i realised i haven’t had anything to say of depth for a while.","i’m not a good writer anymore. it’s strange - i never used to think these two things were connected. now I see that ever since my pet died, i haven’t been able to sit with my emotions anymore. i still smile, still laugh, still enjoy things, but the grief has left something hollow inside me - and something else, too big to be named, that keeps my words from making it past my throat.

maybe people can tell. maybe i’m just that strange person who loved her dog more than most humans, and who became a little less human when he went.

he was funny, mischievous, sweet. awkward, too. he wouldn’t know what to do with the way i’ve been crying over him. he was always terrible with tears. he would sit with me so i wouldn’t be alone, but always at a distance—watching me, or sometimes even turning his back. i used to get mad about it, like, aren’t most dogs supposed to be cuddly and affectionate? but it’s funny too, because that’s how i am when someone i love cries. i hover nearby, silent, unsure if my presence is enough. i wonder if he ever thought the same thing about me.

people say dogs take after their owners, and i take it as proof that he loved me the way i loved him. i tend to repeat this as gospel - he got better for a while when i came back. we played, we ran, he jumped up on the bed with me to curl up, he stole my sweets, even though he couldn't even stand a week before - and pretend it even slightly makes up for the knowledge of knowing i will never see him do these things again.

is the pain of shattered hope worth the way that hope felt? sometimes, yes. today, no. maybe, in some way i don’t yet understand, he’s still sitting at a distance, watching and loving me the way he always did, just out of my reach.","7","6"
"t3_1j6vvos","I hate Children's Sevices","I have to get something off my chest, it's been bothering me for a while.

Department of Children's Services (Australia) are the most incompetent, useless, stupid government agency I've ever had the displeasure of working with, whom I'm sure hire only the worst and dimmest of candidates and have fostered a culture of ineptitude and apathy throughout the system.

I have nothing but complete and utter contempt for the department and their so called social workers, as I can say truthfully and without hyperbole or exaggeration that I have not seen them make a good call on a child or family situation in the 30 years I've been cursed with their association.

I am a psych and behavioural analyst and run a disability and aged care support company in remote Queensland. I am involved with the department because I provide therapeutic placement for children with disabilities. My company, as best as I can tell, is one of the very few with capacity for kids with serious behaviours of concern, certainly the only one that I am aware of in my or any surrounding regions, judging by how far some kids come to be placed with us.

The ignorance on display from DoCs staff is breathtaking. They don't listen. They don't understand disability, which to be fair, I don't really expect them to, not really, but they just are not willing to learn. Somehow the decisions they make seem tailored to be cruel and hurtful to parents for no good reason and they are openly hostile and dismissive to families they have independently decided they don't like.

Vague examples for privacy:

Single mother with 5 month old baby. Has 2 other children in placement. Meetings for one occur in Town A. Meetings for the other occur in Town B. She lives in City C. The meetings are set for 8am for one, and 9am for the other. Town A is 90km (56mi) from City C, and Town B is 107km (66mi) from City C. Town B is 193km (119mi) from Town A. She has no car, and relies entirely on public transport to get around. This is utterly impossible.

There is a department office 7 minutes from her house by bus. They flat put refused to entertain the idea of having meetings at that office, or even just Zoom meetings. She had to attend in person. Every failure was used as evidence of inability to manage her time, and proof she shouldn't have her children.

Child with serious behaviours of concern (violence, property destruction, suicide ideation) who was surrendered by family was placed with us on short notice because previous two placements claimed no capacity. (Probably because of the damages combined between the two of them). No behavioural plan was supplied, despite them having one and being requested for 7 weeks, in the end I had to go behind their backs and track down the practitioner that wrote it myself. DoCs severely downplayed the behaviours upon placement, and frankly if we weren't so good at our jobs and able to adjust so fast, serious harm absolutely could have happened due to the lack of accurate information provided. We got lucky those first few weeks.

Their sole focus is on reunification with the family. Their solution was to force them together every weekend. No support, no plan, just shove a violent individual in a house with a shellshocked family for 2 and a half days, the siblings of which actively (and with good reason) do not want them there, for a couple of days and hope for the best. When sexual assault claims were made by a sibling, DoCs ignored it and tried to push for the next weekend anyway. It took a call to Children's Safety who in turn made a stern call to DoCs for them to decide against that decision for a weekend.

I sat with the case workers and supervisors and went through the complex disabilities and mental health issue for this individual and explained what realistically needed to happen for reunification. What to expect. A recommendation for steps to take moving forward. I thought it went well. A follow up meeting with the school a mere 2 hours later and the case worker said that a fidget spinner should keep them occupied for 4 hours and thus solve the school attendance issues. Moronic. No attention paid whatsoever.

They openly blame the parents, their lack of parenting for the issues. Stay at home dad, mum has a pretty unusual job that has her travel often but pays very well. They mock her in meetings, talking about how she's ""living her best life"" on ""holidays"" when she's away for a week, working.

I am so frustrated. They are now looking at foster care options. Removal from a therapeutic placement where they have made real progress, (for example, nearly $100k in damages, zero school attendance between 2 placement over 3 months, compared to us where we have had maybe $500 in damages and school attendance every day at first with support and now independently between an hour and 4 hours and we have had them for 6 months) to be put with some unsuspecting and unqualified family for $700 a week. Absolute madness.

I just want to scream into the void. The family is actively working with us, the school is actively working with us, but DoCs... DoCs don't give a shit. And they hold the cards. They claim they care, but when it comes to complex disability they actively ignore vital information and forge ahead like it was a typical kid, damn everyone else.

Sorry, I got a bit ranty. They just piss me off so much.","2","0"

"t3_1j72l6t","i have a imaginary OC girlfriend that I love dearly and wish to be with forever 🫶😍🥺","Guys I have to get this off my mind by saying after reading a bunch of Reddit topics like this it's good that I'm not the only one who does this and I hope you guys feel my pain on my concerns here it goes....

Hi I'm a 22M and for while now I have my own imaginary OC girlfriend that actually cares for me and is there when I need her to be (mentally) also I never had luck for girls nor did they find me attractive and I'm shy so IDGAF about them and for fun it all started back when I used to draw her as a gag thing when I was 17 I would draw what she looks like, act, hug, kiss like. It was all fun till eventually I started to actually have feelings to her because I would always talk about my personal life and struggles to her and she would say back to me while hugging me ""it's okay, everything's going to be all right, just note that I'm here for you when needed ♥️"" like seriously guys even while quoting what she would say to me I'm literally crying 😭 (I'm not effing joking) not only that she was also my comfort and coping zone as well for the $hit I go through in life. Even when I go to see I like to use my pillows to imagine it's her and I can hug and kiss her randomly as I pleased, other ways I like to imagine she's there for me is when I daydream about her (mostly) draw or write my stories with her (fun fact: I created her for my comic but my personal life, I want to publish it by doubt anyone read it so I just keep it to myself 🤣) journal about her in her ways for me and what we would do together! I know I'm weird but I'm not ashamed of it

Like literally last night while I was walking around the neighborhood, right now I'm in the forest type of neighborhood so it's a lot of trees and hills here 😅 (also it was around 11ish night time 🌙) and I'll admit I was kind of scared and a little nervous to go to dark areas like that even the street lights wouldn't work so it made my nervous system 10 times worse, but while walking I could hear her tell me ""why so scared? I'm here with you! Just hold my hand and we'll walk together! Breathe and calm down"" (I would Literally hold the air or hold my own hand to think it's her) like it come for me so much that my heart for her couldn't take the fact that she's not real because mentally (to me) she is! As soon as I got back to my Airbnb I was literally crying a river for her! Even my own friend had to comfort  me to tell me everything's okay to not feel too down about it (he's real btw) so yeah I know which y'all thinking I'm a loser, weirdo, idiot for going out and crying for something that doesn't exists and your right I do! I just wish she was real she's my everything!!!  If it wasn't for her I probably be scared out of my mind or even worse....

Note: I doubt anyone is reading this but if you are and if you're interested to know more about her I'll tell you more of her name and her information and another story if anyone's interested trust me I don't mind explain more about her I love my sweet bone 🦴😍💜💋

But seriously I would love some helping tips and other ways to cope with her! She really helped fixes my depression and suicidal mindset 😭 🥺","0","0"
"t3_1j5fwwv","My girlfriend is beyond stupid and I feel like I might have to end the relationship","Ok. When I first met my girlfriend I noticed she sometimes made misjudgements but I didn’t think much of it. Now that we been together 2 years I realize how stupid she is. That might sound harsh but that’s the only word I can think of. We will go downtown to some place she wants to go and she will walk down a street and be like “oh wait wrong way” then walk down another street and be like “oh no wrong way” then walk down another street and be like “oops wrong way again”. It’s horrible, she has no sense of direction and I feel so stupid following her around.

She also talks in circles which makes me so angry. Like for an example yesterday she asked me, “do you want a burrito for dinner?” Then I replied we don’t have the ingredients for a burrito so I’m going to eat the food we have in the house. She then asks, “oh so you don’t want a burrito?” So I thought maybe she bought ingredients for a burrito so I said sure I’ll have a burrito. She then says, “ok but we don’t have the ingredients for a burrito”. Like YES I KNOW THAT.

Her stupidity makes me treat her worse which I hate because I don’t want to be rude to people but sometimes the way she talks and acts just infuriates me. I also feel more slow and held down when I’m with her. Like when she makes a dumb decision I’m usually around her so I have to help her correct her mistake.

Anytime I do something alone I feel a huge wave of happiness go through my body because I don’t feel held back from her behaviour. Overall she’s a good person but I honestly don’t think I can continue a relationship with her. Her misjudgments cause me so much financial loss and general stress.","6077","287"

"t3_1j6yegx","i think i ruined the friendship between my sister and her best friend","another long post...

for context, my(f18) sister(17) and her best friend(f15, almost 16, let's call her Dana) have been friends for almost a decade, they've always spent a lot of time together because our moms were friends. the last few years have been very very rough for Dana, and we've always been here for her, especially my sister, and that made them even closer.

so, today, during lunch, my sister came to my mom and asked her if she could go out for a party night with Dana and her friend group, BUT. here in italy, there are two stages of the party: the first one is open to everyone, the second one is only 18+, and she wanted to go right to the second one, that begins around midnight. my mom immediately said ""no."", and my sister started whining, saying that Dana went there too a few weeks ago, and guess how she did that? fake ID and some connections, and that surely didn't help to have a ""yes"" as an answer. a few hours ago i was with my sister and Dana, just talking, until my sister asked my thought about going to that party at that hour, and i said: ""honestly i don't approve that, not because you're going there, but because you're gonna do it 'illegally'."", and she got angry, saying that she wanted to do that experience because she's a teenager and blah blah blah, to which i replied: ""yeah, you're a teenager and have to do your experiences, but you can make them on the first half of the night, where you can go without any problem."", and i think she expected me to be the ""cool older sister"" because she got angry, and it only got worse when my brother(21) also said he agreed with me. so she went upstairs and i stayed with Dana, so i started talking with her about all this. the conversation then went to my sister's general behaviour, and we went to my room to talk more liberally. after a while, we were talking about how she (my sister) almost never wants to go out unless one of us has weed or cigarettes and stuff like that, and that's when i told her something i had forgot:

last august they both were at home, my best friend was there as well, and we were all chilling in the backyard, when Dana told my sister that she had to go to her(Dana's) place, that she promised that, but my sister was whining about it, saying she didn't feel like it, but not giving a reason to break the promise, so they came up with a deal: Dana would have gone home, and my sister would go there about a half hour later, so Dana left. i stayed with my best friend and my sister, who started saying things like ""i don't wanna go"", ""i don't feel like it"", and i replied other things like ""why don't you tell her?"", ""if you stand her up without saying anything, i'll tell her."", and she freaked out, saying that if i did i would be a bitch, and i just rolled my eyes. after a while, she left and went to her room, and i immediately gave my best friend a ""i know how this will end up"" look, but didn't say anything.

almost a hour later, Dana calls me and says: ""your sister isn't answering my texts and calls. where is she?"". i took a deep breath and face palmed mentally before answering: ""she's in her room, i'll go check on her."", and so i did. i muted myself and went to my sister, who was awake, and told her: ""Dana's on the phone, what do i tell her?"", and she replies: ""tell her that i'm asleep."". my heart dropped and i didn't know what to do, so i just played along, unmuted myself, and said: ""she's sleeping."". Dana was so disappointed and told me to wake her up, so i started shaking my sister trying to ""wake her up"", but she just pretended to fall asleep again and again, and i heard Dana say: ""look, never mind, let her sleep."". i asked her if she was sure, and she said ""yes"", and i just said: ""okay, then... bye love, i'm sorry."", and hung up. i looked at my sister and said a few things like ""you're an asshole"", ""you're a shitty friend"".

so, returning to two hours ago, i told Dana about it, even though i probably shouldn't have, but i just thought it was the right thing to do. her face dropped and she became visibly sad and disappointed, said something like ""i don't even know what to say"", ""i can't think or look at her the same"", and i felt kind of guilty, but still thought that she had the right to know.

we smoked two cigarettes and she went to sleep, saying that she would figure out what to do about all this, again, she's clearly disappointed and tired of my sister being disrespectful.

it's currently 4am, and i'm sorry for ruining her mood, but also scared of my sister's reaction in case she finds out that Dana knows, i've already made a post about my sister and her behaviour:/

english is not my first language, so, sorry for any mistakes and/or things like that, i just didn't want all this to eat me up.","0","3"
"t3_1j6y4k3","I broke a close friend’s heart after playing him 6 years ago","TLDR: My cousin’s ex fell for me and I flirted back, causing a “situationship” or as he called it, friends with (nonsexual) benefits . I told him I didn’t want to date because he dated my cousin but never stopped flirting. I started talking to my now husband when him and I were a thing and broke his heart. Last week, I was bored at work so I started going through old texts with my Snapchat friends and found one that’s been driving me crazy. Basically, when I (20F) was in 8th grade/14 years old, I played this guy (we’ll call him Carson) right after my ex broke up with me. He really really liked me and I didn’t start flirting back until after my ex broke up with me on April 1st (easy date to remember because I made jokes about the relationship being an April fools joke). Idk if I really liked Carson or if I just liked the attention but either way, I flirted back, hung out with him, etc. and I have a video of him trying to kiss me but me not really going along with it, but I also have pictures of us somewhat cuddling (one was of him laying on my lap) and I know we were alone a few times, once was just us watching a movie. We were a thing but never officially started dating because I told him I didn’t want to since he was my cousins ex. My cousin didn’t really care so maybe I was using it as an excuse?? Idk. But everyone around us knew that there was something going on between Carson and I.  Well, on April 18th, I started talking to my now husband (we’ll call him Riley) and April 21st, we started dating. Ig I never told Carson myself, my friend told him, thinking he knew, and he was absolutely heart broken. At the time, I didn’t think about how much it’d hurt him. He had liked me for a long time but I didn’t realize it until after my ex broke up with me and Carson stopped saying “jk” after every flirtatious comment. After looking through the texts, I feel like I did know and just acted like I didn’t. Idk. When he was told, he was just so confused and hurt. I apologized a million times and eventually told him “well, your chance isn’t completely gone, maybe after Riley and I break up”. Idk why I’d tell him that but I did, probably because I had dated a few guys and it never lasted long so I figured the same would happen with Riley and I. Before school ended, we were able to go back to being regular friends, with some occasional tension but we worked through it. A few months later, I lost my virginity to Riley and Carson somehow found out (I’m guessing my cousin told him) and told me how hurt he was and how he’s not sure if we can remain friends. I told him it wasn’t that big of a deal but I was sorry. I told him I’d help him find a girlfriend and everything but i struggled to find someone. Throughout the beginning of freshman year, he tried to date different girls but each time, he told me they didn’t compare to me or they would end up blocking him. He started smoking a lot of weed and drinking and was just all around really sad. Eventually, we had differing opinions on politics and kinda just stopped talking to each other until sophomore year, one of his friends saw me when I was walking home (I went to a different high school than anyone I went to middle school with) and asked why I played Carson. He said it as a joke but it really annoyed me. I texted Carson and told him he needs to stop talking about me and needs to tell his friends to stop bringing it up because it had been two years and I didn’t do anything wrong. He said he agreed, it had been years so he hadn’t even talked about the situation so he didn’t know why anyone was still saying anything to me but he’d talk to them about it. It didn’t happen again after that and we really haven’t talked since but we do still have each other on socials. I talked to my husband about this, telling him all of it and he thinks I should get in contact with Carson and just apologize. I talked to my best friend and she said “we’ve all done it, don’t feel too bad” so I just don’t know what to do. I know it’s been almost 6 years and he probably doesn’t care anymore but also, if he does, I don’t want to make him feel that pain again so idk if I should text him. The guilt has just been killing me and I feel so horrible. Advice?? Also, I know I seemed like a hoe. Back then, I really just wanted attention from anyone. I didn’t even plan on dating Riley but it just happened. I’m not looking for judgement or anything, I promise you can’t say anything that i haven’t already told myself. I’m really just looking for advice.","1","6"
"t3_1j6xt9p","i (19F at the time) was kidnapped and raped by a siblings friend (32M) and now he's trying to come back into my life.","( i'm going to try keep details to a minimum as i don't want anyone to recognise me from this post, so identifying details like genders, names, ect will be changed. i would also like to note that i do suffer from a form of neurodivergence that can make me incredibly naive at times)

in the few months preceding this kidnapper event, i had a partner who i suffered quite a traumatic miscarriage with. he ended up cutting me off the day i was in the hospital - it was terrifying and incredibly lonely.

at the time, a sibling of mine whom i live with had been having some friends over often, and naturally i started getting to know them and would hang out with their friends too. this was something i did often, as i was struggling heavily with the grief of losing both my pregnancy and essentially being broken up with and left to think about it alone.

After hanging out with my siblings friends for a few weeks, Taylor (M32) started giving me gifts. I have quite an interest in sterling silver religious jewellery, and he had given me a few pieces during this time of us hanging out. (a silver chain with a saint pendant, a very dainty 14k gold bracelet, another small silver bracelet). I thought nothing of it, it's quite common amongst us here to exchange gifts often among friends and family so i didn't see it as anything more than that, as i myself have given people fine jewellery randomly before.

One day, he asked me if i wanted to go to his home to see his pets and just chill and do some art. I agreed, as he had some very unique reptiles which i was curious to see.

After getting to his house, it was then that things took a really bad turn.

He sexually assaulted me on several occasions, I was not allowed to leave the house unless he was supervising me, and it would only be to his garden that i could go. I was also not allowed to wear any clothes in his home, he would take them from me under the guise of washing them and not return them unless he wanted me to go outside with him. He allowed me to return to my own home on two occasions, however he was present the entire time and would not let me out of his sight and would regularly complain about how we needed to leave back to his home.

He would regularly belittle my appearance, try to convince me that i would have to laser remove all of my tattoos as they looked disgusting, he told me that my earrings were disgusting and masculine and how he couldn't believe anyone would ever have had sex with me because of how gross they were. He would force me to stand on weighing scales when i didn't want to so he could know my weight, and then proclaim to me that 'we'll have to fix that'.

I know that people will probably wonder where were my parents in this situation, and the reality is that they were on vacation. They left the family home for multiple months at a time, and whenever my mother would call me, he would answer the phone on my behalf and tell her how i was happy and i was okay and convinced her that i was his 'girlfriend' even though i was being held against my will and assaulted in his home.

I asked on several occasions to go back home, and he would tell me 'maybe next week...' and next week would just never come. and even then, i had no clothes so i simply couldn't leave.

i managed to escape because i had a large concert planned, and after arguing with him for days, he finally let me leave so i could go to the concert. as soon as i got home i messaged him and told him never to speak to me again or i would be calling the police.

for a few weeks after this, he harassed me on different platforms. he posted pictures of me he had taken against my will on social media saying for people to 'look at his girlfriend' , he would change his profile pictures to pictures of me or would make profiles in my name.

in the end, i ended up blocking him and changing all of my social handles.

that brings us to now.

its been about 10 months since this happened. i did not go to the police as i did not want to have to relive what happened to me. he also told me many stories of violence he had committed against women who had called the police on him in the past. we also had no text conversations at all prior to me being harassed by him & i truly just believe the case would get thrown out.

i have had a reoccurring nightmare about him breaking into my house killing me almost every night for the past few weeks. i confessed this to my sibling who introduced me to him, and was told that he had been trying to contact my sibling. he was claiming to have purchased gifts for them, and sending them photos of the gifts he had bought and how much he had paid, and that this had been happening for weeks and my sibling had been simply ignoring his messages.

i feel sick. why would he do this? why would he want to come back into my life? after the terror he put me through? he told me on several occasions that he, in his own words, felt like he was 'the predator' and that i was 'the prey' and it was 'his natural instinct to hunt me down'. he also told me how he had only been coming to hang out at my house because he had been fantasising about me.

i don't know what to do in this situation. all i know is that i'm scared and i feel like i have no one to tell who can truly understand my story or my fears of him trying to pry his way back into my life and into my home.","1","6"

This happened many years ago I don't want anyone to get in trouble or press charges I just need to finally be able to speak about what happened.  I was 17 at the time and I volunteered as a Sheriff explorer during this time I met a deputy who in the beginning was really nice to me. I had just graduated high-school but my 18th birthday wasnt until a few months later. I was scheduled to go on a ride along we were required to go on patrol at least once every three months or so and he volunteered to take me on this day. This first time went fine I was super shy but he got me to open up, he talked about himself and asked me about what my plans were after graduating. It wasn't until the second time I went on patrol with him around a month later that things took a turn, I knew he had a girlfriend she was only two years older me, but this time around he started talking about how things were rocky between them. I didn't think much of it I thought he was just venting and no harm done. However  he was being super touchy and was flirting and at that time I was too shy to say anything. He ended up kissing me out of nowhere and he just smiled and said he needed to know if I was attracted to him. I'm not going to lie I was, he was good looking but I asked him about his girlfriend he said she wouldn't care. He offered to take me home after the shift and he did but not before he ended up taking me to an abandoned field and said he just wanted to talk. We ended up making out in his car and i told him i didnt want to have sex that it was as far as i would go he said it was fine but kept pushing and pressuring for more. He said if i really had feelings for him i would be willing to go all the way. He took me home after about an hour and explicitedly told me that if i was asked by any other deputy to just say were friends. I liked how special he made me feel and the red flags were there but i honestly  thought he wouldnt force me to have sex with him since  at that point he did stop when i told  him to even if he continued to ask. From this point on whenever I would patrol with him things would go further. Until finally one day after my 18th birthday he said he would take me home but instead he  hopped on the freeway towards his apartment. I was scared but at that point I felt speaking up would get me abandoned somewhere unfamiliar or worse. We made it to his place and he gave me a beer and led me to his bedroom. I felt like I couldn't say no he told me to relax that I would like it that it was just my nerves. We ended having sex but I finally was able to tell him he needed to stop that he was hurting me but all he would say was just let me finish its OK you'll like it in a minute. No amount of pleading worked until he finally rolled off me. By then I was shaking and oddly felt numb about the whole thing. He took me home and again told me to say we were just friends. He would lose his job if anyone found out making me feel guilty. I ended up quitting the program a few months later and foud out he was being investigated for misconduct on a whole different issue. I regret keeping quiet but at the time I was confused and developed feelings for him. Other deputies became suspicious since they noticed he would go out of his way to talk to me but no one ever asked me personally if anything happened. I know this is long and confusing but it feels good to finally speak about it I've held this in for 16 years. I had posted and then deleted I freaked out a bit that it was shared but if it helps anyone else in a similar situation so they speak up then it is what it is. Also for clarity he was nine years older than me.","1","0"
"t3_1j6owam","Mourning Myself","Me and the Past: A Meeting with My Old Self

I turned on my old device from 11 years ago and listened to my old voice recordings. I broke down crying. I miss myself. I used to be cheerful and innocent.

Now, I’ve been depressed for so long. I’ve lived through terrible things.

I keep picturing that girl from 11 years ago—the one who used to sing in different languages, record rap songs, and create all kinds of things.

It feels like I lost her. I cried as if I lost a loved one. As if that girl died, and I’ll never see her again.

I lost myself. I lost my teenage years. I lost my laughter. I lost my creativity. I lost me.

I miss her. I used to love myself, admire myself. I was confident. I was innocent. I was creative.

And now? Panic attacks, anxiety, problems, responsibilities, endless worries.

I feel like I’ve been dead for a long time. Like I’m just wandering among the living in some kind of dream. I feel disconnected from life, like a lifeless soul drifting through a world that keeps moving.

Why do I feel like I died a long time ago, and I’m just living these years backstage, trying to figure out the cause of my death?

Why does my life now feel like an illusion, while my past felt real?

God, I’m so tired of myself. Why do I miss the past so much? Why do I long for my old self?

She was strong and kind, despite her young age. The older I get, the more scared I become. And the more I need her.

She was wise, creative, confident. Her soul was light and gentle, like a breeze. Everyone loved her. She was mischievous, but even her mischief was innocent. Despite being quiet at times, she was still well-known because she left a soft, lasting impact. Even if she caused a little trouble, it was never harmful—just the kind of mischief that made people laugh later.

I admire her. I love her. I miss her the same way I mourn the people I’ve lost in my life.

I’m grieving myself. Because I died.

I’m nothing more than a body without a soul.","3","2"
"t3_1j6m88b","I feel so useless","I (19M) am an outgoing person usually, happy to talk to anyone about anything. But I have a very big social problem.

Whenever a bad incident happens, especially in the family, for example fights, arguments, grief etc., I feel strong anxiety and I need to go to the furthest, loneliest point in the building so I do not participate in the incident, not even hear it. And I feel so useless that I cannot support the people around me that need my help or help deescalate conflicts, but I start shaking very bad , my brain goes numb and my only thought is to get as far as possible. My brain cannot process staying even near the area of the bad incident. And I feel like the worst human possible because my severe anxiety that gets triggered by this doesnt even let me go talk about it after the incident, not even hugging anybody. I just ignore it as good as I can.

So I feel like if you get attached to someone it just bring you this discomfort when they try to leave. maybr it's just people in my life that have habits of leaving be it friends or others.

"t3_1j6vs1y","I (26f) can't feel sexual pleasure anymore and it's killing my relationship","basically what the title says. I've slowly lost sensitivity since we got married 4 years ago. I thought at first it was due to my depression, so I got therapy. Then, after overcoming depression, I was still experiencing very low/nonexistent libido, no sensitivity, nothing. It didn't matter if I was on my antidepressants or not, before, during, and after it was about the same. I used to be able to enjoy sex, and finish, but now I can't even remember the last time I finished at all. (No I'm not interested in masturbation, nor has that ever done anything to me). My husband has gotten mad at me over the years and accused me of being asexual or lesbian, which I don't think is the case because I KNOW I am sexually attracted to men and not women, and I've experienced normal sexual response cycles many times before, especially as a teen. I did save myself for marriage, if that makes any difference. I then thought, well maybe it's not my depression, maybe it's sexual trauma from seeing and hearing my parents doing it a lot after they always told me sex was bad? (religious upbringing) and so I went to a sex therapist, and she said she couldn't help me. I had another therapist after that who I really liked and helped with everything else in my life except my ability to enjoy sex/ have a sex repsonse cycle despite thoroughly discussing that topic and my traumatizing experiences as a child with my parents. I went to my primary care doctor and he basically told me there were no meds except one that costs $1000 a dose and only has a 10% chance of working. He did blood work on my hormone levels and those were all normal. so basically no one can help me and it leads to dissatisfaction on both sides of this relationship, and makes me so sad. I feel like I should just divorce my husband so he can find a functional woman who can have and enjoy sex with him :(","1","7"
"t3_1j6qxcs","I can’t get over my ex","I can’t get over the guy I was in love with 3 god damn years ago and it makes me sick.

So I was never really in a relationship with this person, we actually never even hang out together. We met in 2022 and we had a friendship that you wish on everyone, but the friendship got stronger and so did our feelings. At first he started getting feelings, at the time it was not appropriate because I was still in a relationship. I broke things off so I could be with him, but when that happened he didn’t have the same feelings anymore and everything went downhill. I’m not gonna explain everything that happened in those 6 months, but I can say that nothing went back to how it was.

Because I was still in love with him when he basically ghosted me at the time, I never got the closure I needed (I think). And I begged him to let me stay in his live as friends, and now that I’m hearing myself I sound so stupid. After everything that happened in those 6 months we kissed etc. for like 2 more times and that made it even worse to get over him.

Like I said we stayed friends and talk like 3 times a year (new years, birthdays and holidays). I even got a new amazing boyfriend whom I’ve been together with for almost 2 years, and who I really love and could see myself marrying one day. But I still think about him (the ex). Last week he even responded on a story I posted on Snapchat and we exchanged maybe 10 sentences. I wake up the next day and he deleted me from snap. I would like to think his new gf made him do it, because it would honestly hurt more if he did it himself.

So now 1 week later and everyday I’m thinking about it and everything that happened almost 3 fk years ago.

So my question Reddit users is why can’t I get over him? Why can’t I get over the memories that we made? Why not after everything this person has put me through?

English is not my first language so I’m sorry for my grammar.

Side note, 1,5 years ago he moved to another city so I haven’t seen him in 1 year. And I see him maybe once I year now. I was supposed to see him last week, but he couldn’t come…","2","1"

"t3_1j6ukus","I don't know how else to help by friend out of toxic environment, please give me advice.","I don't even have any words to describe what's happening right now. I need advice ASAP.

So my friend (19F) is literally going in circles with same toxic people and she clearly doesn't see it! We have a friend group of five since high-school and she's always been the one who has the most other friends outside of the friend group, but we never minded. She has friends from other city and an on and off boyfriend (24M) who's literally the worst human I've ever seen. He's manipulative, controlling, alcoholic with anger issues and he controls who she is friends with, where is she, if she's drinking, etc. He constantly brings up her past before they met and holds it against her. When his friend started hitting on her he blamed HER!! They broke up two weeks ago and we literally celebrated because it felt final. She sent us a 13 minute recording, when they officially ended it, of him just cussing her out, screaming and calling her a slut who doesn't deserve love from anyone, even her parents. He also threatened to kill her dog. Her parents hated him (obviously) so he always talked bad about them.

She stopped texting us this week but we thought that she was just busy. But turns out she's BACK WITH HIM AGAIN AND THEY MOVED IN TOGETHER! What the hell!! I don't even know what to think.

She also forgave her ex (now current) best friend after she bad mouthed her and used her so she would buy her and their friends alcohol. Btw she's dating her boyfriends brother who's another jerk. It literally runs in their blood.

I'm serious considering just going low contact with her because she clearly doesn't value our opinions on those horrible people and will ALWAYS choose them over us. I feel like crying from frustration every time I think about it. We have literally tried EVERYTHING to open her eyes. The worst part is that all of us others are at uni somewhere else and she's the only one who's living in our hometown so we can only call her (but she doesn't pick up often). And I'm so concerned and scared that she'll end up dead in the ditch.

"t3_1j6p60o","I don’t like talking anymore","I used to talk to myself a lot, especially when I was a kid. If I wasn’t talking that meant something was wrong, but I’d usually go back to talking.

Something awful happened that was entirely my fault and since that point I don’t speak much anymore. I don’t want to. I only speak if I can’t figure out how to stay silent. It’s been like this for almost two weeks now. I don’t see any signs I’ll start talking  like I used to again.

As I’m writing this I haven’t spoken in nearly 24 hours. It’s actually harder to speak now. I was quiet to begin with but it’s gotten worse. To be completely honest I don’t care about it all that much. People find others who talk to themselves to be weird or crazy anyways so honestly this is an improvement.

I wonder if I’ll lose my voice completely and then I really can’t talk anymore. That would be both interesting and scary. I wonder if that’ll happen with my face too. I stopped looking at my reflection along with not talking. Idk why, I just did. I actually like it. Everything feels like a first person game.","2","1"
"t3_1j6tw9e","i impulsively sent a personal letter to a situationship-friend. he told me i should do something with it?","hello! i hope im not going against any rules by posting this.i intially wanted to post this to try and figure out how to turn this personal letter into an artistic creative thing that i can put out into the world, but for now, its just a letter that is true off my chest.

this is a letter i have sent a friend/lover that is very important to me. we have a weird, secretive relationship dynamic, somewhat of a situationship but much more communicative and relationshipy. its weird. the letter talks about it a little bit. the thing is, after he read it, he told me that the letter was personal, authentic, and very beautiful, that i should think about maybe doing something with it in the future-(creatively, he meant, we are both creative people, studied creative writing together, that’s how we met)

anyways here’s the letter, keep in mind it is translated as it is originally in a different language:)

”Hi

this letter contains things that are important to me that you know.

Every time I initiate a hang out with you to talk about things, I end up not saying everything I want to say, maybe because I forget, or feel better at that moment when I'm with you, and don't want to create a worse mood for either you or me again, /don't want to be a burden, so I end up not saying anything and end up regretting and getting upset when things don't work out between us.

So I want to take a moment here and write to you everything I can remember that I usually think and feel about us, and hope that with all the recoil you probably get from this letter, you can also take a moment of your time and read without too much pressure of responding quickly.

I want to start by saying that you are a person who is very, very important to me. I have said it many times and I have no problem saying it again, simply because it is true: you are the first person that I have ever felt true, pure love. a feeling that I thought people invent in movies, that made me think it was not something that was even possible to feel. You made me feel it. It is real.

You know how sentimental and emotional I am, it is very easy for me to look at a picture of us from a month ago and feel nostalgic because I miss a specific day that I had a really nice time with you. Like for example on your birthday, when you invited me to sleep over at your place and told me that I was really cute and that you wanted to kiss me in front of everyone. These are things that are hard for me to forget and I hope I never forget because it makes my heart feel good. Sometimes I am completely reluctant to mention things like this or talk about it at all because the fact that I talk about it means that in moments like these have a lot of weight. It makes me very vulnerable and it's scary, I prefer not to mention any good moment we had, not to say I love you, not to say I miss something that happened two days ago, and that way if you don't say something nice back, I won't be offended by it, I won't think it's not mutual, I won't think I'm taking everything too personally and that for you I'm just another person to have fun with every now and then. even though i know if it was just fun it would have ended a long time ago for you. But I choose to say it anyway, because I want you to at least know how much good you can do, even if you don't mean to. I choose to get hurt a little every now and then.

I think you are very talented You write in a way that is very impulsive, for better or worse. In the pieces you wrote, it is very clear that what you write comes from that moment deep inside, and it is not calculated, it is simply what is happening in your heart at that second, and you bring it out. Another talent you have is the way you get to know people. Something that I am very jealous of, but I feel I am lucky to experience it as a friend, and even learn from you. You ask bizarre questions that no one thinks to ask, go into strange depths, and we would sometimes laugh at you at that moment in class because it is really very funny that you ask things that no one thinks are interesting enough, but it is a trait that I appreciate very much. I think that I will move here in this letter between things that you might be flattered by and things that you have a chance of being offended by, It is important for me to point out that it is okay to be offended just as it is okay to be flattered by everything I write, but you should know that everything I write is things that I think and feel. There are no facts here. And there is not even a single intention to hurt.

If I could, I would write this in a letter and bring it to you physically, but right now we are after a not very pleasant interaction that was on through messages, as there is every now and then between us. And right now I am not in the mood to see you because I feel like I will cry and I will not be able to say anything coherent.

Maybe I am too sensitive and take everything too hard. Maybe you love me but don't like me very much and sometimes try to hurt me. It could be both.

Sometimes I feel like you really want to hurt me. That you know exactly what combination of words will hurt me the most, and you choose them specifically. I don't think it's bad intentions. I think it's more of you trying to defend yourself. Maybe I say things that I think come out well, but they hurt you, and then you, who feel attacked, try to attack back, because that way you'll have the power, and you can hurt and leave. Sometimes we encounter a situation of unpleasant messages and at the peak you'll say something like you're gonna stop answering me, or something more cynical-passive aggressive to imply to me that you're not going to answer anymore no matter what I say. Sometimes I'm in a good mood, and after a conversation like that with you i get very sad in a restless way, like i have to talk it out. And when you cut off at the peak of this conversation, I have no way to explain anymore, no way to resolve, no way to do anything. All that's left for me is to sit with myself, with the feelings I have about myself, about how much I may have hurt you with the words I used incorrectly, about how much I want you to understand that I don't think such bad things about you. And to sit with myself, with the feelings I have for you, that with how much I love you, you are the person who most manages to hurt my most sensitive points.

Once in a conversation of this style, you managed to throw into the air that it would be better if we ended the relationship.

After that, when we met and I mentioned it, you said that you said it in the heat of the moment, and that you didn't really mean it.

I think you did mean it, just, at that moment. And then at some point when we managed to talk and get along again, you regretted meaning it. I think that both of these situations are correct, and that they don't necessarily contradict each other.

Sometimes I really have thoughts like, 'Wow, maybe I should really end this relationship.'"" Sometimes I feel like the relationship with you is doing me a lot more harm than good. Sometimes I feel like you hate me. Detest me. And maybe you stay in touch with me because it's easier than breaking up. And maybe that's true sometimes, I don't know. But I also don't think it necessarily contradicts other good feelings you might have for me sometimes. In any case, I can understand. There's not a single person in the world that I can say 100% that will never get on my nerves, accidentally hurt me, get tired of them. and I also told you, I think that if I spend enough time with anyone, at some point I'll want to not be around them. On the other hand, you're one of the only people I prioritize spending time with. And the only person I want to be around even if I'm very hurt and we're not at our best terms.

I think something happened the day we started hooking up for the first time. That day I went out with you and a friend for a walk in the city, we went into your old school, the friend stayed outsid. we were left with just you, with the stories and experiences you had there, with all the nostalgia from there, and I was there, and listened to you, and I really enjoyed experiencing something sentimental with you. A big part of your life you spent there, and then I was there with you and somehow managed to be a small part of all of it. of you.

Later that day, after we hooked up, when you walked me to the train, and we were both very nervous because we had arranged to meet the next day, but we were both afraid that suddenly we wouldn't want to meet again when the time came. Because we both had that similar problem. that weird avoidant way of dealing with life. And then the next day came, we still wanted to, and it happened, and it didn't exactly stop for a very long time.

Usually when I want someone, as soon as they show interest in me back, I stop wanting them. It didn't happen with you. You shared your flaws with me and not only did I identify with a lot of them, but it only drew me in more. I really fell in love with a person, and not just an idea. I think that's why it's so easy for me to get hurt by you.

I love you very much. The whole person that you are. I'm very attracted to you. Physically, emotionally, mentally. In just about every way.

What you think of me, how you think of me, is very important to me. I really care about you and your opinions. Sometimes you say things about me, that you think I'm not intelligent, or things like that, I say very directly that these are things that hurt me. Insult me. You take it more lightly, and with a laugh, and with a certain detachment towards me and how I feel. I think you might have the feeling that you're above me in all sorts of ways. That you have more power over certain things. That your opinions are more important or true than mine. And that facts are perhaps more important or true than my feelings. Sometimes you are the most sensitive person in the world, looking for a hug, love, intimacy, making me laugh when I'm not feeling well. And sometimes you treat me as if you are a person who doesnt know how to be a friend. That you have no ability to understand or contain my difficulty, my feelings.

I think a lot of it is also my fault. Every time I told you that you were crossing a certain line, that's all it was. I tell you that you're crossing a line, And that's it, there were no consequences beyond that. I say my piece, carry on as usual as always, and then it repeats itself. Again things are said, again I'm offended, again I don't want to talk to you again in my life, and then I come back to you the second there's a chance, because I want you in my life. It's like I'm giving up a lot of myself, so that I can feel good, sometimes, with you.

I'll say something now that if it wasn't clear before, it can be very recoiling and disgusting to hear, at least for me- My relationship with you, and you, in general, is very addictive to me. I'm addicted to you. You feel like a drug to me and I can't find a better or worse way to say it, that's how it feels to me. When I'm with you and everything is good, everything is the best in the world. When it's bad, it's very bad.

there was another time, at some day, I was at your place I think a few days after we agreed not to sleep together anymore.- of course we met and slept together because how could we not): There was one moment, you put your head on my chest as if I were a pillow. we just sat like that in bed for an hour, cuddling, calm, comfortable, quiet, pleasant.

Why do I get so hung up on these moments?

It's like if I'm not bipolar enough on my own, there's another layer of bipolarity in our relationship.

I remember especially at the beginning of this relationship, when I was at your place and I felt so nice and comfortable, I didn't want it to end simply because it was the peak of the day for me. The moment I had to go home, just being on the drive back home, alone, sleeping alone, suddenly that was the lowest point of my life.

I've slept alone my whole life. Why does it feel so heavy now?

It's like craving you helped me survive a little longer, every time. And this is the most unhealthy thing I've ever experienced, and the most disgusting thing I've ever said. It's embarrassing to admit it at all, especially when I'm sure it's not mutual.

For a very long time I was emotionally dependent on you, like if you were in a good mood it would be great for me, but if you were feeling bad and would withdraw from the world, I could easily take it personally. Because when I'm in a bad mood, I still want to be near you. I still want to talk to you. And it's disgusting to me. Why is it different only with you? Why am I not interested in sleeping with anyone, except you? Why did I think for years that I wasn't interested in sex at all and that I could easily live without it, and then after I met you, I became a nymphomaniac? Why can I just say bye to people and leave without a hug, but with you this intimacy is so important to me? I don't even have one answer really I have no idea why it's like this

On the one hand I think, if I kept my distance from you, I would get used to being without you, it would have been hard at first, but little by little I would stop wanting anything like this with you, and then maybe I would be able to quit you. On the other hand, You're funny You love Why would I keep my distance just because it's a little hard sometimes?

I'm in these dilemmas every now and then But I really don't want to lose touch with you

Sometimes I think you don't see or appreciate things I do for you, take me for granted. Why not, actually? you said so yourself, no matter when you text me, I will answer. if you need a favor, i will do it. if you want me to come to you and be with you, there will never be a situation in life where I will say no. I haven't given you a single reason to make you think that I'm not simply there whenever you need or want. So maybe it's my fault. Maybe I'm too accessible, not enough hard to get. and it's too convenient, it's easy to take it for granted, I don't know.

Maybe you'll read all of this and think I'm a psycho, Tell me that you think it would be best and most worthwhile to end the relationship, and I'll understand from that, that you don't want anything to do with me, and I'll be offended, and we'll never talk again, and all that this relationship will be is some cute memories from time to time that are accompanied by a bad taste from how it ended.

Maybe you'll read all of this and say nothing, pretend you never got it, maybe you'll even see that you got this letter, tell yourself wow this is really long I'll get to it someday, and forget about ever getting to it.

Maybe you'll read this and tell me what you think and feel too. Share your side. Tell me that everything is okay, it's okay what I feel, it's okay that I'm an addicted psycho, and that I'm too important to you to lose touch with me over stupid things that can be solved in an instant with a little communication and the right mood.

I don't know what you'll choose, but everything is legitimate and I'll understand in the end, even if not at that moment. I love you, I would be happy to talk whenever there is a problem, I just want us to really be able to talk.

I am not here to apologize, and I do not demand any forgiveness from you, Whatever happened was. Do you want us to stay in touch? I would be very happy. Just please try to pay attention, appreciate me, respect boundaries. If situations arise where you feel that I am attacking you, that I am unpleasant, that I am unbearable, that I am repulsive, inconsiderate, offensive, - tell me. Let's talk about it. It doesn't have to be at that moment when you are at your wits' end, you can do it at any moment, but let's try to communicate more healthily and hug after that and be good please:)

i love you”

"t3_1j5oph1","I (F24) thought this word was degrading but why did it turn me on?","I've been dating this guy for the last four months, and he is genuinely one of the kindest, most wholesome people I’ve ever met. If ""wholesome"" was a person, it would be him. He’s loved and respected at his job and church, and I admire him so much.

Last night, though, something happened that I can’t stop thinking about, and I just need to get this off my chest. We were intimate, and he was a little rougher than usual not in a bad way at all. It was different, but I liked it. Then, completely out of the blue, he leaned in and whispered in my ear, calling me his little SL-word.

I was so caught off guard. I’ve never been called that word before in my life, and I always assumed I’d be offended or upset if I ever was. But instead… I liked it. A lot. So much so that I instantly came. And now I’m just sitting here, confused about why that word, something that should have made me uncomfortable, had the complete opposite effect. It felt wrong, but at the same time, it felt good, and I don’t know what to make of it.

I guess I just needed to put this into words and get it off my chest it’s just unlike me to like such a word like that.","444","106"
"t3_1j6oq5f","I'm looking forward to dying","I've seen a lot of these posts on here and didn't really expect to be making one myself, but here I am. I'm currently living for my mom who loves me. She has dealt with a lot in her life and we get along very well and it would really hurt her if I offed myself, so I'm going to try to keep playing this game called life until at least she passes away. My life has had it's ups and downs, mostly downs but there have been some amazing and beautiful moments, but I just don't have anything I truly want to live for anymore aside from my mom. I've lost a couple of loved ones over the last few years and the thought of dying brings me a lot of peace and I'm looking forward to it.","2","0"

I’m a 29 female, never been married and no kids. I've been thinking a lot about my past relationships lately, and I have to admit, it's been a tough journey. My last serious relationship ended in a painful breakup, and it's taken me a while to process my emotions.

As I reflect on what went wrong, I realize that I was blind to some major red flags. I ignored my intuition and stayed in the relationship longer than I should have.

But despite the heartache, l've learned so much about myself and what I want in a relationship. I'm taking the time to focus on myself, my friendships, and my community.

I spend a lot of time getting to know God more. He has helped me through the years to achieve a forgiven heart and renewed my spirit of a fun filled life. Being single increases my loneliness but only those who have gone through this same pain would understand how scary it is to give love another chance.

I'd love to connect with serious minded people and hear about your experiences. Have you ever gone through a tough breakup? How did you heal and move forward?","2","3"
