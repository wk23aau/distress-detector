"t3_1j5fbdy","Hurt","You weren’t happy with me. It felt like whatever I did would never make you happy. I hadn’t felt loved by you in a long time. You say you love me, but why didn’t you act like it? I tried to show you love and you didn’t want it. There’s only so much I can do before I can’t anymore.

You say you miss me. But you never talked to me. You hid all your feelings from me. We’d go to therapy and it felt like an attack on everything I did. It felt like anything and everything I did was wrong.

I was always the one in the wrong.

But what about the things you did that hurt me?

Yeah I’m good at compartmentalizing. I’m good at bottling up my feelings to make others comfortable. It didn’t feel like you cared that I was doing it since it gave more room for you to talk about how you were feeling.

I gave so much of myself to you.

Did you really love me?

Or did you just love the idea of me?

Someone to listen to you and ask how your days were and what? Why didn’t you do that for me? I wore myself out trying to make you happy. Happy with me. Happy with you. Happy with literally anything. I couldn’t do it.

I miss the days that we could sit and talk for hours. I miss the days that you would smile when you saw me. I miss the days that felt like you truly loved me. I miss the days that we were actually friends.

But maybe it wasn’t real. Maybe it was the attention I gave you? Or the gifts? Or maybe I was a distraction? Something shiny and new. Uncharted territory. I don’t know.

I don’t know what you’re telling people. That I broke it off? That I did this and that and whatnot? You blocked me so it’s not like I can try to support you. Not that you were accepting of my support over the last year plus. I really tried. And it felt like you just didn’t care.

I shouldn’t have looked you up on here. I noticed you blocked me days ago. You didn’t tell me where you were moving-not that it’s my business, but it really sucks being completely blocked out by someone who is saying they love me.

Loved me.

My heart hurts. And I can’t even talk to my best friend about it.

You wanna know why I’ve been talking to her? Because my world revolved around you. I stopped talking to my friends. All of my friends. Because you were my world. But I was just a bother to you. An annoyance. A burden.

I needed someone to talk to and she messaged me. She wasn’t a bad person so I don’t know where you got that from. If anything, I was the bad person in that situation. I let you be mean to her. I let you do what you wanted because I thought you were my forever. But you didn’t think I was your forever. You don’t treat your forever the way you treated me. How are you so okay with just disappearing on me?

I truly hope you can find happiness. I wasn’t the one for you and that’s okay. I hope you can show love to the next person you find. Not as a rarity, but strong and unwavering. Love them with everything you have, because you deserve love and to love.

I just wasn’t enough.

I wasn’t ever going to be enough.

I just wish you’d have told me sooner.","5","1"
"t3_1j5tjlt","My boyfriend is watching his ex and has the urge to jerk off","For some context, my boyfriend (23m) and I (24f) have been in a relationship. He was after me for 1 year, dated for 1 year, broke up, and have been dating for 6 months now. I have an autoimmune disease that is mostly affected by my mental health, and can create severe illnesses and damages to my body. Since I’ve been dating him I´ve been noticing my health getting worse and worse. To add more to the story, I found out he was attracted to his work-colleague and made some sort of move, check my other post to figure out some more about this (if interested, but it will add more to the story and will help you gain a better understanding). Plus, my boyfriend since the start of our relationship has told me how he’s a man who doesn’t watch corn, and has been flexing it to his guy friends and all.

So, my boyfriend has been recently saying non-stop how he’s open for me to check his phone, he has actually said it so much it was beginning to be suspicious. I had been noticing him becoming more irritated with me by the second without me doing nothing, and I asked him. I told him that I knew there was something he was hiding that was making him so anxious with me all the time, that's when I began suspecting, and he denied all of my comments, saying it was because he’s been so busy with work.

After some days, he started saying it again, telling me that I could check his phone whenever I didn’t trust him. He was always used to me saying no, since I was keen on not doing so since I felt like doing that. There must be a lack of trust in a relationship and that’s how they fall apart. So, he didn’t expect me to say yes this time. I did due to all my suspicions at the moment. He watched me, and didn’t dare say a word. I gave him some time to be honest with me before looking through his phone and he reassured me there was nothing. I went to his recently watched in tiktok, and I found gems there. He watched these typical girls with boobs bigger than their heads move their butts and boobs sensually. Then, there were many replays of this girl we both knew he talked to before ever getting with me. He didn’t say anything and denied ever doing anything with her videos, only getting hard and then looking for other stuff to jerk off, which I think is a complete lie, but still.

Not only did he break promises by telling and promising me that he didn’t watch corn or other girls, but also lied to me about it until I figured it out. He was never honest and I believe that he still is hiding things from me just because I didn’t figure them out yet. It was already bad that he did this, but worse when it was his ex situationship.

I need some help and opinions to clear my mind, I don’t know if I’m crazy or being rational. I would appreciate other people’s experiences dealing with wrong people and then finding a good person for you. I need to believe that this is not the love I deserve and that there’s many guys out there that won’t do this to me.","0","31"
"t3_1j5mwpv","Potentially ableist rant about ASD and Neurodivergence","I’m frustrated with how ASD dominates the majority of neurodivergent discourse. I get it. I really do. ASD is very misunderstood and it very often coexists with other ND types.

Buuuuuut… it feels like everyone only talks about or thinks about ASD. Heck, even terminology seems ASD specific.

Sometimes I just want to find something about ADHD, and I get told it’s an ASD symptom that can be present in others. Erm, no. It’s an ADHD struggle too, based on self reports from those with a diagnosis.

Why are most ND struggles seen through the lens of ASD so much?

I’m struggling to verbalise my thoughts and I’m hoping someone gets what I’m saying.

We need space for just ADHD, just dyslexia, just OCD. Co-morbidities are co-morbidities. Not the core of disorders.

I’m sick of being told that something I deal with is “ actually an autism thing,” and I just happen to experience that just by chance. No. I’m not autistic. My struggles are not autistic traits. They are ADHD traits. We’d know that if we stopped calling every trait in an ND person an autistic trait.

I’m sick of my symptoms being seen as an afterthought -  a fringe case of ASD symptoms.

Acknowledge my disorder for what it is. I’m tired of being an “oh, by the way” addition haphazardly tacked onto an ASD discussion.

Yes, it is ok to acknowledge that some things are ASD specific that I happen to do by chance. No, not every ND trait is autism specific. My sensory issues are not ASD traits, they are ADHD traits. Stop telling me “it’s okay to acknowledge that some things are ASD traits that others experience.” What are you implying?

And I’m definitely not arguing “everyone is a little ASD.” That’s stupid, and if you manage to get that out of my rant, I can’t help you.

I’m saying, validate my struggles as they are. Not because they overlap with ASD.

What’s funny is my friend who says this doesn’t pick up on the fact that it hurts me when they say these things.","1","5"
"t3_1j5hlsy","I hate myself and feels like I’ve given up without trying","I’m a 23-year-old guy (turning 24 in August), and I feel like a complete failure. Depression has been a constant in my life, and I’m pretty sure there’s something seriously wrong with me mentally. I’ve never sought professional help never in my life. Instead, I’ve coped by abusing drugs like MDMA, LSD, and and ket, weed every single day since I was 14. It’s been my crutch, but it’s not working anymore. I’ve never had a real girlfriend, though that’s not even my main issue. The real problem is I can’t stay consistent with anything working out, holding a job, nothing. Today, I was supposed to get up and go to work, but I just couldn’t be bothered. I bailed. It feels like my brain is fighting against me. I’m suicidal 24/7. When I hit these lows, they last about three months, then I get a month of “normal” before it crashes again. Right now, I’m in one of those dark phases, and it’s so bad I’m genuinely debating whether to end my life today. I don’t know what to do anymore. My body’s a mess too I go from fat to skinny and fat to skinny again, stuck in this weird in between because of how depression screws with me. I’ve felt like this my whole life, and I’m terrified it’ll never change. I’m getting older, life’s getting more harder and serious, and everything’s so damn expensive. I have no ambitions, no goals. I never went to school. I blow all my money, I’m in debt, and I live alone. I feel like a corrupt soul. I say I believe in God, but I don’t really. I’m a fake religious person, a fake human. My friends are starting to ditch me because of how I am, and I don’t blame them. I’ve had enough. I feel like death is the only way out of this hell because I can’t imagine dragging this on until I’m 28, 35, or older. It’s already unbearable. My mom’s tried to help me so many times, but she’s given up too. I always end up back at square one, no matter what. I hate myself so much. I guess I’m posting this because I’m desperate. Has anyone been here and gotten out? I don’t even know where to start.","3","1"
"t3_1j5jc5t","I’m almost 22 and I’ve never been on a date","Like the title says, I’ve never been on a date. Women have expressed interest in me + I’ve had past relationships but they were all long distance. Which means I’ve never gotten to take a woman out for dinner or coffee. Here’s the kicker tho, every time I tell someone that I’ve never been on a date, I get a variation of “no way” or “you’re lying” or “how?”.

Getting these types of reactions means that I am good looking to an extent I guess, but it hasn’t translated to any dates. I will admit tho, I am a late bloomer, I was bullied mercilessly as a child, was fat then skinny and now I’m in the middle which is nice.

I know I need to put myself out there more but every time I do so I get burned rather quickly, in spectacular fashion I may add. I’m also afraid of rejection which doesn’t help. My luck isn’t the best either, and considering how unavailable people in my city are, I guess it makes sense. I just feel so far behind my peers, I feel weird.

I get everyone has their own timeline but at the same time, when most people your age are in committed relationships or going out on dates, it’s hard not to feel unloved/unwanted in addition to feeling like you’re behind.

I also wonder if I should ever tell a woman this when (not if) the day comes? Will she be turned off? Will she be weirded out and think to herself “what’s wrong with this guy? How has he never been on a date?”

Thank you for reading and take care.","2","3"
"t3_1j5mosy","My mom might never be the same","Ok, I know the tag is bad but let me clear stuff up right off the bat. I didn't try to kill myself, nobody in my family did, and nobody in this story succeeds in doing so. With that said, it's still disturbing.

I go to a high school that is located right next to a PreK-8 school. My mom works there and teaches PreK4, while my brother attends as a 7th grader. Yesterday, my mom and brother told me of something that happened. Basically, a kid in my brother's grade tried to kill himself in the bathroom using his belt (part of the uniform) and was at it for several minutes before a friend of the kid went looking for him. To make a long story short, it was a whole 2 hours afterward that the police were called and something was done about it.

Now this alone is devastating and disturbed my mom, but what made me call my post this was this detail of the story.

The kid tried this around 11 am. The administration was only made aware at 1 pm. The kids knew this and said nothing. Now you may think that it's because he's a bully or disliked, but he was a smart kid who played football at his school and was generally well-liked. The chilling part was that most kids were just indifferent to the whole thing. They felt bad, but nobody was particularly emotional. My brother said that everybody was silent but only a few who he knew feared death. The kid who went to check on the victim got texts from the victim with suicidal thoughts, and he said nothing at first. And that's why I named this post what I did.

My mom is one of those people who believes that suicide is cowardly and that there are always options for those who feel that way, but hearing how a group of kids witnessed one of their try that and then everyone not go talk to grown-ups was shocking for her. Even worse, since they have, the school has not made anything public yet about this incident and probably is just going to sweep it under the rug. Now I might have exaggerated the title a bit, my mom is a very resilient woman. But I fear that the way this story played out will affect her for a long time.

Also normally I would talk to friends and people in school about this, but the victim's older sister attends and probably doesn't want anybody to know, so I ranted here.","0","2"
"t3_1j59o42","my friend tried to rape me, I don't know how to move on and my friends think I'm a bitch","some of you might already be familiar with my profile, with my story. I was sexually assaulted a while ago and I really thought I had it figured out. I don't. I'm not going thru all the details of that again but I posted it here a few days after it happened, you can look on my profile if you want to know.

After my last post, I went along with many of your recommendations, I took pictures of the bruises, I warned all my female friends bout his conduct, blocked him everywhere and even told my sister about it (not exaclty how it happened, just that I was feeling scared most of the time and that I was SA'd, I didn't wanted to go into detail with her).

And I thought, I really did thought, it was all going well. For the past week, I had not thought about him once, I had not cried bout it anymore, I was healing, I think. But today I overheard someone talking bout him.

Actually, I heard them talking bout me.

One of my friends - that was in the party I was SA'd at - kind of has a crush on me and everyone knows it even tho he never told me upfront. Today, I overheard some of this guy's friends saying how much of a bitch I was to be with someone else in front of him. I wasn't ""with someone else"" I was being assaulted. I was crying, I was asking him to stop.

I didn't knew he saw it. I didn't knew any of them saw it. And now I feel dirtier than ever. Yet at the same time, if they saw it why didn't they stopped it? Why didn't they helped?

I want to rip off my skin, to burn it so deep there won't be an inch left of what the man who sexually assaulted me touched. And yet now there's also this dreading feeling that they would still view me as nothing more than a bitch. I feel like I can't breath, like I can't ever run away from how tainted he made me, how dirty and broken he made me. Everytime they look at me all they see is my assault, and they think I chose that, think I am a whore. I can't deal with that. I don't know what to do.","11","4"
"t3_1j5mfrg","Revenge","I was involved with a married female for about 10 years. I was abut 25 in a new city and needed some support. I was staying at my relatives house and she was my sister in law. She was in a bad marriage and wanted to emotional support. This was my first relationship and the last. I provided here the emotional support and was like a father to her kids. One of her kid had adhd so needed the extra care. I was the emotional kind so thought this would last forever. She fed me thoughts of they being my own kids and i simply believed it. i imagined my entire life with here. even planing to shift to Canada to be able to be with her. I had to move to a different city before covid and thats when things started changing. She messaged less and called less. didn want to speak to me stating she couldnt get a chance. I Kept begging her to give me time to speak to me. Then she said something to the kids so even tey started speaking less to me. In the meanwhile my marriage got fixed and she just stopped talking me me altogether. I still wanted to be in touch with her, moreso with the kids but she took everythibg away from me. She conviniently said that she dosent thinks its right. for 10 years she felt it was ok. Its been 4 years and i still feel the anger. I feel she used me and i want to take revenge. Ohh yes my wife knows about it. Today is her 25th wedding anniversary and I want to send our old chats and some pictures to her and the family. I feel she made the kids hate me as she didnt want to answer their questions about the affair and wanted to protect her image. so I want everone to know about our realtionship and break her image of a good human.","0","1"
"t3_1j5h23j","I traded in a car. The heat wasn't working.","Its the middle of the night and I've just woken up. I feel guilty.

Yesterday I traded my car in for a new truck. The heat wasn't working in my car but the dealership never noticed. I actually went to a few dealerships and none of them noticed the issue,   which seems weird because its winter and I'm in Canada.

Sitting down with the salesman, he never asked me if there were any issues with the car and when he asked if they could check out the car I let them. I don't feel like I tried to hide the issue but I really hoped they wouldn't notice. Now that I got my wish I don't feel real great about it.","3","4"
"t3_1j5fikp","The nights are too quiet now","I didn't care how much sleep I lost each night. I never got tired of hearing her voice, or seeing how pretty she looked each time she smiled or laughed. I wonder if she knew just how beautiful she looked when she talked about something she loved. Everything with her felt new and exciting as if I was experiencing love for the first time all over again.

The nights are too quiet now. I still check my phone, knowing her name won't appear. I scroll through old messages, replaying our conversations, and wonder if she thinks of me. If she does, I hope it brings her a smile, the way those memories always do for me. And if not, that's alright too. Because I know, in that time, we shared something truly special, a spark of pure joy that I'll always cherish.

I don't know when or if I'll ever see her again, but I know this for sure: she was one of the best moments of my life. I hope she knows that she is still deeply loved and profoundly missed.","4","0"
"t3_1j59xpo","I’ll have to face the fact I have to stay in my awful, toxic job.","31F nurse in a very toxic environment.

I’ve been denied a promotion twice in 6 years.

I feel my growth has been stunted, no room for promotion, I’m not learning anything more. The staff are bullies. I’m being bullied by three seniors who are ganging up on me. Higher ups told me to be quiet basically when I reported it.

I’ve been run down, chest infection after chest infection, extreme fatigue etc then I went off sick five weeks ago after being told to shut my mouth basically and I’ve been fine since. In a good head space, no fatigue etc.

I’ve job searched every day. No suitable roles as I am specialised theatre nurse. All I keep seeing is clinical assessor/Pip roles and I’m at such a breaking point with my role that I am close to going for that one and it’s hated by people and run by private companies who can sack you at  any time.

I have to return back to an environment where the people are nasty, where the seniors are out to get me (and they are) and where I no longer feel I am learning, improving or getting anywhere. No amount of effort I put in works there anymore, and I’ve tried my hardest.

I’ve even contemplated leaving nursing entirely but no other role pays the same and I cannot afford to retrain for something.

I have a mortgage, pets to feed, bills to pay and now I have to accept the fact that i have to stay in this place for longer until I find somewhere else and even then, work never let me leave for an interview. I have to stay in my work prison and serve a never ending sentence.

The last day before I went off sick I genuinely contemplated driving my car off the bridge on the way home. Now I have to go back. My doctor said he’d give me a paper for more time off as he understands the pressures. But I don’t know what’s the best thing to do. I’m grateful I have work and have a job, I just wish it was filled with a lot nicer people where I could have a fresh start.","9","4"
"t3_1j4rccj","My grandpa used thousands of dollars out of my grandmas account and then DIED.","So recently my granfather died, He was a sweet guy as far as any of us knew him. He wasnt very active in recent years, in fact he was terribly sick for most of my (f20) life and id either see him at the hospital or on the couch barely breathing. So tell me why my grandma (whos a bit of a oversharer) told me about the family drama aka my grandpa took out thousands of dollars in cash from their bank account. My grandma found out shortly before he died when she found a bag full of cash and had their kid (my father) investigate. They planned on having a family intervention and question him on where the money has gone but then he just died! It wasnt a surprise for anyone that he died but like goddamn what could this old man use all that money for?? Like he would barely get out of bed he was so sick.

"t3_1j5l5t1","My Mom hates me","Sorry for the bad writing, i attempted to post it in an german subreddit first but they ave a limit of 3k letters max and also don't allow blocktext wich is what this would have turned into if i tried to stay within said margin (plus deleting a paragraph) So i had to use Google translate! Sorry!

I (25f) always have disputes with my (59f) mother.

Whenever I don't do something the same as she wants, she gets pretty acidic and even if I do it the same way as she wants, she somehow always has something to complain about.

Example of today:

Because of the beautiful weather, I should hang my duvet out of my window, but the problem is that the winter garden roof is right in front of my window and I can't hang it out because it is a more or less flat level. So I decided to hang the blanket over the edge of the winter garden roof, mind you at one point that was quite clean (in my opinion) at least)

And if I had hung the blanket directly out of the window, she would have been dirty or even dirty anyway.

I also had planned (and also discussed with my mother) that I would wash the blanket this weekend anyway.

Nevertheless, she then sniffed me about half an hour later and she also found it very shit that I sucked at the same time as I was sucking.

We have a solar system that produces a very nice amount of electricity in very sunny weather and I thought that it would already be finished with sucking because I hadn't heard her vacuum cleaner anymore and then started sucking my room.

However, she still has a problem with it because she apparently continued to suck again after a moment (which I couldn't hear because of my loud sucker) and also ran the washing machine (which I didn't know anything about because I couldn't see or hear her from my room on the first floor and that I was not explicitly told that it would be hired)

In addition, she also complained because I took a break when sucking (I have a cold and don't have enough endurance to create everything at once)

(My room consists of two adjacent rooms of which I usually only do one because I am more in this, but this time I wanted to do both and only took a break in between)

After I had explained Mama that, she told me that I always had an excuse.

I then started crying (no idea why, sometimes happens during such confrontations) and Mama asked in a rather aggressive tone why I would cry now even though there is no reason for it and that we would only have a reasonable discussion.

(Incidentally, the howling is nothing that I have an influence, I don't because it is to cry afterwards or something, I have zero control about whether or when this happens)

In the surplus, she also titled such moments as ""psycho shit"" and attempted manipulation.

(Not today, but in other similar situation)

Incidentally, she mostly teemers my attempts to explain and or counter arguments or ignores them entirely.

I often have the feeling of being shouted at in these moments, even though she only ""talks to me very quietly"" (her words)

I don't even want to do something in the household anymore because it is almost always wrong or not right.

And almost every interaction with her consists that she tells me something what to do, or indicate that something is wrong/dirty or somehow not correct.

That would be okay, but everything is just too much, I don't want to come down to her or talk to her.

When I come home and your car is not there, I'm already relieved.

Is probably not your fault, I'm probably just over -sensitive or overreact or something.

Also, i haven't stopped crying the whole time while writing/translating this and my mom came in and asked me in a really passive aggressive tone what was up and why i am still crying. I told her to leave and she left.

Idk what to do..

I feel like she truly hates me and idk why she does all of this like that. Maybe it makes her happy? When asked she always says that she doesn't, but Idk if i can believe that","1","1"
"t3_1j4yx7b","The cp case against my ex husband has been closed and I don’t know how to feel about it","In the beginning of the year, my (27f) ex husband (27m) came to me after not talking for a year since the divorce finalized, to confess to me of having sexual fantasies about children and looking at cp while we were together. I took this information to the police and have been working with an investigator since then, and made a controlled call to him with the investigator where he confessed only to looking at animated cp because “the real stuff is really hard to find”. Today I was told that they spoke with him and looked at his devices and haven’t found any evidence and are closing the case. And it’s a relief that, to the best of my knowledge, he didn’t hurt any children or consume any content that hurt actual children. But I was also warming up to the idea that he would face some kind of consequences for his actions. Because he also emotionally manipulated and raped me throughout our entire marriage. I know that I could still try to press charges for what he did to me, but I don’t really have any proof except for my own words. And I want to be able to just move on and enjoy my life now that I’m free from him. But he has a new girlfriend who is significantly younger and reminds me of me when I was young and fell for his bullshit. It feels so wrong that he can just do all of this and put me through so much and have nothing happen.

I hope he’s telling the truth about getting help and wanting to change, but I also can’t help but believe that every word that comes out of his mouth is a lie, even when he believes it’s the truth. But I’ve done what I can, it can’t be my responsibility anymore.","32","10"
"t3_1j5kuga","Feeling of solitude","Hi everyone, does anyone resonate or seems familiar to this? ( It's and italian text, so sorry in advance)

Una quercia centenaria, che persiste passivamente al tempo, sostenuta dal gentil suolo che l'accoglie, offre sempre il suo supporto ad un uomo mediocre che sempre ha cercato la pace all'interno di una vita in cui è facile entrare e pressoché impossibile uscire, cullato dal gentil dire delle moire, senza mostrare obiezione. La quercia offre segretamente conforto ai suoi numerosi coinquilini che la abitano ed ignora coloro che le crescono affianco e che cercano di non interferire con la sua quiete.

Le radici che prima estraevano solo preoccupazioni dai propri simili ora ricavano solo nettare puro e paradisiaco, ricco dei più naturali ed immediati piaceri: la pace del canto degli uccelli, la tranquillità di un bosco che come unica imposizione segue le stagioni con le bellezze che ognuna di essa gli porta, il rintocco lontano di una campana di qualche paese vicino. Le preoccupazioni inutili lasciano spazio solo a presa di coscienza ed accettazione.

Guardare al bosco e avere nostalgia di paesaggi passati che solo la quercia ha avuto capacità di comprendere. Voltare le spalle alla città che invece di nutrirsi di ricordi campagnoli e pensieri ciclici, senza neccessità di crearne frettolosamente di nuovi, si alimenta con la scomodità ed il rumore del futuro obbligo non naturale, non favorendo una vita vissuta unicamente sul filare dei pensieri e l'evoluzione dell'umore.

Vivere senza un'obbiettivo od un peso sulle spalle, vivere essendo nessuno, vivere solo di artifici umani e fenomeni naturali, solo la salute conta, null'altro, tutto ciò di cui ho sempre vissuto e tutto ciò che ho conosciuto: natura, relax, ricordi, solitudine ed isolamento. Così come fa la stessa quercia che ho sempre ammirato, vivrò questa vita spoglia e silenziosa, senza più incappare in tumulti di pianto ed ansia paralizzante, accettando il vento che tra gli spazzi vuoti ed isolati soffia e che ricorda all'animo la dimenticata arte dell'accettare ciò che razionalmente odiamo ma che inconsciamente amiamo, la pigrizia. L'esistenza terrena è di per sé mortale, quindi perchè rincorrere la fatica e l'ansia quando si può semplicemente accettare l'inerzia?","1","0"
"t3_1j5kpxw","I feel such deep gratitude towards someone and can’t share it","When I was 17(F), I met someone. A woman. Online. I never met her in real life, even years later. We only spoke on the phone once for an hour (years later). It was basically a purely texting relationship.

It was a blogging site, one of those where you just wrote an online diary, basically. We hit it off as conversation partners, but it wasn’t more than that for around a year. We didn’t even talk that often, but when we did it was magical. She was much older than me, and I knew it from the beginning. She was 31 when we met. It was weird for me to talk to someone older, but it just worked, and I didn’t think about it much, so I rolled with it. We talked almost exclusively about a shared hobby.

A year later I was having a complete breakdown. It was my first major mental health breakdown. I think I was just lost in transitioning from school life to college life. I suffered alone for a year (I didn’t really have a support system), and after that, I decided to open up about it in my online diary. I didn’t know what I expected, if I expected anyone to care. But she suddenly supported me. She talked to me a lot. She said she had been through the same things, so she understood what I was feeling. And that’s how it started: she explained to me A LOT about how mental health works. When I was a teenager, I didn’t “believe in mental health”. Till it bit me in the ass: I mean, I had this major breakdown, and suddenly, my “nonexistent” mental health incapacitated me. I had severe fatigue, panic attacks, even diarrhea. So, the woman basically taught me some basic concepts, explained some basic things to me. I started to read up on therapy, psychology, we’d discuss issues.

It was also magical: she just got me. I’d never had the privilege of having anyone in my life who understood me, gave me a manual to myself. I internalized my family’s approach of ‘you’re just a lost cause hysterical little shit, and there’s nothing left to do with you but ignore you when you get difficult’. And with her, I suddenly understood that I wasn’t hysterical. That my feelings had a cause. That I could actually fulfill my needs, and there would be no breakdown. So, she taught me how to relate to myself in a healthier way, how to be on my side, always. And the best part? She never actually lectured me on anything, never made me do anything, never got mad at me for not trying anything. And she was always respectful to me despite the age difference. She never played the ‘I’m older and I know better’ card, even though she was definitely older and knew better. She just explained how things work (for her, and how she thought it worked for me, too because we’re so similar), and I could take it or leave it. She just treated me the way that I understood how to treat myself. Like, she’d do or tell me things that’d calm me down, or help me get out of despair, or a panic attack, and I made a mental note ‘oh, that’s what I need when I’m having a panic attack. Yes, this works for me when I’m overwhelmed. Ok, that’s what I’ll ask for when I need support next time’.

I think I was going through this very major and life-changing breakdown for about a year. My health was never the same after that (still isn’t, 13 years later), but I was slowly learning to live with this new version of myself. I felt more stable, but I still needed a lot of support. And she was there. I don’t think I’d be alive or (relatively) sane right now if it wasn’t for her during that first year, if it wasn’t for her guidance and gentleness. I really had no one, especially no one who understood me like she did. She’s the one who made me try therapy. Not by talking about it (she never went to therapy herself), but a couple of months after we started talking about my mental health, I was reading some posts about therapy, and understood that what I felt with her, I could find in therapy. And I got really interested in it: with her, I couldn’t ask for more or for a more stable presence. With a therapist, I could get that presence for an hour a week on a regular basis. Well, I never found that therapist with whom I had this magic. Never found anyone even remotely not hurtful, actually (I have a bad trauma from therapy by now, tried 20 therapists). The woman was really the only person in the world who got me to relax and listen to her without fighting and rejecting right away. Others would just trigger me hard, trigger a defensive response and then hurt me when I couldn’t accept what they were saying, even though I was fighting myself hard not to push them away. With her, it felt like she was going through the minefield of my psyche, knowing exactly where to go and where not to go and how to neutralize at least some of the mines without setting an explosion off. And the most awesome effect was that the neutralization usually had ripple effect: she’d make one small thing feel slightly better, and I could feel the chain reaction of things correcting themselves months later, things that were unrelated to the first conversation.

It went on for years. I mean, she wasn’t my therapist, but… We talked about our lives, hobbies, mental health. It was always the older-younger dynamics, but not in a bad patronizing way: she’d just explain things, but she never pushed. She never said that because I’m younger I don’t get to have a different opinion. Never laughed at me. Never tried to make me respect her. She didn’t need to: I’ve never respected anyone like this in my life. She doesn’t have a conventional successful life: never married, never moved out of her family’s apartment, she didn’t even work most of her thirties (for reasons I didn’t fully understand but never pushed her to share). But I respected her more than anyone who had all those. She was very smart, driven, understood things deeply, always treated people with respect, everyone, she had this quality of attracting people to her, like, she didn’t wait for anyone to start talking to her (like I did), if she saw someone she found interesting, she’d just initiate. And she treated vulnerability with care. Doesn’t matter what happened between us, doesn’t matter if I hurt her (unintentionally. I’d never do anything bad to her intentionally), doesn’t matter what was happening — she never used any one of my open wounds, never chose to set any of the mines just to hurt me back. And she could do it at any moment. She spoke my language, she knew how to put things exactly in a way that her words would have the most effect, so she could destroy me. She never ever even tried in all those years. Not even when the relationship went sour and she was annoyed with me for years. She’d snap at the small things (once she started aggressively attacking me in a discussion about Harry Potter… Not me—my thought process. That’s when I knew it wasn’t just a rough patch but truly over), but she never went for my traumas. Not even when she didn’t enjoy me anymore.

As I said, the way she treated me had a ripple effect, fixing things without her even trying. Through the years, the way she treated me, talked to me, I developed that inner compass as I call it: basically, this feeling that in my life, I’m the one who always knows best. Even if I make mistakes, I’m still the one who knows best, and I’ll course correct if I make a mistake. I don’t mean that I feel that I’m always right about everything — just in my life, in things that concern me. It was very different from what my family told me: you’re incapable of anything, you should listen to us, you don’t have a brain. That inner compass made me finally start living my life. Not what my family thought was best — what I felt like doing. And the most beautiful part of it was that these things were not what the woman wanted either. They were truly mine. I moved to another country — something I always wanted. She clearly couldn’t understand my decision, but that didn’t matter. It was mine. I started speaking another language (English) more because that’s what I always wanted, and she couldn’t understand it either. And it didn’t matter. I knew what I wanted. And a thousand choices like that that she watched me make and kept her mouth shut enough. Because of this inner compass, I feel like there will always be a part of her in me, wherever I go.

As I’ve said, the relationship went sour. With years, I understood that this dynamics of her keeping me at arm’s length (I never knew much about her, her struggles, she never let me support her) doesn’t work for me anymore. And I wanted to actually talk on the phone, actually meet her. All I could get out of her was one phone call, and after that she was always “not in a good place” for a call. I finally was brave enough to admit to myself that I wanted more of her (and that I’m an equal in this relationship and an adult, too, so I have the right to pursue it), and wanted to have a relationship. She was vague about it. And then her reaction made me not sure about it, too. At some point she did try to rely on me more, and I didn’t get it, I guess, and it hurt her immensely (and when I understood that I hurt her, it was hard to forgive myself: she was someone I NEVER wanted to hurt. Not for any reason). And then we talked about everything — the dynamics, my feelings, our wants and desires — and just like that it was over, slowly, quietly, not really too painfully (and immensely painfully for me at the same time, but, I mean, she didn’t really hurt my feelings. I was just hurting because it ended). It was 7 years after we started talking.

But I could never forget her. I’d text her sometimes, just to know how she is. Nothing too personal — just to know if she was ok. She’d get annoyed at me for that. I couldn’t really understand why… She’d say something about me “trying to be a people-pleaser and showing that I still care when I don’t”. At some point, I asked her if I should stop texting her because I clearly annoy her. She said yes. I tried. I tried for two years. And then I texted her again and said that I’m not a child anymore (I was 28 at the time), and I don’t want to live in a world where we don’t talk. We didn’t have to be best friends, but I was certain we had to talk. Sometimes. About anything. At some point. And she agreed. It was weird, and I was the one texting her mostly. And then it fizzled out.

I never talked to her about it. There was nothing left to talk about, nothing left to say. But I still think about her when something good happens in my life. When something bad happens, and I handle it like a capable adult without falling apart. When I manage to choose myself instead of caving in.

Yesterday was one of those days I couldn’t keep it in (the last one was a year ago, and she did acknowledge it, even if briefly). I texted: “Hey, it’s one of those days when I can’t help it but want to wish you the best. So, here I am, wishing you the best. You’re incredible, and I feel so lucky to happen to live on this Earth when you exist”. She read it immediately, and… left me on read. I’m not sure why. She used to tell me that she doesn’t know what to say when people tell her good things, and she used to do it with me, too. But she usually acknowledged it. Now she didn’t. Did she think I was weird for texting it? Did I make it awkward? Was it too much? I guess I’ll never know. But ChatGPT told me to try and write it in a journal, so, here I am, on this sub, trying not to bother the most magical connection of my life with my gratitude.

I’ve been in love; I have parents; siblings (well, cousins); I’ve had best friends. And this connection was everything in one: an older sibling who’s almost like a parent who’s also my best friend and with whom I’m absolutely in love. She was my first adult love: the love when you don’t just fall for someone because you think they’re perfect, but the love when the more you see the imperfections, the more you respect and love the person. You understand how difficult their life is, and respect how beautifully they’re fighting and what a strong and capable person they are despite all their limitations.

My life (and mental health) are in no way perfect. I’ve made a lot of mistakes, some of which I won’t ever be able to fully correct. But the peaceful moments that I have, the good things, the authentic parts of my life, the parts where I feel like I’m living my life and not someone else’s, I owe to her.","1","0"
"t3_1j5fjlk","I hate how I obsess over people I care about, and it’s ruining me.","Every time I get close to someone, my mind starts obsessing over them, and I absolutely hate it. This is the third time it’s happened, and I feel like it’s destroying me because, with the first two, I ended up pushing them away, and we eventually became strangers again.

Right now, I’m obsessing over a really close friend in our small friend group of three. We’ve known each other for almost three years, give or take, and we’re so close we even refer to each other as “siblings.” But recently, something changed ad I've started obsessing once again. I can’t stop thinking about them. I always want to talk, hang out, or just spend time with them. And when they spend that time with someone else, I get jealous to the point where it physically hurts and I even feel betrayed in a way.

Before you think I’m completely nuts, I know this isn’t okay. I don’t start arguments, and I never tell them how I feel because I know I don’t have the right to control who they spend time with or talk to. I would never want to make them uncomfortable or make them feel like they owe me anything. But that doesn’t stop the thoughts from eating me alive. I cannot help but wish I had them all to myself.

Sometimes, instead of hanging out, I’ll say, “I’m tired” or “I don’t feel like going out,” when in reality, I do want to spend time with them—but I just can’t handle it mentally. So instead, I drive alone late at night, trying to escape the overwhelming thoughts. I don’t want to lose yet another person because of my own obsession. I am trying my best to stop, but so far, I’ve made little to no progress.","3","1"

It would allow me to pay my debt my ex left me with, get the education I need to find a better job and fix the broken things in my home.

"t3_1j5k39v","Feeling self conscious about my body after a comment made while intimate","Hi Reddit,

I’ve been struggling with something and I’m feeling really self conscious about it. I (19 M) have always been aware that my penis is very small (well below average) and It’s something I’ve been insecure about, but I’ve tried not to let it define me. Recently something happened that made me feel way more insecure than I’ve ever felt.

I was with a girl I’ve been talking to recently and we decided to have sex but during she said “I don’t know how to say this but I can barely feel anything. I was expecting something else” The way they said it wasn’t outright mean, but it felt so dismissive and made me feel like I wasn’t enough. It really got to me and now I’m stuck thinking about it all the time.

I’ve always known I’m smaller than most guys but hearing a comment like that from someone I was intimate with really knocked my confidence. I’ve only been with 1 other girl and I was self conscious about it with her but we both had a good time for the most part. But after that comment I’m constantly worrying that I’ll never be enough for a future partner and that my size will always be a problem.

I really don’t want to let this comment affect me, but it’s hard to move on from. Thanks for reading my post and I’d love to hear from anyone with advice to help move forward and feel better about not being well endowed.","1","6"

She was the first one in years that made me actually feel this way about someone. She was loving caring and amazing and she would drop everything for me. If texted her she was there but today she was distant. And i know why. She told me she didn't have the same feelings and i know that and i have to be okay with that and I'm trying to. But it's really difficult to. She started talking to this new guy and I'm pretty sure they went out today because she looked so nice in the one snap i got from her. It was her going out look. And the only time she doesn't instantly respond to me is when she's out with someone like that. If it's one of her girlfriends she's normally really quick and talkitive with me still. And it sucks. It really hurts and she called today to say she had a birthday gift for me which is nice because i don't really celebrate my birthday i don't like making a day about me but it's such a kind gesture. And i could tell she was really happy in her voice. And she said she had a good day and wouldn't tell me why which means it's probably the guy. And it's not like she's hiding that fact i asked her not to tell me about him and those experiences because it made me feel bad and insecure but honestly i don't know if hurts worse not being told but it still feels bad. Anyways I'm really lonely feeling right now and just wanted a connection from someone and nobody is there to answer me it seems. All the people who i used to be able to pick up and talk to whenever whenever don't respond to me anymore and when i reach out in a time like this just to feel a small connection nobody is there.

I’ve always had my suspicions but i wasn’t sure what i was suspicious about. I knew he had done some pretty tame things like drink and smoke but whose dad hasn’t? In a way this more just confirmed that he has cheated. I’ve also always been a sneaky person, when i was younger i would always listen through the doors and behind walls whenever my parents would fight, just so i can know everything and see how transparent they’d actually be with me. I’ve just always been nosy. A while back I was maybe 13 or 14, me and my family decided to upgrade all of our phones. When each of us transferred all of our information to our new devices some of the applications pop up. And at 13 i was the most chronically online emo loser who grew up in the 2000-2010s era so i recognize a grindr logo when i see one. That day my dad did look a bit like he knew that i saw but he probably thought i didn’t know what it was he had on his phone. I just told myself maybe i thought i had seen that logo, and left it alone, until now. Tonight after my nightly routine i forgot my hair ties in my parents room so i decided to sneak in there while my dad was asleep, and his phone was unlocked with a chat opened. Like i said….im nosy. I didn’t see anything but i 100% knew it was grinder because i saw the logo. I did take a photo while his phone was open too , i dont know why but something was telling me to! I also wasn’t sure if this was something my mother knew of and just never said anything. Just because i feel like it’s her natural response to something like that. I love my dad, he’s still a father to me and my siblings, and he works hard. This doesn’t make me hate him but it does slightly piss me off because all i can think about is my mom and how much she doesn’t deserve her husband doing something like this.

As of right now i’m not sure what i’ll do. I just wanted to get this off my chest because i know it’ll weigh heavy on me if i don’t tell some one. I feel like if i tell my friends they might pity me just because this situation is just so weird and honestly i feel like freaky stuff like this doesn’t happen in anyone else’s family LOL.","1","0"

I (19) have been diagnosed with severe depression and really struggle being clean. My depression stems from trauma from my mother, being verbally, emotionally, and physically (rarely, but still) by my mother (39). My room is frankly disgusting. My bed is littered by trash, clothes, and stuffed animals, I haven't seen my floor in over a year, and every surface (nightstand, TV stand, dresser, ect) are messy and filled to the brim. I lose everything and my closet is overflowing with junk I've never used. I don't enjoy doing much except listening to music and watching cartoons.

It sucks because I want to be better. I am very clean, I shower daily and wear deodorant/cologne, but my room is a mess. I hate it, and it makes me hate myself even more than I already do. I have a therapist, but I rarely see her, and I'm scared to tell her this about me. I have a full time job and people love me, I'm very organized and happy at work. No one would ever suspect I have a terrible room. The only thing I keep clean is my pets' cage (rats). I feel so embarrassed and ashamed, I never have friends over. I want to be better so badly but I don't even know where to start.

I have this wonderful dog named Richy, he’s the best thing that ever happened to be but my parents have a rule where he can’t go inside the house, he’s an outside dog. It’s been raining a lot where I live- I’m talking like crazy winds and rain. I asked multiple times if my parents can let Richy in because he can get cold and lonely out side and the response I get every time is “no, don’t ask again” or they say I’m being dramatic about him and that he’ll be fine.

"t3_1j5bn88","my uncle's girlfriend is tearing my family apart","So, I'm from a very close-init family, we love each other a lot and have always been together. My grandma had three children, uncle A, uncle B, and my dad, and then grandpa had a child with another woman, uncle C. This is about uncle B.

I don't like his current gf. She immediately trauma dumped on my grandma to gain sympathy, then proceeded to imply she was old and getting forgetful and clumsy (grandma's perfectly fine, she's as healthy as they come), then she brought along her son she had with another man, who I have no trouble with. She herself isn't bad, but the way she and her son behave is weird, because it's like they're not a part of our family, they just kinda live there, and I have the feeling that she wants to kick my grandma out and have the house to herself, which isn't possible because it's decided 50/50 between uncle A and uncle B, but she's tried to buy the other half to uncle A, who firmly refused, because once they both pass away, the house is mine.

The worst part about all this is my uncle's behavior since she arrived. He works with my mom at a local restaurant, nothing fancy, its main target are the broke college students nearby, but they get paid well. My mom had a cousin of hers working as a waiter there, and he wasn't the best, but hey, acceptable,  but uncle B decided to start saying that he was more trouble that its worth, and that his girlfriend's son should work there, my mom firmly refused. My grandma has anxiety of going out on her own for years now and since she only lives with uncle B and his girlfriend, she constantly relies on him to get medicine or to just go out, and he's been getting extremely rude with her for no reason whenever she asks to go out, yelling and saying ""he needs his own time too"". We threw a party for grandma's birthday a while ago, and you'd expect him to sit with his mother, but no, he went and sat with his gf's family, completely ignoring grandma. I fell and got hurt pretty badly a while ago, and everyone called me and asked of I was okay, but him? Not a peep.

My last straw came a few days ago, my mom suffers really bad anxiety/panic attacks sometimes and he caused her one. Long story short, he missed work without calling in advance and my mom had to cover his shift and then tried to reprehend him because she's the manager of the restaurant. He completely flipped out and said something along the lines of ""leave, it doesn't matter, (gf's name) can replace you"", and my mom got really mad, and said ""I don't want to have anything to do with you as work or as family, you're never stepping foot into my house again"".

Now I love my uncle, but his gf has completely ruined everything, I don't like her, I see her and I feel angry, but I can't do anything because I'm forced to interact with her, and you'd think my lack of warmth would tell her to not talk to me, but she talks to me as if she was my aunt, SHE'S NOT, and I genuinely wish I could just make her go away and make things go back to normal.

Studying in the USA has been my dream, but securing funding has been extremely challenging, especially given the current situation.

I have contacted over 60 professors and applied to multiple universities, but funding remains uncertain. With the ongoing conflict in Sudan and limited opportunities, I am struggling to find a way forward.

I am afraid that even if I secure funding, I may not be granted a visa due to the war in my country.

Is it possible to study there given these circumstances, or should I give up?

If anyone has insights or advice, I would truly appreciate it.","1","0"
"t3_1j5itoh","All my friends left.","I just wanted to put this out there and hopefully someone can read it or relate, or share any advice, or whatever. i spent a very long time getting out there and getting a big group of friends, just for them all to leave, i’m okay with finding new friends, and have been looking for a long time, but the truth is,

it wouldn’t usually bother me, but I can’t help but feel so bitter and mad about it, like I can’t really shake it. I’ve been looking everywhere around me, but same for jobs, I literally can’t find any social groups near me.

"t3_1j5itfh","Im breaking up next weekend with my girlfriend of 2.5 years","Throwaway cos yeah personal stuff.

I (26m) plan to break up with my girlfriend (26f) next weekend. We have been together for around two and a half years and we just dont really have anything in common, our conversations are frankly boring, she is a lovely girl which is why this has been the hardest decision ive ever had to make but i think its for the best. I spoke to her a couple weeks ago about a few things that were bothering me and sex was one of them and it made me realise that it was a different level of priority for us, for me its quite high and im very much experimental in that department and would love to try things but she just doesnt. And im not going to get her to do something shes not comfortable with or doesnt want to do. We also spoke about how id like to see more effort and enthusiasm during sex from her as i felt a bit like my pleasure wasnt that important which isnt a great feeling let me tell you, and she hasnt really put any more effort into it minus the absolute bare minimum.

If im completely honest, im terrified. Im scared of what the future will be, scared that I wont find someone else, scared about hurting her which is the last thing I want to do is hurt her but I also need to take care of my own happiness. This is my first proper relationship and girlfriend, I've never had to break up with someone and im so scared.

My minds still a bit mad trying to process my decision so sorry if this doesnt read very well.

Edit: more things to get off my chest jesus sorry. I do still love her, and this yoyo effect I'm feeling of wanting to break up then doubting has made me feel so numb scared and empty I feel so lost. Each time my girlfriend messages me today it hurts so much i really do care for her but, i just don't know if I'm doing what I did early on and ignoring things that obviously do bother me because I've got complacent.","1","4"
"t3_1j53tt6","TIL that my coworker had a Title IX case against him - from my predecessor - and he's still here.","I don't really know what to make of this, and I don't really have anyone to talk to about it. I (23F) started my master's this academic year and was brought in as a graduate assistant in one of the academic advising offices on campus. Our office has a new director who comes from a high school administration background and relatively new advisors (two of them, both have been here five years max).

Until yesterday, I didn't know why the previous GA left her role. She clearly left in a hurry because my office (her office) still had wall decorations, cork boards with posters and flyers, supplies, and cabinets chock-full of folders with papers, guides, flyers - you name it, it's here. It looked like the place was already in use is what I'm getting at. She created entire binders about our department's programs and even fully stocked the supply closet that we have. I knew she hadn't left due to graduation, it had to be either right before she graduated or she hadn't renewed her contract, but I didn't know why. It's not really my business, but I was curious and wanted to be sure it wasn't for something nefarious.

So, my suspicions rise when a classmate of mine, M, recognized the office that I said I'm a GA for (a handful of us are GAs, most of them for our college, but me in this advising office) and she brought up that she used to work there in undergrad until she graduated last year. M started asking about names from when she was there, and it became apparent we've had a lot of staff changes in less than a year. I thought, ""Interesting, I wonder why?"" She also did not like most of the people (advisors/director) who are/were here. I kind of shrugged it off, figuring that she probably just had some bad experiences or that the leadership prior to our current director was suboptimal, because I liked my coworkers. Naïveté on my part, I'll admit.

But something hasn't quite left me since that day: M said the previous director, let's call him Colin, resigned after being caught in a relationship with a student. I took this with a grain of salt because I hadn't heard that, not even from the other student workers who like to gossip, and M had made it clear that she didn't enjoy the office atmosphere.

Things came to a head for me yesterday, when I met with the current director to discuss some issues with the website. Things progressed to how she doesn't like how disorganized the supply closet currently is, and her plans to clean it out with our administrative assistant over spring break. She mentioned having so much stuff left behind by the previous GA, like thick binders of who-knows-what, and not knowing what to do with them. They're multiple 5-inch binders stuffed to the brim.

Bringing up the GA snowballed until Director casually mentioned how my coworker, let's call him Andrew, one of the two advisors in our department, was the one caught making sexual advances - and toward the previous GA. They had gone out for drinks after-hours (unsure if it was with a group), and he had texted her inappropriately about hooking up. The then-director, Colin, received word of this but didn't want to do anything about it. He was promptly fired for his inaction once an actual, full-blown Title IX case opened against Andrew.

The GA left after this incident and no one has seen her since. She left everything behind. Her friends harassed the office to try and hold Colin accountable, but it wasn't until the case was opened that action was taken.

I'm in shock and just don't know how to process these instances. He came onto my predecessor, yet she left, and he is still working here. I don't even know if she's graduated, but it makes sense now why her stuff was left behind and why nobody talks about her aside from the student workers who don't know the truth.","10","3"
"t3_1j5ez5s","I treated my for a broken hand/wrist as a kid and didnt know/realize it until i was older (very long read oof)","i honestly really should probably talk abt this bc it honestly was actually pretty tramuatizing, enough that i feel like i may have locked away some memories of what happened bc of just how awful some of the experience was

my memory is somewhat spotty bc of how scary it all was but ill try my best to explain

my friend had a Halloween party at her house

we decided to play something that involved running, which was a rather stupid decision as everything was slippery and dark outside

i was running near/on ground that was steeply raised up a bit for a buliding to be bulit flat on

i slipped and fell, despite the mud, when i instinctively reached out to brace myself by putting my hand out towards the top of the small slope i got hurt, really really badly, i had never been in such pain before, i dont remember how quickly it arrived exactly but it was pretty quick to show up

i started crying a soon as the pain hit and the girl i had been running behind took notice and from what i can remember asked if i was ok, the other girls i was playing with eventually noticed and the escorted me to the house and to my friend's mother who is a vet/vet tech

she wrapped it in blue vet wrap in the kitchen and asked if i wanted to go to the doctor, and child me refused out if fear of possibly having to get surgery and probably bc i didn't want to inconvenience anyone, the vet wrap was uncomfortable and irritating but honestly the splint i got for a broken foot abt 2 years ago was worse, and it was by an er doc too, and while child me had to experience that awful splint, the vet wrap did make my hand feel better, i felt like i could pick it up and move it safely

so i ended up staying inside sitting on one of their couches in the living room and resting my arm on the arm supports, watching tv with my friend's mom, i wasnt rly interested in the show but that was the least of my worries then, i think at one point she brought me food, like a hotdog or smth, which had ketchup bc my autistic ass wouldn't eat meat unless ot had ketchup on it

the other girls went outside after everything calmed down somewhat, tho my friend stayed a bit longer from what remember to make sure i was ok

eventually they came back inside for an event i forget if it was planned or started bc it was dark and I was stuck inside

basically it was a game where someone would get wrapped on toilet paper to become a mummy, they included me in it by loosely wrapping parts of my arm/hand that i was willing to move

and then we eventually all went home, i dunno when any of this next stuff happens exactly but ill try to explain it in order

i was cyberschooled then and at first i was fine... until i needed to write something, im right handed and my right hand was the one that was injured

i remember my mom yelling at me because i refused to use my right hand and i think i asked if she could write for me, she told me to use it and i remember crying and saying ""I cant! I cant!"" i tried to move it even slightly in order to try obeying what she said but the pain was terrible, horrendous, unbearable, i cant think of words that can extensively describe how much pain i was in

i dont quite remember it all but i think when i tried to use my left hand to write i was yelled at too, and my mom minimized my pain by saying smth along the lines of ""it isnt that bad"" and i was also condescendingly asked if i wanted to go the doctor which i again refused fearing surgery and also bc having my parents yell at me made me upset

all this time i remember i still had that blue vet wrap on, my hand was shaking and in so much pain, i forget if my mom did the usual ""let me feel it"" thing but if she did i most definitely refused and probably yanked it away, based on the fact I still had that vet wrap on i think it was probably the next day

i was allowed to write with my left hand but not without being scolded, i remember writing down things in notebooks for fun with my left hand, and i even decided that a character id made had my left hand's handwriting, i eventually got better writing with my left hand and honestly really had fun with it

while i wrote and did things with my left hand i also did not use my right hand or bend my wrist, at least i did as little as possible, i kept on using the vet wrap to stablize it until it wouldn't stick no more, then i found some wrap i has gotten from when i sprained my leg and so i it instead, and remembered how i treated my sprained leg, used that was refrence for resting my hand and also didn't move it bc it was painful

i dont remember much else abt the recovery, i think i stopped wrapping it and started using my right hand again as soon as the pain lessoned, which probably was after like a month or two perhaps? ik it takes longer for a broken bone to recover but the pain does go away pretty quickly honestly, i remember my mom expecting me to recover from my ""sprain"" in about a week and was upset i still refused to use it and instead write with my left hand

i did keep on writing with my left hand sometimes for awhile after that just for fun, which ironically probably helped my right hand recover lol

i dont quite know how long after it was but i think it was a decent chunk after but within the same year, i once again slipped and fell and i forget which handi landed on but based on the pain and how caught myself (the same way again) i think it was my right, which i once again assumed was a sprain, but only a minor one, so i again pulled out the wrap i had and i think for abt a day or 3 days wrapped my hand, i remember not having much pain and wondering if it still needed wrapped the next day, but i still ended up keeping it on i think

and until i was a teen it never hit me that the pain i feltin my bones was not a normal sprain thing but probably a broken bone, and it really hit me after a horse broke my foot 2 years ago that yea, that probably wasnt a sprain... bc like it was while less pain, that pain i got from my broken foot felt literally like a lesser version of the pain i felt in my hand when i was a kid

tbh im not completely sure if i did break my hand as ive never rly had it inspected for past breaks, unlike my foot it doesn't rly act up when the weather changes or from overuse etc, at least i think so? i never rly took notice of anything like thay as a kid because i was never aware or looking for anybpain related to broken bones, so im open to anyone suggesting its something else, not for legitimate medical advice as well, ik i shouldnt get it from here and its already healed, just out of curiosity, i wonder if it was like a pinched nerve maybe, but it didnt feel like one at all (ive unfortunately had and continue of have pinched nerves in my neck 🙃)","2","0"
"t3_1j5o8uu","I broke up with my girlfriend of almost four years and I regret it","It's almost been a year, and I made a mistake.In June I broke up with my girlfriend of almost four years because we were going away for college and we were both going out of state on opposite  sides of the country. I thought it would be the best thing for us, but it's been the opposite.

I really hurt her when we broke up. The first few days I thought this was going to be the best thing for me, and I just tried to push her out of my mind as much as I could, but I just kept feeling like an asshole. She loved me so much, and I took it for granted. She would do things for me all the time just because and never expect anything in return. She would constantly put me ahead of her and also just loved me no matter what I was going through.

I couldn't stop thinking about her, and during my first week of college, I was so excited about what was going on in my life, and I wanted nothing more than to just text her and let her know what was going on.

It bothered me that in the almost 3 months we had been broken up at that point, she never once reached out to me. I wanted to know how college was going for her; I wanted to know how she was doing. How could the girl who I once had this amazing love with not try to reach out to me once? I texted her, letting her know that I had been thinking about her and that I hoped she was doing well. She kept things super brief and said she hoped I was doing well, but I wanted to talk to her so much more, so I poked about what she had been doing, and in two months she had done so much, and she was going to this great huge school and was doing all of this without me.

I know I should've been happy for her, but it just made me sad and angry. We didn't talk for a month after that until she sent me a picture of a tattoo she had gotten. I was so excited that she finally reached out to me. This was the first time since we had broken up that she initiated the conversation.

We talked for a little bit, and it felt so great. We fell back into conversation like back when we were dating. It felt so good to talk to her again, but at the same time, it made me feel sick that I knew so little about what was going on in her life now, and I was only hearing so little about it. I sent her a text telling her how happy I was for her and how what she's doing seems like such a great experience for her, and she never responded. That hurt a lot.

I looked at her TikTok and Instagram for the first time in months, and I just wanted to throw up. She is living this whole life without me. She looks happy and, most of all, beautiful. Like, how dare she be so beautiful and smile at people with smiles that were once mine?  I would go to her Spotify, and I would be so paranoid that one of those playlists was dedicated to someone that wasn't me.

I felt so selfish and angry and mad at the world and at myself. I had to push her out of my mind, so I started seeing someone. I wasn't even really interested in them. Looks-wise, they were nothing compared to my ex-girlfriend. Their personality was so dull and boring compared to my ex, and in the end, I ended up just feeling like this huge dick for stringing someone along for months just to get over my ex-girlfriend.

I went home for my Christmas break from my college, and it got even worse. Knowing that we were in the same town and just a drive away from each other's houses made me feel insane. I got so nervous that I was going to run into her any time I left the house. I thought about going Christmas shopping in the mall she worked at so I could ""accidentally run into her"" and then would just get sad because I was becoming this huge creep. I wanted to text her every day asking if she wanted to get coffee, and I never did because nothing would hurt more than knowing she didn't want to see me. I texted her Merry Christmas, and she was nice about it, but she didn't want to talk to me anymore after that.

And then I saw she went back to her college before me, and it was painful seeing her with all her friends having so much fun and having so much fun without me. Seeing her cozied up with a girl on her Instagram makes me feel like I'm going to throw up. I see them post together all the time, and I just want to know if they're dating. How could she date someone so soon after 3, almost 4 years? How could she be so brazen and post her and that girl getting coffee and going on dates together? Does she not think I'll see it? I think I would feel worse if it was a man. The thought of some man looking at her the way I used to and touching her and being intimate with her makes me angry and sad and violent all at the same time.

I would stalk her pages all day while I was still in our hometown, waiting for her to post something and getting nervous when she would. How could she be having so much fun and be so happy all without me?  We were each other's first love, first kiss, first everything. And now I don't know if she's doing that with other people.

Things got a little bit better when I went back for my second semester of college, but I still just can't get her out of my mind. I'm starting to see another girl now to try and get over my ex, and she's, again, nothing like my ex-girlfriend, and I don't think there will ever be anyone like her.When I first broke up with her, I didn't think it would hurt this much. I guess in the back of my mind I thought she would've fought for us. I thought she would've texted me more when we were broken up; I thought she and I honestly would've gotten back together at this point. I'm so insanely in love with her still, and I brought this on myself, but I thought I was doing what's best for the both of us. I guess I didn't appreciate or realize the things that she did for me while we were together.","0","16"
"t3_1j5i0en","I really don’t see any point in living past eighteen","Life is so expensive nowadays, and it feels like no matter how hard I try, I will never be able to afford the kind of life I want. Moving out seems like an impossible goal, and even if I manage to get my own place, I worry that I will still be struggling just to make ends meet. When I think about the future, all I can picture is an endless cycle of stress, waking up, going to work, barely making enough to feed myself, coming home exhausted, and then doing it all over again the next day. It feels like I will be stuck in survival mode with no time or money to actually live.

I want more than that. I want to travel, to see the world, to experience things beyond the daily grind, but I cannot afford to. I am happy right now, but I know childhood does not last forever, and that terrifies me. What happens when it is gone? What happens when I am on my own, facing a future that feels like nothing but work and struggle? I do not want to live just to survive. I want to spend the one life I have being truly happy right up until the moment it ends, but right now I cannot see a future where that is possible.

I think I might just join the military so I can feel something, and if that goes well, I could get free college. But I don’t know, everything about the future seems so unappealing.

"t3_1j5l06a","I pissed myself in a ride thanks to an obese couple at a park","I hate roller coasters after this horrible experience.

My brother (17) and I (13)  were in line waiting for the Jurassic park ride(can’t remember where), the line was long and then the person in charge started asking for 2 people and no one moved. We were so tired of waiting and I told (lets call him Mateo) mateo to volunteer us.

He was reluctant cause no one had spoken up and we couldn’t see the cart, but I told him to please accept cause I was tired. When he raised his hand I saw a lot of people turn to us with a mocking expression, I started to get scared.

In our cart there were two morbidly obese people who shouldn’t have been allowed. The security lady came to secure us (it was a long bar that gets pulled from up and secures all the people in the cart from the hip idk how to explain) and she started pulling down the bar when she reached the gigantic stomach of the man. She tried going lower but his belly wouldn’t let her.

I was scared cause i wasnt secured at all. Mind you i was a fucking lanky teenager and the ride started and i felt myself slipping down. I started crying saying to mateo that i was gonna die and he realized what was happening. He tried to grab me as best as he could cause he also wasn’t really secured but he was way bigger than me. I was crying so hard trying to hold on with all my strength (it wasnt much lmao) my brother trying to help me, when suddenly i felt myself go up and almost over the security bar.

I don’t know how but mateo found the strength to pull me back down and I was panicking so hard. The ride ended and i couldn’t calm down, mateo picked me up and carried me all the way back to our parents, only then did we both realize i peed myself at 13 years old.

It was so scared, so embarrassed, top 5 worse  experiences of my life would not recommend. Being in a park with roller coasters rn made me remember that horrible feeling.

"t3_1j4owse","I accidentally brought an explosive through TSA and got away with it.","The title sounds crazy but in 2023 I was visiting family out of state during the 4th of July.  At the party that I went to with my cousins we were obviously setting off large fireworks, we ended up not using all of the fireworks and later that week while hanging out with the friend that hosted the party, he gave me the firework as a joke I guess and I just put it in my backpack that I had with me (note the firework work is the type you put in a mortar so IT IS NOT SMALL.)  I completely forgot about the firework in my bag so when I was packing to fly back home I wasn’t looking for anything in my backpack and was just throwing my clothes in. Turns out I never took the firework out, covered it with all my clothes and brought it with me to the airport. I went through tsa the whole airport and my flight without knowing I had this firework in my bag. I hadn’t realized that I even had it till I got home and was unpacking and it fell out of my bag.  Funny thing is my aunt got stopped in tsa on a separate flight from mine because there was some kind of flammable residue on her stroller that was detected and she had to be patted down and all her stuff looked through but they couldn’t detect a fucking big ass firework at the bottom of my backpack.","101","23"

See the problem is that when we broke up it was because he was making some choices that were really not great for our relationship. So, I have gone on several dates as a now single woman after 4 years of dating him and I feel guilty. Like I feel like even though I am single and I have broken up with him it feels like I’m cheating or lying by omission because I have gone on dates and made out with other guys. Like I still care for my ex but unless he can work out his problems I just can’t see a future with him romantically which sucks. I feel like me trying to sort out my feelings and date for fun would crush him if he found out I’ve kissed other men as I had only had one other partner before him.

"t3_1j59a9z","friend is dying of cancer, can't tell almost anyone about it","It was only a couple of months between his first doctors visit and finding out it was terminal. all of this has moved incredibly fast, and I don't feel capable of talking about it much. In the few times I have mentioned it to other people, I'm always very calm. I'm very calm when I see him, too. I just can't seem to cry about it when you'd expect me to, but then I break down at random times.

He's a lot older than me, so if I ever thought about it, I probably would've guessed he'd die before me. But not like this. Not this soon.

I'm not family or anything, or a really close friend. there are people who have known him for more than a decade, and I have to be some kind of blip in his life, having only really been his friend for a few years. In a way, it doesn't seem like I have any right to be upset about this. Not when he's got actual family and friends who are as close as family. but here we are.

the thing is, like, my own parents are...fine, but fell short in a lot of ways. i'd never, ever admit this to anyone i know, but I did/do see him as kinda a parental figure. Or, at the very least, a trusted older adult. Someone I could be honest with and rely on, which is pretty rare in my life. He looked after me a bit. Now I'm trying to look after him. I don't think I'm doing a very good job of it, but I'm doing my best to do as much as he'll let me.

I feel so worn thin. I'm trying so hard to be here for him, and also be here for my best friend who's going through a rough time mentally, and my family, and also work and have my own life and not go absolutely fucking insane. i don't know. this is more important than anything else i could do. I'm just so tired and sad and i'm not sure i deserve to be but there it is. I want to tell him that he's important to me, that this is really fucking me up, but i have no idea where to find the words. I don't know that the right words exist. I'd give anything to fix this. If I could die instead, I would, but that's not how cancer works. I don't know. I'm tired and right now I just desperately want things to be okay, or to not have to be the strong one for once, but who else is gonna be?","4","0"
"t3_1j4k76n","My lesbian coworker has given me hope for the world","and myself, I guess.

Backstory, about five years ago, the woman that was my soulmate and best friend called off the engagement. It hurt, and sudden. Within two years she was dead. She'd been diagnosed with terminal cancer, didn't tell me and left because she didn't want me to deal with that, I found out from mutual friends years later after the funeral.

It hurt, confusing and I got real cynical about life. Relationships. All that. It was bad for a while, but I worked thru it.

Since then I've been mostly single. Sort of a loner. Dated,  nothing serious. Closed myself off, from friends too. Life moves forward. Career takes off. My job requires a lot of moving.

Enter my lesbian friend, who is honestly funny and so good hearted that it's made the craziness of the world bearable. I'm a male. We became quick friends both being new and looking for things to do.

She's refilled my faith in humanity. She's got hobbies, independent ideas and cares about people she doesn't know. She has sympathy for people that hate her. She's willing to be the butt of the joke and then dish it out.

I want to make clear that this isn't about a secret love or desire to date her to get over my ex fiancé. She's just a good person and friend. I just like her. She's helped me realize how much I've shut myself off from the world.

And she's reminded me of why it's so important to have connections and friends.

She's a bit of an introvert, and I'm too so we've been helping each other with that. Feels good, which I need in the world today.

She has a girl she's trying to get the courage to ask out. I'm trying to convince her to do it, like my friends did with my ex-fiancé a long time ago. She deserves a shot at happiness.

But I wouldn't have thought that for myself six months ago. This excellent lesbian friend has helped me rediscover the part of me that loves human connection. And it means so much.

Since our friendship started, I feel the first genuine desire in years to try snd do things and date. To make friends and connect with others. To be part of the world, deeply and meaningfully.

I'm so thankful to her for being just such an awesome friend, by just being herself, she's helped me in so many ways she'll never know.

I think my ex-fiancé would've liked her a lot.

And I hope all of you will have the chance to have a really great lesbian friend who will help give you faith in humanity too.

I'm literally speechless, the person she pointed out is literally the brother of the individual I'm dating, I tried asking how we are related and I doubt it's a close relative, most likely distant and they are not directly related to me.

I need advice on how to cope with this.

Yes, the relationship was a bit toxic, he's a narcissist,  and I'm not saying this just cause I think so or a video told me. He told me from start, he went to therapy and the therapist told him he has signs of narcissistic disorder, adhd and other things.

But the thing was that, we loved each other so much, I know he loved me, and I loved him to death. Theres a lot of bad memories and shitty things he did, I wasn't the best eaither. He was really jealous, possessive and over protective, and I'm very sociable so yeah, it was a problem, but I knew he loved like he never loved anyone.

Last time we saw each other was in June for my birthday cause he broke up with me one week prior, then we stopped talking, talked again in July and since then we have gone zero contact.

Sometime I feel so chill and feel like I moved on, but I still think about him every single day, EVERY SINGLE DAY, and there's days I miss him so much and want to talk to him, every time is getting harder and harder to not contact him.

I wish he would call me, but I know he won't, and I know this is for the best.

How do you get over someone you thought was the love of your life and thought you were going to marry that person?","3","1"
"t3_1j5ptf4","I betrayed God for my male friend and I feel terrible","I 18F have been an Opus Dei Catholic for all my life, properly devout, receive Holy Communion on the tongue, read the bible every day, pray the rosary 3 times a day, wear my veil to church, grew up in youth group. You name it, I did it.

I have always told myself I would wait until marriage and never do anything with a man unless we had been married. I am in my senior year of highschool and I am very close with my male friend (also 18) who I study with at his house after school most days. He somehow convinced me to suck him off. This has happened twice now and I feel so incredibly guilty.

I am going to go to hell. I am going to church tomorrow night to repent and I'm not sure when I can go to confession next but I will talk to Father at Mass. I am supposed to be reading the Responsorial Psalm at mass tomorrow too and I feel unworthy to enter under God's roof after knowingly sinning. It was a grave sin and I did it twice, I haven't been able to bring myself to take off my purity ring but I don't feel like I deserve to wear it.

Anyway I am stressing now and do not know what to do !!

SIDE NOTE:I forgot to mention I am also so scared because he took a video without telling me until afterwards and my town is pretty small and I was in my uniform so if it gets out it will spread like wildfire and everyone will hate me !! so thats great","0","36"
"t3_1j5fkiv","My partner wants to get my name tattooed","My partner (20NB) wants to get my (19F) name tattooed. We’ve been together almost 3 years at this point. My opinion is that they should wait, if even getting it at all. I have every intention of staying with them but I couldn’t in good conscience let them get my name tattooed this young. They’re upset coz they’ve been wanting to do it for like a year now and I keep saying wait. I’d prefer if they did it for us to at least be married but they don’t want to wait that long. I suggested maybe a few years nd they got upset. Idk I don’t think I’m wrong for this. I wouldn’t feel good about letting them do something I myself wouldn’t even do right now, although they’ve said they don’t care if I get theirs tatted or not","0","3"
"t3_1j5b783","I don't know how to talk to people and I think it drives them away.","I've been doing some thinking about all the conversations I have had with people and I think I have a issue with coming off as ""authentic"" or ""comfortable"". I met this guy online he was really nice I gave him my phone number and we hit off, we have been talking for two days the second day we call I remember he said ""oh!, someone is calling me bye!"" and I didn't think anything of it but uhm I haven't really heard from him since I texted him and he kinda left me on read and I texted him again I don't think he bothered looking at the message and I think I don't want to believe that I had just got ghosted but I think I did? And I don't blame him really because I don't know how to talk to people. I've noticed that I overshare and I can be awkward and maybe I make people sad when I talk to them but at the sametime I don't know how to approach people, or how to really make connections so I just blurt things out and I can see why that would drive someone away that kind of thing is so tiring to deal with. I also noticed when we were talking to him he said now you sound more relaxes or more comfortable or you're not trying too hard and i've got that a lot, I don't know what that meana though because sometimes thats how I genuinely act, I guess because i'm so awkward some of the things I say come off as forced but I can't help it and I don't know what to say really and I don't want to interview people and be like, oh so you like this? and this? and that? how do you feel about this? asking a ton of questions. I also was talking to someone before this guy not ina romantic sense but I think I made things awkward with that person too, I think I made them sad and I didn't mean to but it just happens sorta and I don't notice until like a day later or so and its like damn I shouldve approached it like this or like that. And even when i'm trying to talk with new people I always overthink what I want to say, I LITERALLY WAS OVERTHINKING WHAT I WANTED TO SAY TO BOOK A HAIR STYLING APPOINTMENT LIKE COME ON, thats just pathetic that it took me 3 days to ask my stylist how much is this or how do I get to her studio because I was ovethinking what I wanted to say and because I felt embarrassed and ashamed. And I started to realize that even my bestfriends don't really know what to say to certain things I say so its an awkward silence before I have to be like so uhm ahaha sorry about that!! and I have to make a stupid joke or something because I know they don't know what the hell to say and I made the whole convo awkward. I haven't even spoken to my bestfriend of 5 years, in which I should be thr most comfortable speaking to in like 5 days because i'm trying to think of something to talk about, again this is so pathetic and I don't know why im like this, it shouldn't be hard to talk to people but for some reason for me it is and it just makes me kinda angry and kinda sad and jealous because everyone makes it seem so effortless to talk to people and have a regular convo where you're like ""AUGH I SHOULDNT HAVE SAID THAT IM GONNA PUT MY HEAD IN A WALL!!"".","2","1"
