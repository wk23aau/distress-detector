    "selftext": "I'm so tired...of the debts, these emotions, the fights with my boyfriend and being so afraid for my 10 month old baby daughter's future. We're so behind on our bills, we're in so much debt...we owe so many people money. Our friends, our families....I'm so ashamed to face them, I don't even talk to some of them anymore because I'm so ashamed. I feel so guilty...I want to pay them back but I don't have the means to....whatever little money we get we use to pay for food and our utilities. There's never any extra left. We're stuck in a constant loop of borrowing money to pay for all our debts, and we've been stuck for years...nearly as long as we've been together. We know it has to stop but then how will we pay for things?\n\nWe're constantly looking through job postings and sending out applications, I actually got a response from 1 of them but it doesn't start until April (if I can submit all the requirements, which is proving hard to do because we have no funds for it...it sucks that you need money to make money), my boyfriend hasn't found anything yet, though he reassured me after one of our fights that he is looking at every job posting out there and stepping out of his comfort zone, like I finally did last year. Our fights have mainly been about our relationship (we're like roommates, raising a baby) and money troubles, that usually leads to fighting about his difficulty finding a job. Some days I understand that it's just really hard to find one, also we stayed in one industry for so many years that branching out now is....hard. And some days I doubt that he's actually expanded his options, because I expanded mine and I found one so why can't he?\n\nOur relationship is suffering almost just as much as our finances, it's dying. I'm barely interested in sex, meanwhile being intimate physically is his love language. He's barely interested in other forms of intimacy, which is my love language. We've had so many discussions to try and find a compromise but to no avail. Most days I think our relationship is actually over, I've actually tried to break up with him in the past. A few times before I even got pregnant, a lot while I was pregnant and a few times after our baby was born. All those times tho he's refused, says he wants to keep fighting for our relationship.\n\n I had..or maybe, have really bad post-partum depression, it took me 3 months to even \"like\" my baby. I was depressed and anxious the entire pregnancy, but he was just so....unreliable. Like yeah, he did what he could to make sure I got my check-ups and other needs but he wasn't a good emotional support system, he did the bare minimum is what I would call it. He was feeling a lot of pressure and stress, you could just tell.  I know how this makes him sound but he's not so terrible, just...dense I guess and pessimistic. I also know how this makes me sound but I was working during my pregnancy because we couldn't afford for me to not be working too. We both know that we both definitely should have stepped up when I got pregnant and looked for a better job than the ones we had, but we didn't. We were both scared, and we've regretted it ever since. Because even now that decision is bleeding into our current issues.\n\nI've considered just taking my baby and leaving so my boyfriend and I can get some much needed time apart, to think. But there's nowhere I can  go. I also have like a lot of cats that I don't want to leave him with because that would be an AH move, they're mainly my responsibility not his. And yes I know they add to the expenses but they barely eat anymore because we can't afford to feed them regularly. We've tried to get them adopted but no one here wants rescued stray cats. Most people in our country think they're a waste of time and money...\n\nI know we need therapy, together and separately..but that costs money...and...money is the one thing we just don't have....\n\nThese issues have been weighing so heavily on me for a long time, but as I'm typing it I just feel silly...like these aren't really problems...other people have bigger problems is what my brain is saying. Insecurities I guess....\n\nTLDR; My bf and I are broke, in debt, still looking for jobs, have a baby together, dying relationship, exhausted, fighting all the time and DEFINITELY need some form of therapy...",

So I gave them money hoping that would spend it to ease themselves.

    "selftext": "Sorry for the long ass post. I would have made it longer but wanted to spare you the novel. \n\nI\u2019m honestly just really lost and struggling so much right now. I\u2019m 25, and suffer from a long list of mental and physical disabilities. I\u2019m not really able to work right now due to my disabilities but am in the middle of a long process of trying to get on disability payments. I still live at home with my mum and brother (dad is deceased), and I just found out last week my mum has stage 4 bone cancer. My partner of 3 years doesn\u2019t live with me but is soon having to move out of his family home so has been putting pressure on me to move out with him as we\u2019ve been together for a significant amount of time and we should be moving onto the next stage of our relationship. I\u2019ve tried to explain that it\u2019s difficult for me to move out as I don\u2019t have a job and the income I do get from the government isn\u2019t going to be enough to pay for rent let alone my food, medications, my dog\u2019s food and be expected to save for my doctor and specialist appointments but also to save to eventually buy a house like how he wants us to be able to do before turning 30. He just keeps telling me to apply for work and I only have experience in retail but due to one of my medical conditions I can\u2019t even stand for more than 5 hours on a good day without being in debilitating pain where I literally struggle to walk. I have no experience in being a receptionist and no matter how many jobs I apply for no luck. He wants me to move out as well as I\u2019m being treated as a stay at home mother looking after my mum and brother (this is well before the cancer diagnosis). I don\u2019t think as well that it\u2019s sitting in for him that I very badly need and rely on being on my mum\u2019s health insurance considering I\u2019m chronically ill and it can turn at anytime for me and sadly I\u2019m having a different surgery at least once a year, sometimes twice a year so idk how I\u2019d be expected to afford that if I wasn\u2019t living at home, with no job. He refuses to live with my family until we can save enough to buy a house because he hates my family and well understandably is struggling to even see a future with me like this but I feel like he\u2019s in between a rock and a hard place with the fact that he does love me and how he doesn\u2019t want to leave me cause I\u2019m sick cause it\u2019d be like leaving someone who\u2019s got cancer which is an asshole thing to do. And it doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m struggling with my mum\u2019s new diagnosis. On top of everything else I personally am just really struggling with how beyond god damn emotional I am. Late last year I fell down some stairs causing me to be bed ridden for 2 and a half weeks and in turn has caused me to develop or severely worsen potential already undiagnosed OCD. I\u2019ve never been diagnosed before with OCD because truly I don\u2019t say out loud my thoughts and whatever I have disclosed or displayed gets pinned to my autism but since the fall I\u2019ve been consumed with anxiety, depression, anger, guilt, agitation and panic with mess, things not being in a particular order (mainly MY way of order). I feel like a shell of who I once was I struggle to hide anything well, I cry almost daily and have just started to learn either cry to myself when no one is around or wait for my therapist. I don\u2019t ever want to leave my house cause if I stay at my partner\u2019s house, guarantee I\u2019ll be a sobbing mess when I get back cause my mum and brother always make a mess and they never clean up after themselves which in turn triggers me more. I already am a pretty reserved person when it comes to my feelings cause I think it\u2019ll come off over dramatic to others even though I know they\u2019re valid but today I got proven why I think that because my partner asked me what was wrong when I got home and I spilt 1/4 of my thoughts and feelings and I got stopped with being told that \u201cmaybe you just like to make things more difficult for yourself than it has to be\u201d. Potentially that\u2019s true but also I don\u2019t mean to, my brain just never shuts up which I\u2019m realising with typing this that yes it most definitely doesn\u2019t shut up. The sadder thing is there\u2019s a lot more to my anxieties and why I can\u2019t take it anymore and maybe I\u2019ll just get a diary and deep clean till I can\u2019t walk. I just want to be alone and lowkey sedated but I got an appointment in a couple days on an update to some scans and if I\u2019ll need surgery or not which is obviously another anxiety. I frankly just feel a lot of pressure from my boyfriend and I feel pressure to look after and help my mum and if I don\u2019t well no one will cause my brother and her partner are useless. I feel pressure on myself with my own mental and physical health, getting a job and what kind of job realistically would even be good for me, I feel temptation to go back into eating disorder tendencies or back into my addiction to smoking weed. I feel beyond insecure about my appearance which I know is a vanity and self esteem issues. I truly don\u2019t know what to do because try and take it day by day but I clearly have some control issues. I\u2019m frustrated cause I don\u2019t want to die, but I also don\u2019t want to be alive or at least conscious.  ",

I say technically because the first was so on-off that it didn't even count as one, plus she ended up cheating.\n\nBut what I've noticed since the that one is that I tend to be overcaring, sometimes clingy and think about whoever I have feelings for constantly, as if an image of her is burned into my mind no matter where I look or even if my eyes are closed.\n\nI've been through some brutal ones where a girl I met at university (a mate's mate but single) was so unbelievably beautiful, funny, well-mannered and smart that it was painful to keep thinking about her until I asked her out but she polited declined.\n\nThe other relationship was when I met an American girl studying here who actually liked me for who I am which was a surprise considering I believe myself to be the equivalent of Rocky Dennis in terms of looks, but with the way I was around and to her I realise now I was too overcaring right at the start treating her as an already long term girlfriend when we just started dating for 2 days.\n\nAnd then, after a while of dating she tells me something resulting in a glorious stab in the heart where she quite literally said \"over these past few weeks dating you has made me realise I miss my ex\" and proceeded to fly back to Murica (reddit won't let me say it properly for some reason) THE NEXT DAMN WEEK FFS so naturally I crashed out and drank a lot.\n\nSo referring to the title of this the one main thing as to why I don't want a relationship is that I don't want to lose her, ruin her life or make her detest me because of how I am with overcaring. I hate it but better to stay alone than to ruin someone's life.\n\nAnd for those of you who say work on changing yourself, trust me I've tried but it's pretty hard when you have little experience in the dating scene because you look like a damn goblin from clash of clans.",

I know relationships are never easy, but I\u2019m just starting to think that maybe we didn\u2019t meet at the right time in each other\u2019s lives. \nI have so many insecurities in regards to being included in outings. Her communication is really lacking and forgoes telling me how she feels about things. \n\nOur most recent disagreement has been in regards to travel - we can\u2019t come to a compromise and find a balance between her travelling with her (and also my) friends with time for us to spend together. We promised we\u2019d travel with each other after this year fell through for similar reasons. Instead, I had to leave it at she will go with her friends instead of me. I\u2019m hurt because it feels like she doesn\u2019t want to go away with me, but she\u2019s hurt because I think that. \n\nShe\u2019s promised to do better and apologised so many times for not communicating. I feel like our bad times are more frequent than the good. I want to push through because she is so loving, caring and sweet but I\u2019ve got a massive piece missing rn and if I explain this to her, she breaks down and stops talking entirely. I\u2019m stuck. \nI know I am so far from a bastion of perfection in this relationship, but I just can\u2019t help but be frustrated and saddened by this.\n\nToday, I was sick and quite feverish, so I spent a while thinking back to a past relationship. While I\u2019m absolutely over that girl, I just couldn\u2019t help but reminisce about how that short relationship three years ago made me feel. I do hold it in very high regard because I was in the wilderness prior to it - alone and totally confused about my place in the world before she showed me, so I\u2019m now quite nostalgic about what she was for me, especially now my needs just aren\u2019t being met. That girl and I met in the wrong time and the wrong circumstances to last, but we ended very amicably. I know it\u2019s horrible and so unfair for my gf as well as the previous girl to keep thinking like this. \n\nI love spontaneity and random, intimate things (and I have told her this) but never does she ask me to come over for a karaoke drive at midnight with the windows down. Never does she say she wants to spend the night with me somewhere random. I sometimes ask but it\u2019s usually a no. I feel like I\u2019m right back to where I was pre-previous relationship and I\u2019m lost and so sad.\n\nI want to make things better, and I know constantly comparing my last relationship to my current is really poor. I know I\u2019m focusing on the negative things she does. I know I could be better but I\u2019m so fucking demotivated bc she just doesn\u2019t talk and we just don\u2019t go out to do things. Then a rift forms and I have to be the one to try and pull it back, and then she\u2019s extremely upset and scared that I might leave her, or she thinks she\u2019s a bad person. I can\u2019t say how I really feel because of that. It takes days for our usual fun side to return and then there\u2019s a couple weeks of good. Rinse and repeat. \n\nLong-term relationships are loads of battles to stay in love. Some are so much harder, but I do love her. Though, is it worth losing parts of who you are when I\u2019m this age? I\u2019m emotionally exhausted by the constant confusion and stress of slow and lacking communication as well as my physical needs just not being met. I\u2019m 23, so I\u2019m not looking to waste her or my time any longer if this just won\u2019t work. I like solving things but this feels like it\u2019s becoming bigger than me. ",

    "selftext": "Throwaway account because I feel terrible about this. \n\nWhen I was young (10 maybe) and I got an Ipod. I would love doing stuff on it. But then I got into fanfiction and thus I got into porn (I still love fanfiction to this day). I also was able to gain access to porn sites (Pornhub, Xvideoes, Spankbang, etc). My mom had to work long hours and my uncle mostly left me alone (we're both quiet), it got more convinent when I got old enough to become a lackey kid (14)\n\nBut that day, I was in the mood for porn every chapter (what I now know as PWP)\n\nSo I would type chapter 'large number' and then put tits or ass and then search. I was already seeing gross things I wasn't supposed to but then I found a website and it had adults engaging with minors. \n\nI was aware that sort of thing was bad, but this was written not visual. I knew the visual stuff was terrible and never looked for that sort of thing. But the written stuff?\n\nI just kept reading it, I justified it as it's only weird if I'm an adult. I never visualized ACTUAL real life children, I would think about other fictional characters, not sure if that's better but I did.\n\nBut now I'm an adult and I feel disgusting! I NEVER want to hurt a child in that way! I despise child molestors! And yet I still read this stuff. I stopped when I was about 18-19 (not sure spefically but I know I haven't read that stuff in the past three years and I remember not being able to find the sites anymore, which was good in the long run)\n\nLately, I've been feeling really gross. Like I'm disgusting and I should feel awful what I did! Which I should! It's gotten worse this past year, I didn't really think about it. I still read stuff where characters were underage but limited to just being in their teens (someone on AO3 who does a bunch of Harry Potter/crossover girls stuff and another one who had his own website and was registered on Literotica). I want to cut those people out of my reading too! I feel horrible for what I've done and read.\n\nMore context: I live with my mother (she knows about the video porn thing, but not the written stuff), I'm a college student, I can't drive (I rideshare everywhere). I WANT to get therapy but I don't want to spend money. My mom has actually taken me to therapy a few times (this problem hadn't affected me mentally yet for me to bring it up, plus most of the time my mother was in room, so I wouldn't have done so regardless), I actually got diagnosed with anxiety. But I assume the reason we don't make it a regular thing is because it's expensive. The best thing I feel I can do is go to hotlines. \n\nSometimes they do make me feel better. Once I watched some YT video about someone who hurt animals and I thought I could handle it, but the woman said this man also read stuff from one of the sites I found (I never liked that, I would avoid that if I saw it) and I FELT DESPECIBLE! The hotline got me a nice lady that told me some gentle things that made me calm down.\n\nBut then I read one of the guy's I mentioned work on Literotica, the characters were ACTUALLY OF LEGAL AGE and it felt like I relapsed! Then I watched porn on a specific website for specific kink of me, but when I was looking for something one of the videoes said 'teenage' and I began to spiral. Because of one hand, not all pornsites are trustworthy but on the other, 18 and 19 (legal adult age) could still be referred to as teenage so I was confused, so I called them and the lady didn't want to help me and she transferred me to a warmline (they were nice but they asked for my insurance which I wasn't expecting so I ended up feeling emotionally drained).\n\nIt came to a head when I woke up this morning and I was on my period and then I started feeling those thoughts that was disgusting while my body was in pain. I couldn't call because my mother was still asleep. So I texted my hotline and the woman said my problem wasn't something a hotline could fix, so she sent me all these links to porn addiction stuff. They either cost money or I felt they couldn't help me, because they talked about this happening to men. Alternatively, they could help but my mother was still in the house, so I still felt I couldn't do anything immediately. And it really felt like no one could help me. I even signed up for Betterhelp (though I remembered they had controversy and signed out before telling my problem). So I decided to post this on here.\n\nI really don't want to hurt anyone. I want to put that terrible part of my past behind me. But sometimes I can't help but think about it and feel disgusting.",

    "selftext": "Okay so this might come across as a little sad and bleak, and I doubt that I will get any gentle responses... Might as well be ranting because I have found a haven in Reddit lately. \n\nI often wonder why anyone would like to be friends with me. I struggle a lot with anxiety and maintaining attention, and usually when I offer advice it is not that helpful (usually overly philosophical and impractical). Some people may like to engage in that kind of discussion I guess\u2026 \nI don\u2019t have any interesting hobbies besides going to a cafe by myself and having a cigarette, browsing and looking for jobs to advance my career. I have a very niche sense of humour that can be overly sarcastic and easily offend. I try to pick up hobbies, but I end up wanting to escape my reality via watching too much TV, cleaning/decluttering and spending time with my partner, which I also don\u2019t see why he would stay with me after the initial attraction wears off. I am probably extremely depressed as I grew up with a childhood trauma that I tried to address via therapy but it felt like the benefit wasn\u2019t outweighing the expense and somehow it felt even more depressing as \u201cmy only only hope for getting better didn\u2019t look that hopeful\u201d. A few therapists seemed to make me feel like my system was in a kind of a deadlock. \nI find myself lately thinking often about why anyone would like to be friends with me, even though I don\u2019t think less of myself - I am young (32F), attractive, fit and financially independent. I am well-educated and have a decent-paying job. I rarely lie, gossip and I like to support people by understanding their goals. I like to treat my friends every now and again, but I don\u2019t like transactional relationships. I used to have creative ambitions but quit them and settled into a boring life when I saw nothing was really materializing. \nHow can I improve this sense of isolation helplessness, with years of therapy as a last resort?

    "selftext": "Four years ago, I felt like I had achieved all goals, happiness, and was married to my best friend. For context, I (35f) and my husband (38m) have been married for 17 years. I met him as a teenager, we dated, and married promptly after my 18th birthday. I felt like we had really worked through a lot of issues to build a good marriage and life together. I don\u2019t have a strong support system of people in my life, so it was just him and me against the world. Well, that changed, and I\u2019ve been beating myself up about it for a while, and trying to navigate my feelings, or just ignoring them, idk. I started to have feelings for a co-worker (I know, typical). He has been a friend at work, and is married. There has been nothing romantic between us, and I don\u2019t get any indication from him that he is interested in more. He has just been supportive as my co-worker and a friend, and that friendship doesn\u2019t extend outside of work at all. I have no interest in pursuing a romantic relationship with him either. I don\u2019t want to have infidelity in my marriage or try to convince someone else to be untrue. And breaking marriages for another person just means a worse marriage.\n\nThis has really led me to contemplate my life. Why, when everything was feeling so right, did I start catching feelings for someone else. I looked back at our relationship and started seeing all the negative. I questioned if I was just looking for reasons to justify how I felt. I came to the realization that our dating relationship was abusive (and early years of our marriage). More than just bad, or two stupid kids. He was very controlling, pushed sex on me before I was ready, and even used a sexual act two different times as \u201cpunishment\u201d (that was painful). Anytime I\u2019m alone with my thoughts, I think that so much of how I am today in my relationship with him was shaped by the bad times. He isn\u2019t that person any more, he isn\u2019t controlling, and treats me better overall. But, I don\u2019t have friends, am scared to make him mad, scared to talk about my feelings, am super agreeable to avoid any conflicts. He has been explosive and mean in the past when he gets angry, although that hasn\u2019t been too recently. (Nothing ever physical.) I still feel like a terrible person for thinking about another guy, and feel some blame for wallowing in the past. I think if I would do it all over, and there\u2019s no way I would stay in the relationship if given a do over. If I had a daughter, I would teach her how to avoid this and reach out for help. \n\nI feel like my eyes have been opened to the truth of our past. I tried to bring it up with him by asking what he thought about our dating relationship. He said he doesn\u2019t really think about it, and I said that I thought it was bad. I brought up some things, and he didn\u2019t want to talk about it. He said he had apologized and I just hadn\u2019t forgiven him for it. He got mad, and I got upset and cried. I remember him giving an apology several years ago, we both got drunk and he said he felt bad about things and I consoled him, but I\u2019m just now realizing it was abusive. I wanted to get confirmation from him that he agreed it wasn\u2019t a healthy relationship, just for healing. But there was nothing productive about it. \n\nI find myself lately being depressed and bottled up. I work full time and my husband hasn\u2019t had a job for a few years now. I really don\u2019t care if he works, but want him to contribute to our relationship in some way. Instead he spends a lot of time sitting around the house on his phone making a mess and spending excessive amounts of time on hobbies. And no, I don\u2019t think there is any chance he is cheating. I think he is also depressed. My guilt and frustration are overwhelming. I love him and he loves me, but I\u2019m spending too much time in my head not dealing with my feelings, just hoping things find their place and go back, even though I know that\u2019s not likely. I know I could use counseling to work on past trauma and learn to be a better partner myself. So maybe I\u2019ll finally do that. ",

A few days later I kissed a new guy and a week after that I started dating that guy. And so on and so forth. I often ended it with one guy, and started dating a new one a week or two after.

I was a terrified pregnant 18 year old with no one to turn to. I left him almost two years after we moved in together. I called my mom after not talking to her or my dad for almost a year. And I asked if I could come visit. I moved back to their house a week after. \n\nAt the beginning of 2018 I moved from my hometown to a little island where I met my now husband (37M) and father to my two younger sons. I admit I tried repeatedly destroying this relationship, he never gave up, just kept on loving me through all of it. \nChristmas 2023 I had a mental breakdown, planning how to kill myself and writing letters to my family. But making my child cry while he was playing with his new toys, made me get some help. I was in the psych ward for 8 days, didn\u2019t get to see my children other than FaceTime, and I celebrated new years alone. \nI was diagnosed with CPTSD, depression, anxiety and borderline personality disorder. I had a ADHD diagnosis from the age of 15.\n\nI started therapy February 2024, and DBT group September 2024. And I have finally started getting back to my feet, learning how to feel emotions again, and not look at myself with resentment and disgust. I have not had a big emotional breakdown or reaction since October 2024, and I am so proud of myself. I started ADHD medication for the first time in 13 years, and it has helped me keep up everything in the house, and following my kids closer. I\u2019m so grateful that I didn\u2019t go through with my plan, and I thank my children and husband every day for being \u201cmine\u201d and that I love them more than anything. \n\n\n",

(I've always needed therapy i just havent wanted to go) I have ADHD and depression +anxiety and have been un medicated.\n\n\nI want to talk to a professional because I cannot handle going to work. I hate working. I hate how my body aches and I'm forced to think and not be able to do anything acually GOOD to help me get out of it. I have to do tasks wile being trapped by my own mind. I suffer from some sort of gender dysphoria, I hate being a woman when someone reminds me that...I am... a woman. when i forget i am a girl. im okay. but, I have Tokophobia(fear of pregnancy) and it is effecting my day to day life. it hurts to live. I'm surrounded by men at work who can't even confront their own emotions I KNOW they can't handle mine, they have given up right in front of me. I have to stay sheltered and not speak my mind because it isn't about tacos (I work at taco bell) so I'm alone in my suffering\n\nthat is until I have my boyfriend or my best friend with me(we work together) my friend helps me by basically forcing me to talk for once(after hours during close) and I'll litteraly be there crying while working and the others look at me like \"wtf I'm staying out of this\". ITS EMBARRASSING but it's so nesssesary to my sanity\n\nI cry every day now. I feel so cursed in this body. \n\nI'm so lucky to have both my BFF and my boyfriend who support me 100. they just want me to be okay, but I can tell I'm not normal the way my thoughts race and crying when I'm alone.

    "selftext": "I (25F) have been in a long-distance relationship with this guy (23M) for the past 1.5 years. He was really sweet and caring in the beginning, and I talked to him for a considerable amount of time before starting a relationship with him. It's just that I think his behavior has changed compared to how it was during the talking stage and the first few months of the relationship. He says he's a fault-finder and that it's just a part of his personality.\n\nIn the beginning, he only used to praise my appearance, but over time, he started commenting on my facial features (nose, forehead, etc.) and many other things. I\u2019ve had a bad case of acne throughout my adolescence due to sensitive skin and genetic factors, so it couldn\u2019t be cured completely. While I don\u2019t have cystic acne all over my face anymore, I still occasionally get breakouts. The skin on my body also gets inflamed easily after waxing.\n\nEarlier, he never said anything about it\u2014in fact, he used to love and support me despite all of this. But eventually, he started telling me to use certain products to improve my skin. I\u2019ve told him multiple times that this isn\u2019t how things work (since I\u2019ve undergone treatment for most of my life), but he gets irritated and says I don\u2019t even want to try and that I lose hope too easily. Similarly, he made comments on my facial features and said I need to get plastic surgery. When I got upset, he claimed it was just a joke.\n\nI have a very chirpy, bubbly personality and get excited easily. We recently went to a concert, and everything was fine until we were walking back. As we were side by side with his arm around my neck, we reached a narrow space where only one of us could pass at a time. I was focused on our conversation, so I stood there for a second or two before moving. He got annoyed, removed his arm, grabbed me from behind, and pushed me through the space.\n\nAfter that, he started scolding me for being \"too dumb\" to stand there and not move immediately (which I don\u2019t think is even a reason to fight). For the next hour, he kept verbally abusing me, asking if I was really dumb or just pretending to be around him. He even mocked my excitable personality, saying I get too excited to see him and then start acting dumb. He also said I don\u2019t deserve anything he does for me (including the concert, which was my birthday present from him). He kept going on and on while we walked back for an entire hour. My head hung low, and I was holding back tears the entire time.\n\nWhen I had to catch the train to return home, he held my backpack tightly from behind and forced me to jump onto the moving train, even though I was scared and there was a huge risk involved in doing something like this, I mean, anything could have gone wrong! We had gotten late and almost missed it.\n\nJust two weeks ago, he \"faked\" breaking up with me to \"teach me a lesson\" because he thought that was the only way I would understand. He said he had fought with me multiple times over a single issue, and since I didn\u2019t seem to get it, he had to do this. At first, I thought he was just angry and didn\u2019t take it seriously. But the next day, he texted me dryly and told me it was final. I was heartbroken and broke down in tears, desperately trying to reach out to him.\n\nThat afternoon, I video-called him while crying hysterically, begging him to come back. He laughed in my face and told me not to cry, that everything would be fine in two to three months, and that I should just leave him. He was completely unemotional and unnecessarily cold. Each word hit me hard, and I kept wondering where all his love had gone.\n\nHe knows I\u2019ve had traumatic experiences in my past relationships, yet he took advantage of my biggest emotional vulnerability. He knows I get anxious, overthink everything, and become inconsolable. Despite that, he played on my emotions. The very next day, he went on a five-day trip with his friends, which they had been planning since the previous week. He barely responded to my texts or calls while I was a crying mess, unable to eat, sleep, or work properly.\n\nWhen he came back, I decided to talk to him one last time because I was so hurt that I had finally made up my mind to end things. But when I called him, he acted as if nothing had happened. I lashed out and told him everything he had done wrong and how I felt all those days. After listening, he finally realized how horribly he had treated me and admitted that he thought we would reconcile. He had only pretended to break up with me so I would \"realize my mistake.\" It was never real. He thought we\u2019d just talk and sort it out.\n\nI wasn\u2019t in the right headspace, but I still gave him another chance.\n\nThere are other things that bother me, and I\u2019ve told him a million times to work on them. I always get excited for the weekends because we\u2019re busy all week, and I look forward to spending time together. I usually plan for us to watch a movie, and he always promises to be there at a certain time. But then, he keeps postponing because his roommates drag him along, saying he can\u2019t stop them. He keeps pushing it forward until it\u2019s too late, and I end up waiting. At the end of the night, I just say, \"I understand,\" and go to sleep. He apologizes, promises it won\u2019t happen again, and then does it again the next weekend.\n\nAfter the \"breakup\" drama, we discussed this, and he promised to change. But that very day, he did it again. And then again this weekend.\n\nHe has also told me multiple times that if I don\u2019t start making \"good money\" and move in with him soon, he might get attracted to someone else and leave me.\n\nHe constantly tries to make me jealous by talking about other girls, even saying he doesn\u2019t want to waste the best years of his life in a long-distance relationship and wants to hook up with other girls. Later, he claims he\u2019s just joking and doing it to \"motivate\" me to work harder, earn well, and move in with him.\n\nOn the other hand, I\u2019ve never belittled him or made negative comments about his appearance or insecurities. He has acne scars and body dysmorphia, but I\u2019ve always loved him as he is, making sure he feels comfortable in his own skin. I tell him he\u2019s the most perfect guy for me and that he doesn\u2019t need to change anything to feel good or deserving.\n\nBut he constantly criticizes me, mocks me when I express my struggles, and calls me \"weak\" whenever I try to talk about things that hurt me. He says he doesn\u2019t like weak people who \"crib all the time,\" which makes me feel like I can\u2019t even discuss my problems with him. If I do, he gets annoyed, fights with me, and tells me I\u2019m playing the victim instead of being strong.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m just really confused. I love him and don\u2019t want to leave, but I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s good for me.\n\n\nPS: The \"mistake\" he wanted me to realize was that he thinks I need to develop new skills to switch to a better job. My current job is hectic and low-paying, but I have to work hard throughout the week. With my parents' declining health, I can\u2019t study every weekend. Sometimes, I slack off because I\u2019m overwhelmed and need to cool off. He tells me I need to hurry up, and when I explain my situation, he fights with me, mocks me, and says I\u2019ll never earn well or do anything in life because I\u2019m not trying hard enough.\n\nEdit : Additionally, he has told me multiple times that other people\u2019s opinions of him matter a lot. He wants to be \"likable\" to everyone. He said he used to get a lot of attention before developing acne, but things changed after that, which is why he constantly seeks validation from others. He gets upset when girls, in general, don\u2019t give him attention. Whenever I ask why he seeks attention from other girls when I\u2019ve always appreciated and motivated him, he simply says it\u2019s because I\u2019m his \"girlfriend,\" so my words don\u2019t count. He also gets noticeably excited and happy whenever he finds out that a girl is interested in him, as it satisfies his need for validation. I've always brushed it off but idk if it's a concern or not.\n",

    "selftext": "This is the second time in two days this has happened. Sorry for any errors but I'm in the middle of the second one and it makes reading a real bitch.\n\nThe trigger is bright light. Up until two days ago if I looked at a bright light I'd just get this dark smudge in my vision which went away soon.\n\nWell, on Friday I looked at something bright. Don't even remember what it was, maybe the light reflecting off a car, it was sunny. I went into Maccas to pick up a burger for my mother and I had trouble reading past the black splotch. Ordered the burger, scrolled tumblr while I waited. \n\nThe black splotch soon disappeared but there was nothing where it had been. I was reading something about COVID and it was hard to read. I could see only the top third of the C and the bottom left of the O in COVID was also gone.\n\nAnd then I got this static that appeared. This flashing rainbow static. It started moving out across the left of my vision, and I could see directly in front of me but the blind spot was getting bigger and moving. If I held up my hands in front of me I couldn't see my left hand at all.\n\nI made it home OK but half an hour after it started the left of my peripheral vision was gone.\n\nLuckily in another half hour my peripheral vision was back, but augh, it just happened again. I looked at a candle and went to read a book, and oh shit, I can barely read again, and oh no there's the small flashing staticky crescent, and it went and spread across the left of my vision again. Like a ripple going outwards.\n\nMy peripheral vision on my left is gone again.\n\nI hope this isn't going to become a thing. I had a similar thing happen to me fifteen years ago, once, but this is twice in two days. Am I going to have to start making sure I don't look at bright lights now? What if it gets worse? I'm seeing my doctor about something unrelated on Monday but I often struggle to get taken seriously by doctors (yep, I'm a woman) and I'm tired of going to battle every time there's something wrong with me.",

I\u2019m extremely shy, and socializing feels like an impossible task, I had a girlfriend through most of my first year here who I met early but she left me out of boredom and since my entire social group consisted of her friends (since she grew up here) im now a extreme loner.

To give some context to that. I was in a sort of common/uncommon situation back in high school. Being viciously bullied at school and abused outside of it. Lead me to be somewhat of a target. The only thing was girl bullies don't normally bully to your face they do everything, if not most behind your back, which lead me to blaming the only person who openly made fun of me but what he did wasn't even that bad. Example he would snicker to his friends where I could hear or throw snow balls at me. Chomp change in comparison to what I was going through at the time. Although it was enough for me to tell everyone I hated, loathed and despised him. For Years and only when I became an adult did I realize that what I was saying about him was somewhat the same as what I heard about myself. Hatred with no context. I've felt bad ever since and even though it's been 20 years I've always wanted to say \"I'm sorry\" but could never find him. Till tonight at 2am I found him and he's engaged and looks very happy. So I just wanted to get this off my chest, since I will stop looking now, I have no intention of trying anymore cuz he deserves to not have this random piece of knowledge. That's otherwise useless to his happy life and is more so for me. ",

    "selftext": "I apologize in advance for any grammar/spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.  \nFor context: me (27F) and my bf (25M) have been in a relationship for 5 years and living together in my father's house for 4 (in my country living costs are really high so it's pretty common to still stay with your parents beyond your 20's).  \nAt the end of last year my bf decided he needed a new phone for posting content (tiktok and reels) since his current phone's camera wasn't good and his career (gym instructor/ personal trainer) could use a boost from social media. While I agreed that a new phone with a better camera would help and I knew that he had saved some money, I asked him to wait a little longer (1 month or 2) before making any impulsive puchases since I was unemployed at the time and that money could be used for any emergencies.   \nWell, he disregarded everything I said and decided to buy the phone anyway, and to make a long story short, it was a scam in wich he lost almost $800. To say I was disappointed is an understatement because i told him before, that even though the money was his and he could use it any way he wanted, the shop was really suspicious and it was better to buy from an official store if he was going to spend that much in a phone.   \nIt was really frustrating but I tried to help him contact his bank to see if there was anything we could do and to my surprise they refund almost half of the money, but my happiness was short lived because the very next day he fell for another scam and lost both the recovered money plus $300 ($250 from his account and $50 from mine). I was livid at this point, the car had broken down (another $600 expense), we had no way to pay our share of the bills plus the repair costs and he had to ask for money from his mother (bless her) to solve everything, but we survived.  \nWell, now I'm employed and things were better until yesterday when he told me he was thinking again about buying the phone, to wich I told him: \"no way, not right now\", since we're not completely stable yet to spend that much money and I thought he would be at least a bit more mindful since we're still paying for his poor decisions from last year and we barely have money for bills, but he didn't want to listen to my reasoning, kept justifying why he needed it and I'm sure he'll buy it even though he knows that if he does that I'll have to cover his share of house expenses and I'm honestly mentally and emotionally exhausted, I feel like he isn't my partner anymore, just an oversized toddler and it's draining me.  \nFor additional context: he's been betting his money on soccer games and although he wins most of them, last week he almost lost all of the grocery money :)  \nOur currency is not USD, so those are all approximate values.  \nIf you survived my ranting, thank you for reading everything.",

    "selftext": "A bit of backstory: I used to live in the countryside with an older relative and she had a habit of acquiring pets she was unable and unwilling to take care of, eventually we ended up with four dogs, two small and two large. The problem is that every time we would open the front gate to take the car out the dogs would run out into the brush and potentially put themselves in danger, so we\u2019d lock them in a tiny cage for a few minutes while we drove out and then come back in and let them out into the yard. The two large dogs started to get too big and the relative refused to buy a new larger cage for them and told me to figure it out (it was my job to lock up the dogs and this relative could basically boss me around all she wanted.) eventually I started putting one of the smaller dogs in an open plastic barrel while the others stayed in the cage, but she learned to jump out, so I would put a lid on it for more than five minutes. I hate myself for it, but I am an extremely, almost medically, forgetful person. And one day, I simply forgot about the dogs, and went to work, truly believing that I had let them out as usual. I came back to find that the dog had suffocated in the covered barrel. I can\u2019t explain the emotions I had in that day, but that happened when I was 16 and it still makes me nauseous to think about. I\u2019ve had a very hard life, but for some reason I think that this day was the worst day. There was a lot of screaming and crying from both the relative and I and she made me wrap the dog in an old dog food bag and carry it to the car so that I could dump it far from our property, unceremoniously. It still fucking haunts me. Everyone tells me it was an accident, but I still have nightmares about it. All I can think about is how horrible it must be to be a tiny innocent thing suffocating in a plastic barrel on a hot day. It eats me alive. Everything makes me anxious, I don\u2019t want to be responsible for something like that happening again, I want to have kids one day, but how can I knowing that there\u2019s a possibility that they can meet a horrible end just because my mind is in the clouds. The only time I spoke of this event was the day it happened, to various online friends, and then I never spoke of it again since until now. I\u2019m laying in bed and trying to sleep, and maybe it would help if someone knew. \n\nI\u2019m sorry Lila, I didn\u2019t mean to. ",

    "selftext": "I Ran Away from Home at 13 to Escape Abuse Now I'm Trying to Change My Life\n\nI don\u2019t know if my story matters to anyone, but I feel like I need to let it out. Maybe someone out there understands what it\u2019s like.\n\nI grew up with my grandmother when I was little, and she made me feel loved. She taught me kindness, humility, and the importance of sharing, even when you don\u2019t have much. I still carry that with me today. But when I was five, she had to leave, and I was sent to live with my mom. She tried her best she worked abroad to support me. Eventually, I was left along with my half siblings to their grandmother, and that\u2019s when everything changed.\n\nFrom the time I was six until I was thirteen, I was abused. Not just words physical beatings that left my skin red and bruised. My teachers saw the marks, but I told them I fell. What else was I supposed to say? No one would have believed me anyway. My only escape was watching TV dramas. I cried along with the characters because, for a moment, it felt like I wasn\u2019t alone. I had no phone, no way to tell my mom, no one to vent to.\n\nI tried everything to please her. I got good grades. I cleaned the house. I did the dishes. Nothing was ever enough. Because in her eyes, I didn\u2019t belong I wasn\u2019t of her blood. No matter what I did, I was unwanted.\n\nSo one day, I left.\n\nI walked nearly 6 kilometers to my grandmother\u2019s place. It wasn\u2019t my first time running away I even did it once when I was six, but that time, I brought a school friend with me. Their grandmother was furious that I brought their grandchild along with me tbh I didn't know what I was thinking I was still a child that time in 2nd Grade. But this time, I was alone and determined. When I finally arrived, my grandmother wasn\u2019t upset she was happy to see me. She took me in without question. It was only after the third time I ran away that she finally got mad and went straight to confront the woman who had abused me.\n\nThat was the moment I finally felt safe. My grandmother has been my safe space ever since.\n\nBut the past doesn\u2019t just disappear. Even after escaping, I still struggled. In 7th grade, I got dengue and had to be hospitalized for a month. That\u2019s when the doctors found other health issues, but I was never told what they were. No one ever explained anything to me. At least my stay was covered by PhilHealth, so it didn\u2019t add to my problems.\n\nNow I\u2019m 19, but I still feel stuck. I have trust issues. I struggle with self-worth. Sometimes, I wonder if I\u2019m the problem, if I\u2019ve just been blaming my childhood for everything. But I also know I want to break free from this cycle. I want to change.\n\nI want a better life. I want to help others like me. I want to leave an impact and make a difference. And if I want that, I have to keep going. ",

    "selftext": "After returning home from an ayahuasca ceremony, I got a message from a friend of mine whom I considered a \"spiritual brother\". He wanted to meet up. I was still in that post-ceremony glow\u2014full of energy despite the late hour\u2014and I wanted to socialize.\n\nI live down a long dirt trail, a 15-minute walk from the nearest road. When I got there, he was waiting in his SUV. I was excited to talk with him. Right away, he offered me some hard liquor, saying, \u201cThis is what the indigenous people drink here! It\u2019s very good for you.\u201d But I had just returned from drinking ayahuasca, and he knew that. He wasn\u2019t speaking clearly, but he started telling me stories about indigenous cosmology, which fascinated me\u2014until the conversation took a turn.\n\nHe began talking about how husbands take other women and how normal it is. Then he told me he needed someone \u201cspiritually on his level\u201d so they could have a deeper connection than with their actual partners.\n\nI told him flat out I wasn\u2019t interested. But I kept asking questions. *Does your wife know about these \u2018practices\u2019 you do?*\n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s better for her. Better for me too. And for our children.\u201d\n\nHe started going on about how we don\u2019t marry the people we are equal to\u2014we marry the ones who are good for having kids. That real spiritual connection is with extramarital lovers. He kept inflating my ego, using spiritual talk to manipulate me. I asked if he had done this before.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done it many times,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWith many different women.\u201d\n\nThen he put his hand on my leg. I told him I was leaving. But I made the mistake of trying to stay friendly.\n\n\u201cLet me just show you one thing before you go,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stopped me behind the car and hugged me. That\u2019s when I froze. Trauma hit me like a wave. This wasn\u2019t the first time something like this had happened to me, and suddenly, I was simultaneously trapped in his arms and in my past.\n\nHe pulled me tightly against him, ran his hand down my back, onto my hindquarters. At the same time, he started kissing me\u2014lightly, from my ear down to my collarbone. My stomach churned with nausea. I squirmed to get away. He let go. I was in full trauma response, barely able to hold back tears.\nThen he begged me not to tell his wife.\nI barely managed a goodbye before I ran back up the hill to my house, praying he wasn\u2019t following me.\n\nA few days later, I saw his wife. Despite my own pain, I felt it was my duty to tell her the truth about her husband. Never mind my trauma\u2014this was her husband. She deserved to know.\n\nAt first, she seemed to believe me. But later that day, I got a message from her. She repeated *all* his lies. He told her I subconsciously wanted to be with him. That based on our messages, I *must* have known it was going to be romantic.\n\nBut that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth!!\n\nI was completely blindsided. Now, looking back, I understand things I didn\u2019t back then. At the time, I was in a cult. I believed that everyone in it was a good person, incapable of this kind of thing. If it were me *now*, I\u2019d know better. I\u2019d understand that if a married man asks a woman to meet him at 2 AM, he\u2019s not looking to talk about life. *Full stop.*\n\nToday, I saw both of them. \n\nSeeing him again brought everything back- how he lied, how he got away with it, how his wife believed him over me. The anger and pain hit me like a tidal wave. I wanted to punch his stupid mouth, to do something, to make him face the truth of what he did. I even had a thought of role-playing the situation in front of his wife-forcing her to see it so she would understand. But I know deep down, no matter what I do, she probably won't believe me. He has her wrapped in lies. And I'm the one left carrying all of this. I've been crying all day. I feel so much anger, hurt, and grief. I don't know how to process this.\n\n",

Even when I go to see I like to use my pillows to imagine it's her and I can hug and kiss her randomly as I pleased, other ways I like to imagine she's there for me is when I daydream about her (mostly) draw or write my stories with her (fun fact: I created her for my comic but my personal life, I want to publish it by doubt anyone read it so I just keep it to myself \ud83e\udd23) journal about her in her ways for me and what we would do together! I know I'm weird but I'm not ashamed of it\n\nLike literally last night while I was walking around the neighborhood, right now I'm in the forest type of neighborhood so it's a lot of trees and hills here \ud83d\ude05 (also it was around 11ish night time \ud83c\udf19) and I'll admit I was kind of scared and a little nervous to go to dark areas like that even the street lights wouldn't work so it made my nervous system 10 times worse, but while walking I could hear her tell me \"why so scared? I'm here with you! Just hold my hand and we'll walk together! Breathe and calm down\" (I would Literally hold the air or hold my own hand to think it's her) like it come for me so much that my heart for her couldn't take the fact that she's not real because mentally (to me) she is! As soon as I got back to my Airbnb I was literally crying a river for her! Even my own friend had to comfort  me to tell me everything's okay to not feel too down about it (he's real btw) so yeah I know which y'all thinking I'm a loser, weirdo, idiot for going out and crying for something that doesn't exists and your right I do! I just wish she was real she's my everything!!!  If it wasn't for her I probably be scared out of my mind or even worse....\n\n\nNote: I doubt anyone is reading this but if you are and if you're interested to know more about her I'll tell you more of her name and her information and another story if anyone's interested trust me I don't mind explain more about her I love my sweet bone \ud83e\uddb4\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc8b\n\nBut seriously I would love some helping tips and other ways to cope with her! She really helped fixes my depression and suicidal mindset \ud83d\ude2d \ud83e\udd7a",

    "selftext": "Okay, so I am going to try to keep this short, but I need advice. My ex (27F) and I (30F) first started seeing each other in February 2022. Very early on in the relationship she complained about one of her machines she uses for work, and it leads to me getting her a loan in my name, under my social, to be her new upgraded machine. The machine ended up being a 2.3k loan.\n\nTime goes by and we realize we are not right for each other. We were both super toxic during the relationship in our own ways. Her and her daughter moved out in the middle of June 2024 after us breaking up initially in the middle of May.\n\nEver since they moved out, she was constantly late on the payments, which caused her to make late payments every single time. Thankfully, this did not impact my credit by some miracle in this universe.\n\nOn 1/10/2025 of this year, after not paying since November, I went in and withdrew money from a mutual fund my dad gave me when he passed away. Not something I wanted to do but I had to because it was starting to impact my credit drastically.\n\nBefore this, on 11/25/2024, her daughter called me because she missed me. My ex wasn\u2019t home, her mother (kid\u2019s grandma) was. I said hi to her even and she didn\u2019t say anything to me. When my ex got home the kiddo dropped the tablet she was using, and it disconnected.\n\nI ended up texting my ex asking her not to be mad at her kid when she just missed me like I missed her. We have a fight where we both said some intense things (and I did a lot of it). I have no excuses for the things I said, but I don\u2019t regret it either.\n\nLong story short \u2013 she blocks me and deletes the calling app off her kiddos tablet so she can\u2019t call me again.\n\nThe loan, in the beginning, was $2,299. When I paid it off, I paid $1,154.39. I paid 50.22% of this loan.\n\nDo I have grounds to get this back? How do I go about getting it back?\n\nAlso, do I have grounds to get my dog back? I let my ex take her when I was not in a good mental space because I couldn\u2019t even take care of myself. Dog\u2019s microchip is under my name and to my knowledge she didn\u2019t update her vet records so the last person for her was me. In the dog space \u2013 I am this dog\u2019s favorite person. I went over there one day and was talking to my ex and my dog freaked out for a solid 15 minutes over seeing me.\n\n\u00a0\\*We live in Oklahoma in the USA\\*\n\nSo, should I just cut my losses and move on and try to save that money back up or should I text her from a different number or a friend\u2019s phone to ask her to give it back since I paid half. Genuinely I have no idea what to do in this situation and I\u2019ve gone back and forth for 2 months.",

    "selftext": "My mom acts like a kid when she's sick... I'm currently argued with my mom, she's sick right now (bed sick) she can't get up, has a high fever etc. Anyway today I was looking for my cat and she was in my moms room, I was minding my own business getting my cat telling her she could get sick so I'll take her. She made a comment that is still bothering me, \"oh so you care more about the cat, but not about me, ok\", \"I'm sick and you don't bother checking in on me\". \n\nFor context my mom and I... we don't have the best relationship, growing up she was never the most loving, kind towards me, it was a very toxic environment, It is a lot better now compared to how she was before tho. Anyway, I really hate it when she says stupid shit like this, is not the first time. When I'm fkn sick, dying sick, she's not there for me, she's not the type to go out of her way to get me medicine, or make me a warm soup... I'm not the fkn mom, I'm in my 20s but to this day, at my grown age, it would be nice to have or feel the love of a pampering mother specially when you're sick. \n\nI got so mad I wanted to tell her off, \"why would you expect that from me? If I haven't experienced that myself?\" \"Do you think im your mother or something?\" \"What you sow you reap\"... so many things, but I kept my cool, \"yeah i do care a lot about my cat\" is all i said and went about my day.\n\nIt made me even more mad, because I am also fkn sick, I have a bad stomach bug that has been going on for 4 days now, and guess what??? She hasn't done sht for me, hasn't asked how I've been if I'm better or what... \"probably something you ate\" is all she said when I first told her, and off to work I went. Didn't bother to check in, didn't bother to ask how I was doing, if she could make me something to help me... and she has the audacity to say that sht to me?... and guess what, im hating myself for this but here goes. \n\nThe day before, she went to work fkn sick when I had told her the night before not to, because she was literally dying with a high fever. She still goes cause she's a workaholic, Anyway, it's 2pm and I see i have a missing call from this woman, I was showering getting ready to go out with my boyfriend. I call back i asked her what does she need, she tell me to go pick her up because she can't drive back home, that she feels weak... i tell her why I didn't answer when she called, this is what she says \"why didn't you shower earlier, you need to be more attentive\".... wtf??? Why would I pause my day for her? Does she want me to just sit there and wait around for her to get home or call me and finally function, for her? Wtf.\n\nLong story short, I call my boyfriend and let him know what happend, he ended up giving me a ride. So we rushed to get ready he ended up givin me a ride to her work place to pick her up and drive her back home. On the way back, she just kept going on about, why didn't I answer when she called, why am I not paying attention, why was I still sleeping late... I don't fkn know maybe cause I'm also sick and fkn tired from work???? No a thank you to me or my boyfriend, nothing. \n\nI did that sht just for her to be telling me \"you care more about the cat than me\"... but she's right, I don't care as much about her than i do about my cat, I don't love her, but I don't hate her, I see her as the person that gave birth to me, which gives her the mother title, but she is no mother to me emotionally.\n\nAnyway, i wanted to get this sht off my chest, so thank you of you took the time to read this!

I buried what happened in the back of my mind. Kind of blamed myself for being dumb enough to get so drunk and trusting someone to not take advantage. Now I realize this wasn't my fault.

My brother was 3 when we got him and always treated him as sibling. They were never referred to as adopted growing up. Flash forward I\u2019m 19 he\u2019s 13. He becomes obsessed with me completely out of no where. Starts with cutting the back out of several pairs of jeans attempting to see me exposed. Then one day I noticed while using the restroom there\u2019s small holes chiseled into the wall. Yep peep holes. Parents patch them. He creates more. Mind you he\u2019s in extensive therapy they\u2019re basically begging for help as to why he\u2019s doing this. (Of course the state wants you to adopt and then ditches you when there\u2019s a problem.) He then started exposing himself in weird places in the house so I would walk in on him. Then I worked all night was tired accidentally dozed off on the couch (still am pissed I fell asleep because maybe this part could have been avoided) and he touched me from my butt to my vagina in one quick movement. I wasn\u2019t hardly asleep so I instantly woke up saw him walking away and he admitted to my parents that he did it. (I moved out 2 weeks later) Now flash forward again I\u2019m 25 he\u2019s 17. My parents obviously continue to raise him. there was no punishment because he was a minor (he was sent off for a year if you want to call that something) my parents have a relationship with him and I have a relationship with my parents. He talks about me to mom still which I find very odd. I have not said a single word to him since the incident. Being around him even this many years later physically makes me ill. I hate his guts and quite frankly wish terrible things upon him. I\u2019m no where close to being healed from this and don\u2019t know if I ever will be. He has a girlfriend that he\u2019s been with for awhile she has no idea what he did and it just makes me sick because if that were me I\u2019d want to know and I feel wrong by not telling her but I do not know her and the fight within my family it would cause ugh. I witnessed him today with the gf and he\u2019s constantly in her face demanding affection and overly touchy. Just makes me sick for the girl and any future potential victim. sorry for the long post.

    "selftext": "Throwaway account because I don\u2019t want anyone I know to see this. This is something I\u2019ve only ever told one person and I feel deeply uncomfortable to even tell a therapist. \n\nFor context: I have never been a victim of sexual abuse physically, was raised in a super healthy home life, etc. Nothing traumatic has ever happened to me due to another person I personally knew. \n\n\nWhen I was younger, I purposely would go on a site called KidzChat. I knew that predators would be on that site, and would advertise myself as someone to talk to \u201cF 12\u201d. I was around the ages of 10-14 doing this. Older men would then message me super sexually explicit things. We would sext for a while and eventually trade Skypes to talk or videochat. The biggest instance that I remember was skyping an older man who wanted to show me his jumping jacks. He would jump for a while and then his pants would conveniently fall off.  For some reason that moment is engrained in my mind. I know I\u2019m a victim fully, but I feel weird because I went out looking for it? I guess that\u2019s the cost of unlimited Internet access. \n\nAnother entirely separate thing that bothers me severely, is that one day (aged 11) I had my family dog perform oral on me. The dog didn\u2019t need any coaxing, it liked the smell and went up to it. I remember it feeling awful and I felt so intensely guilty afterward. I never did it again, but I realize that this has deeply affected me as an adult. I absolutely cannot receive oral from a man because it reminds me of what I did with my family dog. This fact genuinely haunts me as I know it was completely wrong and animal.\n\n I don\u2019t even know how to cope with both of these facts as I was a victim and perpetrator. These things still affect me in my sexual life now manifesting as intense fear and guilt to commit certain normal sexual acts with people like being eaten out, sexting my boyfriend, etc. I know I don\u2019t have the guts to tell a therapist either.

    "selftext": "I stabbed a dog. I was working as a delivery driver and I went to a house with a bunch of packages piled at the door meaning the homeowners were gone. All of a sudden a giant dog that looked like the beast from the sand lot, same breed, very large, came sprinting around the corner and latched on to my arm. I had a thick canvas work jacket on so the teeth barely broke the skin. I carry a folding knife as a habit since I was a kid in boyscouts. I stabbed the dog with my free hand after trying to punch the dog and it ran off back around the corner of the house. A woman and her teenage daughter came around the corner screaming at me and I told them what happened. Apparently they were neighbors there to take care of the dogs. It all happened on the front porch in front of a ring camera. I then left, called my boss and the cops but decided not to take legal action. I guess I felt bad for doing that to the dog.

    "selftext": "I don't know what spurred this on our relationship was always seemingly good. \n\nI (35m) think my Brother (32m) hates me. \n\nI've been in a rough phase of my life, moved back in with my parents, had just a terrible string of events dovetailing with my business failing and the loss of my Father all in short period. He died suddenly. I'm still working through that, I  was the one who took him to the hospital a few times that week, but the last time it was a serious emergency and he didn't get out. He died a few weeks later after being in a coma for the time. \n\nThis sort of, at least in my opinion, galvanized us into having a closer bond.  Or so I thought.\n\nDad dying was only a few months ago. It hasn't been a year yet. But I'm still trying to pick up the pieces and start moving forward.  And it was like our relationship with each other improved over it. We were a very loving family before, but this hurt us and we leaned on each other more. \n\nThen I learned the other day my Mom brought the hypothetical prospect of me being homeless. \n\nI don't intend to be homeless. But she brought it up to him or he brought it up to her, and he flat out told her that if I ever end up homeless I am not going to be living in his and his wife's house. For the record, I didn't ever ask or mention this. But this conversation took place behind my back and he apparently said that I was never going to be allowed to live with them. \n\nThey have a very large house btw, essentially half the rooms are empty at any given day.\n\nThat shocked my Mother to hear that and she told me. \n\nAnd quite frankly, it shocked me too. I am not going to be homeless. But to hear someone you thought you could rely on if things ever went to total shit say that, it's sad. But what made me more sad was remembering a conversation I had with him a few months before. \n\nHe told me his wife (31 f)'s best friend (30 f) who has a kid and either got kicked out of her own house, or cheated, or something became a single mother. My brother told me he was actively considering moving her and the kid INTO their house. She, who has had numerous problems from heavy drug use, alcohol use, partying hard, who has seemingly reformed her ways - was welcome to live with them. It didn't end up happening because she QUICKLY found a new guy. \n\nBut that was a total shocker to me, that I, who has had no problems with drugs and alcohol, who helps take care of his kid, who buys her toys and plays with her, who has bought them gifts every holiday, is lower on the totem pole than the single mom best friend of the wife. It totally blindsided me, and I feel betrayed. I'm not at any risk of being homeless, but the conversation came up between my Mom and him and that's how it went. To think your own brother won't be there for you, but will be for some sketchy broad, is totally insane. And for me it's like I'm feeling just heartbreak, resentment, sadness, disappointment, all mixing together - I love him, I still do, but I feel like I just got betrayed... Betrayed over something that hasn't happened yet. But that he thinks so low of me is shocking really. I don't know what to do. \n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey, Team! I've been feeling super duper down in the dumps lately and want to vent serious style without fear of personal societal repercussions! This is a throw away account n such. Not really curating this post just typing about whatever comes to mind. \n\nI've never really been the happiest of people. Even in my youth I remember being melancholic more than not. Didn't have the best upbringing (not the worst by a long shot either). My parents fought with each other all the time if I didn't have someone over. I remember hiding in my room hearing them arguing downstairs hoping against hope it wouldn't lead into my room with them competing for my favoritism. There were times either my mom or dad would try to drag me out of the house to stay at a hotel with them because the other parent was \"crazy and untrustworthy\". Events like this were common place (once or twice a month) in the house up until I was around 14 when it all kinda just died out. My parents stopped fighting daily, maybe once a month or so until not at all. They never even acknowledge the horrors they would put me through. They just tell me it wasn't as bad as I think but it totally fucking was. It was hell, not to mention how often they would remind me how abnormal of a human I am. \n\nI've been diagnosed either adhd and I highly suspect I have high-functioning autism. I never really managed to fit in around others as a kid, often doing things my own way. Friends were hard and socializing was harder. My parents would try with all their might to assimilate me into \"normal\" behavior. My mom didn't let me shop for my own clothes until I left the house. I bought some shirts with some cats on them with one of my first paychecks (maybe 16 yrs old). She took and hid them from me because she was afraid people would \"think I'm girly, or gay\" which blew my mind. My dad wasn't the most supportive of my interests either. I recall a time when i was in grade school I really liked filming and doing stop motion Lego things.. I probably just caught him at a bad time (wasn't very many good times).. forgot what I asked but I remember his reply was along the lines of \"it doesn't matter anyway, it won't go anywhere\" in regards to my short-lived hobby. I don't think I picked up that camera again after that. I wish I did. Can't blame myself there i guess.. I was young and impressionable.. I wonder often how things play out if he never said those words. Probably not much different but maybe..  instead I just spent most of my time online, hiding behind headphones blocking out the screaming. \n\nDidn't have many friends growing up. I'd typically just pick one person I liked and puppy dog around them. I was pretty shy and often to target of harassment from some of the meaner kids in school. I got used to being the butt of jokes and such pretty early. It didn't bother me much but it definitely scared me off from trying to form connections. That said I managed enough. I had a lunch table to sit at most of the time. I wasn't usually the star attraction but the folks there didn't seem to mind my presence. I recall once I didn't really feel comfortable sitting at any table so I sat at an empty one. This prompted the principal to come over and with good intentions have me sit at a table with a bunch of strangers I didn't really know. Horrifying experience. That said, I didn't really spend too much time hanging out with friends irl. I unfortunely found connections on the world wide web..\n\nDespite how strict my parents could be they let me have unfiltered internet access from the very get go when i got my first laptop at 12 or so. They never monitored my activity, or set restrictions on screen time or anything. Long-story short I end up in some unsavory online spaces. I met people who at the time I thought were nice friends, parental figures, people to talk to when I didn't have parents I could. It wasn't until a bit later in my life I realized how groomed I got. I never thought much about it at the time. It seemed like people finally enjoyed my company, wanted to invite me to chat and stuff. I didn't see the harm at the time at all. Just some text-based roleplays, maybe a picture or two without my face. Whags the harm? Now in my adulthood I feel like I'm able to see the effects more. My libido is so high yet the thinking about sex makes me extremely uncomfortable in a way that's hard to describe. I get jealous, disgusted, confused, lustful, etc etc etc whenever I see or am reminded of the mere concept of penetration. What's worse is I think it's effected my love language too. I feel I have a really difficult time feeling like I'm showing I love someone if I'm not having sex relatively often. I doubt myself, and if I'm able to provide and be a good partner. I know there's so much more to a relationship but my brain always defaults back to thoughts along these lines. I hate it but the nature of the issue causes me to love it. Its such a conflicting mess of sexual frustration. I have no idea how to do a segway here so... :3 \n\nAnxiety is a big thing in my life. It wasn't so bad when I was younger, mostly manifesting in social anxiety around new people or crowds. Nowadays I sometimes feel anxious just leaving my apartment. Going to the store is a massive panic attack and I have no reasons why. I desperately want to put myself out there, meet new people and enjoy this life I have but the exhaustion from the anxiety and depression just constantly kick my dick straight into the dirt.\n\nDepression is the worst. It's only gotten worse since I broke up with my seven year long partner (we were engaged too at the time). The break up is a long story with no heroes and only villains and victims. I don't want to dive into it here. I'm a bastard, theyre a bastard. Point is I'm a total bastard livid with regret over such minute details. I miss my ex... I care about them... but I don't trust them anymore and I loathe the mere memory of them. It's such a dissonance... I can't think back to the early days and not wonder if any of it was real at all. I'm sure there was true love between us sometime... I wonder when we lost it, and I fear they mightve never felt love for me like I did for them. We were young when we met. Stupid too, probably. Grew up and got distant yadayada... happens.. I still miss them.. their quirks and such. The way they talked and the way they ate. Even the things that annoyed me I miss... its wild how much I miss the things that pissed me off...\n\nAnyway, this post is going a bit long. It's bedtime for me. Thanks for reading my cool, epic post. Might post more vents like this. ",

I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong.\n\nShe\u2019s in my roommate\u2019s room all the time. My bedroom is on the first floor, 4 roommates are upstairs (I have 5 roommates total).

    "selftext": "Hey so this will be my final update on everything as I believe the situation has finally come to an end and I\u2019m in a really good place. \n\nI left off where I was in a shelter and had made a lot of friends. Well the girl who I was gonna move somewhere with she ended up going back to her Mom and step Dad, and so I was back to being stuck on what to do. That was until I got a message from my grandma that her mom (my great-grandma) needs someone to care for her, she said that her brother would be happy to have me stay with him as long as I care for my great grandma. I decided I have nothing left to lose and decided this would be a good gig till I find out what I wanna do. I arrived in Miami 3 days ago and have been enjoying it greatly so far. I never really knew my dad\u2019s side as he wasn\u2019t that close with his family and after he passed it was hard to keep contact. My great-uncle is very nice and very accommodating and his wife is really nice, they live in quite a nice part of Miami as well near the beach. \n\nI haven\u2019t seen my great-grandma in over 10 years and she was so happy when she saw me. She can\u2019t speak that much English as she only really speaks Spanish. I\u2019m aware I said my dad was white, but that\u2019s was only because I was scared of my identity being revealed and that wasn\u2019t a 100% lie. My father was Cuban and was born and raised in Miami, however, he was most likely a descendant of Spaniards. Anyways, my great grandma has been teaching me Spanish and as well through the help of translating of my great uncle stories about my dad. She told me that he would fall asleep on her lap at family gatherings and how he would make the whole family laugh imitating her accent. It made me tear up seeing all the photos of him as a kid with his whole family. She told me that when he got on drugs and ran away from home, it left everyone in complete distraught. She claimed my grandma would cry everyday. \n\nMy Mom never had a relationship with them, and that was her choice they wanted to meet her actually. They told me that they weren\u2019t shocked what happened to me as my Dad told them later on my mom would cheat on him all the time with other men. This made me furious as my mom always claimed my dad was her \u201csoulmate.\u201d \n\nI have not heard anything from my mom, however, my cousins wedding went ahead yesterday as my aunty posted it on Facebook. My mom was there and she seemed completely fine from the photos. The wedding looked boring anyways, my cousin is marrying his first cousin from Pakistan (in-laws side) and no one is smiling. It made me laugh actually seeing my mom with all these people who are deeply religious and conservative. Seeing my mom next to my grandma and other female relatives who wear scarfs and are deeply religious, compared to my mom who sleeps with anyone that gives her an ounce of attention really cracks me up.  \n\nAlso no word from my EX-husband, however, his sister sent me a text apologising on behalf of her and his parents. \n\nSo yeah that\u2019s the end I believe I\u2019m taking care of my great-grandma and will work out what I wanna do in the mean time. This will most likely (hopefully) be the final update as I believe I\u2019m in a really good place. ",

    "selftext": "Using a new account as I have people on my original account who know me irl, and I don't want them to even come across this.\nAs the title says, I really feel stuck at this point in my life(I'm currently 27 and turning 28 next week). All of it started two years back, when me and my then girlfriend(let's call her M) of 5 years started having a ton of arguments. It was mainly regarding my admission process and my promise of hitting the gym. I had quit my cushy job towards the end of 2022 to focus on my exams and my application process. It was a frustrating time for me as I had a pretty good profile(or so I was told) and expected to get an admit from almost all the universities that I had applied to. As it later turned out, all my hopes got dashed as I only rejection after rejection.\nIn the middle of it, there was a family function for which I had to travel to a different city(this is also the city where I did my undergrad from and M also lived). To give a backstory, we had been together since my sophomore year of undergrad and our relationship was a long distance one(We only saw each other during classes when we were studying. After graduation I had moved to a different city for work, and went to my hometown when COVID hit us.). \nSo during the time of this family event, I planned to take out some time and planned a dinner with M(during which I specifically told her that I didn't want to discuss my application process and that I was taking this trip as sort of a break). Unfortunately our conversation ultimately went into that direction, and what I thought would be a warm evening ended up with me feeling helpless and ultimately crying in the restaurant. After the family event ended, I travelled back to my city, and then had a talk with her and we both decided we'll take a break and introspect why we were arguing almost on a daily basis(we specifically decided that we will not be seeing or planning to see anybody in that period, but work on this and figure things out).\n\nAlmost a month later, a mutual friend of ours(let's call her C) tells me that M actually went on a couple of dates to see people(C and M were very close friends), which broke the trust I had in the whole relationship and I told that my trust in us was broken and that we were done. I developed this feeling of being inadequate, and ended up getting addicted to porn to numb myself, instead of studying and working on projects.My whole routine was to hit the gym and work out till I felt pain in my body, return back to home and sleep.\n\nAbout a couple months later, I learnt that it was C who had actually convinced M to go on dates and \"meet\" other people. Furiously, I cut contact with C and stopped any form of communication. As far as things with M were concerned, I was still too attached to her, so we decided we can try to work on things.\n\nThings changed a bit and I got an admission in a good university and started my postgrad journey here. But during the winter of 2023, me and M again had some serious arguments and I decided to cut ties with her. We still chatted on and off and she still told me she loved me. Around 2 months from that time, we tried to get back together again, but ultimately I couldn't sustain it this time(the distance had become a pain. turns out in a different country, loneliness hits you like a truck). And this time we broke up, once and for all. I felt and I still feel immense guilt for breaking up and putting her through a lot of pain. I sank into a pretty low state, got hooked to porn, but studied enough to keep my grades up, ultimately leaving any opportunity of upskilling myself or studying, but kept sinking lower and lower.\n \nAround a month back I talked to a therapist, and told her about my guilt and that I had been in a state of \"feeling like I do not deserve anything nice because I hurt M\" and that I self sabotaged whenever anything good came in my life. She heard all of my story and did tell me a lot of times when I was emotinally scarred and somewhat even manipulated by her as well. Now that I see this, I feel helpless. I inflicted a lot of pain and self sabotage on myself, and my addiction to porn has turned me into a very lazy person. I know that deep down I have the potential to excel if I figure my shit out. The thing is, I am not able to. I feel burnt out(recently even failed an interview at a reputed big tech company). I hardly have energy to study, reversed all the progress I made in the gym, and somehow not able to shake off this addiction. It's tough to put on a brave face and fake a smile, telling my family that I'm alright, while I'm numb deep down. I want to cry and take some of the pent up emotions out, but I simply cannot cry and give anyone a hint that I'm not alright. My family is very supportive and I don't want them to feel helpless knowing that I'm not as good as I tell them.\n\nJust wanted to take this feeling out. Thank you so much for reading.",

    "selftext": "another long post...\n\nfor context, my(f18) sister(17) and her best friend(f15, almost 16, let's call her Dana) have been friends for almost a decade, they've always spent a lot of time together because our moms were friends. the last few years have been very very rough for Dana, and we've always been here for her, especially my sister, and that made them even closer.\n\nso, today, during lunch, my sister came to my mom and asked her if she could go out for a party night with Dana and her friend group, BUT. \nhere in italy, there are two stages of the party: the first one is open to everyone, the second one is only 18+, and she wanted to go right to the second one, that begins around midnight. my mom immediately said \"no.\", and my sister started whining, saying that Dana went there too a few weeks ago, and guess how she did that? fake ID and some connections, and that surely didn't help to have a \"yes\" as an answer.\na few hours ago i was with my sister and Dana, just talking, until my sister asked my thought about going to that party at that hour, and i said: \"honestly i don't approve that, not because you're going there, but because you're gonna do it 'illegally'.\", and she got angry, saying that she wanted to do that experience because she's a teenager and blah blah blah, to which i replied: \"yeah, you're a teenager and have to do your experiences, but you can make them on the first half of the night, where you can go without any problem.\", and i think she expected me to be the \"cool older sister\" because she got angry, and it only got worse when my brother(21) also said he agreed with me. so she went upstairs and i stayed with Dana, so i started talking with her about all this. the conversation then went to my sister's general behaviour, and we went to my room to talk more liberally.\nafter a while, we were talking about how she (my sister) almost never wants to go out unless one of us has weed or cigarettes and stuff like that, and that's when i told her something i had forgot:\n\nlast august they both were at home, my best friend was there as well, and we were all chilling in the backyard, when Dana told my sister that she had to go to her(Dana's) place, that she promised that, but my sister was whining about it, saying she didn't feel like it, but not giving a reason to break the promise, so they came up with a deal:\nDana would have gone home, and my sister would go there about a half hour later, so Dana left. i stayed with my best friend and my sister, who started saying things like \"i don't wanna go\", \"i don't feel like it\", and i replied other things like \"why don't you tell her?\", \"if you stand her up without saying anything, i'll tell her.\", and she freaked out, saying that if i did i would be a bitch, and i just rolled my eyes. after a while, she left and went to her room, and i immediately gave my best friend a \"i know how this will end up\" look, but didn't say anything.\n\nalmost a hour later, Dana calls me and says: \"your sister isn't answering my texts and calls. where is she?\". i took a deep breath and face palmed mentally before answering: \"she's in her room, i'll go check on her.\", and so i did. i muted myself and went to my sister, who was awake, and told her: \"Dana's on the phone, what do i tell her?\", and she replies: \"tell her that i'm asleep.\". my heart dropped and i didn't know what to do, so i just played along, unmuted myself, and said: \"she's sleeping.\". Dana was so disappointed and told me to wake her up, so i started shaking my sister trying to \"wake her up\", but she just pretended to fall asleep again and again, and i heard Dana say: \"look, never mind, let her sleep.\". i asked her if she was sure, and she said \"yes\", and i just said: \"okay, then... bye love, i'm sorry.\", and hung up. i looked at my sister and said a few things like \"you're an asshole\", \"you're a shitty friend\".\n\nso, returning to two hours ago, i told Dana about it, even though i probably shouldn't have, but i just thought it was the right thing to do. \nher face dropped and she became visibly sad and disappointed, said something like \"i don't even know what to say\", \"i can't think or look at her the same\", and i felt kind of guilty, but still thought that she had the right to know. \n\nwe smoked two cigarettes and she went to sleep, saying that she would figure out what to do about all this, again, she's clearly disappointed and tired of my sister being disrespectful.\n\nit's currently 4am, and i'm sorry for ruining her mood, but also scared of my sister's reaction in case she finds out that Dana knows, i've already made a post about my sister and her behaviour:/\n\nenglish is not my first language, so, sorry for any mistakes and/or things like that, i just didn't want all this to eat me up.",

    "selftext": "So almost 10 years ago my mother and my now ex stepfather got gifted two dogs. My mother never wanted them since she already had a lot on her plate but since my ex stepfather did, there really wasn\u2019t much of a choice. \n\nMy ex stepfather began getting more and more abusive until we all finally left, and despite my mother knowing we didn\u2019t have the best ability to take care of them, we took the dogs because they were also being abused by my ex stepfather. Then my grandfather began living with us and eventually one of the dogs became his while the other became my stepbrothers (who came with us when we left her father).\n\nA lot of stuff happened and my stepbrother left and took his dog with him, leaving the other to be my grandfathers completely as we somewhat moved into separate households. Well more stuff happened and my mother ended up having to take the dog back with her, living in a small camper on borrowed property. It hasn\u2019t been ideal for her or the dog.\n\nThe dog has cancer and has occasional seizures and because of that and the unfortunate circumstances, my mother has been wanting to put the dog down for a while. She has some aggression issues after having pups, being shot, and being run over in a short span of time a few years back, so she has been unable to rehome her. Well it\u2019s come down to it and because my grandfather is unable to take her, she is getting put down soon without his knowledge.\n\nI get she is a sick dog who isn\u2019t living in an ideal situation by any means, but I still feel terrible that it\u2019s going this way.

    "selftext": "( i'm going to try keep details to a minimum as i don't want anyone to recognise me from this post, so identifying details like genders, names, ect will be changed. i would also like to note that i do suffer from a form of neurodivergence that can make me incredibly naive at times) \n\nin the few months preceding this kidnapper event, i had a partner who i suffered quite a traumatic miscarriage with. he ended up cutting me off the day i was in the hospital - it was terrifying and incredibly lonely. \n\nat the time, a sibling of mine whom i live with had been having some friends over often, and naturally i started getting to know them and would hang out with their friends too. this was something i did often, as i was struggling heavily with the grief of losing both my pregnancy and essentially being broken up with and left to think about it alone. \n\nAfter hanging out with my siblings friends for a few weeks, Taylor (M32) started giving me gifts. I have quite an interest in sterling silver religious jewellery, and he had given me a few pieces during this time of us hanging out. (a silver chain with a saint pendant, a very dainty 14k gold bracelet, another small silver bracelet). I thought nothing of it, it's quite common amongst us here to exchange gifts often among friends and family so i didn't see it as anything more than that, as i myself have given people fine jewellery randomly before. \n\nOne day, he asked me if i wanted to go to his home to see his pets and just chill and do some art. I agreed, as he had some very unique reptiles which i was curious to see.\n\nAfter getting to his house, it was then that things took a really bad turn. \n\nHe sexually assaulted me on several occasions, I was not allowed to leave the house unless he was supervising me, and it would only be to his garden that i could go. I was also not allowed to wear any clothes in his home, he would take them from me under the guise of washing them and not return them unless he wanted me to go outside with him. He allowed me to return to my own home on two occasions, however he was present the entire time and would not let me out of his sight and would regularly complain about how we needed to leave back to his home. \n\nHe would regularly belittle my appearance, try to convince me that i would have to laser remove all of my tattoos as they looked disgusting, he told me that my earrings were disgusting and masculine and how he couldn't believe anyone would ever have had sex with me because of how gross they were. He would force me to stand on weighing scales when i didn't want to so he could know my weight, and then proclaim to me that 'we'll have to fix that'.\n\nI know that people will probably wonder where were my parents in this situation, and the reality is that they were on vacation. They left the family home for multiple months at a time, and whenever my mother would call me, he would answer the phone on my behalf and tell her how i was happy and i was okay and convinced her that i was his 'girlfriend' even though i was being held against my will and assaulted in his home. \n\nI asked on several occasions to go back home, and he would tell me 'maybe next week...' and next week would just never come. and even then, i had no clothes so i simply couldn't leave. \n\ni managed to escape because i had a large concert planned, and after arguing with him for days, he finally let me leave so i could go to the concert. as soon as i got home i messaged him and told him never to speak to me again or i would be calling the police. \n\nfor a few weeks after this, he harassed me on different platforms. he posted pictures of me he had taken against my will on social media saying for people to 'look at his girlfriend' , he would change his profile pictures to pictures of me or would make profiles in my name. \n\nin the end, i ended up blocking him and changing all of my social handles. \n\nthat brings us to now. \n\nits been about 10 months since this happened. i did not go to the police as i did not want to have to relive what happened to me. he also told me many stories of violence he had committed against women who had called the police on him in the past. \nwe also had no text conversations at all prior to me being harassed by him &amp; i truly just believe the case would get thrown out. \n\ni have had a reoccurring nightmare about him breaking into my house killing me almost every night for the past few weeks. i confessed this to my sibling who introduced me to him, and was told that he had been trying to contact my sibling. he was claiming to have purchased gifts for them, and sending them photos of the gifts he had bought and how much he had paid, and that this had been happening for weeks and my sibling had been simply ignoring his messages. \n\ni feel sick. why would he do this? why would he want to come back into my life? after the terror he put me through? he told me on several occasions that he, in his own words, felt like he was 'the predator' and that i was 'the prey' and it was 'his natural instinct to hunt me down'. he also told me how he had only been coming to hang out at my house because he had been fantasising about me. \n\ni don't know what to do in this situation. all i know is that i'm scared and i feel like i have no one to tell who can truly understand my story or my fears of him trying to pry his way back into my life and into my home. \n\n",

    "selftext": "Teen Nightmare\n\nThis happened many years ago I don't want anyone to get in trouble or press charges I just need to finally be able to speak about what happened.  I was 17 at the time and I volunteered as a Sheriff explorer during this time I met a deputy who in the beginning was really nice to me. I had just graduated high-school but my 18th birthday wasnt until a few months later. I was scheduled to go on a ride along we were required to go on patrol at least once every three months or so and he volunteered to take me on this day. This first time went fine I was super shy but he got me to open up, he talked about himself and asked me about what my plans were after graduating. It wasn't until the second time I went on patrol with him around a month later that things took a turn, I knew he had a girlfriend she was only two years older me, but this time around he started talking about how things were rocky between them. I didn't think much of it I thought he was just venting and no harm done. However  he was being super touchy and was flirting and at that time I was too shy to say anything. He ended up kissing me out of nowhere and he just smiled and said he needed to know if I was attracted to him. I'm not going to lie I was, he was good looking but I asked him about his girlfriend he said she wouldn't care. He offered to take me home after the shift and he did but not before he ended up taking me to an abandoned field and said he just wanted to talk. We ended up making out in his car and i told him i didnt want to have sex that it was as far as i would go he said it was fine but kept pushing and pressuring for more. He said if i really had feelings for him i would be willing to go all the way. He took me home after about an hour and explicitedly told me that if i was asked by any other deputy to just say were friends. I liked how special he made me feel and the red flags were there but i honestly  thought he wouldnt force me to have sex with him since  at that point he did stop when i told  him to even if he continued to ask. From this point on whenever I would patrol with him things would go further. Until finally one day after my 18th birthday he said he would take me home but instead he  hopped on the freeway towards his apartment. I was scared but at that point I felt speaking up would get me abandoned somewhere unfamiliar or worse. We made it to his place and he gave me a beer and led me to his bedroom. I felt like I couldn't say no he told me to relax that I would like it that it was just my nerves. We ended having sex but I finally was able to tell him he needed to stop that he was hurting me but all he would say was just let me finish its OK you'll like it in a minute. No amount of pleading worked until he finally rolled off me. By then I was shaking and oddly felt numb about the whole thing. He took me home and again told me to say we were just friends. He would lose his job if anyone found out making me feel guilty. I ended up quitting the program a few months later and foud out he was being investigated for misconduct on a whole different issue. I regret keeping quiet but at the time I was confused and developed feelings for him. Other deputies became suspicious since they noticed he would go out of his way to talk to me but no one ever asked me personally if anything happened. I know this is long and confusing but it feels good to finally speak about it I've held this in for 16 years. I had posted and then deleted I freaked out a bit that it was shared but if it helps anyone else in a similar situation so they speak up then it is what it is. Also for clarity he was nine years older than me.",

He told us he stopped and that he was sorry.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;**13-15** \\- I didn't talk to my father directly, as I felt betrayed and hurt. This was made worse when my mother kept trying to stand up for him. (I later learnt she was trying to stop the mistress from contacting my father so that she and him could work on their relationship)\n\n&gt;**14** \\- My mother is diagnosed with cancer, but they cant tell what kind or how far along it is.  My father grows even more distant from us, and the arguments increase.\n\n&gt;**15-16** \\- My mother is hospitalized and my father starts talking to this woman on his phone. I start to feel more anxious. My mother advocates for my father, but it just makes me more mad and hurt. They argue more now, and I find myself becoming emotionally distant from my father.\n\n&gt;**Late 16** \\- My mother dies and I shut down, as well as shut myself off from my family, friends and peers. I am angry at my father as he does not seem as affected and was also the cause of my mother's stress before she died. My older brother tries to soothe me and we traumabond. My father tries to relate to me, as his mother died a few months before mine, but he doesn't understand that it isn't the same.\n\n&gt;My father 'dates', moves in and then marries a woman I have never met in less than 8 months. His friends, my trusted adults, all support him, as well as his family and peers. I am hurt, but I pass it off as him just grieving differently. I was sure it was a phase and that they would break up/divorce soon enough. I later find out, its the same woman he cheated on my mother with, lied to us about, and then continued to talk to while my mother was battling cancer. I confront him about this and he says that he thought I knew who she was (despite us never being formally introduced to her. To this day, I know next to nothing about her. Only her first name, where her mother lives, and the name of one of her children.)\n\n&gt;Father's wife is emotionally and verbally abusive towards me and my brother, but I, being the younger and more emotional one, take it harder.\n\n&gt;She tells me that I'm *killing my father* by arguing with him, and that *he will end up dead, just like my mother*. I yell back at her to defend my father, as I take it very seriously when someone wishes death upon another (even indirectly), but my father takes her side and berates me for defending him.\n\n&gt;He does a myriad of other things; threatening to sell off my cats, locking them outside and causing one to die from the cold as punishment for me not agreeing with him, as well as pretending not to hear when his wife flat out threatens to kill me. He was right next to her when she said it, mind you.\n\n&gt;Under the advice of my older cousin from my moms side, I report the wife to the CPS but he denies hearing her threaten me to the social workers, which makes me look like an emotional teenage girl. We get placed into family therapy, but the therapist is borderline sexist and just wants us to be a family unit, regardless of the woman's blatant disregard for my safety.\n\n&gt;I ask my father why he's choosing his wife's needs over the safety of his biological children, whom he claims to adore, and he simply says that ***\"the Bible says wife before children\".*** I'd argue that doesn't apply to 'wife that you cheated on your children's mother with and who threatens you children', but okay, dad.\n\n&gt;I sleep with a knife under my pillow, just in case she tries to harm me. My anxiety and depression levels are through the roof.\n\n&gt;**17 - 19** \\- I cant remember much from these years, but it mostly involves me trying to bond with my father, as he's the last living parent I have. I go through 3 relationships, and have no one to talk to or seek comfort from when it goes downhill. My father thinks we're getting better because of him, and not because of the gigantic effort and emotional stuffing-down I'm doing as even being near his wife makes me anxious to the point of insomnia.  \nAs angry as I was before, I still love my father and want him in my life. I tell him that he can pick any other wife, just not her, and I would be genuinely happy with that. He doesn't care, and only treats me well when she's not there (away on vacation or at her mother's house). When she is around, though, he is more distant, and visibly more tense.\n\n&gt;**20** \\- My father announced that he wants to split our house physically (half of it is to go to me and my brother, as it was built when my mother was alive and she paid for and designed it). I tell him that I don't want him to do it, as it will just drive us further apart, but his reasoning revolves around his wife and her comfort. My brother and I have long assumed that his wife is just with him to benefit from his money, she doesn't treat him nicely, but he doesn't seem to notice.\n\nI know its childish and na\u00efve, but I didn't want him to distance himself from me, even though he has hurt me so much for so long. I still cry (I've actually just stopped crying as I'm typing this) whenever I think about how far we've already drifted apart.\n\nOur relationship went from one of trust, smiles, secret fast-food lunch breaks and long hugs... to me not even being able to tell him about the girl that broke my heart, and how I would love to have one genuine dad-hug from him so that he can tell me its alright. I would love to have him at my wedding one day, but I don't know if that will ever happen.\n\nI don't want to grow up, not in a world where he dies alone and regretful, but it seems that that's the only way for me to not end up living my entire life clinging to his leg, begging him to look back and maybe love me the way he used to.\n\nSo ***I'm done***. I'm done wanting his love and I'm done waiting on him to realise he was wrong, and that I still needed him.\n\n*I'm* going to be *something*, and *I'm* going to *love someone* and *let them love me in return*.\n\n***I deserve better.***\n\n***TLDR:*** My father has hurt me with his actions and his words for too long. I'm going to learn how to live without him, no matter how much it will hurt to let him go.",

    "selftext": "Sorry in advance for this being DENSE with context and a little bit nonsequential at the end but its necessary to me understand the gravity of this, I think.  \n  \nMy mother was raped by my grandfather when she was 26. He was 60, but strong. My brother and I were 5 and 8 at the time and we were in the house when it happened. I vaguely remember the screaming and having to be temporarily resituated at a friend's house until my mom found out where to go. Two of my uncles showed up, one kept grandpa restrained while the other spoke to the police. I think one of them threatened to kill him or something but regardless he never saw the inside of a cell for it. I still don't know why (more on that later). He has ZERO criminal record except for vehicular manslaughter (the young woman's underwear was found in a nearby field and she knew our family), for which he spent some time in a mental hospital. My mother told me he was observed to have had antisocial personality disorder but I'm not sure how she would know that because he would never tell her something like that. This is a man that says shit like \"I've never been depressed in my life, I don't even know what that is.\" Anyway, we moved somewhere so he couldn't find us. Problem there is Grandpa had a stalking habit so he found us after few months. You have to understand my brother and I were in no position to understand what happened, or at least that is reasonable enough of an assumption that mom didn't tell us what happened. All I knew was Grandpa wasn't around anymore and that I missed him (despite abuse of my brother and I up to this point, which I will get to). \n\nOnce he found us he would spoil my brother and I to gain favor and make it harder for my mom to keep him out of our lives, a pattern that would persist indefinitely. My mom saved up money during Move1, and we relocated to an \"aunt's\" house. She was a close friend of my mother's that was stalked by my grandfather prior to all of this. The \"aunt\" was also a pedophile. I was too young to understand that the teenagers she was messing around with were not adults. My mom was too traumatized to worry about anything other than feeding us, loving us, and killing the pain on her downtime with pills and partying. She balanced it well and her recreational activities never interfered with us beyond waking us up in the middle of the night for a taco bell run so we wouldn't be left alone in the house. Somewhere in there he found us again, because of the stalking bit.\n\nDuring this time he sank his claws deeper into my big brother and I. Christmases and birthdays were always huge to us both because, even though we were poor, we were spoiled senseless by grandpa *AND* by my mother's dogged determination to outshine his efforts. She had to spend every one of those Christmases and birthdays watching us thank and hug him in front of her, telling him we loved him.   \n  \nAfter a few years of living in that creepy shithole, my mom made enough to move again. She even wrangled us a stepdad for security. SPOILER he loved crack and bullying us. However he was young (27) and deeply troubled himself. He actually kind of kept grandpa at bay for a minute but we still LOVED grandpa so much. Our fathers never met us, between my brother and I, so there was a sort of role that needed fulfilling, which was another reason she was scared to tell us what happened. During this time my grandfather was abusing me by interrogating me about whether or not I was gay and forcing me in front of the mirror to pop my acne until I bled and the acne became infected. My pockmarks are much worse than they need to be and he reinforced a lifelong belief in my hideousness and I was made to go to therapy at the age of 10 to address my latent homosexual tendencies. What prompted his obsession, I do not know. I think he was scarred from when I wanted to be a girl for Halloween 3 years in a row from ages 3 to 6\n\nA few years after Move3 came Move4, but it at this point my mom considered losing contact with him to be futile. She would move further and further each time and he would constantly show up unannounced. At this point I'm in middle school, brother in high school. During this time my 15 year old brother kicked my stepfather out, so my grandfather was around much more often so he could pressure me intensely to be confirmed Catholic (our family is heavily Irish Catholic) This would eventually cause me to have a psychotic break later at 15 where I had religious delusions for a whole year.\n\nAround the time I finished high school my mom met my now stepmother and we moved 100 miles away. Which was perfect considering grandpa would have an accident that made it harder for him to want to drive on the highway ever again. The last time he saw my mother's face was at her wedding 15 years ago. I would say his presence tarnished it, but it was full of drag queens and LGBTQ+ folks so I like to think it was a difficult day for him (the man is a vicious bigot).\n\nThis is around when mom tells me about how he raped her when she was 26.  I'm 19 at this point and I have been conditioned to worship my grandfather. He was my father for all intents and purposes, more than any other man in my life. I was resistant and resentful. I was stupid. I buried what my mother told me and it created a rift between us that is since mended but it is one of my deepest regrets.\n\nMy *absolute deepest regret* is moving in with him. Move5 left me in a rural town with only a grocery store to work down the street and I had no car or license. TIP FOR YOUR KIDS: Do not let them get away with thinking they are better than working their way out of a situation, or that they won't be grateful to themselves for it. Anyway, I wanted to go to college and grandpa lived in Baltimore. He offered to let me stay and I told my mother I loved her but I couldn't get stuck in that town (I wasn't stuck, I was undisciplined and ignorant). I will never forget my mother's crying face as I left in *his* car. So I guess *that* is the last time he saw her. \n\nFrom 2012 onward I was living in Baltimore, going to school, working, partying and going on trips with friends. I was having a merry fucking time, and rent free to boot (undisciplined). Somewhere in the first 2 years I did mushrooms and I gained a bone-deep certainty of how awfully I had betrayed my mother. I called her and apologized for everything, begged for her forgiveness. I didn't have to, because she understood. Then she told me EVERYTHING EVERYTHING. Not just about her rape, but the vicious abuse of her 6 other siblings, the rape and physical assault of my grandmother, and the manslaughter. \n\n**Out of her 7 siblings, 2 brothers defended her (after the rape) initially. One said that grandpa was dead to him but reconnected only 3 years later. The other just plain acted like it didn't happen even though he was the one keeping grandpa at bay while we left the house. When my mom told her sisters, 2 were silent, one acknowledged that my mother was traumatized, and the one I hate the most said \"He must have been so lonely.\" The remaining 2 brothers kissed his feet like they always have without skipping a beat. They still do.**\n\n**My grandfather viciously beat every single one of his children. He beat and raped my grandmother, and put a gun to her head with his foot on her neck. An uncle tried to defend my grandmother with a bat, grandpa caught it mid-swing, and completely blackened my uncle's torso. He coerced a neighbor's wife to crawl across the floor to him to ask for a kiss in front of the neighborhood and *his own wife and children* at a party. He hit me and my brother for as long as he and I were too young to defend ourselves, at least until we acted like he wanted. He beat me for bleeding on the floor when I cut myself by mistake at age 3.  I was hit and screamed at if I cried. At age 5 I watched him choke my then 8 brother, like it was Bart and Homer, for correcting his math. He stalked my mother's friends and called them in the middle of the night to say disgusting shit. He then raped my mother for god knows fucking what when I was 5. I have no idea what else he's done to my aunts and uncles.**  \n  \nI'm suspicious that he did something to me too because I was absurdly sexually obsessive when I was 4 and 5. By obsessive I mean I cornered a girl when I was in kindergarten and tried to rip off her clothes while screaming \"You're mine\". Where did those instincts come from? How often do 5 year olds do that?  \n  \nSo I was drinking pretty heavily after what my mom told me, enough to keep me from being able to move out from my mom's rapist's house, and then I met my current partner in 2018. Like everyone I was with up til that point, I begged her not to be friendly with him and I told her why. She has some sort of hyperaltruistic reflex, plus her grandfather treats her like shit so she just made my grandpa her grandpa. After I begged her not to get close to him. He then exposed himself to her multiple times and whispered \"something disgusting\" into her ear that to this day she will not repeat. I know it wasn't age because when I confronted him on this, he never did it again. Between 2018 and 2023 I was basically killing myself with booze about this and a lot of things. 5 hospitalizations in 2023. \n\nMy mom confronted the one that said \"he must be so lonely\" and she said none of those things happened. My grandmother can corroborate however and has. \n\nI'm posting this, one, because apart from my partner, I have no one to talk to about it. I'm not looking for moral validation, I know how badly I hurt my mother and what it says about me. Grandpa is 91 now and I think it's fair to say most of who he was is gone. I don't forgive, I see it as irrelevant to who is now.  He's a scared husk that's been glued to a chair since 2008.  I tried so hard to be a changed person in sobriety got into the habit of hugging him and telling him I love him, but by the time I realized it makes me feel slimy, I couldn't afford to stop. My mom knows this and she is, according to her, at greater peace with everything than me.\n\nMy present disquiet comes from the constant thoughts like \"WHAT KIND OF BROTHERS AND SISTERS DON'T DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO PROTECT THEIR SISTER? There were 7 of them and they left us for the wolf. There were 7 of them that never EVER let grandpop babysit their kids. WHY HUH? WHY CAN HE COME AROUND US AND NOT YOURS? Why are we the \"black sheep\"? Why did no one believe my mother after what they've been through?* I have an uncle that still tells me he has always loved me, he's my godfather and the sensible one and he has the fucking BALLS to ask me why mom doesn't talk to him anymore. \n\nLast year every single one of my mother's siblings gathered to celebrate his 90th birthday. *Two of my mother's sisters are sitting on his lap in a photo they took together.* The one that said \"he must have been so lonely\" is so pleased with herself in the photo. Recently she told me I was the favorite grandchild of his 9,000 grandchildren, and she looked like she's hated me for it for a while. I wasn't the *favorite*, I was a pressure point for a predator to make sure my mother could never get away.\n\nNone of these people have any idea that I know. Neither does grandpa. Neither do their children. They just think I'm a lazy alcoholic (part true). Been thinking about writing a book. But also I just needed this. If anyone can relate or just have some insight as to how in the fuck 7 siblings side with the incestuous predator and abuser. What's worse is how I've found this to be far less unique than I thought. I know more people than I would like that have relevant experience with men growing families as punching bags and sex objects. Every kid I see makes me worry for them, and I have a hard time seeing a father with their children and not have an immediate fear for the kids.\n\nTLDR; Seriously? Just kidding. Grandpa raped my mom and stalked her, my brother and I through life and I eventually ended up marooning myself in the same basement where he did all of the worst things you can do to a person while his children treat my mom with denial and even resentment.\n\nP.S.  \nMy mother is the strongest and happiest she's ever been and I love her and my stepmother so much. She has chronic illness and PTSD but she is creating all the time and excelling at her work. I've never been more proud of her. My brother is the same as he's always been, stoic and quiet about all of it in a way that scares me.\n\nP.P.S.  \nMy aunts and uncles have been snooping while I'm at work and leaving obvious signs they were in my fucking bedroom. Where I fucking sleep. If you are reading this, good. You should be fucking ashamed of yourself. You were all in your fucking thirties and were successful when you shielded her attacker. You had the resources to help your sister and put the man away. You chose her rapist over her. You're not the Christians you say you are, you're not good people, you're psychotic lowlifes whose kids don't really know them (some of them know, just not exactly *how* spineless and mindless *yet*). No wonder your daughter calls you by your first name like that. To the other, no wonder your daughter doesn't call you at all. For all of you, it is not close enough to karma that you have to literally wipe that man's ass now. You seemed like you would've jumped at the opportunity to *swallow* his shit at the rate you guys sided with him. Still thinking about that book.\n\nEDIT: For various grammatical/spelling errors and weird slashes. (I know still can't comma)",

    "selftext": "I have to get something off my chest, it's been bothering me for a while.\n\nDepartment of Children's Services (Australia) are the most incompetent, useless, stupid government agency I've ever had the displeasure of working with, whom I'm sure hire only the worst and dimmest of candidates and have fostered a culture of ineptitude and apathy throughout the system. \n\nI have nothing but complete and utter contempt for the department and their so called social workers, as I can say truthfully and without hyperbole or exaggeration that I have not seen them make a good call on a child or family situation in the 30 years I've been cursed with their association.\n\nI am a psych and behavioural analyst and run a disability and aged care support company in remote Queensland. I am involved with the department because I provide therapeutic placement for children with disabilities. My company, as best as I can tell, is one of the very few with capacity for kids with serious behaviours of concern, certainly the only one that I am aware of in my or any surrounding regions, judging by how far some kids come to be placed with us.\n\nThe ignorance on display from DoCs staff is breathtaking. They don't listen. They don't understand disability, which to be fair, I don't really expect them to, not really, but they just are not willing to learn. Somehow the decisions they make seem tailored to be cruel and hurtful to parents for no good reason and they are openly hostile and dismissive to families they have independently decided they don't like.\n\nVague examples for privacy:\n\nSingle mother with 5 month old baby. Has 2 other children in placement. Meetings for one occur in Town A. Meetings for the other occur in Town B. She lives in City C. The meetings are set for 8am for one, and 9am for the other.\nTown A is 90km (56mi) from City C, and Town B is 107km (66mi) from City C. Town B is 193km (119mi) from Town A.\nShe has no car, and relies entirely on public transport to get around. This is utterly impossible.\n\nThere is a department office 7 minutes from her house by bus.\nThey flat put refused to entertain the idea of having meetings at that office, or even just Zoom meetings. She had to attend in person. Every failure was used as evidence of inability to manage her time, and proof she shouldn't have her children.\n\nChild with serious behaviours of concern (violence, property destruction, suicide ideation) who was surrendered by family was placed with us on short notice because previous two placements claimed no capacity. (Probably because of the damages combined between the two of them). No behavioural plan was supplied, despite them having one and being requested for 7 weeks, in the end I had to go behind their backs and track down the practitioner that wrote it myself. DoCs *severely* downplayed the behaviours upon placement, and frankly if we weren't so good at our jobs and able to adjust so fast, serious harm absolutely could have happened due to the lack of accurate information provided. We got lucky those first few weeks.\n\nTheir sole focus is on reunification with the family. Their solution was to force them together every weekend. No support, no plan, just shove a violent individual in a house with a shellshocked family for 2 and a half days, the siblings of which actively (and with good reason) do not want them there, for a couple of days and hope for the best.\nWhen sexual assault claims were made by a sibling, DoCs *ignored it* and tried to push for the next weekend anyway. It took a call to Children's Safety who in turn made a stern call to DoCs for them to decide against that decision for a weekend.\n\nI sat with the case workers and supervisors and went through the complex disabilities and mental health issue for this individual and explained what realistically needed to happen for reunification. What to expect. A recommendation for steps to take moving forward. I thought it went well. A follow up meeting with the school a mere 2 hours later and the case worker said that a fidget spinner should keep them occupied for 4 hours and thus solve the school attendance issues.\nMoronic. No attention paid whatsoever. \n\nThey openly blame the parents, their lack of parenting for the issues. Stay at home dad, mum has a pretty unusual job that has her travel often but pays very well. They mock her in meetings, talking about how she's \"living her best life\" on \"holidays\" when she's away for a week, working.\n\nI am so frustrated. They are now looking at foster care options. Removal from a therapeutic placement where they have made real progress, (for example, nearly $100k in damages, zero school attendance between 2 placement over 3 months, compared to us where we have had maybe $500 in damages and school attendance every day at first with support and now independently between an hour and 4 hours and we have had them for 6 months) to be put with some unsuspecting and unqualified family for $700 a week. Absolute madness.\n\nI just want to scream into the void. The family is actively working with us, the school is actively working with us, but DoCs... DoCs don't give a shit. And they hold the cards. They claim they care, but when it comes to complex disability they actively ignore vital information and forge ahead like it was a typical kid, damn everyone else.\n\nSorry, I got a bit ranty. They just piss me off so much.",

    "selftext": "basically what the title says. I've slowly lost sensitivity since we got married 4 years ago. I thought at first it was due to my depression, so I got therapy. Then, after overcoming depression, I was still experiencing very low/nonexistent libido, no sensitivity, nothing. It didn't matter if I was on my antidepressants or not, before, during, and after it was about the same. I used to be able to enjoy sex, and finish, but now I can't even remember the last time I finished at all. (No I'm not interested in masturbation, nor has that ever done anything to me). My husband has gotten mad at me over the years and accused me of being asexual or lesbian, which I don't think is the case because I KNOW I am sexually attracted to men and not women, and I've experienced normal sexual response cycles many times before, especially as a teen. I did save myself for marriage, if that makes any difference. I then thought, well maybe it's not my depression, maybe it's sexual trauma from seeing and hearing my parents doing it a lot after they always told me sex was bad? (religious upbringing) and so I went to a sex therapist, and she said she couldn't help me. I had another therapist after that who I really liked and helped with everything else in my life except my ability to enjoy sex/ have a sex repsonse cycle despite thoroughly discussing that topic and my traumatizing experiences as a child with my parents. I went to my primary care doctor and he basically told me there were no meds except one that costs $1000 a dose and only has a 10% chance of working. He did blood work on my hormone levels and those were all normal. so basically no one can help me and it leads to dissatisfaction on both sides of this relationship, and makes me so sad. I feel like I should just divorce my husband so he can find a functional woman who can have and enjoy sex with him :( ",

As part of this, I got a tripod and a mobile phone mount for said tripod.\n\nFast-forward 4 years. I've graduated (December of 2022 to be exact) and am working full-time. I occasionally put my phone in the mount and set it on my bedside table to watch things in bed. this past week, the tripod mount broke. No problem, it's like $12. \n\nI ordered another one off Amazon. It was supposed to arrive yesterday.

I need advice ASAP.\n\nSo my friend (19F) is literally going in circles with same toxic people and she clearly doesn't see it! We have a friend group of five since high-school and she's always been the one who has the most other friends outside of the friend group, but we never minded. She has friends from other city and an on and off boyfriend (24M) who's literally the worst human I've ever seen. He's manipulative, controlling, alcoholic with anger issues and he controls who she is friends with, where is she, if she's drinking, etc. He constantly brings up her past before they met and holds it against her. When his friend started hitting on her he blamed HER!! They broke up two weeks ago and we literally celebrated because it felt final. She sent us a 13 minute recording, when they officially ended it, of him just cussing her out, screaming and calling her a slut who doesn't deserve love from anyone, even her parents. He also threatened to kill her dog. Her parents hated him (obviously) so he always talked bad about them.\n\nShe stopped texting us this week but we thought that she was just busy. But turns out she's BACK WITH HIM AGAIN AND THEY MOVED IN TOGETHER! What the hell!! I don't even know what to think. \n\nShe also forgave her ex (now current) best friend after she bad mouthed her and used her so she would buy her and their friends alcohol. Btw she's dating her boyfriends brother who's another jerk. It literally runs in their blood.\n\nI'm serious considering just going low contact with her because she clearly doesn't value our opinions on those horrible people and will ALWAYS choose them over us. I feel like crying from frustration every time I think about it. We have literally tried EVERYTHING to open her eyes. The worst part is that all of us others are at uni somewhere else and she's the only one who's living in our hometown so we can only call her (but she doesn't pick up often). And I'm so concerned and scared that she'll end up dead in the ditch. \n\nPlease I need advice. I'm at my wits end.",

    "selftext": "this is a throwaway because my family knows my main (also English isn't my 1st language so I apologize if there's any Spelling/grammar mistake)\n\ni genuinely don't know what to do or feel about this.i feel so alone and unsafe rn, im literally crying as I'm writing this. \n\nLast week, I woke up to my brother touching me inappropriately. We share the same room and bed, I felt his hands on me. I don't know why, but I stayed completely still. I could've stopped him, I could've yelled or pushed him away-but my brain just froze. I just lay there and took it.\n\nAfter about 5-10 minutes, I decided to \"fake waking up\" very slowly so he would stop. And he did.\n\nI felt disgusting. I wanted to tell my mom, but he's her favorite, and I was terrified she wouldn't believe me. So, I kept quiet and hoped it would never happen again.\n\ni decided not to and hopped he'd stop. I feel so gross whenever he would touch me during the day or even when he's in the same room as me. \nI just feel so icky about all of this.\n\nfor the next few days, nothing really happened, and I almost convinced myself it was over. But on the 3 days after that incident I felt it again. I woke up but didn't open my eyes, I felt numb and trapped. i wanted to cry, but I just lay there again, completely still, doing nothing to resist or stop him\n\nanyways,I went to school and was gonna told a friend about it but i got scared that they'll Tell everyone about it so i didn't. i didn't slept at my room that night (i slept at a friends house). i literally couldn't sleep that night, i remember my friend waking up because i was Crying and she asked me if im ok, i said yes and asked if we could watch a movie. i cried myself to sleep that night.\n\nSo nothing really happened after that and Really thought it was over. i was even sleeping in my room. \nI woke up to someone touching me again Today. So, 40 something minutes ago, i woke up to him touching me again. And just like before, I did nothing.\n\nI wanted to move, to scream, to do something. But my body wouldn\u2019t listen. It was like my brain had shut down, leaving me frozen in place. so I just lay there, pretending to sleep, trying not to make a sound. and he eventually stopped.\n\nWhen he finally rolled over and pretended to sleep, I slowly turned away, pulling my blanket tighter around me. I wanted to cry, but the tears wouldn\u2019t come. I just stared at the wall and stayed there for about 20mins and got up to write this. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I don\u2019t know how to make it stop.\nI just wish I could disappear. \n\nPLEASE give me advice on what to do. im literally crying rn because i couldn't defend myself. I just feel so icky about this\n\n\n\n\n\n**EDIT:**\nThank you so so much for the amount of advice you guys gave me and for reassuring me that freezing is a completely normal reaction to these kind of situations.\n\nim planning on asking my mom if i could maybe sleep in her room because im not \"comfortable w sleeping in the same room as my brother\" but im currently staying at my friends house to maybe just clear my thoughts about this whole situation.\n\nMany people are saying to \"Set up a camera and record the whole situation\" But im not gonna do that because i don't wanna experience that situation again.\n\nAlso just to clarify; no, i am not indian. i'm japanese. We live in a 2 bedroom apartment that's why me and my brother share the same room. My dad isn't with us anymore so it's just me, my mom and my little brother. the reason im scared to bring it up to her is because she always takes my little brother side and we just recently loss our father. i don't want to cause her even more pain by telling her my brother has been Groping me.\n\nI'll update you guys asap when i do finally bring it up to my mom. \nonce again, ty for the people who dm'd me and gave me advice on what to do. i really needed that \u2764\ufe0f",

    "selftext": "hello! i hope im not going against any rules by posting this.   \ni intially wanted to post this to try and figure out how to turn this personal letter into an artistic creative thing that i can put out into the world, but for now, its just a letter that is true off my chest.\n\nthis is a letter i have sent a friend/lover that is very important to me. we have a weird, secretive relationship dynamic, somewhat of a situationship but much more communicative and relationshipy. its weird. the letter talks about it a little bit. the thing is, after he read it, he told me that the letter was personal, authentic, and very beautiful, that i should think about maybe doing something with it in the future-(creatively, he meant, we are both creative people, studied creative writing together, that\u2019s how we met)  \n  \nanyways here\u2019s the letter, keep in mind it is translated as it is originally in a different language:)\n\n\u201dHi \n\nthis letter contains things that are important to me that you know.\n\nEvery time I initiate a hang out with you to talk about things, I end up not saying everything I want to say, maybe because I forget, or feel better at that moment when I'm with you, and don't want to create a worse mood for either you or me again, /don't want to be a burden, so I end up not saying anything and end up regretting and getting upset when things don't work out between us.\n\nSo I want to take a moment here and write to you everything I can remember that I usually think and feel about us, and hope that with all the recoil you probably get from this letter, you can also take a moment of your time and read without too much pressure of responding quickly.\n\nI want to start by saying that you are a person who is very, very important to me. I have said it many times and I have no problem saying it again, simply because it is true: you are the first person that I have ever felt true, pure love. a feeling that I thought people invent in movies, that made me think it was not something that was even possible to feel. You made me feel it. It is real.\n\nYou know how sentimental and emotional I am, it is very easy for me to look at a picture of us from a month ago and feel nostalgic because I miss a specific day that I had a really nice time with you. Like for example on your birthday, when you invited me to sleep over at your place and told me that I was really cute and that you wanted to kiss me in front of everyone. These are things that are hard for me to forget and I hope I never forget because it makes my heart feel good. Sometimes I am completely reluctant to mention things like this or talk about it at all because the fact that I talk about it means that in moments like these have a lot of weight. It makes me very vulnerable and it's scary, I prefer not to mention any good moment we had, not to say I love you, not to say I miss something that happened two days ago, and that way if you don't say something nice back, I won't be offended by it, I won't think it's not mutual, I won't think I'm taking everything too personally and that for you I'm just another person to have fun with every now and then. even though i know if it was just fun it would have ended a long time ago for you. But I choose to say it anyway, because I want you to at least know how much good you can do, even if you don't mean to. I choose to get hurt a little every now and then.\n\nI think you are very talented You write in a way that is very impulsive, for better or worse. In the pieces you wrote, it is very clear that what you write comes from that moment deep inside, and it is not calculated, it is simply what is happening in your heart at that second, and you bring it out. Another talent you have is the way you get to know people. Something that I am very jealous of, but I feel I am lucky to experience it as a friend, and even learn from you. You ask bizarre questions that no one thinks to ask, go into strange depths, and we would sometimes laugh at you at that moment in class because it is really very funny that you ask things that no one thinks are interesting enough, but it is a trait that I appreciate very much. I think that I will move here in this letter between things that you might be flattered by and things that you have a chance of being offended by, It is important for me to point out that it is okay to be offended just as it is okay to be flattered by everything I write, but you should know that everything I write is things that I think and feel. There are no facts here. And there is not even a single intention to hurt.\n\nIf I could, I would write this in a letter and bring it to you physically, but right now we are after a not very pleasant interaction that was on through messages, as there is every now and then between us. And right now I am not in the mood to see you because I feel like I will cry and I will not be able to say anything coherent.\n\nMaybe I am too sensitive and take everything too hard. Maybe you love me but don't like me very much and sometimes try to hurt me. It could be both.\n\nSometimes I feel like you really want to hurt me. That you know exactly what combination of words will hurt me the most, and you choose them specifically. I don't think it's bad intentions. I think it's more of you trying to defend yourself. Maybe I say things that I think come out well, but they hurt you, and then you, who feel attacked, try to attack back, because that way you'll have the power, and you can hurt and leave. Sometimes we encounter a situation of unpleasant messages and at the peak you'll say something like you're gonna stop answering me, or something more cynical-passive aggressive to imply to me that you're not going to answer anymore no matter what I say. Sometimes I'm in a good mood, and after a conversation like that with you i get very sad in a restless way, like i have to talk it out. And when you cut off at the peak of this conversation, I have no way to explain anymore, no way to resolve, no way to do anything. All that's left for me is to sit with myself, with the feelings I have about myself, about how much I may have hurt you with the words I used incorrectly, about how much I want you to understand that I don't think such bad things about you. And to sit with myself, with the feelings I have for you, that with how much I love you, you are the person who most manages to hurt my most sensitive points.\n\nOnce in a conversation of this style, you managed to throw into the air that it would be better if we ended the relationship.\n\nAfter that, when we met and I mentioned it, you said that you said it in the heat of the moment, and that you didn't really mean it.\n\nI think you did mean it, just, at that moment. And then at some point when we managed to talk and get along again, you regretted meaning it. I think that both of these situations are correct, and that they don't necessarily contradict each other.\n\nSometimes I really have thoughts like, 'Wow, maybe I should really end this relationship.'\" Sometimes I feel like the relationship with you is doing me a lot more harm than good. Sometimes I feel like you hate me. Detest me. And maybe you stay in touch with me because it's easier than breaking up. And maybe that's true sometimes, I don't know. But I also don't think it necessarily contradicts other good feelings you might have for me sometimes. In any case, I can understand. There's not a single person in the world that I can say 100% that will never get on my nerves, accidentally hurt me, get tired of them. and I also told you, I think that if I spend enough time with anyone, at some point I'll want to not be around them. On the other hand, you're one of the only people I prioritize spending time with. And the only person I want to be around even if I'm very hurt and we're not at our best terms.\n\nI think something happened the day we started hooking up for the first time. That day I went out with you and a friend for a walk in the city, we went into your old school, the friend stayed outsid. we were left with just you, with the stories and experiences you had there, with all the nostalgia from there, and I was there, and listened to you, and I really enjoyed experiencing something sentimental with you. A big part of your life you spent there, and then I was there with you and somehow managed to be a small part of all of it. of you.\n\nLater that day, after we hooked up, when you walked me to the train, and we were both very nervous because we had arranged to meet the next day, but we were both afraid that suddenly we wouldn't want to meet again when the time came. Because we both had that similar problem. that weird avoidant way of dealing with life. And then the next day came, we still wanted to, and it happened, and it didn't exactly stop for a very long time.\n\nUsually when I want someone, as soon as they show interest in me back, I stop wanting them. It didn't happen with you. You shared your flaws with me and not only did I identify with a lot of them, but it only drew me in more. I really fell in love with a person, and not just an idea. I think that's why it's so easy for me to get hurt by you.\n\nI love you very much. The whole person that you are. I'm very attracted to you. Physically, emotionally, mentally. In just about every way.\n\nWhat you think of me, how you think of me, is very important to me. I really care about you and your opinions. Sometimes you say things about me, that you think I'm not intelligent, or things like that, I say very directly that these are things that hurt me. Insult me. You take it more lightly, and with a laugh, and with a certain detachment towards me and how I feel. I think you might have the feeling that you're above me in all sorts of ways. That you have more power over certain things. That your opinions are more important or true than mine. And that facts are perhaps more important or true than my feelings. Sometimes you are the most sensitive person in the world, looking for a hug, love, intimacy, making me laugh when I'm not feeling well. And sometimes you treat me as if you are a person who doesnt know how to be a friend. That you have no ability to understand or contain my difficulty, my feelings.\n\nI think a lot of it is also my fault. Every time I told you that you were crossing a certain line, that's all it was. I tell you that you're crossing a line, And that's it, there were no consequences beyond that. I say my piece, carry on as usual as always, and then it repeats itself. Again things are said, again I'm offended, again I don't want to talk to you again in my life, and then I come back to you the second there's a chance, because I want you in my life. It's like I'm giving up a lot of myself, so that I can feel good, sometimes, with you.\n\nI'll say something now that if it wasn't clear before, it can be very recoiling and disgusting to hear, at least for me- My relationship with you, and you, in general, is very addictive to me. I'm addicted to you. You feel like a drug to me and I can't find a better or worse way to say it, that's how it feels to me. When I'm with you and everything is good, everything is the best in the world. When it's bad, it's very bad.\n\nthere was another time, at some day, I was at your place I think a few days after we agreed not to sleep together anymore.- of course we met and slept together because how could we not): There was one moment, you put your head on my chest as if I were a pillow. we just sat like that in bed for an hour, cuddling, calm, comfortable, quiet, pleasant.\n\nWhy do I get so hung up on these moments?\n\nIt's like if I'm not bipolar enough on my own, there's another layer of bipolarity in our relationship.\n\nI remember especially at the beginning of this relationship, when I was at your place and I felt so nice and comfortable, I didn't want it to end simply because it was the peak of the day for me. The moment I had to go home, just being on the drive back home, alone, sleeping alone, suddenly that was the lowest point of my life.\n\nI've slept alone my whole life. Why does it feel so heavy now?\n\nIt's like craving you helped me survive a little longer, every time. And this is the most unhealthy thing I've ever experienced, and the most disgusting thing I've ever said. It's embarrassing to admit it at all, especially when I'm sure it's not mutual.\n\nFor a very long time I was emotionally dependent on you, like if you were in a good mood it would be great for me, but if you were feeling bad and would withdraw from the world, I could easily take it personally. Because when I'm in a bad mood, I still want to be near you. I still want to talk to you. And it's disgusting to me. Why is it different only with you? Why am I not interested in sleeping with anyone, except you? Why did I think for years that I wasn't interested in sex at all and that I could easily live without it, and then after I met you, I became a nymphomaniac? Why can I just say bye to people and leave without a hug, but with you this intimacy is so important to me? I don't even have one answer really I have no idea why it's like this\n\nOn the one hand I think, if I kept my distance from you, I would get used to being without you, it would have been hard at first, but little by little I would stop wanting anything like this with you, and then maybe I would be able to quit you. On the other hand, You're funny You love Why would I keep my distance just because it's a little hard sometimes?\n\nI'm in these dilemmas every now and then But I really don't want to lose touch with you\n\nSometimes I think you don't see or appreciate things I do for you, take me for granted. Why not, actually? you said so yourself, no matter when you text me, I will answer. if you need a favor, i will do it. if you want me to come to you and be with you, there will never be a situation in life where I will say no. I haven't given you a single reason to make you think that I'm not simply there whenever you need or want. So maybe it's my fault. Maybe I'm too accessible, not enough hard to get. and it's too convenient, it's easy to take it for granted, I don't know.\n\nMaybe you'll read all of this and think I'm a psycho, Tell me that you think it would be best and most worthwhile to end the relationship, and I'll understand from that, that you don't want anything to do with me, and I'll be offended, and we'll never talk again, and all that this relationship will be is some cute memories from time to time that are accompanied by a bad taste from how it ended.\n\nMaybe you'll read all of this and say nothing, pretend you never got it, maybe you'll even see that you got this letter, tell yourself wow this is really long I'll get to it someday, and forget about ever getting to it.\n\nMaybe you'll read this and tell me what you think and feel too. Share your side. Tell me that everything is okay, it's okay what I feel, it's okay that I'm an addicted psycho, and that I'm too important to you to lose touch with me over stupid things that can be solved in an instant with a little communication and the right mood.\n\nI don't know what you'll choose, but everything is legitimate and I'll understand in the end, even if not at that moment. I love you, I would be happy to talk whenever there is a problem, I just want us to really be able to talk.\n\nI am not here to apologize, and I do not demand any forgiveness from you, Whatever happened was. Do you want us to stay in touch? I would be very happy. Just please try to pay attention, appreciate me, respect boundaries. If situations arise where you feel that I am attacking you, that I am unpleasant, that I am unbearable, that I am repulsive, inconsiderate, offensive, - tell me. Let's talk about it. It doesn't have to be at that moment when you are at your wits' end, you can do it at any moment, but let's try to communicate more healthily and hug after that and be good please:)\n\ni love you\u201d\n\nid like to know your thoughts about this. if it made anyone feel anything, or anythig like that.   \nafter he read this letter he has said that relates, understand, and he was the one to tell me to maybe do something creative about it in the future, i never even thought about it until he sais it, as it was a very personal thing that was meant for his eyes only.  \nthanks for reading:)",

Sometimes during dates he would text her constantly and tell me that she is lovey dovey with him saying \u201cthank you for being the brother I never had.\u201d She rejected him from dating app but suggested they be friends. I didn\u2019t say anything initially but as we started getting serious I asked him to delete and stop talking to her. And he did. Fast forward to now, we have had some issues and almost broke up a couple of times. \n\nSome examples of problems include but not limited to incidences when we talk about the future plan and type of children we would have, he says they would have \u201cchinky eyes\u201d because it is a dominant gene.

He is now crying profusely apologizing saying he loves me.\n\nIs this emotional cheating? \n\nUpdate 1: he keeps saying \u201cI can\u2019t lose you ur the love of my life I blocked her, and ur my wife\u201d\n\nUpdate 2: he threatened to take his own life when I tried breaking up with him.

    "selftext": "I recently remembered an event from the past, and I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about it. It happened a long time ago, so it\u2019s possible that what I remember is not exactly what actually happened.\n\nA few years ago, in 2022, when I was 14, I was coming home from school with some friends when an idiot thought it would be funny to open my backpack and ring a doorbell without telling me. Immediately afterward, everyone started running. I quickly zipped up my backpack and, for some reason I don\u2019t remember, I decided to cross the road to the other sidewalk instead of running forward. Maybe it was because there were too many people in front of me, making it difficult to run quickly\u2014I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t remember.\n\nThe thing is, as soon as I stepped onto the road, an older man on a motorcycle appeared right in front of me, just a few meters away. I moved away as fast as I could and got back onto the sidewalk where I had been before. I think I remember the driver swerving a little when he got scared after seeing me (though I\u2019m not entirely sure about this). I didn\u2019t hear any noise that would suggest the man had fallen, nor did I hear a scream of pain\u2014just a \u201c\u00a1Me cago en la madre!\u201d (which roughly means \u201cFor f***\u2019s sake!\u201d in Spanish), which I believe means he kept driving (I think).\n\nThe problem is that I don\u2019t know if I started running once I stepped back onto the sidewalk, which could have prevented me from noticing an accident if it happened. But it\u2019s more likely that I stayed still after stepping away from the road\u2014at least long enough that I would have noticed if anything had happened. I\u2019m not sure what exactly happened in that moment. It all happened so fast, and it\u2019s been a few years since then.\n\nWhen I saw the idiot who opened my backpack again, all he did was laugh. I guess he saw what happened in some way, and that\u2019s why he made fun of me when we met again. Or maybe I told him about it, and then he started laughing\u2014I don\u2019t remember. I also seem to recall that I had two other friends behind me, on the other side of the road, and when they caught up with us, they were laughing too. If what I remember is correct, that would mean nothing actually happened.\n\nI got home feeling like an idiot, but at no point did I think I might have caused an accident. I\u2019ve walked through that area dozens of times since then, and while I wasn\u2019t specifically looking, I never noticed any signs that an accident had happened. I also searched online for news from that year in my city, and I didn\u2019t find anything similar to what I experienced. I never heard anyone mention that day again, which reinforces my belief that nothing actually happened.\n\nI recently remembered this incident, and I think I\u2019m becoming paranoid. I\u2019m scared by the possibility that the man could have had a serious accident or that someone nearby might have been hurt, since it was a very busy area at that time, with lots of cars and many kids coming back from school. I\u2019ve been really worried for the past few days, and I honestly feel bad about it.\n\nDo you think I\u2019m just being paranoid? I need someone to reassure me\u2014I\u2019m a bit scared.",

    "selftext": "I\u2019m a woman in my 60s who for the bulk of my adult life has been able to keep and cultivate good relationships with friends, family, and coworkers. I have suffered off and on with depression and anxiety that I felt was bad enough to seek treatment for since my mid 40s. I had no shame in admitting this as it was a difficult time for me given perimenopause, a stressful job, kids heading off to college, etc. \n\nThings really began unraveling for me about a year ago. I had gained a bunch of weight, felt like crap, was facing some unexpected backlash from my two adult kids whom I had raised alone and were each facing their own separate personal crises simultaneously, was helping my widowed, aging mother navigate life alone, and a second new and stronger wave of \u201cideology\u201d was evolving.\n\nI started therapy for the first time in my life and leaned heavily into journaling out my feelings, as I have a love of writing and my therapist felt it would be helpful for me. I dove right in to a shadow work journal with writing prompts that ask you to relate negative thoughts and feelings you are having now to your childhood, in order to heal your inner child. I have written at length on my memories from early childhood and nothing came forward that I hadn\u2019t pondered before, so no big revelations this time\u2026 except for my anger.\n\nAfter a year of processing these events, poking at my anger, examining every piece of it through the lens of this tired and wounded old woman, and having the entire world bursting into flames exponentially more every day, I am at my breaking point. In the past year I have lost my 3 friends to the above mentioned \u201cideology\u201d, then most of my family, and now, because I am so sad and really suffering from the effects of anger about not only the abuse and neglect I experienced in my past, but the trauma of the problems my entire continent is facing, I\u2019ve got my mother in my face telling me she doesn\u2019t like how it makes her feel that consequences are happening as a result of her actions. Nobody is blaming her for anything, merely mentioning they are losing their job. Or that they are struggling mentally. Or that they\u2019re boycotting hyper consumerism. Or that they\u2019re scared. Or that they feel compelled now to join this movement or become anti-whatever to make a statement and support people who\u2019ve been hurt. She doesn\u2019t like feeling that feeling that comes up when she has to wonder if people actually know her leanings, and maybe even think her actions are causing harm to them. It\u2019s her own thought process guilting her, and outing her at the same time. \n\nIt\u2019s so hard telling this without using certain words that are crucial to the story, but hopefully I\u2019ve avoided the flags that will get this story banned. \n\nNow, I find myself on the verge of lashing out at my 84 year old mother the next time she berates me (I see it coming) because I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to bite my tongue. I carried for 60 years the memory of her attempted suicide in front of me as a 3 year old, where just before losing consciousness, instructed me how to use a telephone to call for help. She doesn\u2019t think I remember. I protected my mother from her own shame of her daughter carrying this secret knowledge all her life, while enduring beatings from her 2nd husband, repeated emotional betrayals from her, being called a slut every day of my teen life. I was shamed mercilessly for my own emotional problems growing up, and was told I\u2019m not good enough constantly. My own suicidal thoughts at 13 were claimed by her as embarrassing, and would make her look bad. I was never allowed to feel my anger and it caused me to make some really poor choices regarding relationships in my life. \n\nWell that rage has come to life and I think if I express it the way it deserved to be expressed all along, it might kill her. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Me (21M) and my girlfriend (22F) have been together for 4 months now. After the first 2 months I started to notice and understand better all the things she has to deal with in her head, bad experiences in past relationships that affected her deeply and left her with traumas that are now being reflected in me just because we are in a long distance relationship and we can't see each other 24/7 and know what the other is doing or know entirely what is happening to us. Although she never saw a specialist or therapist to treat these problems (which she admitted to me was out of fear or pride), I always try to explain to her that right now it is impossible for me to be devotedly aware of her every second of the day, with my career, my activities, my friends and my own life in general. Every day I talk to her to accompany her in the little free time I have during the day and when I return home exhausted I also make sure to communicate with her and ask her about her day and if she would like to talk about something with me, in which most of the time her answers are \"I have nothing interesting to tell\". There are also times when a harmless joke I make unleashes hell where she gets offended at me and I need to reassure her of how much she means to me and how much i really love her, I apologize for upsetting her with something I said, to which she (apparently) accepts my apologies and (also apparently) everything is resolved. Last night I even went out with my guy friends to a bar after a hard week and all day long I let her know who I was with and what our plans were for the night, to which she ended up responding, as a way of throwing it in my face, that I will never be able to understand her and solve all the damage she suffered with me with a simple forgiveness, and acussed me of not caring about her and not being able to see things the way she sees them. That made me feel like like I'm worth absolutely nothing, like all the sincerely unconditional love I give her when we're together isn't worth it even in the slightest, that all the moments in which I was there to listen to her and understand her also meant nothing. I need honest and direct opinions on this. ",
