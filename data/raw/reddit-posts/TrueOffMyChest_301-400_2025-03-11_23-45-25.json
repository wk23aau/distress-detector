He's never comforted me since I grew up, and when I cry, he'll just call me stupid for whatever im crying about, so I have to hide. He never stops bothering me, even for the dumbest shit that he could do in 2 seconds, like the multiple times I had to make his bed just because he doesn't want to put in the tiny amount of effort required. I genuinely cant tell if he pretends to love me at times. He's just a fat, lazy alcoholic that loves to make me do shit (he's literally calling me while I write)",

    "selftext": "I (27f) got engaged 6 months ago to my now ex fianc\u00e9 (let\u2019s call him Ross) (30m). However that month was hell with my grandma (who I was extremely close to) dying. I wasn\u2019t dealing with it I was just ignoring the pain and saying I was fine. Well about 3 weeks after we got engaged and my grandma dying I had drinks with a friend (27f). What started off as just a drink or two quickly turned to shots and not remembering even leaving the lounge. Now most of this is from what I have been told by the friend, her husband, and my ex fianc\u00e9. Friends husband (let\u2019s call him Craig) had to come and pick us up and took us back to their place. My fianc\u00e9 had his son and we lived about a hour away from the friends and where we got drinks so he was not able to come get me. The friend and I apparently crashed in their bed with Craig having to wake me up when Ross called. Now this is where stories have changed. At first Ross and I were told that my friend and Craig started doing stuff in the same bed I was in and I woke up and joined in. Whereas recently they have started to say I started everything. The only memory that I have during any of this is thinking \u201cwhat the fuck am I doing\u201d and I then proceeded to run out of the room. According to my ex fianc\u00e9 I then called him and was trying to seduce him over the phone. This is when I apparently told him what happened and he said I sounded excited. My next memory is being on the phone with him and him yelling at me that I had called him just to tell him I cheated on him. We apparently talked a little longer and then hung up. And that night is the night my life fell apart. \n\nSince that night we have tried to make it work but as you can tell he is now my ex fianc\u00e9. He continues to holds resentment towards me and the friends on what happened. I would also like to say that they are no longer friends either after that and the friend texting me telling me that she was the martyr in my relationship. \n\nWell now that everything has ended and stuff has come to light I am struggling. Craig was sober through the whole night and the friend while originally saying she didn\u2019t remember anything is now saying that she remembers all of it. I am the only one that doesn\u2019t remember leaving the lounge or anything at their house besides that one thought and the one line from the phone call. I am feeling very used and taken advantage of because sober or even buzzed I would have never hooked up with anyone but my fianc\u00e9.  Together we have experimented but it was together. I am so unsure of how to feel about that night. Now I am not looking for advice, sympathy, or really anything I just thought it might help if I write this all down. And maybe someone can learn from my story that just because you think you can trust people to protect you that may not be the case and one night can take the life your building away. \n\nIf there are questions I\u2019ll do my best to answer them in the comments. Thanks for reading. ",

    "selftext": "I don't really know how to start this or end it or what I'm really trying to say, so please excuse any rambling/unnecessary information.\n\nI'm a 22 year old female who had little to no experience having friends throughout high school. In elementary school I had a fairly large circle of friends, but around the time puberty hit and I became more self aware I realized that my peers found me weird. I was pretty much exclusively friends with guys and I was basically a full head taller than anyone around me, including my male friends. I was pretty bad at actually holding a conversation (I still am) and my interests strayed from even my small group of friends. Middle school came, and that was fine, I still had my group of friends. But in classes where I wasn't sitting with them or we had differing lunch periods, I was basically silent. I was too nervous to make any attempt to talk to those around me or try out social skills.\n\n  \nHigh school was terrible. At first I had the same lunch period as my friends, but then my table slowly filled with other people until my seat was seized by other people and my \"friends\" made no attempt to save me a spot. It felt like I was unable to speak anymore. I had a surgery that took me out of school for 6 weeks, and by the time I came back I was basically a stranger. I unironically tried to live high school like a shadow, keeping my mouth shut except to participate in classes that required it and to participate in group projects.\n\n  \nI didn't really consider myself as having friends until I joined this group on discord. The people in it have changed and we've hopped servers a few times, but the central people have stayed the same. The most relevant are (Fake names, although I'm not worried they'll find this) Cas, NB 22, Ian, M 22, and James, M 23. These people form the core of my friend group.\n\n  \nI don't really know when it started. I think I was about 19. I had been feeling depressed for a few weeks, and self harming was basically my exclusive way of relieving stress. I was questioning my worth even as a human being, fantasizing about ways to remove myself from this world. I guess I started questioning if my larger friend group even wanted me around, since I was so easily discarded by the one I had since childhood. I didn't disclose my depression, didn't mention self harm, didn't share that I wanted to die. I wanted them to feel bad for me, so I accused them of not valuing me as a friend and then, to them, disappeared off the platform for two weeks.\n\n  \nThe next time I checked discord, I had paragraphs of apologies and worried messages basically begging me to come back. It felt euphoric. Even people outside the circle that I consider my closest friends were messaging me, wondering when I'd be back. At the time I don't think I even realize I was being manipulative. But I definitely got hooked on the euphoria of their reaction. The feeling of being wanted.\n\n  \nI've spent the last 3 years doing basically the same thing. Not at the same level. I would guilt trip them for hanging out with other friends. If they said something mean to me I would sulk for days until they apologized, even if it was my fault. I give them the cold shoulder if they do something that displeases me even to a minor degree. I push their buttons until they snap to see what they let me get away with. If I'm angry, they get quiet and relent to anything I say or do. Even then, they always come back.\n\nRecently Cas has been hanging out with two different groups of friends more than us. They keep getting involved in new communities related to their interests and being an important part of other peoples groups. The time they spend with me and the others has dwindled so significantly that I've become a twisted amount of jealous. I've been thinking of ways to convince them to cut those people off. Ways to convince them that the others aren't worth their time, or that they're bad people. I actively want to isolate them from the other groups so that their only choice is us. I want to make them feel bad for thinking that they should devote attention to anything else.\n\n  \nI got on anti depressants a month ago and started attending therapy. The combination is opening my eyes to the things that I do. I am disgusted with myself. I am afraid that I'm going to go to far and they're going to realize what I do and cut me off. I deserve it. I want to be better for them, but as I am now I'm probably more comparable to cancer on the group than a friend. I think I'm afraid that it's too late. I don't know. I don't really want pity.  I'm even disgusted that I feel pity for myself when I put myself in this situation. Even now I don't know if I can be a better person, but I'm too deep into anti depressants to think that I should just remove myself from this world. I just needed to tell someone.",

    "selftext": "I hate that he still makes me insecure and question myself even now, so I needed to vent.\n\nThis post is about me (F), my ex (M), and \"Will,\". We're all in our early 20s, and this all mostly happened \"long\" distance, since both my ex and Will live a couple of hours drive from me.\n\nThe timeline of everything is a bit complicated, but I'll do my best to explain.\n\nMy relationship with my ex was shitty.\nI let myself be pressured into an open relationship because I was too afraid to lose him, and I was, honestly, dumb.\n\nHe used to be my friend, and I though - more, he led me to belive - we had the same ideals about things like relationships.\n\nThis went on for a while, untill he mentioned having a girlfriend.\nI was hurt, thinking I had misunderstood everything, but I wanted to do the right thing and asked if she was fine with how we talked and if maybe we needed to take a step back.\n\nHe claimed it was fine, that they had talked about me a lot, that she knew everything about how we talked and had no problems with it.\n\nI believed him, probably because I wanted to, so we kept talking as usual, even if I eliminated every possible \"hint\" on my end. \n\nEven if I was sad about my unreciprocated crush, I started working on getting rid of my feelings for him.\nIt was not a good period. I am very sensitive to rejection and was stuck between wanting to end the friendship for peace of mind and not wanting to lose someone I cared about. \n\nThen, he came back. While we were on a phone call, he said something pretty explicit, and I gave in.\nI know I was wrong for it, but I just assumed he had broken up with his girlfriend. \nHe had talked about her only one other time, and just to complain about how they were having trouble because his libido was higher than hers. (I know, ew, but rose-colored glasses were still doing their work.)\n\nSo, I flirted back, and we started saying some explicit stuff too, which never happened before that moment.\nHe was also asking for pictures, and being pushy when I told him I wasn\u2019t comfortable yet.\nThis went on for a week before it occurred to me that maybe I should ask about his \"ex.\"\n\nWell, they were still together. He told me he loved her, and she knew he was polyamorous, so he decided he would talk to her.\n\nAnyway, he talked to her.\n\nRadio silence for a week followed.\nFirst, he had to talk to her and suddently felt bad talking to me, and later, he was always \"too tired from that conversation\" to tell me anything.\n\nFinally, I pressured him enough to tell me that his girlfriend, \"Anne,\" wanted to think about things, but we could still be friends as usual.\n\nThat week of silence had made me so scared of losing him that I agreed, and six months of hell started.\nHe would flirt, then ignore me, then get mad at me for being upset.\nI would have breakdowns, ask him to just end everything, and he would guilt me by saying he and Anne were \"working so hard on all of this\" and I was just going to make it all useless, which was unfair to them.\n\nAfter those six month I finally decided to end it. It was hard\u2014he made me feel crazy and like I had used him. He managed to basically twist everything in HIM ending things with ME, but still \"gracing\" me with his presence in my life.\n\nAfter another month, he called.\nHe told me that even if I had hurt him a lot, he understood why I was feeling so anxious and that Anne had finally agreed to us having a poly relationship, where he would date both her and me.\n\nLike the idiot I am, I agreed. I talked to Anne to make sure it was alright, we set boundaries, and we gave it a try.\n\nSkip to another six months later, and things are not good.\nAnne broke up with my ex, and he became depressed. He would do nothing all day, only call me to get him to get out of bed or for s*x stuff.\n\nHe wanted to go to uni but said it was too hard, so he looked for a job\u2014but he was not committing to that either.\n\nHe also started getting very upset for things I did or did not choose to do.\nHe got mad at me for gifting a drawing (I'm a small artist) to a friend\u2014something I have done countless times for countless people, him included.\n\nAnother time, he got mad because a client I had done a commission for gave me a small extra as a thanks, because he was \"disrespecting my boundary\"\n\nHe got mad at me for asking him to please use \"they/them\" pronouns while talking about my best friend of eight years.\n\nHe gave me the silent treatment for going to a concert with the same friend\u2014one I had booked before we were even officially together and had plans to go to before this whole situation even started.\n\nSkip again to the last two weeks of the relationship, and we have plans of going to a convention. Will, a mutual friend, is going to be there too.\nMy ex is supposed to join me on Friday\u2014we have tickets for Saturday.\n\nThursday, Will arrived in my town, and since we had never met in person, he asked me to join him and a group of friends for dinner.\n\nI figured it's a good way to meet, since we would not be alone.\nMy ex knew, said he had no problems with it, so I went.\n\nIt's important to note that my ex wanted to keep our relationship a secret, even though I had asked him to share it with friends, Will included. \n\nAt this dinner, Will was nothing but kind, maybe a bit too affectionate for a friend, but I honestly did not pay much attention to it. \nI am not good at telling when people have feelings for me, and Will's an outgoing guy, so I thought it was just that.\n\nThe next day, my ex arrived and I hosted him.\nThat night, one of the two major events that led me to the breakup happened.\n\n(TW for SA)\n\nI was sleeping, and my ex woke me up for s*x by touching me inappropriately.\nI tell I'm to stop because I'm tired.\n\nHe pouts, and I ask him what's wrong.\nHe tells me, \"I missed you a lot, and you just want to sleep.\"\nI repeat I'm tired and really excited for the next day, and I'm sorry, but I'm really too sleepy to be in the mood.\n\nHe's still upset but agrees, and we go back to sleep.\n\nThis happens again. At least another two times, but I don't really know because I still need a few minutes to understand stuff once I've been woken up. I'm starting to feel unsafe.\n\nThe next day, I wake up with a bad stomach and back pain.\nHe \"jokes\" that maybe he did something to me in my sleep.\nI am disgusted and want to get out of bed.\n\nHe hugs me to keeps me there, and it takes me a while to manage to even just get up.\n\nAnd then, the slowest morning of my life starts.\nI wanted to get dressed, make breakfast for both of us, and then go to the convention by 10:30 AM.\n\nBy 11 AM, I was in tears (I do cry a lot when I'm stressed), begging my ex to just let me get ready\u2014and to get ready himself\u2014because I had paid a lot for the ticket, and it was important to me to be there.\nI'm also someone who manages anxiety by having \"plans\", and having someone just ignoring an agreed upon plan without comunicating makes me stressed. He knew this.\n\nWe finally got on the train, and I was upset. \nHe was mad at me for being upset, and we argued.\nHe told me he thought it was better to get there later but knew I would \"get worked up\" if he told me, so he didn\u2019t want to \"deal with me.\" Instead, he just took things slow so that \"I had to adapt to his pace\", and it was the better like that.\n\nI was so shocked about what he was saying, for the first time I felt like he was the crazy one and not me.\n\nI tried to make him see why that was wrong. \nI said, \"Remember when you got to an event you really cared about 30 minutes late and were sad? This is the same for me.\"\nLike he's some toddler who needs to learn empathy.\nHe agreed it was the same but still refused to apologize, so I let it go to enjoy the convention.\n\nI was on edge all day, constantly thinking about what I would do if \"something bad\" happened, even though I wasn\u2019t sure why I felt that way.\n\nWe met Will and finally told him we were a couple\u2014 to be honest, he had to ask because my ex did not want me to say it, he just agreed to hold my hand and \"not lie if he asks\".\n\nThe rest of my ex's stay went normally. He left, and a couple of days later, Will called me to tell me he had feelings for me.\nHe made it clear he didn\u2019t expect anything from me, planned to take as many steps back as needed, and that my ex already knew. \n\nI honestly did not expect it because I had never done anything for him.\nWith both my first and second boyfriends (the one in this story), we got close after I supported them through a rough period, but I had never done that for Will.\n\nThat also made me think a lot\u2014my ex had a very \"transactional\" mindset. He never did anything just for nothing, and I didn\u2019t like that about him. But he had convinced me it was normal, that I was just a people-pleaser. (I am, but not as detached from reality as he made me out to be.)\n\nHe would always list things he did for me (like consoling me when I was stressed) and things I didn't do for him (like not being good enough at listening him rant about his life because I don't understand his struggles enought to comfort him, and I'm not logical enough for giving advice, apparently.)\n\nI decided to take a few days to process my feelings and focus on my relationship with my ex, figuring out how to deal with everything, even if right then I did not feel close to him at all.\n\nThen, the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back came.\n\nAs stupid as it seems, it was a drawing\u2014just a dumb character that Will had made, standing close to my dumb character and hugging them.\n\nI had done this MANY TIMES.\nI love drawing people's characters with mine. I do it for friends, even for mutuals and strangers on the internet, just because I enjoy it. It\u2019s something I love doing, and people usally like receiving them so it's a win-win.\n\nI had been working on it before Will\u2019s confession, it was done and I posted it, like I do for any other drawing I finish.\nI really did not see it as important, I had done countless similar drawings and I was also trying to keep a regular posting schedule, so that my account would get more interactions and I could maybe get commissions.\n\nOne day, first thing in the morning, my ex texted me a screenshot of it.\n\"I was finally happy after a while, but this ruined my day.\"\nAnd\n\"I was also going to 'touch myself' but I don't want to anymore\"\n(First, ew, second, good, maybe do something else with your day)\n\nI couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\n\nI messaged Anne, and we finally shared everything about him.\nWe had never done that before because he didn\u2019t want us to, always claiming to be a private person and saying it was unfair to talk about our relationship.\n\nBut all his gaslighting came out. We shared stories, feelings we had both experienced but that he had convinced us were just in our heads\u2014the same things I just described in this post, things I thought were just me being too sensitive, timelines that didn\u2019t add up...\n\nI was sad \u2014 for about a day \u2014 but mostly, I was angry.\n\nThat night, I called him, confronted him, and then broke up with him. \nHe played dumb, kept saying he knew nothing about it and I should have talked about it.\nBut he never apologized for what he did. Just for \"what I felt he did\".\nI was disgusted and furious.\n\nLater that night, while I was crying myself to sleep, Will called, and I told him what had happened.\nHe was so kind and caring\u2014he comforted me, helped me calm down, and validated my feelings.\n\nI fell asleep with him on the phone.\n\nI know this was long, but I needed to explain why I moved on so fast. I don\u2019t love my ex at all from the moment I texted Anne. It was like a switch flipped. \nI went from loving him to feeling nothing but hate and disgust in about two hours.\n\nAnd I admit that Will was part of why I broke up\u2014not because I wanted to be with him, but because he showed me what genuine affection feels like.\n\nI never told Will I had feelings for him before breaking up, but I did tell him he was a good person and that I liked him in general.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Will and I started dating. At first, we planned to just talk and be very close friends until I felt 100% over the anger and hurt, but it just happened.\n\nHe took a train at 5 AM to be with me when my cat was diagnosed with cancer. He hugged me, made me watch a movie to take my mind off of it, shared stories about his old cat that had the same illness, and told me to cherish every moment I had with her.\n\nIn that moment, I knew he was the person I wanted to be with. That was the kind of care and emotional maturity I had always looked for in a partner.\n(Of course there was more, but that was an important moment for me)\n\nSo, we officially started dating shortly after.\n\n(For those wondering, my cat is still okay. She\u2019s a fighter. Even though the tumor can\u2019t be operated on, we\u2019re making sure she has the best possible quality of life with the help of our vet. She\u2019s had a great 14 years so far, and we want to keep it that way. She and her brother are getting lots of cuddles and treats.)\n\nSo\u2026 I know this was long and messy, but the point is: my ex has been going around asking about me and Will, and I hate that he gets to think of himself as the victim.\nI may have made mistakes, but his actions were malicious.\n\nI also really regret letting all of that happen. I used to think I knew how to spot a toxic partner, but I let him do his thing without noticing.\n\nI just wanted to vent.\nThank you for bearing with me, and sorry for any mistakes. ",

We used to be extremely close, and always teased each other jokingly. \n\nBut since reconnecting with them, I've just been feeling a lot more sensitive to their comments? It feels silly as I know they don't mean anything bad by their words, but I just find myself wondering if they even really like me as a person or if they're judging me.\n\nCouple of examples: I have pet cats and this friend knows I love them. They've never liked cats, which is fine. They sent over a funny video of a cat, but that somehow devolved into them telling me how much they hate cats, and talking about how they also thought cats made their owners bitches, etc... I just tried to brush it off and joke back, defending my stance on cats a little bit. This isn't the first time I've had to hear about someone's grievances with cats, but it's just such a conversation killer for me. Like cool, you hate the animals I happen to really like. I am so glad you have given me this reminder lol.\n\nThe other thing that bothered me a bit was just a comment that made me feel like they thought I was immature. I said something like \"Oh this slaps\" and they immediately said \"Don't say that, you're 31.\" It's such a small thing but I guess I've always been a bit anxious about seeming \"mature\" enough to people, so it did sting a bit. \n\nI imagine a lot of this is just my own anxieties getting the best of me, as well as the fact that it's been so long that we're almost strangers in a lot of ways. I guess I don't really know what they think do me anymore. \n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading! \ud83d\ude05  \n\n",

    "selftext": "I have a few friends who are very close to their parents and they know their parents love them and are their #1 biggest fan no matter what they do. It\u2019s very fascinating to witness, and simultaneously upsetting because I can\u2019t help but compare it to my own situation.\n\nMy parents have never been the affectionate, loving type but I didn\u2019t realize just how little they cared for me until I moved out of the family home before marriage. Coming from a very conservative Muslim culture this is looked down on, because people assume you are living away from your family as a single woman to do haram (forbidden) activities in the religion. However I just wanted to have my own space and be independent, that\u2019s all. My parents did not take it well, my mother told me I was selfish and deserve everything bad in life for abandoning them.\n\nThis was over a year ago and the relationship is still quite strained. I\u2019ve called a few times since and my mother was super rude and irritated like I was bothering her for calling her. So I stopped, and I haven\u2019t spoken to my family in a few months. I\u2019m not sure how you can claim to love your child and practically disown them for wanting to live their own lives. So I know now I am not loved by them.\n\nIt\u2019s really sad to not receive unconditional love from your parents because you will never get unconditional love anywhere else. Not from friends, not even from your spouse. You will forever feel unloved and worthless. Most relationships are fickle and very conditional. You family is meant to be your rock. But I have none.\n\nSometimes I wonder why I am even in this world.",

    "selftext": "I've only told maybe 2 people for my entire life about this, but it's been weighing on me recently. I feel like I need to just shout to the void about it.\n\nI(28M) befriended one of my teachers when I was 14. At the time, he was 35. For more background, I was F at the time (now FtM). He was my middle school teacher and when I switched schools, I added him on Facebook. It wasn't until around my freshman year of high school that we really started to talk. \n\nAt first, I basically harassed him, sending him messages daily, until he started to reply and it became conversational. After about a year, we began messaging each other daily. It was never anything inappropriate; we mainly talked about games, music, art, daily life, etc. (normal friendly type conversation). We never hung out or met up or anything. The only time I saw him after he was my teacher was one time at a school event.\n\nI lived in an abusive home and was a very lonely kid. I always figured he sensed that and that I just needed/wanted someone to talk to who actually cared. He became what I still consider to be my best friend at the time. I eventually started to have feelings for him because of this. I still remember telling him how I felt, and him saying something along the lines of \"I'm very flattered, but that's not appropriate\". The conversation dwindled a bit after that, but some time passed and we picked back up our daily conversations.\n\nOne morning, I woke up to see my father on my computer, snooping through my messages with this former teacher. I freaked out and told him this. We ended up exchanging numbers and started texting because of this. \n\nA while went by (a few months, if I remember right), we continued our friendship and daily conversations. Something happened and my parents took my phone (I can't exactly remember why they took it). I went to lunch with a friend one day, and when I got home, both of my parents were there and I knew something was wrong (they divorced and hated each other). They confronted me about my teacher and I's friendship, saying they \"[knew] everything\". My father had texted him through my phone, telling him to cease contact and threatening to report him to the school board if he ever tried talking to me again. I was heartbroken hearing this and knowing I'd never speak to him again. My parents claim he was \"grooming\" me, but I never felt that way. He felt more like a dad or an uncle, and treated me almost as his kid. Plus, as mentioned before, I basically harassed this man into talking to me. I always got the feeling he just kind of felt bad for me, especially looking back on our conversations and this situation as an adult.\n\nI never spoke with him again after that. It was somewhat of a traumatic experience for me, but only because someone I really cared about just suddenly vanished from my life and I felt as though I had nearly ruined his life because I was a lonely kid. The loss I experienced changed me as a person and the way I view all relationships.\n\nI still think of him often. I want to reach out and ask him how he is, and tell him how sorry I am for putting him in such a bad situation. It's just been so long and I don't want to dredge up the past, especially when I'm sure it was also traumatic for him. \n\nI don't know how to move on when it ended so abruptly and so badly. I have dreams of running into him on the street and getting my opportunity to tell him I'm sorry and hear how he dealt with things afterward. ",

She has called multiple ambulance this year and each time they kick her out the hospital because there's nothing wrong with her! The last she went, she called cause she thought she was having a stroke but texted me to bring her tablet to the hospital. When I got to the hospital i told her \"people who are actually sick don't care about having their tablets.\" This caused her to snap at me about not caring about her. \n\nToday, she left her tablet open in my dad's office (they are divorced but live together for now) and I saw her messages with her online boyfriend. He's talking about visiting her and they're saying I love you but she's never met this man! It's always the same damn story too: Military man, has a young child, and they are stationed aboard. Can she be that gullible to keep believing it?? \n\nI get it. She an adult (56) but my mom does not seem mentally sound. She has lost countless bank accounts talking to these online boyfriends! She once gave one $700 to \"invest\" in his business and he ghosted her, all while demanding my dad help her pay for medication. She's constantly \"falling\", which is her throwing herself to the ground. She did it in front of my cousin once and she [my cousin] said she didn't want to come over anymore because my mother was irritating. She is the reason one of my sisters rarely comes around and my other sister is NC with her! \n\nEverything is everyone else's fault! I'm so frustrated because she's not understanding the urgency! My dad is not staying in this apartment and finally moving on with his life while her credit is in the shitter! She's barely at work! She spends most of her money on door dash and shitty shit from Temu!

    "selftext": "My husband wanted a dog, and I had never had one before. I\u2019ve had plenty of pets in the past: cats, rabbits, and fish, and I loved each one of them deeply. So, we decided to get a dog.\n\nHe did the work of finding the exact dog he wanted, and we drove three hours to adopt her. Even though he took on most of the feeding, exercising, playing, and training, she bonded to me. The bond feels like an obsession. When I\u2019m around, my husband doesn\u2019t exist to her. She never wants to be more than three feet away from me, and often, she\u2019s touching me.\n\nWhen I need a break, I go into the bedroom and shut the door. She just sits outside, waiting. I can put her in the office with my fianc\u00e9 on the other side of the house, and then go to the bedroom and shut the door. But she waits at the office door, whining and whimpering. My husband tries to interact with her, but she doesn\u2019t care. She just wants me. And I can\u2019t handle this level of attention. You can take her outside, but if she knows I\u2019m inside, she won\u2019t leave the door. If I leave, she panics. A few minutes later, she calms down and does her own thing. She never bothers my husband this much.\n\nI\u2019ve heard mothers talk about feeling \u201ctouched out\u201d with toddlers, and that\u2019s exactly how I feel with my dog. The difference is, I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever grow past this stage. She\u2019s a dog. We\u2019ve worked with trainers to help her become more independent, but it doesn\u2019t seem to work.\n\nI\u2019m thankful that there\u2019s more nuance in the \u201cadopt, don\u2019t shop\u201d movement. Sometimes, it might actually be better to get a dog from an ethical breeder, as shelter dogs can come with their own set of challenges. My dog has trauma, and that trauma will stay with her for life. It shows up in our relationship, where we\u2019re in a sort of quasi-codependence. It\u2019s frustrating because she\u2019s fine when I\u2019m not around. My husband can take her places, and she\u2019s as happy as can be. If I\u2019m not home, she\u2019s completely relaxed. It\u2019s only when I\u2019m around that she becomes obsessed with me. I don\u2019t get to experience the playful, silly dog everyone else sees because, in my presence, she\u2019s consumed with me.\n\nMy husband takes her to his brother\u2019s farm, and he sends me videos of her. It breaks my heart because I want to see that happy, playful dog too. I want a dog I can sit outside with, playing with toys and rolling in the dirt, without her needing to touch my leg at all times. But I never get that dog. I love her so much, but her constant affection drowns me.\n\nI look forward to when she goes to the farm because I get to be home without her on top of me. I don\u2019t love my job, but I dread going home because, at least at work, I get some alone time.\n\nI love my dog, but I don\u2019t like being around her.",

    "selftext": "I really need to take this off my chest because today I f*cked up multiple times and I feel extremely embarrassed. \n\n\nMaybe I am in my head but I'm definitely somewhere in the wrong. \n\n\nOk so my day started fine with me taking a ride to the airport. The driver, a super nice guy from Pakistan, shared with me that he is fasting and he will only get to have water or something to eat after 6pm. So what do I do? I get all excited about Pakistani food and ask him to tell me what are his favorite dishes from his hometown. Then I proceed to describe in excruciating detail all my favorite dishes from my country. Recipes, mouthwatering ingredients, the whole thing. By the time I realized that he must be starving (it was 4pm after all), I was already rambling for about an hour already. I apologized immediately and he was super nice about it, but this doesn't make me less of an idiot. \n\n\nSo after this great success, fast forward to a few hours later - I am on the plane, seated near  the back, squeezed into the middle seat. We are about to depart, the plane is on the move and I realize that my seatbelt gets loose without me lifting the little lever thingy. I ask for assistance and the flight attendant tells me \"Don't worry, the seatbelt will work later\". So I ask him \"How is this possible...?\", thinking that I really don't do well during flights, that I used to get panic attacks, that I managed to control after a lot of therapy and &lt;&lt;OMG I am about to fly and if something happens I will break my neck crashing on the roof of the plane!!!&gt;&gt;. \n\n\nHe sighs, then tells me he will replace the belt and goes away. Comes back after a minute or so and he says that the plane needs to depart and that there is no time, they will need to move me. There is quickly some commotion, all the flight attendants make some signals to each other and they find me a free row at the front. So I thank them profoundly, I apologize for the last minute chaos that I caused and go to my new princess seat, but the window with extra legroom that I didn't pay for. I sit down, I put the seatbelt on.... and I realize that the new seatbelt ALSO gets loose if I push the metal thing! I test it out a little bit and then it hits me. If I just pull the belt, it stays locked. If I put my finger under the metallic thing and push slightly it gets loose. So that means that I did all this.... for no reason.\n\nI close my eyes and start thinking that it can't be that I'm so inconsiderate today. And how embarrassing. Meanwhile I'm doing my breathing exercises trying to relax. There is turbulence today and my mouth is dry, I can't handle it anymore. I open my eyes and soon as I see the flight attendant handing out chocolates, I ask for some water. She says \"I will check if we still have\", and I'm thinking \"Oh wow, how strange! It can't be that they don't have at least one bottle\". Quickly she comes back, hads me one and finally I drink some water. \"Finally I can try to relax\", I'm thinking. Then I realize must have dropped the chocolate she gave me. I start looking around and then I look to my left and I freeze. On the seat next to me there is yet another water bottle that the flight attendants must have left for me while I was trying to \"breathe iiiiin, hooooold, exhaaale, the plane is safe the plane is safe the plane is safe\".\n\nSo that's it. This is another successful day. I am sitting here patiently, writing this to distract myself and I think I will post as soon as we land. \n\n\nThank you for listening to my rambling dear reader &lt;3",

    "selftext": "The way \"life\" taught me about sex. Not my mom or dad, or a sex ed teacher. But life.\n\nLet's keep in mind that as humans we have an innate instinct to procreate.\n\nMy dad used to babysit me while my mom would go to work. He would put Asian music videos on in the living room and I would sing and dance to the songs all day long. I was 4. I was a sociable outspoken singing daddy's girl and I loved people because they would dote on me. What I'm really trying to say here is, at 4, I could recognize humans and human beings.\n\nMy dad took me over to his buddy's house. His buddy had two sons. One was about 7 and the other son was about 4 as well. While he and his buddies were hanging out downstairs, the older boy (7) showed me a book his dad had of naked people in all sorts of sexual positions, kind of like a Kama Sutra. He proceeded to usher me into a closet and took off all my clothes. My dad found me naked in the closet and helped me put all my clothes back on and we went home.\n\nAt around 5 years old, I woke up one morning and looked around. My little brother was sleeping in a separate bed in the same room as me. As you know and as I have mentioned above, I loved watching TV because of the music videos, and because of Barney and other things I would watch on TV. So this somber morning, I woke up, walked to my parents room and they were sleeping and I didn't want to wake them up. I walked back to my room where my brother was sleeping. We had a TV in our room and laying around on the floor were a VHS tapes. So I picked one up and popped it in. It was a porn tape. I remembered the naked people from the book that one kid had showed me and this porn tape had the same people. Naked and actively doing things. I somehow knew it was bad. So I turned down the volume, and I watched the whole thing instead of taking out the VHS. Let's just say, curiosity killed the cat and I was the very curious kitten.\n\nThen around the same year, at 5 years old, I was molested by my uncle. He was living in the same house as us in the basement. It happened (to my memory) one time and one time only. I knew what had happened to me the moment it happened. I knew something bad had happened to me, and I knew what sex was but I just didn't know the exact words for what everything was.\n\nThat is my 7-layor carrot cake story. Not exactly 7 layers but it just seems that bad things of a sexual nature kept making its way into my very short life and I came out on the other side too knowing, and too knowledgable way too soon. Every day I wish I had had the chance to be innocent and to be trusting of others and of people. I wish I had the chance to be a happy-go-lucky kid unburdened. But I was denied that. I grew up with no friends at all because of the amount of guilt I felt. The fact I understood sex at such a young age, and being molested, it was like an awkward secret I just kept inside. But secrets weight on you. Even if you don't think they do. It's a physical manifestation and I was not the beautiful child I always wished I was. I was dark, and small, and always was a little heavier than other girls. Because of all those reasons, I still have no friends, I have never made a friend. I still have extremely low self-esteem paired with a high body count.\n\nI'm just not normal. It feels this way at all times. I always stick to myself and I never look anyone in the eye. The shame.\n\nI also want to note, to anybody that was raised around too many males. Just don't. It's not safe for any parent with a small female child to be around that many men/males all at once and even if you \"trust\" them I would say you should always have a considerable amount of doubt and remove your child from danger or harm.",

At 20, you\u2019re still figuring out so much, while someone in their mid-30s has a completely different level of maturity and perspective.

    "selftext": "I(F28) and my former friend G( F30) meet during our first term in university, we both came from the same area and went to the same school at one point. We clicked and became really good friends from there. I was an insecure 19 year old at that time and she was outgoing and active in our version of sorority. I was invited to outings that I actually enjoyed and began to build up some confidence. We both had our share of mental problems understood each other, but after taking diffrent courses we stopped meeting as regularly but she always said that I was one of her closest friends. \n\nIn 2020, I became sick. Really heavy burnout, Crohn dieses and bulimia that made me unable to stay in town. I moved back home and slowly began to rebuild my life and health. Now in 2025, I am still sick, but way better and have control of my mental problems. During the last five years I wrote to G every time I went to the university city, asking to meet up and if I could, I set the dates of my travel after her schedule to make sure we could meet(it\u2019s a 5h drive). Every time she said she would love to, and if she was available we booked a date and time. But almost always something happened or she double booked that she remembered 1 day to 1h before. During these five years, we have meet up twice and I have probably asked her around 10 times since I usually go twice a year.  She never wrote to me when she visited her parents or asked me when I was going down next time, which I realise now was a clear sign that I ignored. I once wrote and asked her if she didn\u2019t want to meet up, it was okey and I would understand, time changes people and friendship does not always last. She denied it and said she very much wanted to meet up and I accepted the answer. Telling me how horrible of a friend she is and how sorry she is.\n\nTwo years ago I had a major breakdown when G cancelled on me again. I had been so excited and when she cancelled I was heartbroken. Walking is my coping strategy, especially with heavy emotions, even after 10km I did not stop crying. I was living with another friend  for that weekend and I fully broke down in the end and told her everything. They had never suspected anything cause I always spoke so well off her. She  apparently told my other friends who all are mad on my behalf. \n\nG sent me a snap in May 2024, with the caption \u201dIn exactly one year we are getting married\u201d with a picture on her fianc\u00e9. I congratulated her, but I had no idea about their engagement before that. I decided to one last try and asked her of a time during the summer we could meet up, with my vacation weeks in mind. She responded and we decided a week  were she was free, for details to be determined later. As it approached I wrote 1 week before and told her the days, no response. When I finally was at the hotell I wrote again and told her how long I was there and times when I was booked. My friends were a bit angry at me for trying again but I said that this will be the last time. \n\nOne day after I came home from the trip she responded with how sorry she was for not answering. I had enough and told her how I felt through the years, I was nice and civile even said I should have brought it up earlier and not just unload it all now, even asked my friends to read before sending. G answered and told me she understood why I felt like that, I ended it with that if she wanted to meet, she would have to text or call me now, cause I was tired of this being so one sided.\n\nGuess what - not heard from her since. Now I see pictures from the wedding preparations like the baccalaureate and dress fitting and I feel so sad. Probably I had a delusion hope deep inside that I would get an invite and that she would text me. This quenching the last hope of ever being friends again and telling me how little I meant and what friends mattered to her. \n\nMy friends supports my feelings even my boyfriend, but I just feel like I never meant anything. If they are real friends they will make time for you, I know, but in my head I go through all those memories and just wonder if I could have done anything different. Been a better friend, written more, called or if I just was the burden I always was scared of being, also wishing I not been so delusional and naive. \n\nSorry for the long post\u2764\ufe0f",

    "selftext": "Hi... this is my first reddit post and I need to get these feelings  off my chest. I just feel so angry and I hate it.\n\nContext -&gt; So around a year and three ish four months ago, my father had died in hospital. All shocking and scary times for me and my mom. I was 16 at the time. So I was quite affected and so was my mom. We mourned for quite some time after his death. And we went through a rough patch for a few months before we recovered.\n\nSo this is where the story starts, my mother began chatting and dating around. To which I was fine with, as I was happy she wasn't mourning over my dad and was healing. \n\nShe dated a one or two guys before she found this guy Bill (not real name) who works as a driver. They started dating and shit. And I was quite okay with it. Despite for a few times I was annoyed and irritated at him.\n\nFor starters, my mom would never tell me if he  was coming over. And normally when I'd wake up in the morning he'd be in the kitchen with my mom drinking coffee. This kinda annoyed me. I didn't like this stranger enter my house where my father once lived. I hated sharing my private personal space with this stranger. I hated and still hate his presence in my house. \n\nHe is quite annoying as a person, his like a kid. Extremely curious and neat picking. He laughs in a weird manner not a proper laugh. He acts childish at times. He's obsessed with my pet budgie named tim (not real name) but he doesn't know how to hold him properly. He constantly stresses my bird out. Which i hate.\n\nAnyways, I always felt like my mother moved on way to quickly from my father. And I quite hate it. I'm aware it's her life and she can do whatever. And that she's healing.. but it's hurts  seeing her do things she never do with my father. My father wasn't physically the most affectionate as in ways of kissing or holding hands. But he loved me and my mom in his own ways. My mom truly loved my dad. \n\nI don't know how to describe the emotions I'm feeling. It's difficult to explan everything. I just don't like him and I hate his presence in my home. I hate him touching things inside my house. I find him irritating at times and annoying. I feel these angry feelings. \n\nI hate the fact I don't have mother daughter time with my mother. As Bill comes over to sleep over like... 3ish to 4 days a week. Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday. I quite missing going out with my mom on Saturday shopping or in town. But now as bill sleeps over in Saturday he spends his day off, Sundays with us. And I hate that.\n\nEvery time I plan something with my mom on Sunday, he always has to crash our daughter mother time. I hate him kissing my mom. Being all lovely dovey. I'm happy for her healing and being happy with someone. \n\nBut it's not the same as it was.  I miss my dad\n\nEdit - forgot to mention, my mom literally babies him. Every time he comes over, she cooks all the time. She never has a second to herself. ",

    "selftext": "Hello guys. I really have to get this off my shoulders so i decided to make this post on here. already appreciate you guys for reading it. \n\nSo, i am M/22 and my gf is the same age, we are together since three years now and everything did go well for the most part. The thing is, i am an absolute introvert and probably suffer from social anxiety. I hate to go to places where a lot of people are, i cannot eat when a lot of people are around me and i just get exhausted and overwhelmed so fast. this makes my life really hard tbh, and its even harder because i cant understand why i feel that way. like i was grown up in a great, lovingly household, have a good job, and i am basically just a normal guy, who should not complain about his life. However my gf knows all those things and we talk about it and all, she also tells me shes there for me and just tries to help me out as much as she can. \n\n  \nAnd then there was this situation yesterday, it was the 20th birthday of her brother (who is also a really close friend of mine) and he was throwing a party with approximately 40 people. and what can i say, i felt like absolute shit the whole week, my anxiety hit rock bottom and i felt like i couldnt handle it. the night before the party i had a fucking panic attack while falling asleep. So i was talking to my gf, talking about how i feel and how i am getting the worst anxiety ever and so on.. she then tried to make me feel less anxious, she told me she is there for me the whole evening, she wont let me be alone and stuff and idk just trying to pick me up. (thats also one thing, like i feel giga weak in those situations, why cant i handle such things, shouldnt i be the one protecting her? however i am also really insecure about myself). \n\n  \nThe party was on saturday 19;00, in a bar. my heart was racing all day. i tried to calm myself down with playing some video games, some csgo and some league, but nothing really helped. So at around 18:30 i left home and was driving to the party. you can imagine how i felt. when i arrived, we were in a group of maybe 5 people (i really didnt know many people there, maybe like 3 or 4). then i went to the wc, to calm down a bit and when i cam back my gf was grouping with her friend, the other people i knew where also with their other friends, and suddenly i find myself standing in this bar, alone, trying to talk to some people i didnt even know, just to make it less akward. it was my personal hell. However, i couldnt just go to my gf and her friends, because i would have felt ultra weird, when being the only guy there coming out of nowhere. i would have appreciated it so much, if she would have came up the me and just would be on my site. but she didnt. she didnt the whole evening. like in 8 hours, she wasnt coming up to me once. one time she was looking at me, she wanted to ask me if everything was okay by signaling it, i was shaking my head and telling her no nothing is ok, and then she turned around and did go somewhere else. like why? i dont understand that. i feel like the biggest loser on this earth, my feelings are ultra hurt and i cant stop thinking about it. i could have never done it like this if roles were switched. maybe i am overreacting, but honestly i dont think so. like why do i even tell her how i felt like shit because of this party. should i have just came up to her and her friends? idk. i still think it would have been easier for her to come pick me up, then for me to go to them. especially when she knows how i felt. \n\n  \nidk, this evening made me just feel like absolute shit, i feel hurt as hell, i could literally start to cry right now. Why do i have to be such an insecure and anti social person, i just dont get it. however, now i am here, sitting at my pc, listening to music and writing this down. idk if anybody will even read this, but if so, sorry if my english is not the yellow from the egg, but i tried my best. \n\n  \nhave a nice sunday evening\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "I am currently in family therapy and in one of the sessions where we were talking about my SA and how it affected us both and our relationship, we discovered that I needed some closure. This meant that I would have to talk to a family member (from my mom's side) to tell her what happened. My mom ended up confessing that she would much rather keep the family in peace and still have a relationship with them, then be with me and support me when I do talk to that aunt.  Since then, I haven't been able to calm my anxiety, I feel like shit every day (I have been in a state of derealization that is driving me crazy). Since my dad left when I was 3 I have always put my mom's needs and feelings before mine, sadly all I have learned during these sessions is that I am not the daughter she wants, that I am always wrong and that she literally can't name 1 good thing about me. It is super confusing because she hasn't stopped helping me pay for uni, she still helps me buy new clothes for my new job, but yet again she won't hesitate to tall me how mean or inconsiderate I am. I am honestly exhausted, I wanted to better our relationship, I am the one who started with the idea of family therapy, but It has become one of the worst decisions of my life. (I appologize for any mistakes englis is my second lenguage)\n\n  \nI wonder if this has ever happened to anyone, is it normal for single mothers to hate thir childern?

    "selftext": "My (m24) now ex(f26) girlfriend started dating in March last year. I had just come out of a toxic situationship where I take part blame. I was a bad communicator, I\u2019m sure I still am but I gained some communication skills. I really liked her, found my now ex, 3 weeks later. I knew it would be a rebound but it helped so much. Especially considering this girl had been my crush since 8 years ago when I had first started working with her. We had so much fun early on, trips, going out, eating out. It started to feel less like a rebound and something of a real relationship. Unfortunately, it came to her moving out of her mom\u2019s house. She needed a place to go, and me with my somewhat trust issues, was scared to let her move in with her friends which were one girl and two guys. She had been known to \u201cget around\u201d but I trusted her more than most people did and had hope. She was very kind, had many mental issues, but nothing I couldn\u2019t stand, I had grown up with childhood trauma and this seemed like nothing. So me with my trust issues, and wanting to move out of my mom\u2019s house as well, took her offer of renting a place together. It seemed fun and I had just started a career job, so it seemed like a good time. Found out very quickly, it would not be. See my ex, we\u2019ll call Fiona, had severe insecurities and drinking issues, not to mention drug addiction. I had known to some extent, but not to this severity. The first week we moved in, I wanted to have a get together party for our first place together. Turns out, Fiona hates having people in her space. She was very quiet the whole night, and near the end, she stormed off to the room, where I\u2019d get yelled at when I head to bed. She scream at me in bed, as I had work the next morning I told her sorry and we\u2019d talk about it tomorrow. She got up and stormed out the room. I was just happy for the quiet, until I hear her screaming my name and yelling help! Help! I storm out, seeing her wrist covered in blood, with it spilling all over the floors. I help her best I can, she didn\u2019t hit an artery so it soon stopped, but left a nasty scar. After this night, most nights, especially when we went out, I would get no rest, being accused of cheating, or just not giving her enough love. Over the next few months, one of our mutual friends decided a surprise birthday party for her. I honestly wasn\u2019t thinking to hard about it, I just thought maybe it\u2019d make her happy, forgetting she didn\u2019t like people in her space. Same thing happened. She was upset the whole night, stayed in the bedrooms and never came out. Through out the night you could hear her screams saying \u201cget out of my house!\u201d In the most embarrassing way possible. Her sister was there, and tried to calm her down the whole night, which did not work. I eventually got everyone out, because the music was barely covering it up. I went to bed again. Same thing, yelling at me. She got up, stormed out. I was worried but thought that it was a one time thing. Nope, I instantly hear my name being screamed. This time, much worse. I come out to see the cut is even deeper, attempt to stop the bleeding but it just won\u2019t. I call 911 while making a makeshift tourniquet to try and stop it. The paramedics get her after the police, which was someone I knew. I told them about how she was saying before that she wanted to die. I didn\u2019t think this was an attempt, but a callout. I took her to the hospital after the medics said she didn\u2019t need the ambulance after patching her up. Stayed up all night at the hospital, dropped her off at home, then went to work. I was miserable. I couldn\u2019t stand this anymore. I didn\u2019t want to break the lease, but at the same time I also still cared for this girl. I felt bad. I needed a way out, that night was my chance, but you just couldn\u2019t leave her alone, she cried and begged me. So we continued our relationship. A few months later, same thing, yelling at me and saying I don\u2019t give her enough affirmations and accusing me of deleting snapchats and sneaking people in when she\u2019s off at work. Which led to a night that she destroyed my tv in the living room, put holes in the walls, and screamed at me in my face. I was done, I left to stay at my friends house. Told her to leave, we\u2019d figure out the situation after. The day after, she said she needed time to move, and wanted to talk. I went over, and we talked the whole night. She promised she\u2019d get therapy, and help. And I felt so terrible, I truly loved this girl, but it was such a toxic relationship. I gave her one last chance. We decided to stick together, agreeing to talk things out more. See, I still have my trust issues, and being accused of things makes me curious why it\u2019s that in particular. I memorized her password months ago, but never really felt the need to look through her phone. I had it just in case. But I was working one night, straight shift. She went out with her friends. Acted very strange to me, and I just felt something was off. I come home at 7am, find her dead asleep. Couldn\u2019t even wake her up to give her a kiss. She had left her phone on my side of the bed. I felt the urge to look through it. Went through it for hours. Finding hidden messages in messenger of her taking to her ex saying how she thinks about him everyday, and that she needs him. Other messages to her OTHER ex on Snapchat, came across it by chance because it had been cleared and muted. It was of last night being very flirty and him leaving hearts and her pictures with her hearting back. Her saying I miss you, and then a phone call about 6 minutes lasting. I called this number, I asked him to be straight up if she\u2019s cheating. He sounded dumbfounded but said she wasn\u2019t and that they were just friends that use to date. But I found pictures dating only right before we started dating that they were kissing and all over eachother. I woke her up, absolutely heated. Ngl this was probably the angriest I\u2019ve ever been. I told her what I had seen. She of course denied it. Eventually admitting that it was cheating but they never had sex. Which I absolutely think is a lie. But I said it was over, and she took it so easily. She nodded and called her mom, got her stuff in the car, then laughing about a joke she made saying she\u2019s tired of constantly moving. All while I sit and wait for her to leave. Also if I didn\u2019t mention, this happened ALL ON MY BIRTHDAY. She leaves not answering any of my questions like why? how could you do this? Since then, I\u2019ve been sitting here, she still left a few things and needs a truck to come pick them up. She just texted me that she\u2019s coming today to pick them up. I still feel like shit, but can hold my emotions together. ",

    "selftext": "My husband and I knew it would be hard to have kids. 2 egg retrievals, 3 chances, 2 transfers, and we have our son who is almost 2 years old. I love him so much and live for his laughs and hugs! I want him to have a sibling, but our transfer after him didn't work and we are down to one embryo left. We decided to take a break, even though I am not young, because ivf is fucking hard on your body. \n\nWell, 2 weeks ago I got the shock of a lifetime with a positive test. We just laughed and hugged thinking maybe my body learned what to do with our son and how lucky we were not to have to do another round of ivf. \n\nBut the cramping started last night, and I knew. I begged this baby to please stay. I loved it already, though it was so tiny, and I had let myself dream about what life would be like with 2. Life is cruel though and once a miscarriage starts it doesn't stop because you want it to.\n\nI just want to scream to the void that it's not fair to dangle that hope then have to suffer through it's loss. It's not enough that your heart hurts, your body is in pain as well. It's not fair that we could give a child a good life and people that hate their kids easily get pregnant. I'm just mad, and sad, and I hate my body for not being able to do this, and I have so many emotions about putting my husband on this rollercoaster with me. \n\nI know reddit in general doesn't like kids, but I don't care. You existed, I love you,  and I'm so sorry I couldn't make you stay.",

I am not massive but I have a community that I could never leave behind.\n\nI also have another job - sometimes people assume once I say I'm a content creator that it's my only source of income. I think people overestimate the money content creators make. Even with 50000 subs, your barely be making enough for rent and maybe food. \n\n I'm known for being the woman of my streaming group, which is predominantly men. I get targeted with a lot of female-oriented questions during streams - sometimes sexist jokes but usually stuff like \"Hey, X, you're a girl so is it true women feel X on their period?\" - just as an example. \n\nI started streaming when I was 19. I'm 24 now. In these last five years, I've learned a lot about myself. Including that I have simply never truly felt like a woman. It's always felt like a costume and a role. I've reached more self awareness and understanding of myself and I know for certain, I am not a woman. Mentally, at least.\n\nI don't know what to do. I know the most important thing is \"to thine own self be true.\"\n\nBut I kinda wish I could transition and continue to play the role I've had in my group. Part of me revels in the thought of just being \"one of the dudes,\" but I know it would never be that easy. I know it will be awkward. I know that I will be misgendered and mocked. I know that there will be people in my community who are supportive but I know there will be many who are not.\n\nI am losing my whole identity, as a person and as a member of my group. I am scared to change the dynamic of our streaming group. I am scared to admit I am trans and find out that there may be people in my streaming group or my community who will not take this reveal kindly. I am scared of all the jokes and commentary that will be made. \n\nI am just scared, uncertain, and shaky. My husband has been a rock at this time, but I'm even afraid of losing him in transitioning. \n\nThanks for listening. ",

    "selftext": "I (25F) was in a relationship (25M) for almost 2 years. It started off very very well, very dreamy and romantic where I told my friends that I had found the guy I had been looking for all this while etc etc. 2 months after our first date, i lost my job and i realised how emotionally unavailable he was, because all he cared about was his job and his work stress - he didnt know how to empathise with me or support me or help me out (for context the city we live and work in is his hometown) but i thought probably my expectations are a bit much because we are so early in the relationship. But i have known since aug 2023 that this isnt right for me. I am going to bulletise the problems:\n\n\u2022 spending time: despite living in the same city, he only saw me once a week, fri-sat, which i initially found weird but adjusted around it. However, because he is an insane workaholic, we didnt do anything special, just stayed in. There were no date nights. When we went out on date nights, i planned all of them, i initiated them, and i convinced him. I wanted to spend more time with him, see him more, but that he told was not possible because it messes with his routines. A lot of his habits and ideas of how we should be were straight up selfish, inconsiderate and disreputable tbh. \n\n\u2022 A twisted definition of ambition, different definitions of meaning of life: He has a well paying, reputable, steady job but he wants to start his own thing so that he is doing something \u201cmeaningful \u201c in life. What that means for us is insane working hours, no downtime, no quality time no matter how much i tried to adjust. When breaking up, he said the kind of relationship i want works for people who have job stability and dont want to do much outside of that - and i disagree so much. All i wanted was someone to spend my weekends with, have that quality time. Isnt that the bare minimum? Also, if he cant do this, how will he ever be in a relationship?\nFor me, i am super ambitious and have built a career in a foreign country from the ground up, but for me ambition means being good at job and liking it enough to login every morning to do a good job. Meaning of life doesnt come from the job as i work for the paycheck, but meaning comes from travel, experiences, relationships and friendships. \n\n\u2022 His routine: he was obsessed with his routines. Wake up at 6, sleep at 10, gym at 7am, work 8-9 kinda guy. Which is ok, routines are good, but what that meant was he only saw me fridays, and called me daily 9:30-10 (he didnt call me initially at all and we foughjt a lot to get here). Anything outside of that was not possible. This didnt emotionally sit right with me because i couldnt trust, depend, rely on him. In fact, when we were breaking up, he told me he calculated (????) the amount of time he spends with me or talking to me, and thats about 12h/week, which is not possible for him right now. What this translated in my head was, i am not worth the 12h/week\n\n\u2022 his spending habits: he lives at home with his parents, earns a LOT more than me, and saves and invests all that he earns to an obsessive degree. He has enough to retire rn, and i respect that. But what that meant for us was, he was extremely stingy and calculative. We split stuff but he just wasnt happy spending - on date nights, dinners, gifts. Heck, he even calculated the transport cost from his home to mine. He even liked to lecture me about how i should spend money, when i already live below my means because i have a loan. He also said that he is saving enough for the both of us, but that never gave me confidence because i saw that as an attack on my independence - i cant live on the money he has earned or saved because it is not mine, he will always reinforce that, and i will have a lesser of a say in how we spend that money. He definitely wanted a prenup if we were to marry which i dont mind, but his general attitude towards money and being too calculative wasnt reassuring\n\n\nBasically, these were long-standing problems which i identified very early on in the relationship and communicated why i find them problematic. However, after each time i communicated he gave me something new to cling my hope on to, and i hoped things would get better because i genuinely wanted this to work. They never got better, we kept on arguing, until yesterday when he asked the question and i agreed - i felt a bit blindsided tbh because he never told me he is thinking about it too. I guess there are 2 lessons for me:\n\n1. To be in a relationship and live in the present and not with the person\u2019s potential and what it could be\n2. To not be so obsessed with the idea of relationships and building a life and the feeling of home with someone that i keep putting up with shit\n\nHaving said all of this, the feeling of loss is immense and i still miss him and have been bawling my eyes out, when it was me who had been considering breaking up for the past year and i know in my heart he is not the one for me.",

(Among other things) \nI knew that taking these tests meant I couldn\u2019t take my drivers license for at least a few months, and that was okay with me. What I didn\u2019t know is that it meant I couldn\u2019t drive at all, until these tests were finished - which is 6 months - even tho I am clean. \n\nMy doctor failed to tell me (or I failed to remember) that I can\u2019t use the license for my motorcycle that i already have. \n\nI recently met a guy who made my passion for driving motorcycles light up again. I was so ready to get back on the bike, bring it out of the garage, change out the oil and have it in pristine condition. I was so excited to spent a summer on two wheels while getting my life back on track - and this time with someone to share the joy with. In some ways it was part of my motivation for staying clean, and having it ripped away in the span of a few google searches made it that much harder. \n\nI feel so angry, and stupid. I feel like I should have known, and I feel like it was obvious. Yet I thought in some magical way that I could keep my excisting licence, just not take another drivers test. I was so ready for the freedom of driving to work, and going on road trips. Or just driving to the store without relying on commute or friends, or having to walk for 15 minutes.\n\nI know it really isn\u2019t the end of the world, but the next 5 months is gonna be that much more challenging knowing I could have been on a bike if I hadn\u2019t admitted to my doctor that I smoked weed. Im gonna call the doctors office tomorrow to see if I\u2019m correct in thinking I can\u2019t drive my motorcycle, but I\u2019m scared of getting my hopes up. I\u2019d rather sit with knowing I\u2019ll get told I can\u2019t drive than be let down again tomorrow. \n\nBut on the other side of things, I probably wouldn\u2019t have quit if it wasn\u2019t for having to do this at some point either way. \n\nIt just sucks that I\u2019ll be done with these tests in September, at the very end of the season.

I\u2019ve lied about relationships. I\u2019ve lied about going to therapy. Hell I lied about when I got my drivers license. The majority of the time for no reason at all. I haven\u2019t gained anything from any of this. If anything, I\u2019ve lost friends and fumbled opportunities. But it just happens. I\u2019ve almost never admitted to a lie. I\u2019ve barely been caught in one either. I\u2019ve lied to strangers and lied to people I trust. And I\u2019ve gotten good enough at it that sometimes I don\u2019t even realize that I\u2019ve lied.\nI\u2019ve made up entire profiles of fake people I created in my head.

    "selftext": "So when we were in highschool, my dad made us quit any extracurricular activities to make extra money and help pay bills and save for our college, and just put into saving for us. Thats what he told us. But He would take whatever we made and only give us $20 of spending money every pay period. We gave him thousands that went towards the bills and college funds and even built a house back in our home country for when our parents retire. To add to that, we have gotten many scholarships so the majority of our schools were paid for. My sister in question lost her job and has been having a hard time finding another one. My dad used her funds to pay for the first half of her tuition but refused to pay for the second half. The cost is $4k. He said he has no money but yet he JUST bought a new BMW worth 25 to 30k. Keep in mind, we have 3 EXTRA CARS that need about $500 worth if fixing for him to drive just fine! When my mom was trying to talk to him about helping pay for my sister's college tuition, he told her to ask us (the siblings) to help. Since I have money saved, I was able to help pay for her tuition but before I did, I wanted to confirm with him first that he couldn't pay for it. He said he wouldn't answer that question and brushed me away. When I tried to get more from him, he started yelling at me calling me disrespectful. This is an ongoing thing with him. Whenever we try to talk back, he calls us disrespectful. When he is with his friends, he brags about how smart, educated, and respectful his children are, but then in private, he belittles us, sends money to strangers, and constantly puts others first before his own family. I guess we are all sick of it and I want to write this out because I don't know if somebody can see his side of things and tell me what I am missing here. Yes we can move out but the economy is so bad and he knows that so whenever he gets mad, he tells us that we can just leave, knowing that we can't support ourselves. He gets about $1,500 extra in rent from us every month from 3 of us but not from 2 of us cause my sister lost her job and my other sister just started her college as well (she's 17f). She worked very hard and brought about 60k of yearly tuition down to 7k with scholarships and is staying in the dorms. My dad has now refused to pay that even though my sister has worked throughout highschool to make that money. When we argue about money, he stirs the conversation away from the main point and starts going on longggg rants about this certain bill and that certain bill and whenever we cut him off so he can get to the point, he calls us disrespectful and tells us to get out of his room. We know he purposely does this so he can get out of a conversation. And even when he says he never has the money, he is constantly sending money to random people and we feel like he is flexing it. I remember I had to stay at school while my classmates got to go on a fieldtrip cause he didnt want to oay the $5 fee. And then he bought a $20 hat for a funeral he went ONCE! He likes to be constantly looked at and it's so embarrassing when we have to go out. And my mom is constantly arguing with him on our behalf. It's tiring and I feel for my mom who has to deal with his tantrums most of the time. \n",

But the thought of eventually having to drive every day for the rest of my life sends me spiralling, I don't think I can do this.

    "selftext": "\nOk so this is advice for how to survive these places. They are helpful, but in a weird way, but it sucks, and it\u2019s traumatizing. But it\u2019s very isolated and weirdly desensitized, so in there you aren\u2019t effecting anyone you have personal attachments to. So first official tip, just make it to your release date, and you will be just fine. \n\nNext, a lot of people coming in to these places may have drug issues, or self harm. When I was in the ones I went to, I was too. And I was put in a terrible place with people on stimulants and benzos; along with a very odd amount of persistence and survival \u201cmethods\u201d \nYou will likely turn to snorting cheeked meds, drinking hand sanitizer and god knows what else. So go in with at least a little safety net. bring yourself alcohol wipes, an extra sock, and then a condom, if you are afab and haven\u2019t had any surgeries or anything like that then this can work for \u201ctransportation\u201d but the condom has other uses too. Not for sex.\n \nPlease don\u2019t have sex oh my god. Just jerk off or something, everyone there is fighting literal demons. You do not want to end up in bed with them, I know that sounds stupid, but two people going through a mental health mess will have a very weird and toxic dynamic. \n\nI should also say that people are going to be judgmental. They are judging themselves so they are also projecting it. \nSo I just don\u2019t think you should form attachments or like preconceptions. You should talk to them though, it will really help to hear about someone\u2019s life the closest you ever can. It makes you feel less alone. And it\u2019s incredible to know you\u2019ve seen these people be horrible and they the same for you, and you will never see each other again, and they know the most and least about you. \n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Three years ago, I met a girl online, and we hit it off instantly. We texted every single day, flirted shamelessly, and honestly? It was one of the best connections I've ever had. We never did video calls though, so neither of us knew what the other looked like. We're both introverts, so it never crossed our minds to FaceTime (weird, I know, but that's introvert life for you). Despite that, we developed a crush on each other, but we decided to remain flirty friends who sometimes roleplay sexy things because we're both not relationship people and and long-distance relationships are a hard pass for us. So we just kept texting and gaming together. \n\nSince I didn't know how she looks like, my brain started creating an idealized version of her and I imagined her like this alluring, confident, intense and mysterious femme fatale.\n\nOne day this girl disappeared without saying anything. Poof, gone, she deactivated all her gaming socials. She was always quite depressive so my mind started to jump to the worst conclusions, I was very worried. And I endlessly tried looking for her everywhere, but I only knew her name and country so I got nowhere. \n\nI eventually gave up looking for her but she always remained haunting me in the back of my mind  because of the way she had disappeared and the fact that I didn't know what happened to her. So I kept thinking about her throughout the 2 remaining years, replaying our last conversations to look for cues, and all of that led me to dead ends. It was frustrating. And it was like a mystery that I needed to solve. Alexa play \"oh whooo is sheee?\"\n\nSo one day, I decided that enough is enough. I was going to find her and I was going to get my answers even if I have to become the FBI myself. I believe in manifestation and law of attraction so I spent a whole night visualizing me finding her personal socials (the socials we had each other added were not personal socials, it was gaming socials, so I wanted to find either her Instagram or Facebook).\n\nAnd it worked! Next day, I went full FBI detective mode. I said the only information I had about her was her name and country, so I used those leads and somehow I managed to stumble upon her real full name! (I think this was the manifestation and law of attraction at play or some kind of witchcraft I dunno). It turned out that the name she had given me was a fake one but that's understandable so I don't hold it against her. Whatever. With her real name in hand, I found out where she went to school, where she went to college, and of course her personal socials.\n\nSo I opened up her Facebook and Instagram, filled with anticipation because finally I would be able to put a face to the ghost who'd haunted me for 2 whole years! And when I laid my eyes on her, there she was... THE SHEER REFLECTION OF MY GRANDMA WHEN YOUNG! \n\nNo, really. Like not kind of, not a little resemblance, I mean copy-paste, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, a perfect genetic duplicate of my grandma in her youth. ...I had spent years chasing this mystery woman, only for my brain to go, \"Wait a minute\u2026 is that\u2026 grandma?\"\n\nI WAS FUCKING IN LOVE WITH MY GRANDMA! FOR YEARS! Years of mystery, longing, idealization GONE IN A SECOND. My attraction to her? Instantly killed. Biggest turn off of my life. All the sexy things she had ever told me were no longer sexy and I just couldn't picture us physically together anymore...\n\nWe used to roleplay fear play scenarios AND NOW THE FEAR PLAY TURNED INTO FEAR FOR A DIFFERENT REASON. Like, instead of \"I'm going to hunt you down and devour you\" being hot, now it\u2019s giving \"Eat your vegetables, sweetheart\" and I'm just sitting there like NOOOOOO, THE MAGIC IS GONE.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that would send Freud into overdrive. \"Tell me, how does this make you feel?\" LIKE SCREAMING, FREUD. IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE SCREAMING. My brain had built up this intense, mysterious, alluring figure, and then boom! grandma vibes! And I ended up in some kind of weird family reunion, yay! \n\nThis is for real one of the biggest plot twists of my life. I basically turned 3 years of longing into a detective saga with a twist ending, and instead of crying, I'm laughing about it. At this point I'm just happy because I can finally close this chapter but at the same time I feel shallow for losing attraction towards her immediately after seeing her. Oh well, not everyone can be attracted to their grandma.",

We're stuck in a constant loop of borrowing money to pay for all our debts, and we've been stuck for years...nearly as long as we've been together. We know it has to stop but then how will we pay for things?\n\nWe're constantly looking through job postings and sending out applications, I actually got a response from 1 of them but it doesn't start until April (if I can submit all the requirements, which is proving hard to do because we have no funds for it...it sucks that you need money to make money), my boyfriend hasn't found anything yet, though he reassured me after one of our fights that he is looking at every job posting out there and stepping out of his comfort zone, like I finally did last year. Our fights have mainly been about our relationship (we're like roommates, raising a baby) and money troubles, that usually leads to fighting about his difficulty finding a job. Some days I understand that it's just really hard to find one, also we stayed in one industry for so many years that branching out now is....hard. And some days I doubt that he's actually expanded his options, because I expanded mine and I found one so why can't he?\n\nOur relationship is suffering almost just as much as our finances, it's dying. I'm barely interested in sex, meanwhile being intimate physically is his love language. He's barely interested in other forms of intimacy, which is my love language. We've had so many discussions to try and find a compromise but to no avail. Most days I think our relationship is actually over, I've actually tried to break up with him in the past. A few times before I even got pregnant, a lot while I was pregnant and a few times after our baby was born. All those times tho he's refused, says he wants to keep fighting for our relationship.\n\n I had..or maybe, have really bad post-partum depression, it took me 3 months to even \"like\" my baby. I was depressed and anxious the entire pregnancy, but he was just so....unreliable. Like yeah, he did what he could to make sure I got my check-ups and other needs but he wasn't a good emotional support system, he did the bare minimum is what I would call it. He was feeling a lot of pressure and stress, you could just tell.  I know how this makes him sound but he's not so terrible, just...dense I guess and pessimistic. I also know how this makes me sound but I was working during my pregnancy because we couldn't afford for me to not be working too. We both know that we both definitely should have stepped up when I got pregnant and looked for a better job than the ones we had, but we didn't. We were both scared, and we've regretted it ever since. Because even now that decision is bleeding into our current issues.\n\nI've considered just taking my baby and leaving so my boyfriend and I can get some much needed time apart, to think. But there's nowhere I can  go. I also have like a lot of cats that I don't want to leave him with because that would be an AH move, they're mainly my responsibility not his. And yes I know they add to the expenses but they barely eat anymore because we can't afford to feed them regularly. We've tried to get them adopted but no one here wants rescued stray cats. Most people in our country think they're a waste of time and money...\n\nI know we need therapy, together and separately..but that costs money...and...money is the one thing we just don't have....\n\nThese issues have been weighing so heavily on me for a long time, but as I'm typing it I just feel silly...like these aren't really problems...other people have bigger problems is what my brain is saying. Insecurities I guess....\n\nTLDR; My bf and I are broke, in debt, still looking for jobs, have a baby together, dying relationship, exhausted, fighting all the time and DEFINITELY need some form of therapy...",

I have been trying to be a good daughter, get good grades, do chores, stay home, not spending parents money, don't pass curfew, interact, talk, always tell them where I am, no boyfriends, etc.\n\nBeing a good daughter isn't enough. So I gave them money hoping that would spend it to ease themselves.

    "selftext": "Sorry for the long ass post. I would have made it longer but wanted to spare you the novel. \n\nI\u2019m honestly just really lost and struggling so much right now. I\u2019m 25, and suffer from a long list of mental and physical disabilities. I\u2019m not really able to work right now due to my disabilities but am in the middle of a long process of trying to get on disability payments. I still live at home with my mum and brother (dad is deceased), and I just found out last week my mum has stage 4 bone cancer. My partner of 3 years doesn\u2019t live with me but is soon having to move out of his family home so has been putting pressure on me to move out with him as we\u2019ve been together for a significant amount of time and we should be moving onto the next stage of our relationship. I\u2019ve tried to explain that it\u2019s difficult for me to move out as I don\u2019t have a job and the income I do get from the government isn\u2019t going to be enough to pay for rent let alone my food, medications, my dog\u2019s food and be expected to save for my doctor and specialist appointments but also to save to eventually buy a house like how he wants us to be able to do before turning 30. He just keeps telling me to apply for work and I only have experience in retail but due to one of my medical conditions I can\u2019t even stand for more than 5 hours on a good day without being in debilitating pain where I literally struggle to walk. I have no experience in being a receptionist and no matter how many jobs I apply for no luck. He wants me to move out as well as I\u2019m being treated as a stay at home mother looking after my mum and brother (this is well before the cancer diagnosis). I don\u2019t think as well that it\u2019s sitting in for him that I very badly need and rely on being on my mum\u2019s health insurance considering I\u2019m chronically ill and it can turn at anytime for me and sadly I\u2019m having a different surgery at least once a year, sometimes twice a year so idk how I\u2019d be expected to afford that if I wasn\u2019t living at home, with no job. He refuses to live with my family until we can save enough to buy a house because he hates my family and well understandably is struggling to even see a future with me like this but I feel like he\u2019s in between a rock and a hard place with the fact that he does love me and how he doesn\u2019t want to leave me cause I\u2019m sick cause it\u2019d be like leaving someone who\u2019s got cancer which is an asshole thing to do. And it doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m struggling with my mum\u2019s new diagnosis. On top of everything else I personally am just really struggling with how beyond god damn emotional I am. Late last year I fell down some stairs causing me to be bed ridden for 2 and a half weeks and in turn has caused me to develop or severely worsen potential already undiagnosed OCD. I\u2019ve never been diagnosed before with OCD because truly I don\u2019t say out loud my thoughts and whatever I have disclosed or displayed gets pinned to my autism but since the fall I\u2019ve been consumed with anxiety, depression, anger, guilt, agitation and panic with mess, things not being in a particular order (mainly MY way of order). I feel like a shell of who I once was I struggle to hide anything well, I cry almost daily and have just started to learn either cry to myself when no one is around or wait for my therapist. I don\u2019t ever want to leave my house cause if I stay at my partner\u2019s house, guarantee I\u2019ll be a sobbing mess when I get back cause my mum and brother always make a mess and they never clean up after themselves which in turn triggers me more. I already am a pretty reserved person when it comes to my feelings cause I think it\u2019ll come off over dramatic to others even though I know they\u2019re valid but today I got proven why I think that because my partner asked me what was wrong when I got home and I spilt 1/4 of my thoughts and feelings and I got stopped with being told that \u201cmaybe you just like to make things more difficult for yourself than it has to be\u201d. Potentially that\u2019s true but also I don\u2019t mean to, my brain just never shuts up which I\u2019m realising with typing this that yes it most definitely doesn\u2019t shut up. The sadder thing is there\u2019s a lot more to my anxieties and why I can\u2019t take it anymore and maybe I\u2019ll just get a diary and deep clean till I can\u2019t walk. I just want to be alone and lowkey sedated but I got an appointment in a couple days on an update to some scans and if I\u2019ll need surgery or not which is obviously another anxiety. I frankly just feel a lot of pressure from my boyfriend and I feel pressure to look after and help my mum and if I don\u2019t well no one will cause my brother and her partner are useless. I feel pressure on myself with my own mental and physical health, getting a job and what kind of job realistically would even be good for me, I feel temptation to go back into eating disorder tendencies or back into my addiction to smoking weed. I feel beyond insecure about my appearance which I know is a vanity and self esteem issues. I truly don\u2019t know what to do because try and take it day by day but I clearly have some control issues. I\u2019m frustrated cause I don\u2019t want to die, but I also don\u2019t want to be alive or at least conscious.  ",

    "selftext": "I'm in my early 20s, and I've technically only had 2 relationships. I say technically because the first was so on-off that it didn't even count as one, plus she ended up cheating.\n\nBut what I've noticed since the that one is that I tend to be overcaring, sometimes clingy and think about whoever I have feelings for constantly, as if an image of her is burned into my mind no matter where I look or even if my eyes are closed.\n\nI've been through some brutal ones where a girl I met at university (a mate's mate but single) was so unbelievably beautiful, funny, well-mannered and smart that it was painful to keep thinking about her until I asked her out but she polited declined.\n\nThe other relationship was when I met an American girl studying here who actually liked me for who I am which was a surprise considering I believe myself to be the equivalent of Rocky Dennis in terms of looks, but with the way I was around and to her I realise now I was too overcaring right at the start treating her as an already long term girlfriend when we just started dating for 2 days.\n\nAnd then, after a while of dating she tells me something resulting in a glorious stab in the heart where she quite literally said \"over these past few weeks dating you has made me realise I miss my ex\" and proceeded to fly back to Murica (reddit won't let me say it properly for some reason) THE NEXT DAMN WEEK FFS so naturally I crashed out and drank a lot.\n\nSo referring to the title of this the one main thing as to why I don't want a relationship is that I don't want to lose her, ruin her life or make her detest me because of how I am with overcaring. I hate it but better to stay alone than to ruin someone's life.\n\nAnd for those of you who say work on changing yourself, trust me I've tried but it's pretty hard when you have little experience in the dating scene because you look like a damn goblin from clash of clans.",

    "selftext": "I\u2019m so lost. I know relationships are never easy, but I\u2019m just starting to think that maybe we didn\u2019t meet at the right time in each other\u2019s lives. \nI have so many insecurities in regards to being included in outings. Her communication is really lacking and forgoes telling me how she feels about things. \n\nOur most recent disagreement has been in regards to travel - we can\u2019t come to a compromise and find a balance between her travelling with her (and also my) friends with time for us to spend together. We promised we\u2019d travel with each other after this year fell through for similar reasons. Instead, I had to leave it at she will go with her friends instead of me. I\u2019m hurt because it feels like she doesn\u2019t want to go away with me, but she\u2019s hurt because I think that. \n\nShe\u2019s promised to do better and apologised so many times for not communicating. I feel like our bad times are more frequent than the good. I want to push through because she is so loving, caring and sweet but I\u2019ve got a massive piece missing rn and if I explain this to her, she breaks down and stops talking entirely. I\u2019m stuck. \nI know I am so far from a bastion of perfection in this relationship, but I just can\u2019t help but be frustrated and saddened by this.\n\nToday, I was sick and quite feverish, so I spent a while thinking back to a past relationship. While I\u2019m absolutely over that girl, I just couldn\u2019t help but reminisce about how that short relationship three years ago made me feel. I do hold it in very high regard because I was in the wilderness prior to it - alone and totally confused about my place in the world before she showed me, so I\u2019m now quite nostalgic about what she was for me, especially now my needs just aren\u2019t being met. That girl and I met in the wrong time and the wrong circumstances to last, but we ended very amicably. I know it\u2019s horrible and so unfair for my gf as well as the previous girl to keep thinking like this. \n\nI love spontaneity and random, intimate things (and I have told her this) but never does she ask me to come over for a karaoke drive at midnight with the windows down. Never does she say she wants to spend the night with me somewhere random. I sometimes ask but it\u2019s usually a no. I feel like I\u2019m right back to where I was pre-previous relationship and I\u2019m lost and so sad.\n\nI want to make things better, and I know constantly comparing my last relationship to my current is really poor. I know I\u2019m focusing on the negative things she does. I know I could be better but I\u2019m so fucking demotivated bc she just doesn\u2019t talk and we just don\u2019t go out to do things. Then a rift forms and I have to be the one to try and pull it back, and then she\u2019s extremely upset and scared that I might leave her, or she thinks she\u2019s a bad person. I can\u2019t say how I really feel because of that. It takes days for our usual fun side to return and then there\u2019s a couple weeks of good. Rinse and repeat. \n\nLong-term relationships are loads of battles to stay in love. Some are so much harder, but I do love her. Though, is it worth losing parts of who you are when I\u2019m this age? I\u2019m emotionally exhausted by the constant confusion and stress of slow and lacking communication as well as my physical needs just not being met. I\u2019m 23, so I\u2019m not looking to waste her or my time any longer if this just won\u2019t work. I like solving things but this feels like it\u2019s becoming bigger than me. ",

    "selftext": "Throwaway account because I feel terrible about this. \n\nWhen I was young (10 maybe) and I got an Ipod. I would love doing stuff on it. But then I got into fanfiction and thus I got into porn (I still love fanfiction to this day). I also was able to gain access to porn sites (Pornhub, Xvideoes, Spankbang, etc). My mom had to work long hours and my uncle mostly left me alone (we're both quiet), it got more convinent when I got old enough to become a lackey kid (14)\n\nBut that day, I was in the mood for porn every chapter (what I now know as PWP)\n\nSo I would type chapter 'large number' and then put tits or ass and then search. I was already seeing gross things I wasn't supposed to but then I found a website and it had adults engaging with minors. \n\nI was aware that sort of thing was bad, but this was written not visual. I knew the visual stuff was terrible and never looked for that sort of thing. But the written stuff?\n\nI just kept reading it, I justified it as it's only weird if I'm an adult. I never visualized ACTUAL real life children, I would think about other fictional characters, not sure if that's better but I did.\n\nBut now I'm an adult and I feel disgusting! I NEVER want to hurt a child in that way! I despise child molestors! And yet I still read this stuff. I stopped when I was about 18-19 (not sure spefically but I know I haven't read that stuff in the past three years and I remember not being able to find the sites anymore, which was good in the long run)\n\nLately, I've been feeling really gross. Like I'm disgusting and I should feel awful what I did! Which I should! It's gotten worse this past year, I didn't really think about it. I still read stuff where characters were underage but limited to just being in their teens (someone on AO3 who does a bunch of Harry Potter/crossover girls stuff and another one who had his own website and was registered on Literotica). I want to cut those people out of my reading too! I feel horrible for what I've done and read.\n\nMore context: I live with my mother (she knows about the video porn thing, but not the written stuff), I'm a college student, I can't drive (I rideshare everywhere). I WANT to get therapy but I don't want to spend money. My mom has actually taken me to therapy a few times (this problem hadn't affected me mentally yet for me to bring it up, plus most of the time my mother was in room, so I wouldn't have done so regardless), I actually got diagnosed with anxiety. But I assume the reason we don't make it a regular thing is because it's expensive. The best thing I feel I can do is go to hotlines. \n\nSometimes they do make me feel better. Once I watched some YT video about someone who hurt animals and I thought I could handle it, but the woman said this man also read stuff from one of the sites I found (I never liked that, I would avoid that if I saw it) and I FELT DESPECIBLE! The hotline got me a nice lady that told me some gentle things that made me calm down.\n\nBut then I read one of the guy's I mentioned work on Literotica, the characters were ACTUALLY OF LEGAL AGE and it felt like I relapsed! Then I watched porn on a specific website for specific kink of me, but when I was looking for something one of the videoes said 'teenage' and I began to spiral. Because of one hand, not all pornsites are trustworthy but on the other, 18 and 19 (legal adult age) could still be referred to as teenage so I was confused, so I called them and the lady didn't want to help me and she transferred me to a warmline (they were nice but they asked for my insurance which I wasn't expecting so I ended up feeling emotionally drained).\n\nIt came to a head when I woke up this morning and I was on my period and then I started feeling those thoughts that was disgusting while my body was in pain. I couldn't call because my mother was still asleep. So I texted my hotline and the woman said my problem wasn't something a hotline could fix, so she sent me all these links to porn addiction stuff. They either cost money or I felt they couldn't help me, because they talked about this happening to men. Alternatively, they could help but my mother was still in the house, so I still felt I couldn't do anything immediately. And it really felt like no one could help me. I even signed up for Betterhelp (though I remembered they had controversy and signed out before telling my problem). So I decided to post this on here.\n\nI really don't want to hurt anyone. I want to put that terrible part of my past behind me. But sometimes I can't help but think about it and feel disgusting.",

    "selftext": "Okay so this might come across as a little sad and bleak, and I doubt that I will get any gentle responses... Might as well be ranting because I have found a haven in Reddit lately. \n\nI often wonder why anyone would like to be friends with me. I struggle a lot with anxiety and maintaining attention, and usually when I offer advice it is not that helpful (usually overly philosophical and impractical). Some people may like to engage in that kind of discussion I guess\u2026 \nI don\u2019t have any interesting hobbies besides going to a cafe by myself and having a cigarette, browsing and looking for jobs to advance my career. I have a very niche sense of humour that can be overly sarcastic and easily offend. I try to pick up hobbies, but I end up wanting to escape my reality via watching too much TV, cleaning/decluttering and spending time with my partner, which I also don\u2019t see why he would stay with me after the initial attraction wears off. I am probably extremely depressed as I grew up with a childhood trauma that I tried to address via therapy but it felt like the benefit wasn\u2019t outweighing the expense and somehow it felt even more depressing as \u201cmy only only hope for getting better didn\u2019t look that hopeful\u201d. A few therapists seemed to make me feel like my system was in a kind of a deadlock. \nI find myself lately thinking often about why anyone would like to be friends with me, even though I don\u2019t think less of myself - I am young (32F), attractive, fit and financially independent. I am well-educated and have a decent-paying job. I rarely lie, gossip and I like to support people by understanding their goals. I like to treat my friends every now and again, but I don\u2019t like transactional relationships. I used to have creative ambitions but quit them and settled into a boring life when I saw nothing was really materializing. \nHow can I improve this sense of isolation helplessness, with years of therapy as a last resort?

    "selftext": "Four years ago, I felt like I had achieved all goals, happiness, and was married to my best friend. For context, I (35f) and my husband (38m) have been married for 17 years. I met him as a teenager, we dated, and married promptly after my 18th birthday. I felt like we had really worked through a lot of issues to build a good marriage and life together. I don\u2019t have a strong support system of people in my life, so it was just him and me against the world. Well, that changed, and I\u2019ve been beating myself up about it for a while, and trying to navigate my feelings, or just ignoring them, idk. I started to have feelings for a co-worker (I know, typical). He has been a friend at work, and is married. There has been nothing romantic between us, and I don\u2019t get any indication from him that he is interested in more. He has just been supportive as my co-worker and a friend, and that friendship doesn\u2019t extend outside of work at all. I have no interest in pursuing a romantic relationship with him either. I don\u2019t want to have infidelity in my marriage or try to convince someone else to be untrue. And breaking marriages for another person just means a worse marriage.\n\nThis has really led me to contemplate my life. Why, when everything was feeling so right, did I start catching feelings for someone else. I looked back at our relationship and started seeing all the negative. I questioned if I was just looking for reasons to justify how I felt. I came to the realization that our dating relationship was abusive (and early years of our marriage). More than just bad, or two stupid kids. He was very controlling, pushed sex on me before I was ready, and even used a sexual act two different times as \u201cpunishment\u201d (that was painful). Anytime I\u2019m alone with my thoughts, I think that so much of how I am today in my relationship with him was shaped by the bad times. He isn\u2019t that person any more, he isn\u2019t controlling, and treats me better overall. But, I don\u2019t have friends, am scared to make him mad, scared to talk about my feelings, am super agreeable to avoid any conflicts. He has been explosive and mean in the past when he gets angry, although that hasn\u2019t been too recently. (Nothing ever physical.) I still feel like a terrible person for thinking about another guy, and feel some blame for wallowing in the past. I think if I would do it all over, and there\u2019s no way I would stay in the relationship if given a do over. If I had a daughter, I would teach her how to avoid this and reach out for help. \n\nI feel like my eyes have been opened to the truth of our past. I tried to bring it up with him by asking what he thought about our dating relationship. He said he doesn\u2019t really think about it, and I said that I thought it was bad. I brought up some things, and he didn\u2019t want to talk about it. He said he had apologized and I just hadn\u2019t forgiven him for it. He got mad, and I got upset and cried. I remember him giving an apology several years ago, we both got drunk and he said he felt bad about things and I consoled him, but I\u2019m just now realizing it was abusive. I wanted to get confirmation from him that he agreed it wasn\u2019t a healthy relationship, just for healing. But there was nothing productive about it. \n\nI find myself lately being depressed and bottled up. I work full time and my husband hasn\u2019t had a job for a few years now. I really don\u2019t care if he works, but want him to contribute to our relationship in some way. Instead he spends a lot of time sitting around the house on his phone making a mess and spending excessive amounts of time on hobbies. And no, I don\u2019t think there is any chance he is cheating. I think he is also depressed. My guilt and frustration are overwhelming. I love him and he loves me, but I\u2019m spending too much time in my head not dealing with my feelings, just hoping things find their place and go back, even though I know that\u2019s not likely. I know I could use counseling to work on past trauma and learn to be a better partner myself. So maybe I\u2019ll finally do that. ",

Or that I wasn\u2019t good enough for them and couldn\u2019t understand why they cared about me. \n\nA month before my 15th birthday, I tried to end my life, and my boyfriend at the time had an ex that had ended her life a few years earlier. \nA week before he had told me he didn\u2019t love me anymore, but wouldn\u2019t break up with me at the time, bc \u201cmaybe the feelings will come back\u201d. I knew ending my life would make him come to a decision, but that\u2019s not why I did it. He did not come to visit me at the hospital, but his best friend did. A few days later I kissed a new guy and a week after that I started dating that guy. And so on and so forth. I often ended it with one guy, and started dating a new one a week or two after. This pattern lasted from 13 years old to 17 years old, when I got into a relationship with a guy who was 5 years older than me. \nIn my country you\u2019re legal at the age of 16.\n\nOn my 18th birthday I moved in with him, and within 2 months I was pregnant with my son. We can call this guy Aaron. \nArron was a drug addicted, alcoholic and violent POS. He severely beat me, raped me and cut me off from my friends and family. I was a terrified pregnant 18 year old with no one to turn to. I left him almost two years after we moved in together. I called my mom after not talking to her or my dad for almost a year. And I asked if I could come visit. I moved back to their house a week after. \n\nAt the beginning of 2018 I moved from my hometown to a little island where I met my now husband (37M) and father to my two younger sons. I admit I tried repeatedly destroying this relationship, he never gave up, just kept on loving me through all of it. \nChristmas 2023 I had a mental breakdown, planning how to kill myself and writing letters to my family. But making my child cry while he was playing with his new toys, made me get some help. I was in the psych ward for 8 days, didn\u2019t get to see my children other than FaceTime, and I celebrated new years alone. \nI was diagnosed with CPTSD, depression, anxiety and borderline personality disorder. I had a ADHD diagnosis from the age of 15.\n\nI started therapy February 2024, and DBT group September 2024. And I have finally started getting back to my feet, learning how to feel emotions again, and not look at myself with resentment and disgust. I have not had a big emotional breakdown or reaction since October 2024, and I am so proud of myself. I started ADHD medication for the first time in 13 years, and it has helped me keep up everything in the house, and following my kids closer. I\u2019m so grateful that I didn\u2019t go through with my plan, and I thank my children and husband every day for being \u201cmine\u201d and that I love them more than anything. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": "I (25F) have been in a long-distance relationship with this guy (23M) for the past 1.5 years. He was really sweet and caring in the beginning, and I talked to him for a considerable amount of time before starting a relationship with him. It's just that I think his behavior has changed compared to how it was during the talking stage and the first few months of the relationship. He says he's a fault-finder and that it's just a part of his personality.\n\nIn the beginning, he only used to praise my appearance, but over time, he started commenting on my facial features (nose, forehead, etc.) and many other things. I\u2019ve had a bad case of acne throughout my adolescence due to sensitive skin and genetic factors, so it couldn\u2019t be cured completely. While I don\u2019t have cystic acne all over my face anymore, I still occasionally get breakouts. The skin on my body also gets inflamed easily after waxing.\n\nEarlier, he never said anything about it\u2014in fact, he used to love and support me despite all of this. But eventually, he started telling me to use certain products to improve my skin. I\u2019ve told him multiple times that this isn\u2019t how things work (since I\u2019ve undergone treatment for most of my life), but he gets irritated and says I don\u2019t even want to try and that I lose hope too easily. Similarly, he made comments on my facial features and said I need to get plastic surgery. When I got upset, he claimed it was just a joke.\n\nI have a very chirpy, bubbly personality and get excited easily. We recently went to a concert, and everything was fine until we were walking back. As we were side by side with his arm around my neck, we reached a narrow space where only one of us could pass at a time. I was focused on our conversation, so I stood there for a second or two before moving. He got annoyed, removed his arm, grabbed me from behind, and pushed me through the space.\n\nAfter that, he started scolding me for being \"too dumb\" to stand there and not move immediately (which I don\u2019t think is even a reason to fight). For the next hour, he kept verbally abusing me, asking if I was really dumb or just pretending to be around him. He even mocked my excitable personality, saying I get too excited to see him and then start acting dumb. He also said I don\u2019t deserve anything he does for me (including the concert, which was my birthday present from him). He kept going on and on while we walked back for an entire hour. My head hung low, and I was holding back tears the entire time.\n\nWhen I had to catch the train to return home, he held my backpack tightly from behind and forced me to jump onto the moving train, even though I was scared and there was a huge risk involved in doing something like this, I mean, anything could have gone wrong! We had gotten late and almost missed it.\n\nJust two weeks ago, he \"faked\" breaking up with me to \"teach me a lesson\" because he thought that was the only way I would understand. He said he had fought with me multiple times over a single issue, and since I didn\u2019t seem to get it, he had to do this. At first, I thought he was just angry and didn\u2019t take it seriously. But the next day, he texted me dryly and told me it was final. I was heartbroken and broke down in tears, desperately trying to reach out to him.\n\nThat afternoon, I video-called him while crying hysterically, begging him to come back. He laughed in my face and told me not to cry, that everything would be fine in two to three months, and that I should just leave him. He was completely unemotional and unnecessarily cold. Each word hit me hard, and I kept wondering where all his love had gone.\n\nHe knows I\u2019ve had traumatic experiences in my past relationships, yet he took advantage of my biggest emotional vulnerability. He knows I get anxious, overthink everything, and become inconsolable. Despite that, he played on my emotions. The very next day, he went on a five-day trip with his friends, which they had been planning since the previous week. He barely responded to my texts or calls while I was a crying mess, unable to eat, sleep, or work properly.\n\nWhen he came back, I decided to talk to him one last time because I was so hurt that I had finally made up my mind to end things. But when I called him, he acted as if nothing had happened. I lashed out and told him everything he had done wrong and how I felt all those days. After listening, he finally realized how horribly he had treated me and admitted that he thought we would reconcile. He had only pretended to break up with me so I would \"realize my mistake.\" It was never real. He thought we\u2019d just talk and sort it out.\n\nI wasn\u2019t in the right headspace, but I still gave him another chance.\n\nThere are other things that bother me, and I\u2019ve told him a million times to work on them. I always get excited for the weekends because we\u2019re busy all week, and I look forward to spending time together. I usually plan for us to watch a movie, and he always promises to be there at a certain time. But then, he keeps postponing because his roommates drag him along, saying he can\u2019t stop them. He keeps pushing it forward until it\u2019s too late, and I end up waiting. At the end of the night, I just say, \"I understand,\" and go to sleep. He apologizes, promises it won\u2019t happen again, and then does it again the next weekend.\n\nAfter the \"breakup\" drama, we discussed this, and he promised to change. But that very day, he did it again. And then again this weekend.\n\nHe has also told me multiple times that if I don\u2019t start making \"good money\" and move in with him soon, he might get attracted to someone else and leave me.\n\nHe constantly tries to make me jealous by talking about other girls, even saying he doesn\u2019t want to waste the best years of his life in a long-distance relationship and wants to hook up with other girls. Later, he claims he\u2019s just joking and doing it to \"motivate\" me to work harder, earn well, and move in with him.\n\nOn the other hand, I\u2019ve never belittled him or made negative comments about his appearance or insecurities. He has acne scars and body dysmorphia, but I\u2019ve always loved him as he is, making sure he feels comfortable in his own skin. I tell him he\u2019s the most perfect guy for me and that he doesn\u2019t need to change anything to feel good or deserving.\n\nBut he constantly criticizes me, mocks me when I express my struggles, and calls me \"weak\" whenever I try to talk about things that hurt me. He says he doesn\u2019t like weak people who \"crib all the time,\" which makes me feel like I can\u2019t even discuss my problems with him. If I do, he gets annoyed, fights with me, and tells me I\u2019m playing the victim instead of being strong.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m just really confused. I love him and don\u2019t want to leave, but I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s good for me.\n\n\nPS: The \"mistake\" he wanted me to realize was that he thinks I need to develop new skills to switch to a better job. My current job is hectic and low-paying, but I have to work hard throughout the week. With my parents' declining health, I can\u2019t study every weekend. Sometimes, I slack off because I\u2019m overwhelmed and need to cool off. He tells me I need to hurry up, and when I explain my situation, he fights with me, mocks me, and says I\u2019ll never earn well or do anything in life because I\u2019m not trying hard enough.\n\nEdit : Additionally, he has told me multiple times that other people\u2019s opinions of him matter a lot. He wants to be \"likable\" to everyone. He said he used to get a lot of attention before developing acne, but things changed after that, which is why he constantly seeks validation from others. He gets upset when girls, in general, don\u2019t give him attention. Whenever I ask why he seeks attention from other girls when I\u2019ve always appreciated and motivated him, he simply says it\u2019s because I\u2019m his \"girlfriend,\" so my words don\u2019t count. He also gets noticeably excited and happy whenever he finds out that a girl is interested in him, as it satisfies his need for validation. I've always brushed it off but idk if it's a concern or not.\n",

    "selftext": "This is the second time in two days this has happened. Sorry for any errors but I'm in the middle of the second one and it makes reading a real bitch.\n\nThe trigger is bright light. Up until two days ago if I looked at a bright light I'd just get this dark smudge in my vision which went away soon.\n\nWell, on Friday I looked at something bright. Don't even remember what it was, maybe the light reflecting off a car, it was sunny. I went into Maccas to pick up a burger for my mother and I had trouble reading past the black splotch. Ordered the burger, scrolled tumblr while I waited. \n\nThe black splotch soon disappeared but there was nothing where it had been. I was reading something about COVID and it was hard to read. I could see only the top third of the C and the bottom left of the O in COVID was also gone.\n\nAnd then I got this static that appeared. This flashing rainbow static. It started moving out across the left of my vision, and I could see directly in front of me but the blind spot was getting bigger and moving. If I held up my hands in front of me I couldn't see my left hand at all.\n\nI made it home OK but half an hour after it started the left of my peripheral vision was gone.\n\nLuckily in another half hour my peripheral vision was back, but augh, it just happened again. I looked at a candle and went to read a book, and oh shit, I can barely read again, and oh no there's the small flashing staticky crescent, and it went and spread across the left of my vision again. Like a ripple going outwards.\n\nMy peripheral vision on my left is gone again.\n\nI hope this isn't going to become a thing. I had a similar thing happen to me fifteen years ago, once, but this is twice in two days. Am I going to have to start making sure I don't look at bright lights now? What if it gets worse? I'm seeing my doctor about something unrelated on Monday but I often struggle to get taken seriously by doctors (yep, I'm a woman) and I'm tired of going to battle every time there's something wrong with me.",

It doesn\u2019t matter how exhausted I am, I end up getting most of my sleep in between classes.\n\nI\u2019m in an expensive university in a first-world country, my tuition is being paid for by my rich parents. This comes with a weird kind of pressure. It\u2019s like I\u2019m living someone else\u2019s dream.\n\nI have no idea if my university is worth it.

Idfk\n\nI have no friends. I\u2019m extremely shy, and socializing feels like an impossible task, I had a girlfriend through most of my first year here who I met early but she left me out of boredom and since my entire social group consisted of her friends (since she grew up here) im now a extreme loner. I barely ever leave the house unless I have to go to class.\n\n**(No seriously how tf do I come from a family with so many degrees in prestigious top 100 universities and end up in this niche hellhole? Its mind boggling to me.)**\n\n\nIt is completely meaningless to me. I do not really learn anything, all I do is put the bare minimum effort in my classes to pass because they\u2019re all extremely contrived. Instead of helping me develop knowledge and useful skills, it is making me extremely stressed, unconcentrated, feel empty, like I'm losing my identity and living the most meaningless life there is.\n\n\n**I was homeschooled for most of HS, I hated it but being here is honestly making me wish I could turn back time because at least I had my parents to talk to all the time and not over the phone?** now it\u2019s a different type of lonely.\n\n\nSo what am I gonna do with my life?

Example he would snicker to his friends where I could hear or throw snow balls at me. Chomp change in comparison to what I was going through at the time. Although it was enough for me to tell everyone I hated, loathed and despised him. For Years and only when I became an adult did I realize that what I was saying about him was somewhat the same as what I heard about myself. Hatred with no context. I've felt bad ever since and even though it's been 20 years I've always wanted to say \"I'm sorry\" but could never find him. Till tonight at 2am I found him and he's engaged and looks very happy.

While I agreed that a new phone with a better camera would help and I knew that he had saved some money, I asked him to wait a little longer (1 month or 2) before making any impulsive puchases since I was unemployed at the time and that money could be used for any emergencies.   \nWell, he disregarded everything I said and decided to buy the phone anyway, and to make a long story short, it was a scam in wich he lost almost $800. To say I was disappointed is an understatement because i told him before, that even though the money was his and he could use it any way he wanted, the shop was really suspicious and it was better to buy from an official store if he was going to spend that much in a phone.   \nIt was really frustrating but I tried to help him contact his bank to see if there was anything we could do and to my surprise they refund almost half of the money, but my happiness was short lived because the very next day he fell for another scam and lost both the recovered money plus $300 ($250 from his account and $50 from mine). I was livid at this point, the car had broken down (another $600 expense), we had no way to pay our share of the bills plus the repair costs and he had to ask for money from his mother (bless her) to solve everything, but we survived.  \nWell, now I'm employed and things were better until yesterday when he told me he was thinking again about buying the phone, to wich I told him: \"no way, not right now\", since we're not completely stable yet to spend that much money and I thought he would be at least a bit more mindful since we're still paying for his poor decisions from last year and we barely have money for bills, but he didn't want to listen to my reasoning, kept justifying why he needed it and I'm sure he'll buy it even though he knows that if he does that I'll have to cover his share of house expenses and I'm honestly mentally and emotionally exhausted, I feel like he isn't my partner anymore, just an oversized toddler and it's draining me.  \nFor additional context: he's been betting his money on soccer games and although he wins most of them, last week he almost lost all of the grocery money :)  \nOur currency is not USD, so those are all approximate values.  \nIf you survived my ranting, thank you for reading everything.",

    "selftext": "I\u2019m so tired. I just woke up from a dream (nightmare) where I was going back to a school dance that I left to get Wendy\u2019s. I was really drunk and pulled in hard next to a black Charger. A few guys got out and were looking into my car and for some reason my pants were down. They opened my door and tried to take my key (I was on the passenger side for some reason), I fought back and they shot me 4 times. They then proceeded to start to rob me while I pleaded and said I would give them what they wanted. \n\nI have so many fucking dreams like this and it makes me terrified to fucking sleep. I feel everything when I\u2019m in them and it\u2019s so scary. I can never actually rest because of them, they feel like my regular life but I\u2019m aware of a few differences but. It\u2019s starting to get to the point that I\u2019m too scared to sleep.\n\nAnd I have multiples of the same types of dreams. I usually end up shot and bleeding out, it\u2019s been in the back of my head, my chest, my legs etc. Nobody takes it really serious cause they are dreams but it\u2019s fucking traumatizing man. I die in 40% of them, and am working stressed in 25%. I can\u2019t do this shit anymore. I don\u2019t feel safe anymore, I have to be up in 4 hours but will likely not get anymore rest. \n\nH E L P ",

    "selftext": "Me and my girlfriend have been having a lot of issues and this was the one I wanted to marry. But its gotten so bad that I don't have any energy left to give.\n\nLast night I had the most gut renching dream about her cheating on me and what made it so brutal is that in the dream when I confronted her about it...she used all the same conversational and argument tactics she does IRL. Avoiding the question, gaslighting me, talking over me when I tried to speak, flipping it around on me, trying to exit the conversation after saying her part only, not listening, insulting me, constant non-sequiturs, raising her voice to stop me from saying my part, saying everything I had to say was bullshit....I felt so voiceless. I wanted to demolish everything around me and then I woke up.\n\nSome people would say I should talk to my partner about this...but the issue is that the fundamental communication skills or at least the intellectual honesty to have a real conversation isn't there...I literally can't trust her words.\n\nI haven't had a nightmare like this in a long time but for those who believe in the other...there was a black cat in my dream (I have some gypsy in me) and I had it in the morning (I'm a Hindu).\n\nWhen I woke up...I was so fucking gutpunched and sick-feeling, that I realised this was the last straw. This nightmare has shown me the core issue which is that she cannot be trusted. \n\nIf I ever had to suspect her of cheating....the next level degree of how untrustworthy her mode of communication is...would leave me completely unsure forever.\n\nTrust is all.

    "selftext": "A bit of backstory: I used to live in the countryside with an older relative and she had a habit of acquiring pets she was unable and unwilling to take care of, eventually we ended up with four dogs, two small and two large. The problem is that every time we would open the front gate to take the car out the dogs would run out into the brush and potentially put themselves in danger, so we\u2019d lock them in a tiny cage for a few minutes while we drove out and then come back in and let them out into the yard. The two large dogs started to get too big and the relative refused to buy a new larger cage for them and told me to figure it out (it was my job to lock up the dogs and this relative could basically boss me around all she wanted.) eventually I started putting one of the smaller dogs in an open plastic barrel while the others stayed in the cage, but she learned to jump out, so I would put a lid on it for more than five minutes. I hate myself for it, but I am an extremely, almost medically, forgetful person. And one day, I simply forgot about the dogs, and went to work, truly believing that I had let them out as usual. I came back to find that the dog had suffocated in the covered barrel. I can\u2019t explain the emotions I had in that day, but that happened when I was 16 and it still makes me nauseous to think about. I\u2019ve had a very hard life, but for some reason I think that this day was the worst day. There was a lot of screaming and crying from both the relative and I and she made me wrap the dog in an old dog food bag and carry it to the car so that I could dump it far from our property, unceremoniously. It still fucking haunts me. Everyone tells me it was an accident, but I still have nightmares about it. All I can think about is how horrible it must be to be a tiny innocent thing suffocating in a plastic barrel on a hot day. It eats me alive. Everything makes me anxious, I don\u2019t want to be responsible for something like that happening again, I want to have kids one day, but how can I knowing that there\u2019s a possibility that they can meet a horrible end just because my mind is in the clouds. The only time I spoke of this event was the day it happened, to various online friends, and then I never spoke of it again since until now. I\u2019m laying in bed and trying to sleep, and maybe it would help if someone knew. \n\nI\u2019m sorry Lila, I didn\u2019t mean to. ",

    "selftext": "I Ran Away from Home at 13 to Escape Abuse Now I'm Trying to Change My Life\n\nI don\u2019t know if my story matters to anyone, but I feel like I need to let it out. Maybe someone out there understands what it\u2019s like.\n\nI grew up with my grandmother when I was little, and she made me feel loved. She taught me kindness, humility, and the importance of sharing, even when you don\u2019t have much. I still carry that with me today. But when I was five, she had to leave, and I was sent to live with my mom. She tried her best she worked abroad to support me. Eventually, I was left along with my half siblings to their grandmother, and that\u2019s when everything changed.\n\nFrom the time I was six until I was thirteen, I was abused. Not just words physical beatings that left my skin red and bruised. My teachers saw the marks, but I told them I fell. What else was I supposed to say? No one would have believed me anyway. My only escape was watching TV dramas. I cried along with the characters because, for a moment, it felt like I wasn\u2019t alone. I had no phone, no way to tell my mom, no one to vent to.\n\nI tried everything to please her. I got good grades. I cleaned the house. I did the dishes. Nothing was ever enough. Because in her eyes, I didn\u2019t belong I wasn\u2019t of her blood. No matter what I did, I was unwanted.\n\nSo one day, I left.\n\nI walked nearly 6 kilometers to my grandmother\u2019s place. It wasn\u2019t my first time running away I even did it once when I was six, but that time, I brought a school friend with me. Their grandmother was furious that I brought their grandchild along with me tbh I didn't know what I was thinking I was still a child that time in 2nd Grade. But this time, I was alone and determined. When I finally arrived, my grandmother wasn\u2019t upset she was happy to see me. She took me in without question. It was only after the third time I ran away that she finally got mad and went straight to confront the woman who had abused me.\n\nThat was the moment I finally felt safe. My grandmother has been my safe space ever since.\n\nBut the past doesn\u2019t just disappear. Even after escaping, I still struggled. In 7th grade, I got dengue and had to be hospitalized for a month. That\u2019s when the doctors found other health issues, but I was never told what they were. No one ever explained anything to me. At least my stay was covered by PhilHealth, so it didn\u2019t add to my problems.\n\nNow I\u2019m 19, but I still feel stuck. I have trust issues. I struggle with self-worth. Sometimes, I wonder if I\u2019m the problem, if I\u2019ve just been blaming my childhood for everything. But I also know I want to break free from this cycle. I want to change.\n\nI want a better life. I want to help others like me. I want to leave an impact and make a difference. And if I want that, I have to keep going. ",
