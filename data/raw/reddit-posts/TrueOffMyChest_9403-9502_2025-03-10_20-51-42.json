The worst part is I'm not even looking for a long term relationship, I just want to have fun and I keep getting burned. I wish someone would atleast say something mesn to me because that would be someone saying anything to me. I'm so isolated and bored.",

    "selftext": "I was really good at studies until my 6th standard. I studied at a really good school near my mother\u2019s house. But then I had to move to my real home with my father, mother, and brother. I joined a new school, and everything changed. I struggled to keep up with the new environment, and my schooling started falling apart. I became depressed.\n\nSomehow, I managed to pass my 10th through NIOS open school. Then I joined a government school for my 11th, but I fell into the wrong friendships. That led to me being sent off from school.\n\nHere comes the plot twist...\n\nAfter that, I was just sitting idle at home while my brother was doing his BTech in Biomedical Engineering from a well-known government college. My father had passed away by then, and I started feeling like a burden to my mother. I wanted to help her financially, so I started looking for jobs.\n\nFor two years, I worked multiple jobs\u2014petrol pump operator, hospital attender, security guard\u2014just trying to earn something.\n\nThen, in November 2019, after quitting my exhausting job as a hospital attender at the age of 19, I joined Delhivery as a courier delivery person. The job was insanely tough\u2014at least 30 deliveries per day for a salary of \u20b98,000 per month. I lasted two weeks before quitting and joining Swiggy as a delivery rider.\n\nSwiggy was fun at first. I was earning daily, spending recklessly on food and cigarettes, just living in the moment without thinking about the future.\n\nThen, two weeks later, everything changed.\n\nOne late night, around 11 PM, on my way back home, I met with a horrific accident. A truck carrying a full load of wood logs crashed into my bike.\n\nThat moment destroyed my life and shattered my mother\u2019s hopes.\n\nI was bedridden for 4 years. My injuries were severe\u2014multiple fractures, permanent damage to my hip and leg. The hospital treatment was not good enough, and recovery was extremely difficult.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t give up.\n\nAfter years of suffering, I finally started walking again. And now, I\u2019ve joined BCA online at Manipal University Jaipur to build a better future for myself. I\u2019m learning to code, and I want to use this opportunity to change my life.\n\nI don\u2019t know where this journey will take me, but I\u2019m not giving up.\n\nThanks for reading. I just wanted to share my story.",

    "selftext": "Edit: i forgot the obligatory Click meniton  \nI (16M) have a mother who loves birds, especially cockateils, she has three in total, until about 2 months ago. two of them ended up getting a little too close and WHAM. babies. Now my mother is overall not very good at parenting, she messed up me and my sister pretty bad. But when it comes to her pets she at least acts like she loves them.\n\nNow when these babies hatched, two survived, and they were looking really nice and healthy, that was until a couple weeks ago. my mother was starting to get annoyed at their constant screaming (you know... as babies do) and decided that they were eating enough seed, it wouldnt matter if they were seperated or not from their parents (they were still being fed by their mother and father occasionally throughout the day). so cue her forcibly taking them, cramming them into a small cage, and not letting them see their parents anymore so they \"wouldnt scream again\".\n\ni was going to say something, but due to being too scared to say anything (if anyone disagrees with her on something big, she gets explosive) i kept my mouth shut. i mainly helped her with them when we had to hand feed them when they were infants, so i wasnt as worried as checking on them as i should have been, becuase i thought she could handle it. aparently i was wrong, she cant, and her decision to seperate them ended up being fatal for the youngest. in heindsight i think he was stressed from being seperated from his mom so suddenly, and so he stopped eating. according to my mom, he haddent really been eating too much over the past two weeks or so (ie, since she seperated them). i could be wrong though. (i have some experience with birds and i at least do my reserch.)\n\nthe youngest couldnt stand up. just trying to walk resulted in him just stumbling and falling over. i asked my mom why dont we take them to an avian vet, to see if something was wrong, and her words were \"i dont want to deal with some sick bird, its too stressful. if they die they die. and plus the vet bill will probably be 200 dollars and i dont want to spend that much\" so cue me flabbergasted, i try and hand feed the bird, at least a little bit. and it works, he's eating some, and putting him on his mother's cage floor, and hes slowly eating some seeds. im estatic, and i think, \"oh, ill check up on him in an hour.\"\n\ncue me falling asleep for a few hours instead, and  i wake up to check on him, and he's already passed away. i tell her, and what does she say? \"oh well, i'll bury him tomorrow put him in a plastic bag until then\" (not really relevent, she buried all our previous pets in plastic ziplock bags and such so thats going to be a nice supprise for the next owner. i recommended that she stop doing that but she still does anyway)\n\ni cant belive im related to her, how can one person be so heartless. she loves all her pets until they get sick, then theyre just another burden to her, talk about unconditinal. and worst thing is, i bet she wont even listen and pretend like it died from some illness. again, it could have been something else but im pretty confident she killed it.\n\ntldr: my mom shouldnt have birds, and especially never should have tried to hatch and raise baby cockateils if she really gets annoyed that easily. birds will be noisey (i know from experience).",

    "selftext": "Hey, so, it's really hard for me to come on here and say this. First of all, I know I'm 100% to blame for everything. And, I'm contemplating whether I should leave my boyfriend. Not for me, I don't want to leave him and I think that would hurt so bad. But for him. I feel he deserves so much better.\n\nYou can be blunt with me and tell me what a horrible person I am, I'm not going to be defensive about that. That's what I think of myself right now too.\n\nSo, me 18F and my boyfriend 23M have been dating for almost 11 months now. I love him, so much. I feel pathetic typing this because I know what I'm about to say after all of this will be quite alarming. But he truly is the most amazing, smart, funny, sweet and handsome guy ever. We have many fun times together. However, me myself, I struggle a lot mentally. It's taken me months on a waiting list to finally get into see a psychologist. \n\nBecause I struggle quite a lot with my sense of self and insecurities/suicidal thoughts, I fear that I have brought these things into the relationship. When i first started dating him, I thought I was doing okay. But I realised that my perspective on life, my emotions and everything is so turbulent that it can change quite fast. It's just lately, it's been very bad.\n\nI get mad and upset. You might think that's normal, and, well that itself is however...I've hurt my boyfriend so much by being depressed. I know I'm very toxic to be with right now. I almost jumped out of his car to commit suicide the other day. He is very shaken up and I feel bad because after that all happened. I realise \"holy fuck I just traumatised him, what have I done, I'm an absolute monster.\" I feel like a monster. He loves me a lot and cares a lot. After that all happened, I was at his house crying. He said we should break up temporarily. But hearing that just crushed me and I felt more suicidal and I was begging him to not leave me. I am utterly terrified of him leaving me. I got so upset that, I hit him. 3 times. On the shoulder. I then started crying even more and apologising profusely. However this is the second time something like that has happened. It's like, whenever I'm upset I just loose it. \n\nI am filled with so much guilt. He forgave me. But that doesn't stop the guilt. I know he deserves so much better. I don't feel like I should be with him because I don't want to hurt him more. I love him beyond words can describe and I'm also so scared of him not being apart of my life. I feel so stuck. \n\nI accept full accountability. I know I'm wrong. I know my actions were disgusting. I want to be better. I'm just so scared. I don't think I've stopped crying since I tried to jump out of his car and I hit him. He says he'd still rather be with me than anyone else. I feel so bad, I'm a monster.\n\nI just don't know what he sees in me and it kills me to think about but I feel like he could be so much happier with a girl who isn't a liability like me. :(\n\nI'm really trying to be a better person for him and go to therapy because I don't want to loose him but I'm so conflicted as well because would loosing me make him happier??\n\nI know that all of this sounds awful. I just thought I should post this on a private account to feel more shame. If I could give him the world, I would. :(",

Pronunciation and phonetics is what makes other languages so gorgeous to me.\n\n  Originally I started learning for the hell of it.

Originally it was just because I found the phonetics of French very nice but honestly, seeing my boyfriend smile and blush when I call him pet names is so much better. I\u2019m by no means even relatively fluent in the language but I\u2019ll get there.\n\n  I just need to find a better language learning app that is free, but anything for my boyfriend. He is my love after all.\n\n  I am also learning because god damn what I would give to be able to visit France for some good cheese. But my priority lies with my boyfriend. He knows, I just don\u2019t think he knows he\u2019s my main motivation behind my language learning journey.\n\nEDIT, about two or so days later; I\u2019m back to gushing about my boyfriend. We hung out together yesterday and he was so sweet and gentle with me. He\u2019s my first ever boyfriend (I focused more on friendships before I dropped out), and he\u2019s aware of that and he\u2019s so kind. He constantly asks to reaffirm my boundaries, even more so when he learned about my past.\n\nToday we were on call together and he was doing his morning routine so I said fuck it and got up and did my own for the first time in months. My teeth are now brushed and my face washed + Moisturizer. I feel so awake and happy. I genuinely don\u2019t think I deserve him because he\u2019s made me feel so happy and is constantly reaffirming my gender identity when I\u2019m having bad days. He\u2019s uplifting and he doesn\u2019t get mad if I tell him I\u2019m having a bad depression day and am struggling to take care of myself. He just makes me feel so much better about myself and my mental issues and for fucks sake I think he\u2019s a keeper and I\u2019m so happy he is.\n\nIf we ever get married I\u2019m fucking doing my vows in French. Just for him. And only he will know their English translation. And honestly, I know I\u2019m thinking way too far ahead but I hope we get married. Because even I think six months in and we still have the same connection and spark we did as when we first met. We\u2019re still just as close and we haven\u2019t fought (yet, If we ever do. I plan to always come at things with communication first instead of yelling, because that gets you nowhere). I want this to last. I really, really do.",

We\u2019d recently bonded again because of the complications I had with my daughter\u2019s birth and the lack of basic compassion from her father\u2026 I had been hospitalized for a month before having my daughter and she was in the nicu for 62 days.. during the whole period of me being in the hospital, it was only my mom and him who would check on me and my baby\u2026 given our history it was obviously easy to just open up to him(to me)\u2026 because you know despite him having a wife for the past 7 years.. we\u2019ve always stayed in touch regardless of who I was dating at the time\u2026 I know, don\u2019t even tell me how bad that is\u2026 well to no one\u2019s surprise and surprisingly not even to mine\u2026 I caught him emotionally cheating on me\nwith his soon to be ex wife\u2026 he\u2019s already proposed to me at this point and now both my daughter and I live with him\u2026 and honestly all I can think is stupid stupid\u2026 I know the saying goes you lose them how you get them, but he\u2019s played an active role in my daughter\u2019s life since she\u2019s been five months old\u2026.. that\u2019s her dada\u2026 he\u2019s been the only man who\u2019s happily stepped into the role of being her father since her dad bounced\u2026.. I don\u2019t even know how I got myself into this mess let alone how to navigate this\u2026. I\u2019ve been in love with this man for over 7 years\u2026 and at this point I don\u2019t know what to do\u2026 I just want to do what\u2019s best for my daughter.. I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m hurt\u2026 but the thought of her losing another dad is killing me inside\u2026",

My dad was an addict, often in and out of jail. \nMy siblings were absolutely cruel. With my luck, I was the black sheep that had never fit in.\n\nAnd extended family was no better. My mom\u2019s side just ignored we existed, as they were embarrassed by my mom. My dad\u2019s side contained addicts who were often in trouble with the police. My last name was literally known as the drug name \ud83d\ude2d\n\nMy mom gave up her rights when I was almost 18 and the family I was stuck with treated me horribly. However, they favored my sister. \n(They put me in a room with no ventilation in the garage, I wasn\u2019t allowed in the house, I wasn\u2019t allowed to talk to people at school, they admitted they had a group chat to talk badly about me, etc.) \n\nThis is all a super summarized version, as I don\u2019t want to drone on. \n\nAs soon as I got to college, I was quick to cut everyone off and restart on my life. I found an amazing therapist to process everything I\u2019ve been through, I have people that support me, and I got a super cool cat. \nYet, as the title says, I find myself sometimes wondering if my family thinks about me. \n\nThe only time they had seen me in the past five years was my grandparents\u2019 funerals.

    "selftext": "So I work as an RBT, which in my specific job, is working with kids that have autism. My center is skewed toward younger kids. That being said, the other day one of our new hires had session with a kid for half an hour. Then immediately after, I had session with the kid and he had a potty accident. So I grabbed his clothes and we went to the bathroom to change. Later in the day when I had another kid, I was in the same room as the guy who had my first kid for half an hour and shared like \"hey! He has a newer potty protocol he isn't doing too well with, I had to change him at the start of session, it can be a good idea to check him more frequently\" thinking it was a friendly tip next time he worked with that kid again. *Spoiler alert* he did not think so. \n\nHe basically ranted off on me about how he didn't think he should be getting the blame for something that he didn't even do because he had already checked him (didn't specify when or how many times, it sounded like it was maybe just once, but with a half hour session, that's not bad) and it could have been from when someone else earlier had him because the other person was with him for like 4+ hours. He also tried to call me out on how \"I heard the walkie call of you asking for extra underwear for the kid and it was made a while after you started session for him\". And I didn't even realize this until now, but I made that call 1.5 hours after I started session with the kid for a *separate* potty accident. The first one I saw he was wet after standing up maybe like 1-2 minutes after I started session with him, and we were right at his table, so I just went ahead and grabbed everything I needed and took him to get changed. So *I didn't even make a walkie call* for that first accident anyways.  \n\nThis is also the same guy who had a rough time with another client the other day and kind of talked down to the kid for going into a behavior. And it was like kind of aggressive. I get working with these kids can be tough but that's just?? not okay. If you react like that to a kid after 1 session with him, you clearly do not have the capacity to be dealing with some of the high stressors this job brings. ",

I've had more family members pass since this first started and honestly I've just been on autopilot mode. I know our time together is temporary, he's bad for my mental and physical health, but he's familiar. So I go back every time. I see him at work and get jealous that he flirts with our bosses and they reciprocate.\n\nAnyway I can't sleep alone anymore. I went over to situationships house. We were intimate, a few times. It got to the point where he was too rough, it hurt, so I said after he finished, \"I can't go anymore. It just hurts at this point.\" \n\nThen an hour later he insisted we try again, I said it hurt. I was sore. He said \"let's just go slow,\" and kept trying. I said, \"No it hurts, yeah I'm tapping out.\" He just kept going anyway. He wasn't listening, he just kept going. So I took myself out of my body and pretended I didn't mind it. \n\nIf I was more aggressive he would have listened. So I have no one to blame but myself. My friends and family are sick and tired of hearing about me complain about how this man mistreats me. So I have no one to talk to, no one to blame but myself. What did I expect was going to happen?

This post is not about blaming victims, but rather about acknowledging the responsibility we all have in our own actions, including how we dress and how that can affect others.

    "selftext": "This is a bit long, but it's also how it happened. \n\nSunday afternoon my wife, daughter, daughters-friend, the dog and myself went to the river to play and collect some pretty rocks since it was so nice outside. We live within walking distance and on the way back, we were about to leave the levee along our normally used path when both my wife and I spotted something on the levee about 50 feet away, we couldnt tell what it was. I asked my wife to take the dogs leash so I could go check, and to please take the girl a little way further away while I go make sure it's just garbage.\n\nAs I got closer and saw it was a person, I quickly told my wife and asked her to call 911. I went over to the person and found out it was a young looking girl, and she was still breathing. I ran back to my wife who was on the phone with emergency services and relayed the info that it was a young female, still breathing, not conscious. I then ran back to the girl and tried loudly talking/shouting at her to see if I could get some reaction, but I was very hesitant to touch her since I could see she was actively breathing. Her phone, which had been in her open hand the entire time, began to make ringing noises and I tried to answer it but it was some kind of Instagram thing and not an actual call, I dunno. I set her phone back into her hand and about 30 seconds later a police officer showed up. I waved at the officer to get his attention to the exact location. He quickly ran up to me and gave her a very brief checkout before administering a dose of narcan. He waited a few seconds and began to shake her and shouting a bit to get her awake, which resulted in a moan and partial roll from her. He kept trying to get her awake for maybe another 30 seconds and the ambulance showed up, they almost drove by but saw me waving at them and managed to just barely make the turn. 3 EMT's hurried up to us and checked her vitals and pupils and in the next 90 seconds they had her standing and eyes open. I figured the was nothing else they needed me for, I thanked them and quickly got out of the way. A side note, I'm very impressed with the reaction time of both the police and the ambulance, they were both on site with within 5 minutes of my wife calling them.\n\nThe next day at work, I mentioned this to a coworker whose father I know owns the trailer part right next to where I found the girl. My coworker found out more about what happened, and I hate it. Apparently the girl had gotten some weed from her cousin which had been laced/contaminated with fentanyl. It also sounds like her cousin was with her, and left her laying there when she collapsed. Also found out she had to be administered 2 more doses of narcan while in the ambulance and that she was only 13 years old. Also learned I sort of know her. I actually know her parents as I worked with them both about 10 years ago, I remember seeing her as a small 2-3 year old kid, haven't seen her since though so I obviously didn't recognize her. \n\nI'm glad it was my family who found her and she will be ok, someone could have easily drug her away down into the trees and she would have never been seen or heard again. I'm terrified for my daughter, who is about half this girls age. I can't believe how close I ended up being to her family. \n\nI dunno how to end this, but I needed to share the story. Teach your kids how to be smart and responsible, you won't always be there to tell them yourself.\n\nAnd always wash your hands after touching random objects. I vigorously washed my hands when I got home since I touched her phone which could have been contaminated with fentanyl for all I knew.",

I've heard that from my dad 1000x before.\n\nLike I said, I'm 15. I'm homeschooled. I live with my father and my grandmother (his mother.) And I hate them. I hate my entire family.\n\nMy mother? Abandoned the entire family multiple times and then dies from an overdose when I'm 5 years old. My dad maybe there physically but emotionally, he isn't, never was. His mother is a poor excuse of a replacement mother figure for me. Self-absorbed, egotistical, does not know the meaning of the word \"boundary\" (she told me once that (in so many words) ME having boundaries makes her \"uncomfortable\"), just a shitty person. (She also called me a burden when I was 11. And later told me my existence is \"unfortunate\" \ud83d\ude43)\n\nMy mother's side of the family is completely mentally unstable and dangerous, so we've been no contact with them for years.\n\nMy uncle cut contact with this side of the family (except for his mother), including me, when I was only 13.\n\nAnd I too want nothing to do with my family anymore. After having experienced my first breakup late last year, and how my dad was \"there for me\" during that time, really showed some true colors in my family. I guess I've been having some revelations as of late. I hate this family.\n\nI want to leave but obviously I can't. I can't get emancipated when I turn 16 because that'll cause chaos. I'm trapped until I turn 18 and can get the hell out of here.\n\nMy father's a neglectful, coward of a man who brought me into this world, a kid he didn't even want! (his own words) and refuses to accept that the enabling of his own wife's problems and his problems has really fucked up his kid.\n\nCall me whiny, spoiled, ungrateful, dramatic, I've heard it all before. I just wish I had a family who saw their kid as an individual, not some accidental prop/tool they brought into this world and now have to deal with her \"emotional outbursts\" or \"attitude\"  I wish somebody would at least fucking understand instead of seeing me as a moody teenager.",

    "selftext": "Since I was grade 3, there was almost been problems all my life. Since growing up in a shitty environment, I used to pray to get out of my living situation. I had crazy family members causing scenes where the police would be called for noise complaints and question if i was getting abused. From beg bugs to cockroaches filling the microwave, I was so tired of it, but knew I just had to thug it out. Since gr3-8, teachers would have to question if everything was ok and i truly wondered if they were ever gonna call cps, but i always hid it. Then high school came around and had upgraded to a better living situation, yet i felt so lonely. I wasn't living with my parents and sometimes I just wanted their company despite the ruckus environment they have always caused. However, although i had a better living situation, that was only thing that kept me happy and somewhat ok with my circumstances. But, high school ended and that was one of the darkest and traumatic moments of my life happened. I realize I had large sums of money stolen from family members as well a spiral of physical trauma from that year. From then, I knew I had to add meaning to my  life so I started working community based jobs and eventually researched getting into health care (specifically med school ik a common dream many teens have in education but rarely achieve). However, I believed i could do it. Now enrolled in post secondary i had big goals and was so fixated on getting one thing, the typical rags to riches - shitty environment to respectable status. However, one club i went to fucked me up (story is in my profile). Although it may seem like an overreaction and a story nothing to worry about, it really fucked with my mental. I overthink so much and made me feel like garbage, worthless, and scum. Now, after all these years I decided to call my mental health services at the uni i am enrolled in since I literally had a panic attack before class and started throwing up in the washroom. Tomorrow, is my first appointment and idk if this is gonna help my mental. Idk if i ever had clinical depression plus i never went to see a psychiatrist to diagnose me. I am writing all of this because i truly don't where to go online to vent. I feel like a failure and wondered if i am ever gonna achieve the \"american dream.\" or be stuck at the bottom of the totem pole. I am trying my best to seem like a good human being, but everything going really affects my perception of myself. I hope I can show my parents I am worth something.",

    "selftext": "My boyfriends mom is jealous of me\n\nHi everyone. I\u2019ve been a long time listener to this podcast and a situation arose that I need advise on. (I\u2019m sorry in advance for any confusion or is my writing is horrible, this just happened and I\u2019m not on reddit often.) \n\nI (19f) and my boyfriend (19m) started dating at the end of January this year. Everything has been perfect up until now. We met each others families, were loved by both sides, and everything has truly been amazing. \n\nFor some context, I am at a community college studying to be a speech therapist while my boyfriend is studying biomechanics and another community college. He was attending a four year but chose to come back home because it wasn\u2019t for him. I am also very religious (Christian) and my boyfriend and I go to church together. \n\nRecently, his mom hasn\u2019t been the biggest fan of me. There was one time where we closed the door in his room because I wanted to sleep and we wanted privacy (I can\u2019t sleep unless it\u2019s a dark room) plus I was exhausted from working early mornings. I totally understand if this is against his mom\u2019s rules and from this point on we\u2019ve kept the door open because his parents weren\u2019t comfterble with it closed. Since then, shits hit the fan. \n\nMy boyfriend and both his parents sat down last night to have a talk. They said that they disapprove of me because \u201cpeople who go to community college are lazy and turn out to be nobodies,\u201d I\u2019m a \u201cfake Christian\u201d and it seems as though my boyfriend has gone downhill. They also think, in his mom\u2019s words, that he \u201csettled.\u201d Keep in mind they\u2019ve known me for such a long time, a month. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t spend time with his parents either. We have dinners where I\u2019ll bring homemade sourdough bread or flowers as a thank you. We talk for hours on end whenever I am over there. \n\nHis mom is a stay at home mom with two boys in total, and since my boyfriend is the baby of the family, I think she feels like she\u2019s being left behind. I feel bad having her feel that way but I feel like the longer they push him to essentially break up with me, the more they are going to end up pushing him away. \n\nAnother thing I forgot to mention, my boyfriend and I have not done anything sexually other than kiss. His mom claimed that my boyfriend\u2019s and my relationship is \u201clustful not love\u201d when in reality, she hasn\u2019t even seen anything about our relationship other than when we\u2019re at their house. Even when I am over there, my boyfriend at the most puts his arm on my leg or around my shoulders. \n\nShe is a Christian as well, she went to a university that is a private Christian school and was raised to be religious. Not saying that my path is more perfect but for more context, she doesn\u2019t have a bible and she doesn\u2019t go to church. I thought if anything someone who is religious would understand that in the Bible it says no one can judge because no one is perfect, only Jesus can judge because he is and he made us. I bought my boyfriend a Bible for Valentine\u2019s Day she she thought it was super weird. I\u2019m not telling him \u201cread ten pages every night\u201d or anything, he can do whatever he wants with it, read it or not. \n\nI know this was super long and I feel like I\u2019m forgetting stuff but this is basically the gist of it. How can I convince his parents that I\u2019m not someone that they think I am? I was thinking about just having a sit down with my parents first with my boyfriend so they could also give advice, but my boyfriend is 100% on my side of everything and sees right through his parents bs. I wanted to later on sit down with my boyfriend and just his mom but I feel like it\u2019s going to take some time. Any thoughts and advice is more than welcome here! Thank you ! ",

    "selftext": "Long time lurker, first time poster. I have reached a boiling point where I cannot keep this within anymore. \nMy wife and I have been watching my best friend\u2019s life crumbles in front of us due to his fianc\u00e9 and her manipulations. \n\nFor the remaining of my story, I will refer to my best friend as T and his fianc\u00e9 as Z.\n\nT and Z met on Tinder during late 2021 and T introduced Z to me and our friend group in early 2022. Ever since I met Z, my wife and I had identifed so many red flags about her. Here is a summary of what I can recall:\n\n1. Z has a habit of trauma dumping her past to everyone she met. Even during casual conversations when people asked about her life before meeting T, she would reveal about her previous engagement where her ex-fianc\u00e9 would beat her in front of her mom, just all kinds of sob stories, her suicide attempts, and generally just all sorts of stories that Z loves telling people that she just met, making every conversation with Z extremely uncomfortable for everyone. \n\n2. Over the course of their relationship, Z had convinced T to cut off his friendships with all of his childhood friends who all warned T about Z\u2019s questionable character. I remember that the day T told his childhood friend group that he no longer wishes to speak to them, that whole group messaged me on Facebook warning me to watch out for Z and that she is bad news (even though they have never met me, my guess is that T talked about me with them given that T and I are really good friends who went through a lot in life together). This is the beginning of Z\u2019s gradual removal of T\u2019s friends and her plan to isolate him from his support system. \nWhat I also noticed is that Z is unable to make and keep any new friends, any new friend group that met Z through T eventually got so repulsed by her that they distanced themselves from T and Z. \n\n3. Z casually bragged to me and my wife that she read all of T\u2019s personal messages on Facebook and texts to his friends even the things he said before they met. My wife and I kept telling Z to be more respectful of personal boundaries especially when it comes to the past but Z did not care and kept reading T\u2019s personal messages to friends and family til this day. \n\n4. T and Z bought a house together in 2023 and the moment they signed it off, Z quit her job claiming \u201cmistreatment\u201d even though she always bragged that the job allowed her to nap in her own office anytime she wanted and everyone treated her like family there. \n\n5. Now that T and Z are a single-income household with T working his ass off to cover their mortgage and living expenses, Z always asked for T to take her to lavish restaurants, frequent trips to Disney parks, even having him take her to a week in Disneyworld in Florida after she left her job. Every weekend she would have him take her to LA for a different expensive restaurant so that she could take pics and flex for her IG stories. \n\n6. Z got a diagnosis for Bipolar 1 sometime in 2024. Ever since, she frequently asked T to leave his work early to come home because of her not feeling well for whatever reasons. Note that because of this, T eventually got flagged for declining performance at his work but despite knowing this, Z still had T leave work early often for her. \n\n7. It is interesting to note that despite always claiming of not feeling well almost every day, during the times that I would come over at T\u2019s place to hang out, I observed that Z was frequently able to drive herself late at night to play video games at her brother\u2019s house which is a half hour drive away and come home late just fine. \nWhat pissed me off the most was that during my wedding, which was the only time in life that I asked to spend a lot of time with T, Z asked T to leave my wedding early because, you guessed it, she \u201cwasn\u2019t feeling well\u201d. To make matters worse, Z wore a white dress to my wedding and my wife and I got asked many questions from our friends about that but we just shook it off because we were speechless about that as well. \n\n8. While she was unemployed, Z decided to go to college for an accounting degree even though she has no goals of working anywhere after. She always openly bragged about how she had T doing her college homework and coursework for her because she has difficulty learning since English is not her first language.\n\n9. T eventually got fired from his job for his declining performance. My wife and I was able to meet up at T\u2019s house to provide T some guidance and support to look for a new job. During that time, Z told us that she already asked T for a boob job (she claimed that she feels insecure in college for being flat chested) and she also wants T to pay for a few other cosmetic procedures well knowing that T doesn\u2019t have a source of income anymore. \n\nT and Z will get married at some point in 2026 and I feel like there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. My wife and I know it to our core that Z is a terrible human being but T keeps giving her excuses and falling for her trauma dumping. When my own family briefly talked with T and Z at my wedding, they have also all noted that Z came off very disingenuous and manipulative. Since my wife and I spent the most time with T and Z, our friend group for the most part doesn\u2019t know as much about Z as we know. I feel like I am watching T\u2019s life crumbles in real- time as Z keeps draining his life away for her own use. I honestly wish I put in more effort in talking T out of dating Z when they first met. I never expected T to end up with someone that feels no remorse ruining his life like this. Guess since I can\u2019t talk to anyone else IRL about this aside from my wife, I am better off letting this out on Reddit. ",

    "selftext": "I've been searching on Reddit for a few minutes and everything that comes up is about raisedbynarcissists, narcissism, narcissism, cptsd, victims of abuse, more and more narcissism. I can't take it anymore, because... this is not my experience AT ALL. \n\nMy mom says this to me, but what I hear when she says this is that this is realistically how life is going to be or is playing out, for me and everyone else, and this is just a factual statement. OBVIOUSLY, for victims of parental abuse this is patently false, but I'd like to see the opposite expressed somewhere, so here goes my attempt.\n\nMy mom is a lovely person. She's always tiring herself out helping others, supporting others, lifting them up. I'm sad and she says she doesn't mind staying awake at night to talk to me. I'm not a nuisance to her, I'm cared for and loved. \n\nIn many ways, this has put me off of romantic relationships. If no one is ever going to, to put it bluntly, coddle me and carry me through life like my mom has, what does romantic love have to offer me? IF it's not pure and unconditional and unstoppable, what good is that kind of love? \n\nI know, I know what I'm asking is a tall ordeal, but still... \n\nI just wanted to let people know that sometimes that sentence is true, and other times it is abusive. But I don't think it has to be one specific thing all the time. Context is required, in my case, my mom is a genuinely wonderful person who only wants what's best for me, is supportive, hears me out when I have issues (Even if she doesn't know how to adequately be supportive of my specific needs but that's for another rant). She's always there for her friends, in practical and more emotional ways, and she takes care of all of us. She's always looking out for me and my dad and her mother and people she used to work with text her constantly because she just plainly made their lives very happy. She wasn't bossy or punitive at work, although she praised a job well done, she could see the good in every person and tried to help them in the ways she could. She believes there is always a place for everyone and just because someone is doing bad at one task doesn't mean they are invaluable. She understands people. She cares, most of all, and she's genuine, and so it is really weird to me to go online and only read about how abusive that sentence is, because my mom is not like that, so why would she say it?\n\nI do have issues with taking things literally btw and suspect to be on the autism spectrum.

    "selftext": "So this story is a little bit friendship drama and a little bit bridezilla drama, but I have been reading reddit stories for a long time and wanted to get my own off my chest.  Sorry this is so long!\n\nSome background first: my best friend of 15 years and I (both female in our 30s) met in college when we were randomly assigned to the same freshman dorm, and we had been inseparable ever since.  I'm talking this women was my person, we did so much together, were there for each other's huge milestones, and had kept our friendship going strong for so long even after I moved out of the state several years ago.  I always felt like our friendship was really balanced in that nobody was carrying more or less effort of the friendship than the other.  I even helped her both plan over several months and execute her escape from her abusive ex-husband, and was one of only a couple of people entrusted with this knowledge prior to her physically leaving.  We were TIGHT.  \n\nMy husband and I eloped in our state last summer, which we had been planning for 17 months prior to the event.  Due to events with my family, we decided to elope with literally only ourselves and our photographer, no family or friends to avoid drama (I had a bachelorette party with my friends a month prior to the wedding so they could still be involved).  About 4 months prior to the wedding, my friend reached out to me and asked if she could come to the elopement.  In her words \"it makes me really sad to think of you getting ready for your wedding on your own\".  My now-husband is a very shy man, but had gotten to know her really well over the years and is now friends/very comfortable with her, and was very on board with her joining us.  Other than ourselves, she would literally be the only other person attending.  To me, this was a really extraordinary display of friendship as she would need to fly to come and it would cost her money, which didn't bother her, and I was so appreciative.  Well, about 2 weeks after she offered to join us and we accepted, she started dating a new guy that she was really into.  After her horrible experience with her first husband (they are now divorced), I was so excited for her that she met somebody as amazing as she was.  Well, this is when the drama started.\n\nAt first, she just asked if her new boyfriend could come up to the wedding with her (they had only been dating 2 weeks at this point).  My husband and I talked about it, and he was super uncomfortable with having a stranger join in.  I got back to my friend about it and said \"no, it's nothing to do with him, we just don't want a stranger at our wedding last minute\".  We had plans to do girl stuff like get our nails done the day before the wedding, which would leave my husband to entertain a stranger.  She came back with \"well, he doesn't have to join in anything we do as a group\", which felt really icky as we're people who wouldn't want somebody else to feel excluded the first time they fly up to meet us, especially when they're the partner of my best friend.  It's not that we didn't ever want to meet the guy, just not last minute for our wedding.  Her response? \"Well, you can't tell people they can't fly to your state\", which is technically true but just felt like an excuse for crossing a clearly stated boundary? Either way, this started the only fight we had ever had in 15 years of friendship.  She felt like \"I just wanted her to be alone\" in my state (weird because before she met the guy, she was fine with that), and that I was being unreasonable.  She made plans and bought plane tickets for both of them despite me communicating mine and my husband's feelings about the whole thing several times.\n\nDuring this time, she and her new boyfriend got engaged after less than 4 weeks of dating.  I maintained my stance that we were not comfortable with having him come up to meet us at this time.  She revealed that her and her now fiance had made plans to elope 4 days after us in a different state, and were now going to fly there directly after our wedding was over.  She wanted our nail appointment and stuff we were doing in the days leading up to the wedding to now be joint celebrations for their upcoming wedding too. Mind you, she did NOT consult me on how my husband or I felt about this prior to making her own plans, and was very upset that I didn't react the way she expected me to.  Instead of being excited like she expected about being able to do stuff for both our weddings at the same time, I was just shocked and frankly very upset that she was hijacking our wedding now.  If she had discussed this with me before just deciding, I think I would have reacted a little differently, but it just felt so disrespectful to make plans that affected my husband and I without involving us.  I wrote her a long text to her explaining how disrespectful this felt, and asked her why she seemed willing to nuke our friendship of 15 years over a man who was nobody to anybody 6 weeks ago.  At this point, there had been many many conversations about her not listening about having her man come up with her, and now about how weird it was that they were now getting married so close to our own wedding.  My husband even asked at this point if we could move the wedding date or location to avoid the drama because he was so stressed out.  This was his wedding too, so that broke my heart.  I ended up telling her not to come at all, and told her she was no longer welcome.  We didn't end up speaking much for 2 months, and she cancelled on my bachelorette party 4 days before it was supposed to happen.  I never received an apology or acknowledgement of her behavior for any of it.  My other absolutely incredible human of a best friend from elementary school ended up coming up for our wedding instead when she saw how stressed and upset I was about the whole situation; I am eternally grateful for her.  \n\nFast forward about 3 months, our wedding and honeymoon are over.  My friend (the one who did indeed get married 4 days after us) reached out asking if I wanted to be the maid of honor in their wedding coming up in about a year.  You see, their parents are not well physically and were unable to attend the elopement, so they are throwing a second bigger wedding for their family in their home state.  I asked explicitly if she was sure she wanted me to be MOH after everything that happened earlier that year, she said yes she was sure.  I accepted despite some reservations because I wanted her to have an amazing wedding and very much valued our friendship.  While MOH, she kept expressing how overwhelmed she felt with everything, so I tried really hard to take things off her plate.  I researched all the photographers in the area, and made a spreadsheet with their pricing, contact info, availability, etc.  I also did something similar with the area hotels within her price range.  We're taking many many hours of research, but I was happy to help out. During this time, I also coordinated with the other bridesmaids to order snacks (vegan I might add) for her wedding dress shopping experience, which I attended remotely directly after working a 12 hour night shift.  I also had already planned and booked her bachelorette party.  Everything seemed to be going smoothly, she seemed happy and had never indicated otherwise.  Then came the \"we need to talk\" text.\n\nIt was a normal Wednesday, we had just had a bridesmaid meeting over Teams 2 days before, and everything seemed fine.  When we got on the phone, she informed me that she no longer wanted me to be the MOH.  To say I was blindsided was an understatement.  She told me one of the other bridesmaids had agreed to take up the title. I was obviously hurt, but she is the bride, so I just said \"ok, if that's what you really want\".  She then said \"but you can still come to the wedding if you want\".  I froze and then asked \"so what you're really saying is that I'm no longer in the bridal party\" (she never explicitly stated that, just that somebody else was going to be MOH), and her response was only \"correct\".  She didn't even have the balls to tell me that I was booted from the bridal party entirely, I had to ask outright.  From MOH to guest in one fell swoop.  \n\nHer reasons you ask?   \n\\- \"I have felt out of sync with you for a while now\"  \n\\- \"You were making me feel pressured to do things for the wedding before I was ready to do so\"\n\n  \nI asked her why she never ever said anything to me if the way I was helping wasn't what she wanted or needed, she just stated \"I didn't think it would help\".  I then asked her why she didn't just demote me to regular bridesmaid if she didn't like the way I was doing things, I've done both MOH and bridesmaid before and know how to do both.  In my experience as a regular bridesmaid, I wouldn't be in charge of planning anything anymore unless the new MOH or bride asked me explicitly.  Her answer was again \"I didn't think it would help\".  This was the last straw.  After everything that had happened with her over the last year, I was done.  I wasn't going to continue setting myself up to be hurt by her anymore and it was clear she didn't care about my opinions, thoughts or feelings.  I told her not to contact me ever again and blocked her on everything after that call.  Needless to say I am not going to her wedding.  None of my other friends seemed that surprised by any of the events above, so maybe she was acting like this before and I just couldn't see.  \n\nSide note: Remember how her first wedding was 4 days after our wedding? Well, her other wedding is going to be 3 days after my birthday.  Even my husband, who is anti-drama, asked me if I thought this was intentional haha.  \n\nSide note 2: I'm friends with one of the other bridesmaids independently of her wedding, and apparently my friend had been telling everybody else that the only reason we had a fight around my wedding was because I didn't like that she was also getting married so close to our date.  Which shows she neither heard nor understood anything that I said to her regarding that situation.  I truly hope that it's just a coincidence that she met her now husband and then started acting like a terrible person.  \n\nThank you everybody for reading, it feels good to get this off my chest!",

    "selftext": "my friend left me, and i don\u2019t want to be here without him.\n\ni would normally never turn to reddit for help but i\u2019m here right now. i (female) have been struggling so much lately. i large factor of struggling is about this one guy. i bet you hear that so much but this is the only time in my life that i\u2019ve ever ran into a problem like this. i guess i can full on lore drop here. i met this guy (that i\u2019ll call steve) \n\nin early 2023. ever since i met him, i had this deep connection with him. i have serious feelings for him (and i\u2019ve never crushed on somebody before). it took me up until october 2024 to tell him about how i actually feel. i visited him at his college right before i told him; it\u2019s the main reason why i told him in the first place. when i told him, he never really told me about why he didn\u2019t like me back. steve has always been a very private person but i assumed this would be different. \n\nafter i opened up to him i was struggling so badly. i eventually told him that i needed to stop talking to him. when i told him that (which was in november of 2024), he finally told me that he was gay. i really don\u2019t know why he was keeping that bit of information from me for so long. he had talked to me about liking girls before so i just assumed that he could\u2019ve been bi because he did kind of give off gay vibes. me not talking to him only lasted like a week and a half because i took a gummy and texted him. i tried to tell him that i needed to stop again but he just kept on texting me and i felt bad for just not answering him. \n\nthis man has been the light of my life for such a long time it feels. texting him was one of my favorite aspects of the day and it was what got me through dark times because it felt like he was there for me. fast forward a few weeks, he tells me about this guy that he was talking to. he told me that he had been talking to this guy for 3 months and that this was the first time he has ever really liked someone back. he randomly texted steve saying that he only had platonic feelings for steve and steve got so upset. he sent me a voice message of him almost on the verge of tears. i told him that i shouldn\u2019t be talking to him about this, but i did anyways because i loved him. i tried my best to help him through the situation. i shared what i did when he told me that he didn\u2019t like me back, and i told him that i would be there for him day and night (which he never ever took advantage of even though he said that this was one of the darkest times of his life). \n\nall was good until last month. steve was starting to act really weird towards me (he said that he\u2019s sorry if he has been weird, he was never answering me despite texting me 24/7 days prior) so i confronted him about it. he told me that he went on a date with another guy. i ended up leaving him on read and he said: \n\n\u201cI was going to send a text to you in the morning, but honestly it just feels more right to do one now. I'm sorry. I was slightly inebriated in my last response, and that's not fair for you. I do just want to let you know I am doing well enough mentally right now. Like am I the best l've ever been, no, but I'm definitely very much in a manageable position right now. I know whatever I say or do won't stop your anxiety, but I want to ensure you that if there was something going on, I would let you know. You are a very close friend of mine and you are definitely someone I come to when things are not right. The reason I initially said I was just \"busy\" yesterday and not what I was actually doing was because I didn't want to make you uncomfortable for anything like that. But it is for the best for me to be honest with that kind of stuff and l'll make sure to keep you in the loop As for the (insert boy name here) stuff, I don't really want to concern you with a lot of it because it honestly does depict me at my worst sometimes. I try to handle most of that without mentioning anything because it's usually easier and I don't like getting people involved that shouldn't have to be. I hope this kinda helps digest a little bit\u201d \n\ni still left him on delivered because i just couldn\u2019t handle the pain he has put me through. i texted him almost a week later stating that i am in so much pain and i can\u2019t take it anymore. every single time that i try to make it clear that i\u2019m deeply struggling, he never seems to care although he\u2019s said that he cares for me deeply. just last week, i had this very depressive episode and he asked me how things were going and i said\n\n\u201cnot well. i genuinely think i am the most depressed i\u2019ve ever been right now. i am at my lowest point. i can barely eat, sleep, or focus. i\u2019m just empty. i can\u2019t even get up and be productive. i don\u2019t even feel like i\u2019m living i\u2019m just existing. you would\u2019ve thought that i would\u2019ve been so happy and excited on saturday but i didn\u2019t even care about being at (insert my favorite place here). i\u2019m starting to lose interest in everything.\u201d \n\nand after i said that, he didn\u2019t answer. as a follow up message, i said \n\n\u201ci\u2019m taking this radio silence as a strong sign. and i don\u2019t want to hear some excuse like \u201csorry i forgot to respond\u201d or \u201ci could\u2019ve sworn i responded\u201d. originally i had a way bitchier intro to this message, but that\u2019s not me. all the times you said that you cared about me, i knew they were all lies. i knew i should\u2019ve listened to my gut the entire time. i really really really wish i wouldn\u2019t have responded to that one message in february of 2023. i feel like all of our friendship has been is me constantly doing shit to be such an amazing friend for you, but you NEVER returned the favor and i\u2019m sick and tired of it. i made you all those bracelets, i made that painting for you, i always checked up on you, i sent you a heartfelt message on your birthday, but did you ever do anything like that for me? sorry for doing so much for people and expecting something small back. every single one of my friendships ends like this. all you\u2019ve ever done is just constantly lie to me, and i bet you think that i just haven\u2019t noticed. \u201ccooking dinner till 11pm, going home because you have a headache, immediately passing out when you go to bed, i\u2019ll try my best to respond to you\u201d any of these sound familiar? i\u2019m so tired of how horrible of a person you\u2019ve been towards me. i try my absolute hardest for you. i\u2019ve gotten out of bed, eaten, kept my grades up, tried to take care of myself, picked myself up off the ground, and smiled just for you. maybe i\u2019m just too generous, loyal, compassionate, empathetic, and sympathetic as a person. i genuinely don\u2019t know why you still talk to me or why i still talk to you. i\u2019ve given our friendship so many \u201csecond chances\u201d but this is my breaking point. i\u2019m so fucking sick and tired of everything. i really hope that when i do end up taking my own life that not a single tear falls from either one of your eyes. i always wanted to tell you that i\u2019d make the sky so pretty and orange for you, but i don\u2019t want to do that anymore.\u201d \n\nnotice how i didn\u2019t even mention my feelings for him in that message once. now that we aren\u2019t talking, i don\u2019t know what to do with myself anymore. i\u2019ve grown so attached to this man and i don\u2019t know what to do without him. he has been my rock ever since we met. he was all i had and now i have absolutely nobody. i\u2019ve been lonely my entire life, and i would say that it got worse when i started having feelings for him. but now that he\u2019s gone, my loneliness is ten times worse. i am seconds away from writing my notes and saying goodbye. i am so picky with who i want to be with. if they aren\u2019t aligning with what i want to do in my future, i won\u2019t be happy with them long term. i don\u2019t date just for fun, i date to marry. the reason i grew so attached to steve was because he aligned with my future. i\u2019m so alone and empty with him gone and i feel like it would be a better place if i said my goodbyes. i don\u2019t want the space if that\u2019s what he\u2019s giving me. i unfollowed him on everything, but i haven\u2019t blocked him. i just don\u2019t want to keep going if it means that i\u2019m not friends with him anymore.",

    "selftext": "OK, so this is kind of a clusterfuck and I need to get it all out there, so here goes:\n\nFor the past... probably over a year at this point, I've been chatting to ChatGPT every now and then, at least once a week. I've been kinda treating it as like a diary that talks back; I don't input too much personal info or anything like that but, if I'm worried or stressed about something that I don't wanna burden the people in my life with, or if I have something I'm thinking about and am interested to see how an AI might respond to it, then I'll just open ChatGPT and vent. \n\nEvery now and then, I'll get a \"Memory Updated\" notification where it's randomly decided something I've said is worth remembering for future conversations and, over the past year, this has built up a fair amount, especially about likes, dislikes, fears, and that kinda thing. It's an interesting feature, and it sometimes makes conversations more relevant or stops me having to go over old things, and so I mostly just leave it as it is.\n\nRecently, I saw a trend where people were asking ChatGPT to suggest something that the user doesn't know about themselves based on everything in ChatGPT's memory about them. From what I've seen, it tries to be insightful; sometimes it is quite helpful, other times it is kinda brutal, but overall it's usually pretty interesting in one way or another, and so I decided to give it a try. I asked it, based on everything it's learned about me over the course of our conversations, what is something that it thinks I might not know about myself that might be beneficial for me to know.\n\nAs you can tell from the title of this post, its response was that I should probably get tested for autism.\n\nI wasn't really sure how to respond to that; I don't really know what I was expecting but it was definitely a lot more targeted and specific than the posts I'd seen of other people asking ChatGPT similar questions. I asked it to clarify and it brought up things that it had noted about being kind of picky about what I consume, stuff about regrets/worries related to \"normal\" social situations, fixations on random things, and a few other things that it said \"was indicative of autism\". It also reminded me that it wasn't a medical professional, which I thought was a very interesting thing to include after suggesting that I might have autism.\n\nAnyway, I kinda put it to the back of my mind and then, later that evening, I joined a voice chat with a few of my online friends that I play online games with and, after a while, I kinda brought up with them what ChatGPT had said. Their initial reaction was to laugh, which I thought meant that they thought what the AI had said was wrong, but then they said words to the effect of: \"With how much you talk to ChatGPT, I'm surprised you hadn't already told it that you're autistic.\" I then said that I wasn't autistic (by which I meant I didn't have a formal diagnosis of autism and, until this point, didn't really consider myself to be autistic), and things got kinda awkward.\n\nAnyway, I just took the AQ-50 and got a score of 36, which came with the message \"Scores in the 33-50 range indicate significant Autistic traits (Autism)\", so I guess there's a fair chance that I'm autistic, and that, somehow, I'm the last person to know about it.\n\nI dunno how I'm supposed to feel about this, or what I'm mean to do with this information. I'm a guy and in my early 30s, so it feels kinda late to get a diagnosis with something like this -- and, even if I did get a diagnosis, I don't know what it would change for me. ",

Now thing is, I'd at least tell my parents about the things I make, but even that I started to keep to myself because I find myself getting really self aware about every single aspect of what I make, this mostly goes for YouTube videos, it feels almost too personal to share with them, so the few times I showed them my videos I just got extremely self aware of every video idea and everything I wrote for the script, I kind of just remained paralyzed and stopped making any videos, then went to upload on a different channel they don't know of.\n\nI also know this girl I met on discord 5 years ago, and I would like to meet her and be together with her, and I let her know this almost from the very beginning, but I've made a mistake by making empty promises and saying we would meet very soon, well that soon just kept getting delayed until now and she's getting tired of waiting and I feel really bad too, she really wants us to meet and I do too, she lives in an abusive household that I want to get her out of, but I can't seem to start taking the steps, I'm afraid of telling about her to my parents because they might judge me, but realistically they'd be alright with it, it's just my stupid mind making all sorts of excuses, I don't know what to do, even now I have a job my dad gave to me, but if it wasn't for him, I would've still been unemployed, I never had a job besides for this one.\n\nIdk where I'm going with this post, just wanted to vent a bunch of things I guess, how could I move forward?\n\nEdit: For some clarification my parents are not abusive at all, they're actually very good parents, and yet for some reason I grew so distant towards them",

A link to the full story can be found [here](https://medium.com/@brianmragan/a-former-homophobes-guide-to-pride-cfce2fb6848d)\n\n**A Former Homophobe\u2019s Guide to Pride**\n\nYes, the title is clickbait, but it will be worth the read and maybe you even get a few laughs from it.\n\nOnce upon a time, I was homophobic. At a young age I knew that my brother\u2019s \u201chomosexual tendencies\u201d \u2013 a euphemism that might be more familiar to some than others \u2013 was going to be problematic given my family\u2019s and my own worldview. My worldview believed that A) he could change because homosexuality is a choice; B) if he acted upon his sexuality it was a sin (\u201clove the sinner, hate the sin\u201d). This worldview allowed our family to isolate ourselves from the truth about the core nature of at least 10% of the population, including one of our own flesh and blood.\n\n...\n\nOne day, we were hanging out at a reggae-themed party with a buffet of cannabis infused edibles and libations. He hadn\u2019t had much exposure to cannabis so as I watched him eat about three brownies and a glass of THC lemonade, I grew a tad concerned. I failed to stop him from eating that third sorcerous pastry and the situation soon turned to the classic \u201cI don\u2019t feel anything, these edibles ain\u2019t shit,\u201d then \u201choly shit, what have I done.\u201d Having been there before myself, more times than one should after such an uncomfortable lesson, I grabbed the reigns and became his spiritual guide or \u201ctrip advisor.\u201d\u00a0\n\nI took him on a walk away from the crowds and instructed him to look at the stars. He would bounce between \u201cthey look like Lite-Brites, remember Lite-Brites Brian? I loooooooved Lite-Brites!\u201d then to \u201cwhat if we only die because we accept that we die, oh my god we are all going to die!\u201d Whenever we got to the latter half of these dopamine-infused thought obsessions, I would coach him to focus on different topics, like back to the Lite-Brites or the beautiful design of a parasol and why aren\u2019t parasols popular anymore (he loved umbrellas as a kid).\u00a0\n\nEventually, and what probably felt to him like an eternity, we got to the point where we could coherently talk about deeper subjects such as our upbringing. We talked about when we first started jerking off, how we would hide our porn downloads from Kazaa, how one time I was looking for my downloads and I stumbled upon a very different type of porn than mine. In a single night, we tackled topics that are typically done over years of bonding moments between brothers who share the same sexual orientation. We were both blown away that we had never talked about this stuff, we had so much in common but with a slightly different hue to our stories of puberty. That night will go down as one of the greatest moments of bonding and connection I\u2019ve ever experienced. I\u2019ll cherish it for the rest of my life.\u00a0\n\n...\n\nOne day, while visiting my brother, he asked me if I wanted to go to Gay Bro Dinner Party. I asked him what Gay Bro Dinner Party was and he simply laughed and said \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m taking you to this.\u201d Well, Gay Bro Dinner Party is a dinner party with Gay Bro friends much like a\u00a0BBQ\u00a0or dinner with Straight Bro friends. The conversations that go on at both of these dude parties are exactly what you would expect but more talk about cocks, balls, and asses \u2014 actually that\u2019s not true, the frequency of these topics at Straight Bro Dinner party is equal to that at Gay Bro Dinner Party\u2026.but the context is slightly different\u2026.kind of\u2026again, we are all just a little bit gay deep down inside.\u00a0\n\nWhen I arrived at the party, his friends immediately said \u201cyou brought a straight person to Gay Bro Dinner Party!? What were you thinking!?\u201d In hindsight, I think it was their way of warning me that they weren\u2019t going to tone-down the banter and the thematic schema that goes on at Gay Bro Dinner Party would remain the same. They were going to thoroughly enjoy watching me crawl in my skin. In fact, in my first effort of small talk I asked the bros how they all knew my brother, and they responded in bro-fashion, \u201cat a gang bang.\u201d I gave a nervous laugh, doing mental gymnastics to figure out if this was a joke. I decided to just roll with it and pray they weren\u2019t testing how committed I was to \"being open-minded.\" And with that icebreaker I signaled to them with my nervous laughter, not knowing whether this was a true story or a joke, that I was one of the cool straight guys they could trust. Looking back, I\u2019m pretty sure they were joking, I think, I mean that\u2019s something I would say to someone clearly on a journey to rectify their former antediluvian worldview. But I digress.\n\n...\n\nFor the full story you can visit this link [https://medium.com/@brianmragan/a-former-homophobes-guide-to-pride-cfce2fb6848d](https://medium.com/@brianmragan/a-former-homophobes-guide-to-pride-cfce2fb6848d)",

Stop playing video games, they\u2019ll make you addicted. Stop drinking, it\u2019ll ruin your life. Stop doing this, stop doing that. And then, as if that\u2019s not enough, they push this pseudo-stoic mindset of \u201cjust focus on yourself\u201d and \u201cbecome the best version of yourself,\u201d whatever that even means.\n\nIt all feels incredibly narrow-minded and, honestly, kind of boring. These people act like the only thing that matters is self-improvement and constant progress. But what if I don\u2019t *want* that? What if I just want to be me? What if I just want to relax and enjoy life? Life is already hard enough as it is, and it feels like these gurus prey on people's insecurities\u2014especially those who are struggling\u2014and make them believe that the things they love are actually holding them back.\n\nThere\u2019s this obsession with \u201cself-improvement\u201d that often feels less about genuine growth and more about selling an idealized, almost robotic version of existence. It\u2019s weird because it\u2019s marketed as *freedom*\u2014\u201cbecome the best version of yourself!\u201d\u2014but it actually sounds more like a prison of constant self-discipline. Like, what\u2019s the point if you can\u2019t just *exist* without feeling guilty for not grinding 24/7?\n\nTake guys like Andrew Huberman, for example. Sure, he knows his neuroscience, but does he *really* have life all figured out? Because the way they present themselves, you'd think they had unlocked some secret formula to existence. But to me, it just seems sad. Humans are so obsessed with being ultra-efficient that they forget we only have a short time on this planet. And after that? A whole lot of nothing. So why not enjoy the things that make life meaningful instead of obsessing over sacrificing everything in the name of self-discipline?\n\nI get that addiction is real, and obviously, some habits can be destructive. But what\u2019s the point of living if you can\u2019t just enjoy things sometimes? Why does everything have to be about optimizing every aspect of yourself? I think it\u2019s okay to make sacrifices *when they actually make sense*, but it\u2019s also okay to say, \u201cScrew it, I just want to enjoy myself.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know\u2014this mindset just annoys me.

I guess I'll just start writing what I think I would want to read as a writer and just go from there. AT THE END OF EVERY CHAPTER I WILL RE-READ N MAKE CORRECTIONS AND ADD ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\n\t\u2022 I need someone to talk to about this stuff but my friendship with bestie always seems one-sided... me always texting first. Only time we speak is when I call her.. If no we don't speak at all. \n\t\u2022 STARTING TODAY, I YOUR LOCAL WANNABE, WILL NOT REACH OUT FIRST TO MY \"BEST FRIEND\" FIRST 03/04/2025.\n\t\u2022 Since I can't go to bestie with this.. Who can I go to? I am not close enough to share this with anyone... I can't see a therapist (again refer to point 4 as to why), so I guess I am stuck here typing to myself\n\t\t\u25cb I wonder if people do vlogs anymore\n\t\t\u25cb If they did would anyone to hear the highest of highs I go through\n\t\t\u25cb Or the unbelievable suffering I feel most days just dreaming of falling asleep and not waking up. However, I can't leave son all alone along especially not with my mother, and I can't take fathom taking him with me\nSoooo I am stuck trying to claw my way out from wanting death to living the life I want.

    "selftext": "Throwaway cuz I don't really use Reddit, but I've been feeling particularly guilty about this and wanted to get it out there. A bit of context, this winter has been rather challenging to say the least. I have struggled with mental health issues related to major life changes, as well as complications in relationships and friendships. All this to say, I've been having a rough time, but I've been trying to manage and for the most part have been getting better, albeit there are still some harder times. With that established, back to the main story. I am in a D&amp;D group of eight people, all in our early twenties. Scheduling, as I'm sure many of you can imagine, can be a bit difficult. This past weekend, we managed to find a time that worked for enough people so that someone in the group could run a one-shot. He has put a good amount of time into preparing for it and seemed very excited. We had chosen Sunday as the day to get together. That Saturday, I had planned to travel out of town for a day trip to visit family. While I was there, I started to struggle quite a bit. Like I said, it happens sometimes where certain days are harder than others, and Saturday, it hit hard. I felt as though all my motivation to do anything had disappeared, and I just wanted to crawl into bed and sob for a while. I obviously couldn't do that on the spot, and forced myself to power through, trying to have as good of a time as I can with my family. Here is where I did something I feel immensely guilty for. I decided to message in the D&amp;D group's discord, saying that something came up and I wouldn't be able to make the session. Really, I knew I just wanted to take the day to myself as I knew with the way I was feeling, I most likely would not be engaged or having fun during the session, and flat out just didn't want to be there while feeling like that. Shortly thereafter, the person running the session decided to cancel, moving it to this next weekend. Some of those in the group responded to my cancellation message with little angry emojis. I also was contacted by the partner of the person who was running the session. They asked what happened and mentioned the prospective DM was upset that I had cancelled. I said my family decided to extend the daytrip throughout the whole weekend and I couldn't get away. This was a lie, of course, but I felt like I would seem weak if I had said \"yeah I'm just feeling too depressed to play D&amp;D this weekend\" and I thought a more concrete excuse would be more easily accepted. Since then, I have felt very guilty for this. I understand why people would be disappointed, they have every right to be, and I really did not mean to hurt or upset anyone. I just know I would have had an unpleasant time during the session, and really did not want to be there feeling how I was. I know this isn't exactly the most exciting story, but I just felt like I needed to get it off my chest, its been eating at me so hopefully saying this out loud, so to speak, will help me feel a bit better.

They were friends before we got together, that's how we met, but as we our relationship got more serious, they seemed to be spending more time together. Having a girl best friend is kind of a turn off for some people, I get that, so I  was overjoyed when she and my girlfriend got a long so well, and it was easy to excuse all the time they were spending together because they might've been just ranting about me or like shopping or getting their nails done. \n\nIt started to get fishy once they decided to go on a \"girls trip\" together. To Paris. Alexandra and I had been planning on going there forever because of a jellycat store there, and now she's going with Jay?! Like what? I mean Paris is more of a romantic getaway I feel like. \n\nI gave them both a massive sideye when they said that, but I have some people pleasing tendencies so I didn't speak up about it until I saw the instagram post.\n\nThey were holding hands.

    "selftext": "So let me (F19) start this off by saying my boyfriend (M22) is most likely autistic, and also very socially awkward. He doesn\u2019t have any irl friends and pretty much only talks to me and his mum.\n\nHis mum is an alcoholic, and a lot of the time they fight because she\u2019s drinking and he has to raise his voice and be stern to get any point across. He hates that he has to and does try to talk to her normally. I understand this. However, he does kinda do it towards me too.\n\nI mentioned he\u2019s most likely autistic (I am autistic, so he could entirely not be I just think he is as well) and this very much presents in the way he gets irritated/overwhelmed/upset when he doesn\u2019t understand something or something doesn\u2019t have a logical answer or fit the logical answer he has in his head. I put up with this because I understand getting frustrated when things aren\u2019t \u201chow they should be\u201d but last night I really just couldn\u2019t handle it.\n\nWe got into a stupid disagreement over a movie he wanted to show me, because he likes the perspective it\u2019s shot in. He asked if I knew what he meant and I said yes I just couldn\u2019t articulate it out loud. I do have a problem with that where I can know the answer to something but the more someone prods at me to say it, it ends up just completely leaving my mind and it makes me feel stupid. He asked if I just said that because I didn\u2019t know but didn\u2019t want to sound dumb, and i explained the above point and told him I learned perspectives in drama class.\n\nNow this is not the first time I\u2019ve mentioned to him that I had to learn basic cinematography in two of the 4 years I took drama in high school, but he either forgot or just got too in his head where he was making me seem stupid and he kept saying things along the lines of \u201cdrama is acting. Cinematography is filming. They\u2019re different.\u201d I even tried to remind him multiple times about the fact I needed to know it for class but I kept getting interrupted (which annoyed me since he gets so aggravated if anyone interrupts him and says interruptions only lead to arguments) until he finally just pretty much said the point I had been saying and ended it with him yet again reminding me drama isn\u2019t cinematography and asking if I saw why he was getting misled.\n\nI ended up saying he needed to stop calling me stupid which at first he tried to defend because he\u2019s never outright called me stupid (which is true) just the way he treats me occasionally makes me feel lesser, and he ended up getting upset because his defence turned into him saying he didn\u2019t get why people always made him feel like an asshole when that\u2019s just \u201chow he is\u201d and I told him this might just be the way he talks but it\u2019s disrespectful and that\u2019s why he feels that way. I also don\u2019t really get this because he always says he\u2019s changing but nobody else is and while it\u2019s true he\u2019s growing as a person (losing weight, got a job, gaining confidence, and setting goals) his behaviour does need work and he can\u2019t expect everyone else (including me) to immediately change when he doesn\u2019t like certain things but then use the excuse of \u201cthat\u2019s just how he is.\u201d\n\nWe ended up not talking for the rest of the night and while I do feel justified in what I\u2019ve said I do still feel guilty for making him upset. I was kinda hoping he had work today so he wouldn\u2019t be in a bad mood until I say something (he really likes his job and also doesn\u2019t have a specific schedule he kinda just goes as he\u2019s needed) but as guilty as I feel I don\u2019t want to apologize for anything.\n",

I'm so lucky that most of the caretaking she needs is of the \"call this place\" or \"do these errands\" or other things that are pretty simple. No body care, she's able to talk and move and function (at least, right now. Eventually it'll get worse and then kill her.)\n\nBut, god, I am so tired of it. I spent three hours on the phone today pursuing different government issues. Yesterday I called three different pharmacies and fielded calls from multiple medical providers. Last week I figured out how to get her airport assistance as she had to do work travel.\n\nThe biggest issue, though, is that she will not just straight up ASK me to handle things that she can't do. She hints - \"should we do this?\" \"do you think we need to handle this?\" \"maybe this a good idea?\" It's all so noncommittal. Just SAY that it needs to be done! Then I can fit it in before it's actually an issue! I wouldn't have had to do the crazy calls today if she had just TOLD ME it needed to be done! \n\nAnd then, when I DO handle something based on her hints, she says she didn't ASK me to. \"Oh, you didn't need to do that!\" I get what she intends to say - to be expressing gratitude in the roundabout Midwestern way. But I DID need to do it, because she couldn't. Just say thank you! Admit you needed me! I don't need gratitude, I need acknowledgement.\n\nYes, I've talked to her about this. Eventually, maybe, we'll go to therapy. Most days this isn't a problem - caring for her doesn't interfere with my ability to pursue a career or hobbies or friends.

    "selftext": "Sorry for the vague language, but I had to comply with the rules.  \nI have also posted this in a other subreddit.\n\nI started going on webcam site (similar to Omegle) to help with my social anxiety and practice interacting with people. I hoped this would help me become more comfortable in social situations. Over time, I began to encounter people who were engaging in intimate or suggestive content. This caught me off guard, and I wasn\u2019t sure how to react. I became curious about the behavior and started interacting with others who seemed to be open to these types of discussions.\n\nOne day, I was matched with a person who mentioned that they were looking for an intimate conversation. I felt curious. Later, I was matched with someone who was revealing more of their body on camera. I asked, \"Is this real?\" and she replied, \"Yes, this is real.\" I asked, \"Can you show me more?\" She said, \"No, what the heck. I'm not going to do that!\" and skipped.\n\nSoon after, I discovered an adult website with private one-on-one chats and began talking to women with intimate intent. I started asking them to reveal more, and some did without hesitation. Afterward, I went and did the deed to the imagination of what I saw.  \nShortly after, I suddenly worried:\u00a0*What if they were underage?*\u00a0I got extremely concerned and wanted to find them again, but I had no way of doing so. I initially thought that if people were engaging in these kinds of interactions, they must be adults.\n\nI investigated the website and found out that they verify users\u2019 ages with ID. I returned to the platform and began asking women how old they were. They all told me they were over 18. I reported the site to local authorities, expressing concerns about potential illegal activity, although I didn\u2019t have solid proof. The authorities investigated the site and found no evidence of any wrongdoing. Interpol did an investigation on the site, and found no evidence of wrongdoing either.\n\nThe anxiety grew worse, and I seriously considered reporting myself to the police in hopes that they could investigate and determine whether I had interacted with anyone underage. I also began questioning whether I had at any point unknowingly gotten exposed to minors in that way. I began taking SSRI\u2019s and anti anxiety meds to manage my anxiety and started therapy.\n\nWhen I felt better, I returned to the site (the one that is similar to Omegle) again to engage with people. Shorty after I was again matched with people who were wanting to have suggestive conversation and revealing more of their body (both men and women). I initially skipped, but got curious and felt excited again.I promised myself that I would never ask anyone to do anything, and if I had any suspicion that someone might be lying about their age, I would immediately skip them.\n\nEventually, I was matched with someone whose video was black, but they seemed to be suggesting that kind of behavior with emojis. I asked them how old they were, and they responded, \u201c15.\u201d I immediately skipped. I got matched with someone after. She had her torso visible, and then she lifted her shirt, exposing part of her body. I asked, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d but she skipped me immediately.\n\nI was left feeling distressed - I was using the site without clear age verification, hoping to meet people who were showing intimate content, while also being aware of the risk that there could be someone underage experimenting.\u00a0\n\nThe next day, I reached out to a sex counselor and confided in her about my concerns. I started crying on the phone, realizing that I had crossed personal boundaries in my behavior, just because I was curious.\n\nDespite this, I still find myself wondering whether any of the women I interacted with on the webcam site were underage. My anxiety continues to distort my memory, and I wonder:\u00a0*What if they were 17? Or 16? Or even younger?*\u00a0Sometimes, these thoughts become overwhelming, and I question whether I might have missed signs that would have indicated their true age. Someone might say, \u201cYou would have noticed if they were much younger,\u201d but what if I didn\u2019t??\n\nI think what is the hardest is: while struggling with this, I don't know how to reach out for help. Don't get me wrong, I brought this upon myself. How would others react to this?",

    "selftext": "For context, my mom hates my dad (65M) with an extreme, almost irrational amount of resentment. I was never allowed to see him after their divorce, and my mom has always been abusive toward me\u2014accusing me of trying to \"steal\" my dad from her even when I was a child. Meanwhile, she worships my brother and treats him like a king, which is common in our culture.\n\nGrowing up, my brother bullied me, but as adults, he seems to have changed\u2014or so I thought. He encouraged me to reconnect with my dad, even telling me to sneak out to visit him, knowing full well that my mom would explode if she found out. Recently, my brother has been spending a lot of time at my dad\u2019s restaurant (let\u2019s call it Bo\u2019s) because he gets free food there, and he kept inviting me to come. I resisted at first but eventually gave in because I needed a break from home, and I could actually study and eat there.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: every time I go, my brother *immediately* tells my mom. He asks me to go, waits until I do, and then betrays me. The first time, he blurted it out in front of a cousin, and my mom lost it on me. I blocked him for a week but had to eventually forgive him since we still live together. I thought maybe it was a mistake.\n\nThen it happened again. This time, he acted super nice to me all weekend, made me breakfast, and even walked me to my car before we were supposed to meet at Bo\u2019s. But then, at the last second, he bailed on me, saying he\u2019d study at home\u2014something he *never* does. I went to Bo\u2019s alone, and four hours later, he called me. As soon as I picked up, my mom\u2019s voice came through his phone, asking, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d Before I could even lie, he said, \u201cShe\u2019s at Bo\u2019s.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t understand why he keeps doing this. He used to hate my mom and call her crazy, but suddenly, he\u2019s been defending her, saying she\u2019s just \"mentally ill\" and that we should \"pray for her.\" It\u2019s a complete 180 from how he talked about her just weeks ago.\n\nI\u2019ve given him the benefit of the doubt because he struggles with school and responsibilities, and I suspect he may have a learning disability. But at this point, I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s just na\u00efve or if he\u2019s actively setting me up.\n\nWhat do you think? Am I overreacting, or is this deliberate?",

    "selftext": "I was about a freshman when it started. I went to a school, and said school was a Christian School. But it really was anything but what you'd expect.  \n  \nI will never forget what happened in those 3 dreadful fucking years I stayed in that god damned school. They made me distrust anyone who worked in education, they made me hate anything relating to going to school.\n\nIn the span of 3 years of being suicidal and slicing my arms, they only started to give a damn when my grades went up.\n\nFreshman year, ignored. Sophomore year, ignored... Junior year? Seen, but only because my grades went up. I admit, I didn't have the best grades, I didn't get medals like my classmates, but that's not the point.\n\nIn sophomore year we had a new student... First thing they did? Announce that they should help the student, take away all the sharp objects from her. They didn't do that with me. They didn't announce jack shit. They let me hurt myself. By the end of the year my own best friend even got help. I didn't know she was struggling, we were always the outcasts. But then she got help. The principal came in on the first week my best friend didn't come to school anymore, and told everyone to make little notes that are positive addressed to each other, but in reality it was really just for my best friend. The principal told everyone to make friends with her, so they did. She was involved more, but I wasn't.... Anytime she had announcements about me it was reprimanding the other students for speaking in our mothertongue with me and not in English because: \"(NotAWinterTale) can only speak english.\" Which is false, I speak 5 total languages.  \n  \nThey never set up a guidance councilor for me. Anytime I tried to look for one I got brushed off, and was told to just \"pray to God.\" ... That was the only thing they ever tell me- \"Pray to God\", of course. That doesn't address anything.\n\nThe principal talked to me, told me a story about a deceased student. She was physically disabled but \"always came to school happy\".  She told me that she had it worse than I did, and I should be happy for that. The principal in the same day told me to stop crying otherwise she wouldn't talk to me anymore. She also told me all the professors thought I should be in a different section. The one where they put the \"dumber\" kids... Which I found very insulting because they hadn't even tried to help me in any of my problems, just ignored me and moved on. It was painfully obvious when a professor didn't like me. They never responded to me, or acted with me the same way as other students.\n\nBut still, really fucking disgusting to me. How dare she compare my problems to a deceased student? That was extremely disrespectful and told me all I needed to know, I couldn't trust the principal at all. Every fucking day for 2 years I came to school with new scars. They never checked on me, that responsibility for some reason befell my own few friends. Other students. Not the teachers- The students. 4 people who saw me.  \n  \nBut then the pandemic came, and we were all forced to go to school online. My grades went up. It only got easier because I didn't feel any pressure. Nor did I have to work with others who only wanted to delegate me stupid tasks or have me do nothing at all, or some professor not answering my question properly but just making it more complicated, it was easier because I could search up the topic at the same time, and get the answers I needed. But then they my grades went down again. \n\nI was called in for a private meeting with the principal, a professor, and two guidance councilors. I am not ever forgetting what they told me.  \n  \n\"Is there something wrong (NotAWinterTale)? You know that you can talk to us. Your grades are going down. Your grades in the first and second quarter were really good, and it concerns us that it went down again. If there's anything we can do to help, tell us.\"\n\nI had never felt angrier at them. Two fucking years of being ignored, of cutting my arms, and being suicidal enough to have nearly jumped off the damn building they only started to give a fuck the year they see I fit their expectations of being smart.\n\nI never forgot what happened or what they did. That stuck with me for years. I'm still crying about this years later. Because of them I feel like I don't deserve help unless my performance is above average, that I meant nothing all because I struggled and couldn't do it.  \n  \nThey always made me feel ashamed that things didn't click for me.  Now I feel vindicated now that I know I have AuDHD, and while I know it probably isn't an excuse, I feel happy to know it's not because I was stupid and didn't try hard enough. I am told I deserve what they never gave me, but sometimes those words aren't enough to erase the pain that school gave me.",

On one hand, I\u2019m happier than I\u2019ve ever been, on the other, I low key hate myself much more nowadays. He makes me feel so loved but so disgusting. I\u2019ve always been pretty insecure, that\u2019s not new, but from what I\u2019ve heard, a man\u2019s supposed to make u more confident. All he\u2019s done is make me love one singular part of my body just to make me despise 11 more(yes, I counted). The worst thing about it, is I know it\u2019s not intentional. My partner is really pretty as a girl, even tho he hates it. For example, he has (sorry for this description) big,firm,and perky boobs. As a trans dude he obviously doesn\u2019t want them and is planing on getting top surgery as soon as possible, but it has made me think I\u2019m some sort of glob monster now, while I was very proud of my girls before I met him. Anyways, moving on from my body dismorphia, there\u2019s one more thing that bothers me in this relationship.\nHe\u2019s had a very hard life (bad partners, abusive family and relapsing sh) and whenever I try to talk to him about my lore (it\u2019s bad but not as bad) his expression show the mindset of \u00ab\u00a0here she is, acting like she\u2019s got anything to complain about\u00a0\u00bb and it really bothers me. Also, when I try to bring up any complaints I have to him, he low key starts guilting me into forgetting about it (like a dog when it eats your sunglasses). I just feel like he really undermines my experiences and unintentionally makes himself the victim of the relationship. Like, weve gone through some things in this relationship but he acts like what he does had no victims. I\u2019m just really sad and happy while dating him and I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\n(Sorry if this is incoherent, I\u2019m writing this at 3am and not really focusing on writing, just ranting)",

I\u2019m not much of a cat person, and I understand my energy was probably off putting to the cat. But I\u2019ve always tolerated it the best I could, despite its dislike of me. She went on a week long work trip 2 months ago and asked me to just stop by and feed her cat as well as check on her apartment to make sure all is well. Sure, whatever, I agreed. Her cat got nasty with me day one, and I ignored it. Second day, same thing. By the third day, I couldn\u2019t take it and I just couldn\u2019t imagine living with this stupid cat. So I grabbed it and let it outside through the window. (She lives on the first story so the cat was fine. I placed it on the ground and let it leave. I\u2019m not a total monster.) The next day I went to the shelter when they had an open appointment and looked for a cat that looked identical to her cat. She had a generic black cat so it wasn\u2019t hard. I brought it to her apartment, and left it at that. She came back, and everything had seemed fine. She\u2019s only noted that the cat was skittish at first, but we both just chalked it up to it being the first time she was away from home for so long.

I had friends, sure, but I was never the number one choice. \n\nGroup projects? I had to ask for partners, no one ever asked me. Same went for field trip sleeping arrangements, and anything that had to be in pairs or above. If we were a five people group, and the project was for four, I'd be the one left out almost every time. It would have been one thing if I was a lousy student, but I had great grades, so I know it wasn't about *that*.\n\nI was also always the one to create all the group chats, and always learned that there was one without me as well. And sure, people can do whatever they want, but it still hurts when you find that out. Some of these people are ones I kept in touch until today (I am 24 now), but again: never the first choice.\n\nAnd it might feel or seem small, but I was never the one people set next to. I didn't smell bad (I asked about it), wasn't an annoyance, just another part of never being first.\n\nNow don't get me wrong. They were amazing friends, that point aside. Always there for me when I needed, supported me when I came out and through a couple of years that were practically hell for my mental health, defended me when I didn't know I needed defense. They still support me to this day, too. It's safe to say I literally wouldn't have been here today without them.\n\nThen college happened. I started this year, and the social aspect was my major fear. Will I even have friends? Or is it really something so awful about me that makes people feel less for me, every time?\n\nBut college couldn't have been more different. I found people that actually like me. When we have classes together, they search for me. When I miss a day, I get a text asking where I was, because I never skip classes. And even if they were a group before I joined, they added me to their group chat without making a big deal out of it. They didn't open a new group, they just added me to their usual one. \n\nWe plan our schedules together so we share most classes, we make plans, I don't have to start chats... I guess I am being chosen for the first time, and not being left behind. It's a point when I am positive that even if I don't have many classes with any of them in the future, we will still keep in touch and stay friends.\n\nThere isn't much to this post aside from happy at where I came to, but I felt like I had to get it out and tell someone :))",

I was unable to identify the emotion. It was just \u2026 *something*. Maybe everything at once. \n\n\nI was unable to speak because my throat hurt. And I felt myself cry, a lot. I even teared up with my eyes closed. Dumb, I know. But it hurt. It really hurt. I don't know why it hurt so much.\n\n\nI'm not mad that he has my main. Surprisingly not. But I'm mad that he broke the promise. Our promise. That we made years ago. I still remember when. Even if it was just a silly, small promise \u2013 it still meant something to me.\n\n\nI've calmed down now. But I don't know how to process this. It ain't deep, I should just get over it and I probably will force myself to sooner or later for the sake of him. But yeah, just had to get this silly vent off my chest\u2026 ",

To tell you I've seen the coldest side of my otherwise loving parents would be an understatement. \n\nSilly little me thought we could just talk it out and get one with our lives and I was so wrong. They turned on me so fucking quick. Tried their absolute worst to turn me back. They were scared shitless with religious guilt and legitimately fearful for my afterlife in hell and made sure to project it onto me the worst way possible. I grew apart and away.\n\nIt hurts because I know it also came from a place of love. That mixture of love and unacceptance has followed me my whole life afterwards.\n\nI've ended up with wonderful women who as our love grew, would try to turn me to their faith, maybe even genuinely out of care. But they never understood how much it hurts to not just be accepted for who you are. It always ended in failure and heartbreak. \n\nI was just starting to catch feelings for this girl. We've been having amazing chemistry and genuine fun I haven't felt in years. Yesterday, she brought up how our difference of faith wouldn't let us work out. I've been through this too many times. But this time, It broke me.\n\nI just wish someone would love me for who I really am. I'm so fucking starved for it. I wish I could hear it. Wear it around me like a warm blanket.

Gave him every single part of me and gave him the benefit of the doubt even after he did extremely questionable things- and yep everyone on my other post was absolutely correct and he was cheating on me, for around 2 years with more people than i can count saying and doing the most vile things. I just took pictures of as much as i could stomach, I got to 42 different chats and wanted to get as far away from those disgusting chats as possible. I can't sleep, I can't eat. I'm numb. I can't even cry. I'm not mad. I'm nothing. Nothing feels real. I want to hate him, but I dont. I feel nothing.\n\nI ignored my gut feelings for literally years and convinced myself I was crazy, he would never do that. But I was wrong. I have moved into the living room, I can't afford to move out, We have numerous animals too. He has lied to not only myself but every person around us telling them that we were in an open relationship. We definitely fucking weren't. I gave him numerous 'outs' and tried to break up a few times over the last 2 years which he vehemently denied- but then cheated anyway. While inwas miscarrying his child. While I was going through the hardest part of my life. While I was having trauma therapy for SA and abuse, so many occasions. The one thing he knows I never forgive. I would forgive him for literally ANYTHING else, but not cheating. \n\nI've had to do STI/STD kits because I can't believe a word out of his mouth. How am I supposed to believe he didn't sleep with anyone when he managed to hide all of this, it goes too deep to even begin to put into words. I don't trust someone who can happily hide their uncountable amount of affairs, sexting, flirting and fuck knows what else. I feel disgusting, I feel ugly. I have never felt so low. \n\nHe wants to be friends, but how can I be friends with someone who used me for years and tossed me aside. I want to rip off my skin so that I can get rid of his touch.  I feel so violated \n\nHonestly, I don't think I'll ever recover emotionally, mentally, or physically from this. ",

He has a team of developers working for him. One of his developers is prostituting herself twice a week. Another one of the developers had to move in with his dad because he couldn't afford living on his own and his dad told him to stop working for my brother. My brother convinced him to not listen to his dad and to \"follow his dreams\" so he's moving in with my brother's business partner. His business partner \"house hacks\". House hacking means he puts his name on the lease and has people move in and splits the payment between them without contributing anything. I'm in a long term emotionally and financially abusive relationship that I don't want be in anymore. However, I don't have anyone to turn to in my area and I can't afford to move into an apartment based on my income. I'm a student so I can't move back home. I spoke to my brother about the situation and he's like yeah you can either move with me or my business partner. My brother and his girlfriend are moving to the same city as his business partner. I don't wanna live with my brother and his girlfriend because she has a cat and I do too but her cat doesn't get along with other cats. So I told him his business partners place would probably be better. I asked what the rent would be and he said probably altogether 1150. I thought that was pretty high because it was supposed to be split between four people. My brother told my mom that his business partner house hacks after we had had a conversation about how much rent would be and she asked me if he told me that and I said I have no idea what that is and she found out from him and let me know. And I currently live with my boyfriend for free. The reality of the situation is I can't go from paying nothing to paying 1150 just so I can pay this guy's way while he can't even pay the people that are working for him a decent wage. I told my brother this and he was trying to shame me he was like so you're not ready to jump ship? After I explained I want to visit first, I don't want to move yet and put school on pause just to end up not even liking it there. And even if I did I might struggle to find a job too. I've lived in this state my whole life.  He was like well that's unfortunate but alright and then said I need a hard yes or no by April 5 no later. He treats me like I'm some bitch employee. Or like everything has to be transactional and a business decision. At this point I just feel like going contact. ",

    "selftext": "Not an English speaker.\n\nI still don't get it and i still genuinly don't understand it at all, it was just a simple act that i made. It's not like i saved the fucking world.(if it was to me i wouldn't save the world anyway)\n\nSo it all happened 30 minutes ago.\n\nI was at the supermarket trying to buy something for dinner and was looking there for some vegetables when i firstly saw this girl(aroud my age i guess but i'm horrible at giving people age) panicking around and looking behind her like someone was about to kill her and i saw an old man following her but i ignored the scene.\n\n10 minutes passed by and i went to take some healthy snacks and while i was there looking for them( i never understood why they always move things from the shells for fuck's sake) when this girl reappered again panicking and looking around like someone was about to kill her but this time she was crying and sobbing. When she saw me there trying to look at my snacks she run towards me and went behind my back like she was trying to use my body as defence from someone or something and then again the old man showed up looking for her.\n\nI turned my head around to the girl and asked her what the fuck was her problem and she told me that the old man was trying to abuse her and he already touched her. I asked her why the hell she placed behind me and she told me that she was scared and because i'm a big guy and i could defend her.\n\nI just sighed cause i was already tired of the day and went straight face to face to the old man and just told him to leave that girl alone or i would end in prison and he in a grave. He just stared at me like i was some kind of ghost and looked at the girl and then went away.\n\nI came back to the girl and told her next time to kick him or anyone else herrassing her to the balls and then run or call someone and when i was about to go to pay while crying she asked me \"please don't leave me alone, can you stay with me while i buy a few things?\" I sighed again and accepted. So she bought the things she needed and then she even wanted me to be there for her at her car so unfortunetly i did.\n\nShe hugged me too tightly and gave me her number because \"i need to offer you a drink after today because you saved me and without you i don't want to imagine what would happened\". I just sighed and said \"yeah yeah whatever\" and apparently tomorrow night i have a free drink with this girl.(Tanya)\n\nNow: sincerly i didn't made anything of special or so particular to me. I just did what i had to do to avoid any type of drama or crying or all this pathetic scenes that i hate. I'm always ready for death or prison so it wasn't exactly a menace but more like a straight fact on what would happen. I don't get why all this cries after i took her to the car, all this thanking and all this \"you saved me\". I just did it because i hate drama and all this shit. More simple than this is impossible.\n\nGirls are so dramatic...",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I have always read other people's stories. I figured I want to share my story with everyone to show that no matter how hard your life is, there is always a way. I had reasons to give up but I chose not to. I hope this story can help other people who is going through hardships.  \n  \n**I Had Nothing\u2014So I Built My Own Future**\n\nThere was a time in my life when I had no financial security, no degree, no legal certainty, and no real future. I had no backup plan, no connections to rely on, and no one to help me figure things out. I had to navigate everything on my own, making difficult choices to survive.\n\n# Early Life &amp; Family Background\n\nMy biological father left when I was two years old to become a monk. He was completely absent from my life, never attempting to reconnect. My mother, overwhelmed with life, was also absent for long periods. When she became pregnant with my stepbrother, she left for Malaysia and was gone for nearly a year. During that time, my grandmother took care of me and my elder brother. She was everything you could hope for in a grandmother\u2014kind, nurturing, and always present.\n\nThen, one day, my mother returned and took us to Malaysia without telling anyone. My brother and I didn't understand what was happening; we simply followed instructions. Like anyone leaving home, we missed Brunei, but we had no say in the matter.\n\n# Life with My Stepfather\n\nAt around seven years old, my stepfather entered my life. I was excited\u2014I had always wanted a father. He owned a business selling screen protectors and phone covers, and as it grew, our financial situation improved. But despite his success, he was abusive.\n\nMistakes were not tolerated. He beat us for small things, like forgetting to turn off a light. No matter how well we behaved, we were constantly reminded that we were not his real children. As his business boomed, he became more absent, but his abuse never stopped.\n\nWhen his business thrived, we moved to Johor Bahru, and for the first time, we lived comfortably. But the abuse continued. At 14, we moved to Kuala Lumpur. I had no idea that my life was about to take a drastic turn.\n\n# Australia &amp; The First Collapse\n\nAt 16, I was sent to Australia to continue my studies. I enrolled in:\n\n* Year 12 at Taylor\u2019s College\n* Diploma of Business at Deakin University\n* Bachelor's Degree in Psychology: Applied Science\n\nIn early 2013, my stepfather suddenly announced that we had to return to Malaysia. His business had gone bankrupt.\n\nI didn't want to leave, but I had no choice.\n\n# Returning to Brunei &amp; Struggling for Direction\n\nBack in Brunei, I took a job as a marketing executive at a magazine company. It was straightforward work, but I realized that Brunei's work culture and lifestyle weren\u2019t for me.\n\nAt first, Brunei made sense because I didn\u2019t have the right documents to stay in Malaysia. But after working there, I knew: Malaysia was where I wanted to be.\n\nSo I left.\n\n# Returning to Malaysia &amp; Facing Reality\n\nI was jobless for six months before landing a job as a Private Investigator. During this time, my stepfather did not support us financially. He claimed to be paying our rent, but we later found out he wasn\u2019t.\n\nOne day, our landlord told us the rent hadn\u2019t been paid for months. If we didn\u2019t leave immediately, he would call the police.\n\nThat night, we quietly packed our essentials and left. We were shocked, terrified, but also relieved to get away from the lie we had been living.\n\nLater, I found out my stepfather had another family. His former business partner secretly told my mother that he had two daughters in their early twenties\u2014meaning he had been maintaining a second family for over 20 years without telling us.\n\n# Survival Mode \u2013 Private Investigator &amp; Visa Struggles\n\nI found my PI job through a newspaper ad. It was advertised as a \u201cMarket Researcher\u201d position, but when I went for the interview, I realized it was for a Private Investigator. The work involved tracking down counterfeit products and investigating individuals.\n\nI struggled at first but got better over time. Still, the job was stressful, and I knew it wasn\u2019t my future.\n\nOn top of that, I had major visa issues. I was forced to travel in and out of Malaysia every two months to renew my stay. Eventually, immigration warned me that I would be blacklisted if I kept doing this.\n\nDesperate, I turned to an unconventional way to secure my visa. But it backfired. The person handling my passport ran away with it for years.\n\nI was trapped in Malaysia with no legal identity. I was terrified. I wanted to report it, but I feared I would be deported. I had to stay quiet and find another way.\n\n# The Turning Point \u2013 Finding My Strength in Teaching\n\nMy wife now saw what I was going through. She offered to marry me so I could get a spousal visa. When she said that, I broke down in tears. I had been fighting for so long, and finally, I had a way forward.\n\nI knew I couldn\u2019t continue the PI job, so I looked for something more meaningful. I found a job as a special needs educator and quickly realized I was good at it. I understood behavioral strategies like the ABC Chart and could see real progress in my students.\n\nI also took a side job at a tuition centre teaching English. I worked from 8 AM to 9 PM every day. It was exhausting, but I kept pushing forward.\n\nSoon, parents started coming to me directly. Word spread, and I had so many clients that I had to hire another teacher to help me.\n\n# Building My Own Centre &amp; Surviving COVID-19\n\nI always wanted to run my own business. When the tuition centre owner tried to take control of my earnings, I knew it was time to leave.\n\nI gathered my savings and opened my own special needs centre. It was terrifying, but I knew I had to do it.\n\nThen, COVID-19 hit.\n\nI lost over half my clients overnight. I had to choose: \u2714 Let the business fail or \u2714 Adapt and push through\n\nI transitioned to online teaching and borrowed money to keep my employees paid. I sacrificed my own salary to keep the centre alive. It was the hardest time of my life, but I refused to give up.\n\nMoral of the story: Do not give up despite all the adversities. If you hit rock bottom and felt aimless. Always remember to do with what you can and progress forward. ",

    "selftext": "So I realize I sound like an asshole. I grew up in pretty bad poverty. My mom had a really hard time holding a job and when she was able to, had a spending problem. As a result, I\u2019ve been working full time since I was 15. I worked multiple jobs at a time to get around labor laws so that I could make and save money. By the time I graduated high school I had enough money to buy a car in cash and pay for a majority of my college expenses (cash flowed first 3 years) with absolutely no help. I continued to work through college and eventually ended up in a high paying job. From the age of 17 to now I\u2019ve worked around 50-60 hours a week in addition to going to school. I had no free time. I missed out on a majority of being young- I never got to go to parties, I hardly ever hung out with friends which caused me to lose a majority of them, and I was always exhausted while I should have been young and lively. Regardless, I went through the grind and came out on top. I now don\u2019t typically have to worry about money. I\u2019m in a relationship with a fantastic man that I plan to marry and start a family with. Everything seems to have worked out.\n\nMy mom has always had a very hard time working. She has problems with all of her co workers everywhere she goes &amp; she seems to struggle with taking direction. As a result, she tends to leave jobs quickly, usually without another job offer. She decided when I was around 19 to stop working to care for my elderly grandmother. While I understood this decision, there were still times she could have held a part-time job at least and chose not to. My grandmother was in an adult daycare program for about 20-30 hours a week, which could have been spent working. Instead my mom chose to go out and spend what little money she had gotten from various loans and wherever else she was getting money from. She also complained constantly about having to take care of my grandmother. \n\nMy grandmother passed away a year ago and my mom was left with no choice but to go back to work, and again the cycle starts over. Everyday I hear constant complaining about how much she hates her job and everyone she works with. She makes very little effort to find other work and writes off entire industries for silly reasons (I won\u2019t work in food service because I won\u2019t wear a hair net. I won\u2019t work in retail because I don\u2019t have any experience. Etc.) She is also not saving any money, not towards retirement, not towards an emergency reserve, nothing. She claims she doesn\u2019t have any money left after bills to save, but she frivolously spends. Every space in the house is occupied with something. She purchased a freezer full of steaks that have been sitting uncooked for months. She pays someone to wash her hair every few days because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel like doing it herself\u201d. She has so many things she doesn\u2019t need and every time I visit her there is more yet bills are being paid in increments because she \u201ccan\u2019t afford to pay the full bill\u201d. I even cover some expenses by putting her on my plans and yet she still cannot manage very basic expenses.\nMeanwhile I work, I live very well below my means and my partner and I save a lot of money, both for retirement and for our future together. I know my mother is planning on being able to live off of me and I won\u2019t allow it. I don\u2019t know what she is going to do and I know it sounds cold of me, but I worked too hard to hand over everything to someone who has never tried to better themselves or their life. I\u2019m done.\n\nEdit just because I\u2019m frustrated: I came to visit her today and discovered receipts for various retailers for the past couple of weeks strewn about totaling over $700. She just complained to me about not being able to pay property taxes to stay in her home. It\u2019s just so bad and I needed to vent more, I apologize.",

    "selftext": "Forgive my formatting, I\u2019m on mobile. Do not share my story anywhere. TW- Death, Incest, P*dophilia\n\nI don\u2019t honestly know where to start so I guess the beginning is where I\u2019ll go. \n\nWhen I was very young, my \u2018dad\u2019 began molesting me, from what I can remember I was around 3 or 4. I have three younger sisters that I grew up with and he molested them too as they got older, but it was mostly me that got the brunt of it. \n\nLast year, my mom passed away of a stroke. It was a very complicated time for me because although my abuser was arrested for what he did, my mom had convinced my sisters and I to drop the charges right before she had passed away. She would say awful manipulative things like \u201cYou don\u2019t want your dad to die in prison, do you?\u201d to guilt us into dropping the charges. She then proceeded to invite this man back into our lives by moving him back into the house we all shared at the time, and my discomfort was ignored and brushed under the rug. \n\nWhen my mom passed my \u2018dad\u2019 went crazy and forced me out of the house. My mom was a buffer between everyone and with her gone, I didn\u2019t feel comfortable at the house at all and I had my boyfriend stay in my room with me because I felt safer that way. Cue raging \u2018dad\u2019, cussing me out for inviting another man over and threatening to call the cops and having him trespassed- all crazy erratic shit I didn\u2019t understand. So I moved in with my boyfriend (yay). All that drama didn\u2019t even end up mattering though, because \u2018dad\u2019 remarried and moved to a new state just 3 months after my mom\u2019s passing. Currently all my sisters are still living in that house together.\n\nNow here\u2019s the fun part\u2026 \n\nI\u2019m the eldest. Growing up, I was always told that my parents got married at the courthouse and had me before they officially hosted the wedding. I was born in 99 and the timeline I was told was, \n\u2022Met online in \u201897\n\u2022Courthouse wedding in \u201898\n\u2022I was born in \u201899\n\u2022Wedding I was pictured in took place in 2000. \nI always knew I was in their wedding pictures and I never questioned what they told me, they said the ceremony was delayed until my grandma could get back from doing government work overseas. It all made sense to me growing up, I never questioned it, but it was all a lie. \n\nSo this weekend was a the year anniversary of my mothers death, and I decided to get dinner with my sisters. We\u2019re having a good time and everything but I forgot my jacket, and my boyfriend stopped by the restaurant to bring it to me. I get back to the table and my sisters got all quiet and said, \u201cHey, we\u2019ve got some news for you and it\u2019s really heavy.\u201d Long story short, this man that I\u2019ve thought was my \u2018dad\u2019 my whole life is NOT my biological father. My sisters have been going through all of our moms things over the last year and kept coming across weird pictures and documents relating to me that didn\u2019t line up with what we\u2019d been told. I would\u2019ve thought they were trolling me if it weren\u2019t for the fact they\u2019d confirmed everything with my aunt, my mom\u2019s younger sister. Who, I just found out yesterday, didn\u2019t know that I didn\u2019t know, because my mom was not only lying to my siblings and I about it, but lying to my aunt and all of our extended family too, saying my siblings and I already knew! \n\nI\u2019m going to visit my aunt in a couple of days to sit down and talk all of this out, get the real scoop on my life, because my whole worldview has been shattered. On one hand, I\u2019m grateful I was finally told, but I turn 26 this month and that\u2019s an insane age to learn your dad isn\u2019t even your dad. Not to mention what a horrible \u2018dad\u2019 he was. \n\nI feel this information to be both heartbreaking and freeing- I\u2019m not related to this monster. If I have kids, I won\u2019t be passing along his DNA, and that\u2019s comforting to me. I don\u2019t want to make my half sisters feel bad for being related to him, but I can\u2019t help feeling like this, I\u2019ve always told myself I wouldn\u2019t have kids because this guy doesn\u2019t deserve his DNA being passed on and now I find out I have none of it. This information was a gift to me. \n\nOn the other hand, I\u2019m angrier at my mom than I\u2019ve ever been. I mourned her death so severely, I suffered, because I felt so guilty that our relationship was so tumultuous in life. And yet, we never could have had an honest relationship because I now know she was never honest with me. About almost anything. I feel so much better and at peace knowing that it really and truly was my mothers fault that our relationship was so rocky. How can you have an honest relationship with anyone that could lie about something so big? Not to mention the fact that she was so manipulative and greedy, doing everything she did just to invite this evil man back into our lives, just because it\u2019s what she wanted for herself, to retire on his dime. None of this is on me anymore and I feel so much lighter. \n\nAnd before anyone asks, yes a DNA test is in my future, and I\u2019m starting therapy again soon. I have no idea if my dad is even alive or still out there, but I\u2019m going to find out. I\u2019m not sure how to end this but let me just say, this has been the craziest year of my life by far, and I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to interact with either of my parents anymore, or feel guilty about how I handled things when my mom was alive.

    "selftext": "I saw a post that included a boy my age who got support and security by someone in his life and i feel so jealous i feel embarrassed to admit it but i am i went through so much on my own and really fell apart in the process i\u2019m not saying that he doesn\u2019t deserve the support or that i deserve it instead cause i went through more no i know everyone has their problems and deserve support regardless and should be taken seriously but i never got support and it\u2019s why i feel so hurt and \u201cjealous\u201d but really i don\u2019t wish him any harm it just hurts seeing other people get the love and support you always craved and wanted. I\u2019ve been hit, kicked, beaten up, screamed and yelled at and got threats regularly, verbally and emotionally abused by getting gaslight and cussed out in every way and spat on and death threats once when i was 11 by my dad after getting beaten up and at 14 too by my mom and i got my nose broken by my aunt and never got justice or any support AT ALL. Not emotionally or physically my mom at the time where i was having a breakdown right after the incident told me i deserved everything that happened to me and reminded me when my dad used to beat me up on a regular basis when i was 11 and that i was \u201cstepped on\u201d and \u201cteached a lesson\u201d by my him and my aunt and called me names cause i snapped at her during the breakdown when she refused take me to the police and i didn\u2019t stop bleeding for 17 hours. I spat more blood even days after and i was never taken to the hospital or reported my aunt and when i was 12 my mom attempted suicide and i watched that all and saved her from it my mom was always manipulative and neglectful and shitty and gaslight me into thinking she was the \u201cbetter parent\u201d when she wasnt anything close to that she sent me to my dad when i was 7 even after she knew he sa\u2019ed me. Throughout my childhood since i\u2019ve been a toddler i\u2019ve been abused so much by both my mom and dad and their families and i got no support or help by anybody idk how im still alive i wish i wasnt i stayed alive just to see others living better without carrying this whole emotional burden i have and just to get physical issues (a heart condition i got last year) that can kill me, and the worst part is my physical issues are probably caused by the stress i\u2019ve been under and one thing led to another and all this at just 14 years old why am i even still alive? i don\u2019t want this life i can\u2019t stand this anymore everyday just gets more unbearable and i fear death less and less if an angel came down from the sky and told me i\u2019ll die in my sleep tonight i wouldn\u2019t care\u2026 and if anything i would be relieved to be free from this hell",

    "selftext": "Last Monday I watched my grandma from my dad\u2019s side pass away early in the morning. Now yesterday my grandma from my mom\u2019s side landed in the hospital due to passing cysts and having a mass in her bladder. \n\nShe keeps passing a lot of blood, and her option is basically surgery but since she is too weak for anesthesia, she has to have a blood transfusion. She is a JW (Jehovah Witness) and their big thing is they can accept any medical procedure or help besides blood transfusions. \n\nWe are in a small town and we have limited alternatives. My grandma gave partial power of attorney to a couple people in her congregation, including her brother which he is also part of that but more level headed. We have a random guy from the Kingdom Hall that keeps coming to \u201ccheck on her\u201d but in reality he is making sure she doesn\u2019t accept the transfusion. My mom and aunt are tired of him. \n\n\nI talked to my grandma yesterday before leaving her and basically reassuring her even though she is 84 she still has an outstanding quality of life, she drives, lives on her own, sees friends etc. &amp; it would be okay to look the other way if it could save your life. My grandma said \u201cmaybe if I was younger.\u201d \nAfter some thought, I get it. The KH is her community, if she accepted the transfusion it wouldn\u2019t be a secret and I am sure they would disfellowship her and that would cause more harm I am sure. \n\n\nI am just angry, I am angry that I am losing another grandma in a 2 week span, I am angry at her faith and the people in it. I am just mad. I haven\u2019t dealt with a lot of death and now it feels like I am getting the ringer. \n\nI learned a lot about these medical/ethical dilemmas in school but I never thought it\u2019d happen in my family. I always knew about the blood thing, but id never thought my grandma would be in this situation. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: I lost one grandma last week, now my other grandma is in the hospital for a life threatening thing and she won\u2019t accept a blood transfusion because of her religion and her congregation put eyes on her and us to ensure we don\u2019t persuade her to do it. \n\n\nThank you for reading, I just had to get this off my chest. Everything will be ok in the end I know. Death is apart of life. \n\nEdit: thank you everyone for your condolences and sharing your lived experiences around this. A couple of things, I know this religion was my grandmas whole life. If she wants to go this way then in the end I\u2019ll support her. I just can\u2019t fathom the influence of religion, but I know that it\u2019s not me. I know she is at an old age and she will just get worse as years go on. I guess it just kind of sucks that a religion is dictating on her medical problems. But if she is happy then that\u2019s all that matters and I need to find a way to not be angry at her for it. ",

    "selftext": "This happened just a few months ago, but everyone around me hasn\u2019t mentioned it since the night it happened. \n\nMy dad was neglected, physically and (from what I\u2019ve gathered in conversations) sexually abused as a child. His mother started him on hard drugs before the age of 10. By age 14 he was dealing to her. He hasn\u2019t had anything close to an easy life. But he wanted nothing more than to turn his life around when he had me. \n\nHe and my mom had me at 18 and 19, and were married about 4 months after my birth. As far back as I can remember, their marriage always had issues. It wasn\u2019t easy for my mom, being married to an addict. He stayed clean for the majority of my childhood, but I know he had relapses along the way.\n\nDespite the issues, my parents have built a good life for me and my siblings. Money\u2019s tight sometimes but we never are in need of anything. My dad is clean and works a good paying job, my mom works at the elementary school in our small town.\n\nBut the last two years I\u2019ve seen a huge change in how my dad was acting. He was irritable, constantly arguing with my mom, and threatening divorce. \n\nThis all came to a breaking point one night when my parents, both considerably drunk, were having some meaningless argument fueled by alcohol and resentment. In the middle of the argument, my dad just got up and left the house. \n\nI watched him walk into the garage, shutting to door behind himself. I figured he was just taking some time to cool off, so I didn\u2019t think much of it. \n\nAbout 20 minutes later my mom came to me crying telling me to go check in on him. (I now know that he had been mentioning taking his life to her in private.)\n\nI went and opened the garage door and found my dad crying at a table with a ladder and rope in the middle of the garage. I didn\u2019t even look at him, I was staring at the ladder. I didn\u2019t know what to say. His first response to me walking in was being angry with me. He told me if I thought that he was going to kill himself that way, I was wrong. He said he had much better methods of doing so. \n\nI didn\u2019t leave, and I didn\u2019t respond. I sat down on the other side of the garage and we sat in silence. Eventually he began crying profusely and telling me he didn\u2019t know how to deal with himself anymore, and I started crying too. \n\nHe told me I didn\u2019t have to worry about him, put the ladder and rope away, and told me to go back in the house. But it still didn\u2019t feel right to me. Before I went inside I walked over to him without saying a word and hugged him. We stayed that way for a few minutes, both crying. When we stepped back he grabbed a pistol from his waistband and handed it to me. I took it inside without a word and made sure it was put back into the safe with the ammo separate. \n\nWe never mentioned this night again, and it\u2019s been eating me alive from the inside out. ",

    "selftext": "I've been following this community for quite some time now and I can finally come here to get something off my chest:\n\n\nMost of the posts in here or other communities that ask for an opinion or advice of what to do in their romantic relationship: you know what to do.\n\n\nYou are searching reassurance, which is very important and valid, sometimes we just need to feel validated to fire in us the courage to do what's needed to save ourselves from a bad situation. \n\n\nYour post is important.\n\n\nHowever, 9 out of 10: you know what needs to be done. Tbh, if you needed to come to reddit, post a personal problem you're having with your partner because you \"tried several times to talk to them\" or you \"are afraid of their reaction to say XYZ\".... I mean, if your voice isn't enough for your partner to care about you and really try finding a solution together; or if you are \"walking on eggshells\" with your partner, or if you \"been through the same discussion time and time again with no change nor even honest attempt to deal with said issue\",  you have a much deeper problem than the problem you came here to solve with our help.\n\n\nWhen communication is staled, cut, avoided or violently pushed away, this is THE MAIN factor to end any kind of relationship. \n\n\nIt's not that redditors like to say \"break up\" to all posts,it's just that there is really no one can do if your relationship is one-way street in communication. Really. \n\n\nWe would love you to thrive and be happy with your loved one, but if your partner doesn't consider you enough to try to solve a problem after you offering solutions and all, what other advice can we give to you?\n\n\nAnd you know it.\n\n\nDo not feel discouraged to post, though. We will reassure you and most of comments really want you to have a good relationship and be happy. \n\n\nWish you all the courage and happiness. For real.",

Their relationship made me insanely insecure, and it broke me.  \n\nThey were always together in a way that made me uncomfortable. I grew up with divorced parents, and they never spent holidays together or took me out as a family. It was always separate, two houses, two rooms, two holidays.  \nBut them? They always went out together with the kids. I went a few times too, but once, a street vendor called them a \"beautiful couple.\" And what was I supposed to be? The babysitter? A friend? It felt like everyone saw them as a couple.  \nWere they physically close? No, not really. I know I might sound crazy, but it was the way they talked to and treated each other.  \n\nI know I was wrong, I know what I did to her was awful. But I got to a place I never wanted to be. I was so desperate to keep him that I was the one who proposed. And he just\u2026 accepted. Like he was agreeing to give a coworker a ride home.
