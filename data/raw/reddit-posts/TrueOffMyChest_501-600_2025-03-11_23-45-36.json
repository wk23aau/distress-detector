    "selftext": "So, my girlfriend (32) and I (30M) have been together for almost a year now and everything is going really well. There have been Ups and Downs in our sex life in the past because of several health reasons, but recently we both feel like our sex really took off. I was kind of inexperienced before I met her so there are a lot of firsts for me.\nA few weeks ago we started experimenting some more and talked about things we'd wanna try, and even watched some video footage of those things to get some ideas and stuff.\n\nI told her that I'd experimented with butt play on myself in the past and I would like to try that during sex (not talking about pegging here). We ended up buying a whole bunch of toys and stuff for both of us including some buttplugs.\nLast night we ended up really tipsy and horny so I suggested giving it a try.\nWe did... And at first it was really nice and hot. We both enjoyed it and had some fun UNTIL all of a sudden I felt the plug pop out. We stopped, and looked around everywhere but the plug was nowhere to be found. That was the moment we realized the (moderately big) plug, even though it had a wide base, got sucked up my butt and was in fact stuck there.\nI straight up fucking panicked and my gf said she could see the terror in my face. I instantly felt sick and started sweating, felt like throwing up. So it was like, do we go to the ER or what do we do?! I preferred not becoming one of those embarrassing sex accident ER stories...\nSo we decided to try and get it out ourselves. I kneeled on my bathroom floor with my upper body leaning over my bathtub because I felt like I'll throw up.\nAnd yeah... My girlfriend basically had to use half her hand trying to fish it out real deep up my butt. It hurt like shit and when it finally got out I was grossed out, felt violated, exhausted and traumatized. I ended up in fetal position in my bathroom with my girlfriend nearly crying for having to hurt me.\n\nMy butt still hurts today and was bleeding a bit this morning and I'm severely traumatized. Even though I'd love to keep trying this, I don't know if I'll ever be able to trust a plug again.\nMy girlfriend did an amazing job being there for me and preventing me from going into a full panic attack so we kinda bonded over this even more. All in all a very traumatic but kind of funny story, I wanted to share! \n\n",

I mean, I've known him for years, and we've been through thick and thin together. But when I stumbled upon her videos, my mind was blown. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. She's doing some extremely hardcore stuff - I'm talking multiple giant cock gangbangs, and her body is just... wow. She has a gigantic ass that seems to be the center of attention in almost every scene.\n\nAt first, I felt a mix of emotions - shock, curiosity, and a little bit of jealousy, I won't lie. I've always thought of my friend as a bit of a shy guy, so it's hard to imagine him with someone who's so... outgoing. But as I watched more of her videos, I started to feel a twinge of concern. I mean, this is a whole different world that I'm not familiar with, and I worry about my friend getting hurt or caught up in something that's not good for him.\n\nBut at the same time, I have to admit that I'm also kind of fascinated. I've never seen anything like this before, and it's like my eyes are glued to the screen. I feel like I'm getting a glimpse into a secret world that most people don't know about, and it's both thrilling and terrifying.\n\nI don't know how to process all of this, to be honest. Part of me wants to talk to my friend about it, to ask him if he's okay and if he knows what he's getting himself into. But another part of me is afraid of judgment, of being seen as a hypocrite or a voyeur. I mean, who am I to judge what he's doing or who he's dating?\n\nAll I know is that my mind is reeling, and I don't know how to reconcile my feelings about this.

Mind you, he had stopped speaking to me in April 2024, and then randomly texted me from a new number in December or November? But nonetheless I was elated to have him as a friend again. Me and him have bonded over the few months that we were talking, and all of a sudden, he doesn\u2019t answer.

    "selftext": "My sister stole an earring of mine, I'm sure. A long, fringed earring with a rhinestone on the head that I could remove that I bought about three years ago. It was my absolute favorite, basically the only one I wore and I wore it everywhere, it was perfect for everything, I didn't even need another one.\n\nI wore it to a party in December, and I clearly remember taking it off inside the house and putting it in my jewelry box. But when I went to wear it again, where was it? It doesn't make sense. I didn't lose that earring, I put it where it should have been, but someone took it, didn't tell me and to this day has never given it back to me.\n\nI live with my mother, two sisters and my grandfather; and my aunt is the neighbor in the apartment across the hall, and she and her daughter have complete access to my house. I've already gone to everyone, calmly asked if they had taken it, if they had borrowed it and forgotten to return it; everyone said no.\n\nBut here's the thing: my older sister is a bitch. She comes into my room and takes my stuff. She's already finished my perfume, makeup, skincare, hair products - expensive stuff. She complains when I complain, she takes absolutely no care with anything. My whole life has been like this with her, and my whole life I've complained to my mother about it - but my mother just told me to keep my stuff away from her. It's kind of hard when we live in the same house, but it's okay.\n\nShe's already taken some of my jewelry and broken it. When I was a kid, she took three of my rings and returned them to me broken that same night, but I was a kid and the rings had cost 30 reais in total.\n\nWhen I was 17, she took a pair of earrings that my aunt gave me for my 15th birthday, big earrings with stones, more expensive, but besides everything else, a gift, the same thing happened, they disappeared and one day, rummaging through her room, I found them broken; She didn't even bother to show it to me. This one caused me problems, but this woman had the nerve to tell me to my face \"I'm not going to buy another one, they're too expensive\" with the utmost disdain in the world, and my mother did nothing. I kept up the conversation for a while, telling her that she was an irresponsible idiot who had stolen my earrings, but it was no use, and at 17 years old, what was I going to do? Sue her for a pair of earrings? Alone, even more so, because my mother wouldn't help me.\n\nBrother, this story about that earring that she broke has been cooking in me all these years and, along with everything I went through with her in my childhood, God, I hate this woman.\n\nNow, the same thing happened. My earring disappeared and there was absolute silence. I know she has it, I know she took it. But it was in December, it's already March. I've asked her on separate occasions if she took my earring and she said no. I've already gone to her room and turned everything upside down looking for those earrings and I couldn't find them (I found other things of mine that I hadn't even noticed were not even with me anymore). I want to look in her bag, but she won't let me, she'll get stressed and throw them to my mother who will be on her side like she always is.\n\nBrother, I'm going to go crazy because sometimes I stop and think about this piece of crap earring that I know she took. I know I didn't lose it, I know where I put it; if it had been my fault, if I had left it at the party where I wore it, if I had put it in my bag and it disappeared, if it had fallen on the street, I know I would have gotten over it by now; but no, it disappeared in my house, in the place where it should be, someone took it. The only person who has the nerve to steal it from me and act like the biggest sly person there is. Practically every week I end up staging fights and fights with her, demanding that she give me back the earrings that I know she stole, but she'll turn the story around and I'll leave like a crazy person because I've already looked in her room and nothing. And I swear that, for real, if I found that piece of shit earring with her I would sue her, now I would sue her. It costs a lot less than the earring she broke, but I don't care. I just want my earring, I just want that bitch to give me back what's mine because I know she has it.",

Essentially I find a big pregnant belly extremely attractive and the thought of the women's breasts, hips butt, getting bigger very attractive. It is purely objective/visual and I have had this ever since I was young. I have always felt very uncomfortable with having this fetish. Pregnancy is normally thought of as an amazing beautiful thing which to most people means 'baby' on the way. I also see it this way but separate to that I have this fetish as well. I worry that if someone hears pregnancy fetish that they will immediately think that this is some sicko thing for unborn babies or just not understand what the hell that kind of fetish is or what it means and immediately feel uncomfortable. Don't get me wrong, I'm not planning on openly telling people but as my peer group enters the 'having kids' stage of life I am feeling weird about it. I know that society has changed quite a lot but fetishes are still very taboo and make a lot of people uncomfortable. Sometimes I wish I didn't have the fetish just so I wouldn't have to deal with the mixed feeling. The only person who knows about it as an ex girlfriend of mine. I worry sometimes that she might tell people about it and I would feel very embarrassed and not know how to deal with it / friends looking at me differently.

Our dumb late-night conversations were the only thing keeping me sane.\n\nBy September, my parents were worse\u2014and so was I. My grades were bad no matter how much I studied. And the girl who helped me escape started playing mind games, making things worse.\n\nThen in October, my parents got better. They were laughing, eating together, and finally acting like themselves again. I thought life was turning around.\n\nBut a few days before my birthday, I got a phone call. One of my childhood best friends had died from cancer. That was my breaking point.\n\nAt his funeral, my brother cried. Everyone cried\u2014except me. At the grave, surrounded by people sobbing, I felt like an outcast. I wanted to cry. I should have cried. But I couldn\u2019t.\n\nThat night, I sat in the shower, eyes red as hell, trying so desperately to cry. But nothing. I just wanted to feel human again.\n\nI held it together until February. That\u2019s when the girl told me she loved me. I said it back, and for the first time in months, I thought maybe life was finally giving me something good.\n\nBut now, for the past eight days, I\u2019ve done nothing but eat, sleep, and doom-scroll. I haven\u2019t gone to the gym. I haven\u2019t studied. I haven\u2019t done anything. And I have an important test in three days. I\u2019m stressed, but I don\u2019t even care.\n\nAnd to make it worse, the girl who said she loved me is playing the same mind games again. I don\u2019t understand why. I thought I finally had something good, but now I just feel like an idiot.\n\nI feel like everyone\u2019s life is moving forward except mine. I\u2019ve been stuck since July, and I don\u2019t know how to fix it.\n\nNobody knows anything about this. It\u2019s just me, alone, going through all of this by myself.\n\nI just feel lost, scared, and overwhelmed, so please, what\u2019s happening to me? What do I do?\n\n(Small note: I finally cried actual tears today, and I don\u2019t even know how to feel about it.)",

    "selftext": "Y\u2019all, I\u2019m struggling. There\u2019s so much, and I\u2019m not faultless. Mother &amp; Daddy divorced before my 5th birthday. Mother \u201clet\u201d my older half-brother* live with his bio-dad once he turned 13. Mother also was diagnosed as bipolar in the 1960s and was treated far too long on lithium. I get this logically, but emotionally.,,I always lost out. \n\nMy mother &amp; my aunt/:her sister have always found a common ground. They\u2019ve had typical sister disagreements over the years*but* have always been each other\u2019s biggest advocates. Point is my mother was not a bad person. \n\nAround my 5th grade year I tuned into fashion. I wanted what I liked, not her cutesy smocked dresses, etc. listen I am now as Southern as can be\u2026I have a ridiculous amount of monogrammed items and would/will happily support a smocked personalized/monogrammed adult dress! There\u2019s no shame in my game. Whatever I buy for my niece will have a matching auntie(or mom) part! ***\n\nWhen my older half-brother was 12, he went to live with his father. After my older brother\u2019s death when I was 12 myself, I was sent to *my* father and his wife and my younger half-brothers. To this day, we are all full siblings in each other\u2019s eyes. My daddy raised my older brother, and his final wife helped raise us. This stepmom loves me and adopted me. \nToday, on the anniversary of my husband\u2019s death, I learned that my bio mother passed away 6 days ago. Our last visit was very pleasant; neither of us drug up the past. However I am struggling with the fact that the hospital (where I used to work, and still love) did not notify me, my aunt, or the temporary Power of Attorney. I\u2019ve been out of reach for a couple of years so a family friend stepped in as mPoA, knowing my mother\u2019s wishes. My aunt &amp; I have consistently been listed in medical records as emergency contacts. No one from the hospital contacted my aunt, me, or the mPoA.\nMy mother\u2019s body has been unclaimed in the hospital morgue for 6 days. 6 days!!!\nHow am I supposed to feel? \n\nTL;dr: my bio mom passed away 6 days ago in the hospital. They disregarded all emergency contacts listed and her temporary medical PoA in my absence. Her body has been unclaimed in the morgue for almost a week. They told my aunt on Monday that she had been discharged(blatant lie). There\u2019s a lot to unpack but she was my mother. We had a lovely visit before I left town 3 weeks ago. I\u2019m so furious that her body has been \u201cunclaimed\u201d in the hospital morgue. \nNote: I loved this healthcare system. I spent almost a decade of my career in their local hospital Admin. When I was very, very sick, this staff literally saved my life. I\u2019ve been so loyal until this circumstance\u2026",

    "selftext": "It was just my almost 2 year old son and me in the house. Dogs were outside and I was at the kitchen table doing my makeup getting ready for work as I was supposed to leave in 2hrs. The doorbell rang and I ignored it for a couple minutes. It's not uncommon for solicitors to try and sell shit. I slowly walked up to my front door peephole and looked out. There was a man standing with his back to the door blocking most of my view and then a second man was out at my curb back also facing my door kinda looking around. I started to get nervous and slowly turned the lock on the front doorknob so he wouldn't hear I was on the other side. \n\nImportant to note: my mom's transmission went out last week so she's borrowing my car. No cars in the driveway or in front on the street. But the TV was on playing a kid show for my toddler so he wouldn't miss my presence as much while getting ready. \n\nI watched him for a bit and decided he'd probably leave soon and started walking away. That's when I heard my glass door open. I thought I'd hear him knock next but instead I got to watch as my front door knob started jiggling like someone was trying to get in. And then I froze. Instead of getting my husband's gun to protect myself and my child I did nothing. I just froze. He fiddled with the door knob for a bit and then eventually walked away. I peeped out the kitchen window and watched as this dude met up with his buddy and then they started walking away. \n\nI texted my husband instead of calling the police. He's the one that did. He told me to call them because they wanted to ask me questions, and so I did. Then when I tried to call my phone said I had to connect to a wifi or network to make a call. My bill is paid every month on the 2nd and I was connected to wifi. Just another thing that was going wrong. The police had to call me back and ask if I was ok to even talk to them. When the police did show up they said the guys were solicitors and it's illegal in the city to do that. We even have 2 no soliciting signs taped to the glass door. She said her partner found them up the street and was kicking them out of the neighborhood. Since there was no proof they tried to enter the house nothing could be done. The only thing they could do was drive up to the company and tell them that if they walk onto our property again they will have trespassing charges filed and the company will receive a citation. \n\nAt the end of it all I'm extremely shaken. I didn't do anything right except lock the door. I didn't tell them to go away. I didn't call 911. I didn't get a weapon. I just locked the door and then watched as they tried to get in, texted my husband, and then did what I was told. I cried for a long time after. I'm still not doing great. If I hadn't locked that door I really don't know what could've happened. If you've read this far thank you, I just really needed to get this off my chest and out. ",

But I really tried to work through it and honor our vows. But the last years before we opened our marriage and went ENM I thought about your death more than once. I never thought about killing you but about you dying and freeing me from my vow. I resented you.

    "selftext": "I am a 26 year old guy born in 1998. I\u2019m going to sound crazy in this whole rant. \n\nWhen I was 18 in 2016/2017, I became curious how others were perceiving me. I thought I looked young and still had the teenage look. As someone born in 1998, it wasn\u2019t my turn to be 20+ yet, I was still a teenager. Growing up, people born in the early 90\u2019s and mid 90\u2019s seemed to look more mature than me and I thought it was obvious that I was younger. \n\nI began posting pictures of myself to Yahoo Answers and Facebook \u201cguess my age challenges\u201d and asked people to guess. **Every picture I posted, there was at least one person or a few people who guessed correctly that I was 18. That gave me validation** Yet I also heard 23, 24, 25 etc and that felt super weird at the time. I felt weirded out and uncomfortable because I just didn\u2019t understand how/why I was being perceived as much older if there were people who were guessing my age correctly. I remember feeling upset even if I heard 20. I suffer from OCD too and numbers are very triggering for me. They were adding on years to my life and that just made me feel very restless and I felt absolutely disgusted. I was like **Omg i\u2019m still a teenager and I\u2019m being seen as old??Do I have an abnormal appearance, what\u2019s wrong with my development.** But at the same time there were many people online who guessed correctly that I was 18. I remember one picture someone told me I looked like a teen and that she thought I was 14/15 but another person thought I was 23. Another picture, 4 people thought I was 15-19 yet another person thought I was 24. One picture someone guessed correctly I was 18 but another person said \u201cearly 20s unless you have brilliant skincare regime\u201d. I also uploaded a picture of myself with glasses once and someone thought I was 17 or 18 yet another person said 20-25. I was like 25!!?? And that haunted me for several years. I constantly kept having intrusive thoughts about these extreme perceptions and suffered so much. I even had to see a doctor and psychiatrist and took medication to try and stop the intrusive thoughts. I made a vow in September 2017 to stop posting.\n\nIn real life, many people thought I was a teen in school and asked me what grade I was in but at the same time some people thought I was past university age and doing my masters. It just felt super weird. This kept happening to me throughout university. People asking me what grade I was in (being shocked that I was university) and a few people who thought I was past university age. I will never forget September 2019. A guy born in 1992 told me that I looked younger than 21 to him and still looked like a teen but the day after that, a lady thought that I was older than my then 29 year old sister (1990) and kept saying she looked really young like 22ish and I wasn\u2019t even 22 then like wtf.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I suffer from OCD and constantly had intrusive thoughts that I was filthy and disgusting because years were being added onto my life and I wondered what I was going to look like when I was actually 23-25. These numbers were disgusting in my mind. I also developed Body Dysmorphia and hated my appearance. I didn\u2019t mind being perceived as young but wondered what was it about my face that made me look old to others??? How could I look young and old at the same time? \n\nThen when I was actually 23/24, 2 people asked me what grade I was in and a few days before I turned 25 in 2023, someone asked me if my school was closed for summer break. But then in January 2024, someone asked me if I was 25 and I was like omg have i looked 25 for the past decade?? Am I living in some sort of time warp??\n\nNow I\u2019m 26 and many people ask me if I\u2019m a student of a postsecondary institute (uber drivers, restaurant/cafe owners, people helping me in stores etc) That\u2019s a common perception many people have of me. But I have a sneaking suspicion that history is going to repeat itself in a new context and that a new trend will form that I\u2019ve got to be 30, or 30+ when I\u2019m technically not even in my late 20s yet. This is why I don\u2019t post pictures online and avoid socializing with people. Because I\u2019m afraid history is going to repeat itself again and that I\u2019ll suffer again. I\u2019d much rather be alone than be around people who have the potential to make me uncomfortable in my own skin. I wasn\u2019t uncomfortable withy appearance until I became aware that some people have extreme perceptions of me. I also get really angry like why are most people so stupid and unable to read my face??? \n\nSometimes I just wish I could stay locked up in a tower like Rapunzel away from the whole world so that no one can ever see my face again. I\u2019m also pretending to be Evil Queen now as a coping mechanism. Someone obsessed with her appearance, constantly needing validation and being vindictive towards those who challenge her identity. \n",

I need help and I know that but I'm scared to tell my therapist about it as it's weird to just tell someone in real life \"I think I have a porn addiction\" so my social anxiety has stopped me.

    "selftext": "I live in a multi family apartment complex with my lover, who stays at home most of the day when I'm at work. At one point, our door was getting knocked on twice, sometimes three times a day, multiple times a week. I hold no hostility towards Mormons, but it is kind of annoying being interrupted while cooking or working at 8pm. It was often enough that I noticed when it no longer happened. \n\nWe are very obviously a gay couple, so I figured at some point or another they put that together and stopped coming. I was wrong. Turns out my lover, who is (lovingly and in their own words) \"built like a brick shithouse\", answered the door fresh-out-the-shower wet and in one of my silk robes at some point in the middle of the day, and they have avoided the building since. I still see them in the neighborhood but never on our floor.\n\nmy lover just confessed this during couple's game night and I just started crying laughing. It's been months. They never told me because they were sure they had stretched my robe out in the shoulders and didn't want to upset me. I personally think they look great in tight clothes but I can understand why seeing a big, burly ginger man in a barely closed, ill fitting silk robe could get us put on a religious shit list. Maybe it's just a coincidence (and what lucky guys, either way. They never wear anything like that when I'm home.) but regardless it's so silly. ",

Annie (fake name) and i are both in our 30s, both single, we talk constantly- we are either texting through the day or voice noting each other while we are driving. Everyone at work thinks we are a couple and are constantly asking if something is going on, unfortunately nothing ever has. \n\nI've been in love with her since I first met her. She's just so beautiful and smart and funny, there's nothing I don't love about her. She's a great mom too and I've been partially filling a void in her sons life of a male role model. \nAnyway on to the incident. We were out for dinner after work. I had asked her out knowing I was going to finally confess my feelings, but she didn't know that was my intention, we get dinner regularly enough. \n\nWhile eating we were gossiping about work and about a new project we are starting. It'll be us two and a guy called Craig (m 50s). Craig has asked me out multiple times to the point its definitely an ongoing joke. He knows I'm interested in women only and we have a great working relationship. Annie makes a comment about us having some late nights working coming up and I better watch out for Craig's advances, I joke that I guess everyone just wants to kiss me, she says not everyone. OK not a great start. I say well speaking of kissing and she cuts me off and just says \"please dont\".\n\nI just said ok. We both got fairly quiet. Finished our dinner with some small talk and work chat. Went our separate ways and haven't spoken since. It's been 2 days. I'm just so sad and lonely without her. I miss her son. I want to talk to her so much, but I know I can't keep this situation going on or I'll lose my sanity. I'm going to look for a new job. Maybe actually start dating women. In time I hope I can be a real friend to her. I feel bereaved. If anyone has been through this type of situation and has any advice please let me know. ",

    "selftext": "\n\nYesterday, my parents went out to attend a family function, leaving me alone at home. The first time my dad left me alone at night, I felt a little scared. After all, for a girl, spending the night alone in a big house isn\u2019t always easy. But this time, it was completely different\u2014I felt calm, confident, and absolutely at peace.\n\nWhat surprised me the most was that my parents didn\u2019t call me even once to check whether I had eaten or done my work. Not because they forgot, but because they know I am responsible enough to handle everything. Being the eldest daughter of the house, I have always been expected to take care of things on my own.\n\nWith \u20b9200 in hand from my dad, I first treated myself to chhole bhature. Later, I managed to earn \u20b91000 by sending some rice, so now I had even more freedom to enjoy!\n\nFor lunch, I had paneer curry with rice, and at night, I went full feast mode\u2014pizza and pasta while watching Tenali Rama on TV. No one to disturb, no distractions\u2014just me, my food, and my favorite show! After that, I enjoyed gulab jamun and ended the night with a cold Thums Up, making the day feel even better.\n\nThe best part? This time, I didn\u2019t feel scared at all. Sleeping alone, which once felt a little uneasy, now felt completely normal.\n\nWhat I realized was something even bigger. Every night, when my family is around, I feel lonely. But when they weren\u2019t there, I understood that I don\u2019t actually need anyone to feel complete. If someone doesn\u2019t want to be with me, I can still live happily on my own. As the eldest daughter, I have often been ignored because of my younger brother. But now, I\u2019ve finally understood\u2014there is nothing wrong with being alone.\n\nThis morning, I woke up, spent some time soaking in the warm sunlight on the terrace, and now I\u2019m making myself a cup of tea. After this, I\u2019ll do some housework, and before my parents return, I\u2019ll prepare a meal for them.\n\nHonestly, this experience made me realize that being alone doesn\u2019t mean being lonely. It\u2019s peaceful, freeing, and fun! No unnecessary stress, no chaos\u2014just me, my time, and pure happiness.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "I'm 14 years old and have told two of my friends briefly about this but I feel like I'll annoy them if I speak about it more. I just want to get this off my chest and put my experience somewhere in hopes it'll make me feel better. I'm also posting this here because I don't want anyone to try and intervene, it'll just make everything worse. Content warning for violence as well, but suicide is mentioned first so I used that flair, sorry.\n\nMy mom is an okay mom most of the time, but she's very quick to anger and has total freakouts over small things that always result in herself threatening to kill herself, or saying she's going to kill herself. I have a little brother who is 13, and my mom is 45 with a history of suicidal thoughts and one attempt before we were born, which she told us about. \n\nWhenever we get into huge fights, she usually takes my stuff and threatens to destroy/burn it (she never does), she never let's me talk and always screams over me, and then of course she threatens to kill herself and says it's because of me and my brother and she says we ruined her life. I can understand why she resents us to an extent, my brother and I are rape babies and we look like our dad. On the topic of him, he's an abusive rapist who was/is addicted to drugs, and who hasn't been in our lives since I was 3. He has gone off the radar for a few years and nobody knows where he is. My mom keeps threatening to send us back to him and has shown us her text in him multiple times telling him she's done with us and that he needs to come get us. He never has, obviously. The last few times we've gotten in fights I never even yelled once and just keep talking calmly because I heard that helps calm angry people down, it doesn't work she just keeps yelling, and there's even been a few times when I do raise my voice that she literally covers her ears and says \"lalalala\" like a toddler until I stop talking. \n\nAfter she threatens this, she usually leaves the house and says she's never coming back and says we can live with our grandmother. She says either that she's gonna drive off a cliff, into a brick wall, etc etc, or that she'll just straight up abandon us and start a new life somewhere. Then she'll come back some time later and act like nothing happened, very rarely she'll apologize but if I ever try and bring up what she's done again when she's calm, she'll just get enraged again. I've tried talking to her about it through text only once when she was out of the house, sending her a lengthy few paragraphs about my concerns, but she responded back basically just shaming me, and when she came home she was angry and she said she showed the text to all of her friends, which are mostly my friends parents, and she said they don't like me anymore and I won't be able to hang out with any of my friends anymore. I started avoiding all of my friends and eventually began online school because of this, and now my mom claims all my friends and their parents miss me and they don't understand why I don't talk to them anymore. I don't know what to believe anymore.\n\nWhen she isn't in these weird freak out modes she's an okay mom but she snaps at random stuff before flipping like a switch and being happy again. Just yesterday she was yelling and slamming around her computer because she couldn't upload her photos to Facebook, she's a photographer. A few people had just been over to fix our dryer about an hour earlier, which has been broken for months, so mid yelling at her computer she just got up and went to go text out the new dryer and then when it worked she was all smiles and apologized for yelling.\n\nShe also frequently tells me and my brother that we're the only thing keeping her alive and that she would probably kill herself without us, and she's told us multiple times that she doesn't own a gun because she's afraid that when we grow up and move out she'll kill herself because she has no one to rely on anymore. This scares me and I want to move away for college when I'm grown, I planned on leaving this household as soon as possible, but I don't really want to anymore because she keeps saying things like that. She says stuff like that and says she loves me and my brother, but then says the exact opposite when she gets really angry and says she wants to die because of us and she blames everything she's mad at on us \"stressing her out\". She's also gotten physical with me and my brother multiple times, like digging her nails into the back of my neck and holding my face into a pillow because I wouldn't give her my phone because she said she was gonna break it, chokeholding me and dragging me out of me room before locking me out of my room and tearing it apart because I hid my art tablet from her, and more. She's done stuff with my brother too and I'm ashamed to admit this but I don't know what because whenever she's mad at him I just hide in my room so I won't get punished for helping him. He does the same when she does that stuff with me. I only know she hurts him because I can hear it. \n\nI don't want to call the police, I'm scared and I don't want to live with my grandma or in a foster home or anywhere else and I don't want to be separated from my brother and pets. She actually encourages me to call the police on her and says she'd rather go to jail than live with us. I just want to explain to her how her her actions hurt me and my brother and I want to get her to stop. There's been periods of times where everything has been fine for a while and my family is just a normal happy family and I cry sometimes thinking about how that's what my family could be like if my mom wasn't the way she was. I know I'm doing it to myself at this point by not calling the police but I'm just scared and keep hoping things will change.\n\nRight now is one of those times where everything's fine, my mom is currently talking to my brother, offering to clean off the couch and sit and braid his hair while they watch the movie together. We're all acting like nothing's wrong. I just wish my family could be this way all the time.",

Never really been into a relationship, but I do have some good friends and a loving familt, for the most part. Still, there is something wrong with me. I look around sometimes and hear shared experiences from other people about romantic adventures or success on their jobs and I feel like I want that. It's not jealousy, mind you, it's more of a self questioning as to where have I been if not doing all that stuff?\n\nMy current situation is my fault, and I understand it's not good and even then, I don't have the strength or willpower or whatever you may call it to change it. It's like part of me wants to experience the world and... I guess a good way to explain it is, I want to want to do stuff, but I don't know what or how to start.\n\nStarting things is another problem of mine. I know what needs to be done and even so starting things is so difficult that it's insane. Normally that could be ruled out as being lazy or procastination but frankly, I've putting things off for 30 years, the problem has to be something else right? Currently, I know that I should be sitting down to work on programming projects to create portfolios and help me get employes but doing so is... hard. Not as in, programming is hard, it's not that. I'm also not scared of making mistakes, I embrace them as an opportunity of learning. It's a mix of not knowing where or how to start and perhaps a disbelief that it is going somewhere? I even thought at some point this might be related to me playing too much games or watching too many shows but even if I cut all that off, I still won't do what I need. I'll spend time laying in bed, overthinking, planning too much for stuff I never have the guts to get done.\n\nI guess you could call me a leech, but I don't feel like it's the case. I don't take pride nor plan on taking advantage of my dad's kindness forever, but I just feel... lost? It's always been hard for me to set goals to achieve because I feel like I don't really have anything. I can feel content with so little and that's maybe the reason why I never try and get more. I don't consider myself ambitious: Having fancy stuff or being famous or helping people... None of that stuff really pushes me forward. And those are the common stuff that people want so how can I move forward without a good reason to?\n\nThere are things I'm interested in, yeah. Like learning languages. But also some stuff I'd love to try and have no money for right now like woodworking maybe, music and theater.\n\nI still feel like a kid, frozen in time watching it go by and desperately trying to grow up but failing miserably. And although I umderstand there is no point in thinking too hard about my past mistakes that led here, I'm scared that I'm forever trapped in this loop of not being able to move on. I want to escape, but am not sure what I should do. Therapy would help I feel but I'll only be able to afford it when I manage to get a job. I'm hoping I'll manage to get my first internship this year and maybe talking to someone would help me figure things out. Sure, I have friends, but I don't feel like I have a safe space to be vulnerable with them or anyone else in my family.\n\nI always thought, back then, that I would have this figured out by now. Sometimes I think all it's needed is a small change that gets other things in motion, so lately I've been trying to do that. Doing things differently, trying to experimenting new stuff. I recently created a routine to try and force myself to do stuff; It hasn't helped much so far because even if I write things down I end up forgetting to look at the list or just can't bring myself to do it but on good days, I actually get a small amount of stuff done.\n\nI'm the kind of person who tries to understand and look for a purpose on everything and this here is kind pointless. This post went nowhere and is not going anywhere. Kinda like my life so far. It's funny to think that. But that's why I decided to do it. I'm not sure things will work out and despite hearing positive encouragement from my friends, still can't see much of a future for me but I'll keep doing what I can and trying my best, even if it's not the most optimal for a normal human being.\n\nIf you actually managed to read this far, my apologies for this mess. I wrote as the thougts came, no organization or anything. \n\nI hope someday I understand myself and determine my purpose.",

And honestly i really hate how people now forget that love its the thing that moves the world, love for power, money, for people, etc. So i honestly really want to love someone and feel a unique connection even if it last just a week, i want to feel something real sometimes. But then I think about life, specifically in my country where I can only focus on having a decent career a d get money to pay the future bills. \nI really like being single as I have to give explanations to no one when i go out or stuff like that, but sometimes feeling someone's body close to yours (not in a sexual way) its all you need. \nSorry if it makes no sense, english aint my first language \ud83d\ude13, and this is mostly a venting post.

    "selftext": "Well i dont hate HATE him. I still respect my husband. He provides a lot, roof over me and our son\u2019s head, food on the table, water to drink.. yeah what am I complaining for right? I should always be grateful that im in this position, which i am. It\u2019s just there are things that still bothers me, that ruins my mood, sucking the soul out of me little by little, draining my life day by day, inch by inch. Idk if im just a whiny wife, but here are some things that messes w my head everyday:\n\n1) He NEVER puts his coffee mugs in the sink after he used them, there\u2019s always hundreds of them outside where he smokes (i told him a million times to put it in the sink after he finish using it, i dont mind washing it, JUST PUT IT IN THE FUCKING SINK) but noopee, still compiling outside the house. Til this day, i let it be, there are still 4-5 mugs outside the house, not gonna touch it ever unless he brings it in. This is so sad for me, cus he knows i got a bad eczema on my hands, so everytime i wash BUTTLOADS of dishes, i have to wear gloves, wash the gloves, dry the gloves, also wash my hands bc rubber gloves makes me itchy a bit etcetc my main point is its hell and back on earth for me to do dishes, and he\u2019s not considerate of that. We once had a big fight bc when we\u2019re at our inlaws (his fam) he fucking WASHED HIS MUG??? Huh? Since when the fuck do u do that? So you care what your family says about you instead of caring about your eczema hands wife? Yea fuck you.\n\n2) he rarely takes care of our son. I literally do everything. He only takes care of him if i told him to. Sometimes when i shower, i have to actually ask him \u2018can you watch him for a bit\u2019 he has this ugly smug face and said \u2018k\u2019 like um wtf? You\u2019re supposed to b excited?? He\u2019s your son??? You will b rarely seeing him cus you work offshore???? Get this, infront of his family, he acts so fatherly, playing with him, taking care of his diapers etc while me, if we\u2019re actually home, IM DOING ALL THE FUCKING STUFF, not him. He literally does shit IF i tell him to. He\u2019s never considerate of how tired i am 24/7. 90% of the time if I dont wanna see his smug face if i have to shower and no one is watching our son, i had to put our son in his crib and let him watch ms rachel on ipad, eventho it hurts me doing that cus im limiting his screen time. And what was my husband doing that time? PLAYING LEAGUE OF LEGENDS, and he\u2019ll be like \u2018sorry im in game, i cant quit\u2019 well fuck you. And also get this, when i found out that im pregnant and i wanted to abort it (cus i know im not ready) he was the ONE who strongly insisted to keep it cus he said he cant wait to be a dad. Well step the fuck up bro\n\n3) idk if im wrong or just exaggerating but he prioritizes his family over me and my son. If there was a fire, he would save his 4 brothers and 5 sisters instead of his wife and son. He would go to the ends of the earth for them ( once he had to deliver something car oil at 6AM for his sister n her husband, 6AM??? Mf usually wakes up at 2pm ffs. \n\n4) he has this obsession w fixing up old cars he would spend loads of money on it and w literally his blood, sweat, tears and his time. Yo i don\u2019t mind mf got a hobby, i got a hobby too, that\u2019s great for him, but wht abt when i need to shower???? Do i have to go outside to ask you to watch over our son again with your ugly smug face again?? to sum up he has 2 obsession, league of legends and his car. None of which you can bother him at all. My hobby is just gym. JUST GYM. FOR 1 HOUR. At which i can ONLY work out when my son takes his afternoon nap! I just want him to evenly schedule his hobby.. not to the point he doesn\u2019t have time for his son or me. Do u think he listens? Nah. Everytime i told him this he\u2019ll be like \u2018this is the only time i can do this, while im working at sea i cant do this stuff\u2019 im like HELLO? cars and games are forever?? Your wife and son could leave you or die anytime? wtf is his mindset mahn istg he\u2019s still acts like a teenager. I literally feel like i have 2 sons as of this time.\n\n5) his dirty clothes and socks. Need i say more? I feel like almost every wife experienced this. \n\n6) he spills his coffee and chocolate milk every where in the kitchen but never wipes it. (I once saw the mf VACUUMS his family\u2019s kitchen bc there was a spilled rice grains). Basically he\u2019s really sloppy. \n\nThere are more but that\u2019s the top of my head. Idk what I should do. Everytime i tell him whats been bothering me, we always have a huge fight and it always ends with (ok i promise i wont do it again) but he still does and its and endless cycle. I cant leave him bc I literally have no money to raise my son alone (AND my mom is getting old, so i have to take care of her too). So til now im just tolerating everything but it drains my energy so much but at the same time i put on a happy smile on my face for my son, i dont ever want my son to see depressed or angry. \n\nMind you, he used to b very sweet and thoughtful at the beginning of our dating life and marriage life. I thought he was the most amazing guy. I know he loves me and my son, but i dont think he loves me enough to change his ugly habits. ",

His brother was in the bathroom and his wife was talking to other family. So being the nosy assholes we are we listened. \n\nTurns out his brother has been having an AFFAIR on his PREGNANT WIFE. We heard the woman tell him that she wanted him to divorce his wife for her but to wait until after his wife gives birth which is in a few months.

    "selftext": "To start off, I\u2019m 27(f) with a 22(m) boyfriend. We\u2019ve been together for almost 3 years, and we met due to working together. I still cringe at our 5 year age gap. I have a friend that is 30(f) and I don\u2019t know if I am a complete a**hole for wanting to cut ties with her, or maybe I already accidentally did.\n\nThe last time I saw her, I ended up staying for a weekend which was fun at first, and we tried to drink, but we both fell asleep too fast, which her boyfriend got mad about. I did not like this boyfriend (36m) due to him constantly sleeping with his ex and being so obvious about it but she\u2019d be in this denial or whatever and cry to me constantly about it. He was also somewhat a neglectful parent to his daughter from what my friend would tell me. So anyways, the next day came and I agreed to stay an extra day to watch her two daughters, and figured I\u2019d be getting paid because we discussed it prior. Well I didn\u2019t and during this, I ended up getting bed bug bites on my neck, hands, and ankle area. Pretty much where my skin was exposed. Since leaving there I still feel like I have bugs on my skin and I\u2019m honestly afraid to ever go back. I don\u2019t know why I pick and choose when to be confrontational because I just let left and didn\u2019t say anything. I don\u2019t know whether to say anything at all. We\u2019ve talked about bedbugs before and she\u2019s said she\u2019s gotten rid of them so I don\u2019t know what to say. Fast forward a few days and she tells me her and her boyfriend (36)m broke up and she\u2019s back together with an ex (32)m. This ex (32)m was sleeping with a 17 year old girl and my friend (30f) let both of them move into her home with her two children, before they both just dipped and apparently had left the place trashed and that\u2019s when the bedbugs originally came about around this time too. Oh, and that man(32m) knew her children for a few months and was having them call him daddy. I felt so uncomfortable witnessing all of this, and then seeing what she allows herself and her children to be put through willingly. For months I was telling her xyz was not right and she\u2019d be defending herself and him (36)m until they broke up. At that point is when she is like oh I could never be with someone who does xyz and completely shitting on this man talking about everything she defended and excused, when she put up with it for months and would have continued to put up with it if he (36m) didn\u2019t have his baby momma over again to stay the night after she had been begging him to stop for months doing that for months. So I\u2019m just over it? I\u2019m like why are you actively choosing to put yourself through these things? I don\u2019t like to sugar coat things, because why the hell should I act like neglecting a child is okay just to be a girls girl? Their relationship wasn\u2019t abusive or anything like that, a lot of accusations of cheating coming from both &amp; issues starting a few days after they began dating which is never a good sign but neither were afraid of each other it wasn\u2019t like that, and she will put up with almost anything to keep a guy around and that\u2019s my issue. I used to think she was a good mom, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s that great anymore. I used to praise her when she would say she wouldn\u2019t let strangers around her kids and doesn\u2019t let anyone else watch her kids until I realized she\u2019s letting men she just met meet her kids inside her home, and be around them unsupervised. I used to think she was a good mom until I realized she raises her daughters through sugar and electronics, and doesn\u2019t really \u201cwatch\u201d even though around her children. All of these realizations have come to me now after she broke up with her long term boyfriend of 2 years(34m) and have gone through 4-5 relationships in a year and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s the person I thought she was, and I feel awful but I don\u2019t want to be around someone like that. So she has her new boyfriend ex boyfriend (32m) currently living with her again, and I sent her a message a couple days ago saying I think that he\u2019s a pedophile and I don\u2019t want to be around him to which she\u2019s never responded, but has sent other things. I know that once her and her current boyfriend (32m) break up or start having issues, she will be wanting my pity party but I can\u2019t do it anymore. I feel like I have no empathy for her anymore. If we had more to talk about than her and her relationships I feel like it wouldn\u2019t be such an issue but she has no subsidence to her at all if it is not about a man. Any advice on what you would do in my situation? It\u2019s not my life so I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so bothered. ",

    "selftext": "I hate to say that I am that guy who has been single for a really long time despite my best efforts, but I am. I (27M) haven't even been lucky enough to go on a date in like 5 or 6 years, but I have not given up hope even though things do look a bit bleak for me at the moment. I am a really busy graduate student, I try to fit in workouts and other activities too but it is pretty hard. I do not have a lot of extra energy left to put in substantial effort to find the right person for me on most weeks. So the thing I kinda wanted to get off my chest is I have been working on concepts/writing for a (fantasy) novel for a while when I get some time alone. With my life being romantically unfulfilled, I have fit in a relationship between two characters (the MC and another) to fulfill all the things that I have dreamed about. It was not really part of my original ideas for the story but it kinda just happened. Its pretty much all wholesome relationship stuff that I have never really got to have; the hand holding, the closeness, sharing feelings, tender moments, having each other's back, etc. As lame as it sounds, it has been decently fulfilling for me. There are still days that I really could use a hug even from a friend, but there is something about getting all the stuff I have always wanted on paper that has been pretty nice and comforting. Even though adding this stuff in has been satisfying for me, I am a little afraid it makes the writing worse lol, and when its all finished it makes me that much more afraid to show it to anyone. Some of my friends know I have been working on this but have no idea there's romance involved in it. I just really wanted to get off my chest I have been vicariously living out my romantic dreams through my fictional characters because I do not really have a better outlet. I think its been a healthy way to express what I am missing out on?",

    "selftext": "So I (18f) just finished volunteering for the day at my workplace (animal sanctuary) yesterday, when I got a message from my boss to see he sent me a termination letter, nothing in the message either just the letter itself, and they have ignored me since. \n\nAlso sorry this is a long one, I just have a lot of things in my head I need to sort out. \n\nSo a bit of backstory, since I was around 14 I\u2019ve been dealing with the struggles of depression, anxiety and adhd and ended up leaving school in yr10 because of it. Took a while to figure out but I ended up going to tafe to complete my cert ii and iii to become a qualified zookeeper as I\u2019ve always loved animals and can\u2019t see myself doing anything else. Because of tafe I had to start volunteering to complete the practical component of my course and ended finding this amazing sanctuary to work at. \n\nSo I ended up starting there in early February 2024 and fell in love with the place and the people. I was originally going once a week but started going twice a week in around November bc I loved it so much and wanted to be there more. They always told me they loved how I would be there consistently every week and I would pride myself on it as it was a big commitment for me as I lived an hour away. \n\nThe environment there was great, honestly I couldn\u2019t have asked for it to be any better. The owners always quite involved and prided themselves on this and wanted us to feel more like family rather than a workplace. Because of this I became quite close with the people who were on my days and considered them my second family. \n\nThe owners also lived on site and their kids were always around, because of this I became quite close with them as well, even buying them small presents for their birthdays and helping them with their homework. \n\nI suppose I\u2019m telling you this so you understand how close I was with them, their family and the other volunteers, so you can understand how hurt I am by the way they\u2019ve handled this situation. \n\nEven on my bad days, they were half the reason I\u2019d get up in the morning, even when I didn\u2019t want to drive, or talk to people, I\u2019d still show up bc I didn\u2019t want to let them down, as again I seen them as my second family and greatly valued their opinion. \n\nSo fast forward back to yesterday, it was completely normal. Nothing out of the ordinary, we were still talking like normal, doing all our tasks as normal, having lunch together like normal, I even got a last minute tour and stayed back to finish it up, which brought in a fair bit of money for them. \n\nAlso just a note, it\u2019s a non-profit, all the money from tours goes right back into the sanctuary to care for the animals, food and water, vet bills, etc. \n\nSo just my little routine afterwards, I stop on the way home to go to the bathroom, get food, etc. So I was checking my phone like normal, and seen he sent me an attachment, funny thing is I thought he was sending me a dumb reel or something. Boy did I have a rude awakening when I read termination letter. So naturally I read through it and start crying because again, that day was normal, there was not even a hint that something like this was coming. Luckily I had one of my friends with me so I didn\u2019t do something dumb like driving with so many tears in my eyes I could barely see and probably getting into an accident. \n\nIn the letter he basically highlighted the fact that he wants to maintain a positive workplace and while he values my input, he needs to put the sanctuary first, blah blah blah, the typical things in a letter that would put the blame on me so he doesn\u2019t seem like the bad guy. \n\nSo one important thing to mention, they say this to everyone but from the start they said that they\u2019re the kind of workplace to make sure everyone\u2019s included and don\u2019t like people to form cliques. However, I became really close to two people in particular, specifically because they\u2019re great friends and have done so much for me. \n\nNow while I was really close with these two, I feel we included everyone when we could. Especially since some days at the sanctuary we\u2019d be so busy we\u2019d barely see each other that day. So we\u2019d always go out for lunch, however we\u2019d always ask everyone if they wanted anything and never ate out, always came back to be a part of the whole team. (We\u2019d all have a break at the same time.) \n\nNow obviously being friends, we\u2019d hang out after work, (but again we\u2019d ask some people if they\u2019d wanna come if we weren\u2019t going too far away.) And we would call and stuff, but I feel it\u2019s normal for friends to do that. \n\nSo one thing I could see where they wouldn\u2019t have been to happy with this, is that we were doing an animal course about 5 hours away. You have to finish the online part first before you go do the practical bit. So one of my friends told the boss that we were going to be doing it (he already done it prior and was just driving us), and unlike the last time it was done, they didn\u2019t put it on the group chat or anything for people to say they\u2019re interested. I think they assumed we\u2019d tell people that we were doing it and ask if they\u2019d want to come. Mind you this was about a month in advance, so plenty of time for people to do the online section. I will say this course ends up being quite expensive so some people weren\u2019t able to do it due to financial reasons anyway. \n\nAnyways long story short, one other person from the sanctuary ended up doing the course (btw the course only has 4 spots for the Prac part). We had a great time and included him in nearly everything we did (he traveled separately to us so was only left out of stuff we did on the way). We even had a game night and everything and really the only people who were left out were the people who couldn\u2019t come but wanted to, which I don\u2019t blame them for. \n\nI can only assume that this is the reason they fired us (my friend that drove was quitting, next week was going to be his last, however they messaged him yesterday basically telling him to not come back, and my other friend also got a letter similar to mine.) \n\nAgain, I was completely blindsided by this, as yesterday and even the last few weeks were completely normal. No they didn\u2019t even try to chat with us, saying something like, \u2018hey this is what we can see is happening and we don\u2019t like it, can you just try to include the other people more\u2019. Something like that and I wouldn\u2019t have been as devastated. \n\nThe only other thing it might be is that I would make some pretty crude jokes, although I wasnt the only one that would say them, and me and my boss would say them to each other and everything (we\u2019re Aussie btw, it\u2019s part of our culture I suppose, if we don\u2019t know you or don\u2019t like you, we\u2019ll be quite civil/polite to you, but if we do like you then you\u2019ll probably cop it.) although I don\u2019t think this was the problem bc again it wasn\u2019t just me making these jokes. \n\nI guess what hurts the most, is that I really respected my boss and viewed both of them quite highly. Like they\u2019re great people (at least I use to think so), they\u2019re great parents, really community oriented and from what I\u2019ve heard, quite highly regarded in our field. So basically for him to not even have the decency to even send me a message along with the letter it is what hurt the most. So naturally I sent them both a message, asking them to give me a call bc for my own peace of mind, I really need an explanation. Both of them (I assume accidentally) opened the message and I can see they read it, however they both ignored it. So I sent them an email this morning, however still waiting on a reply. \n\nI\u2019ve never been through a breakup but I imagine it\u2019d be like this, except instead of breaking up with one person, I\u2019ve just lost my second family. With no warning, no explanation. \n\nAnyways thanks for listening to me ramble, sorry it was so long, I\u2019m just kind of at a loss for now. Hopefully I\u2019ll stop crying and get out of bed soon. Thank youse \ud83e\udef6\n\nTLDR - I was volunteering at an animal sanctuary when I got a termination letter from my boss, with no warning, no explanation. I feel like I\u2019ve lost my second family. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Am I being used?\n\nDo I (26F) need a reality check? I\u2019ve been friends with my friend, Blake (26M), for over a year now. We have been pretty close since the beginning. When we first met, we bonded over our shared love for playing soccer together and music. I would say we have many similarities. We both enjoy adult animation, like Studio Ghibli, raves, and playing board games. Since we shared many similarities, we kept in touch daily through text messages, phone calls, and FaceTime. We had a mutual friend named Jennifer. Jennifer and I were very close until I noticed that whenever we spent time together, she spoke negatively about everyone around her. As a result, I gradually distanced myself from her. Around the same time, Jennifer and Blake started dating. Although I wasn\u2019t close to Jennifer and didn\u2019t personally like her, I wanted Blake to be happy. Blake and I maintained a consistent relationship and communication. We talked every day, even during our lunch breaks, via FaceTime. However, things took a turn when Jennifer informed Blake that I had feelings for him and wanted to pursue a romantic relationship with him. That was not the case, and I was even in a relationship at the time. As a result, Blake ended our communication to preserve his relationship with Jennifer. We did not talk for eight months. However, in January he reached out to me. He told me that Jennifer suddenly broke up with him in December. Since then, we\u2019ve been hanging out again. In February, we attended a rave and ended up having sex that night. A week later, we confessed to each other that we had both harbored feelings for one another since we\u2019ve first met. At this point, I informed him that I didn\u2019t want to be a rebound, and he responded by stating that he wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship and wanted to focus on healing. I accepted his decision. We continued spending time together and continued having sex. However, I later told him that I no longer wanted to have sex with him because I was struggling to separate our friendship and romantic feelings. Around the same time his ex-girlfriend, Jennifer, filed a protective order against Blake.\n\nSidebar: Personally, I have had past experiences with abusive men, which may have influenced my perspective. However, I must admit that I am not entirely aware of the details of Jennifer and Blake\u2019s relationship. Given Jennifer\u2019s personality, I can\u2019t help but wonder if this situation is a attention-seeking ploy. On the other hand, I have only heard Blake\u2019s side of the story.\n\nHowever, I suggested that we establish boundaries. We agreed to refrain from having sex and I told him I need a break from constant communication. I also told him to fine another trusted friend to confide in about the Jennifer situation because I haven\u2019t healed from my own trauma from the abusive I had endured. Blake expressed his agreement to the physical boundaries and expressed he didn\u2019t want to lose me again and our friendship.\n\nSince implementing these boundaries, our relationship has undergone a significant change. We don\u2019t talk that much anymore and when we do the protective order case seems to be the main topic of discussion. Although, last night, I visited Blake\u2019s place to watch Star Wars. During the movie, he asked me to engage in a platonic cuddle. We did, and he said Thank you. I inquired about the reason behind his gratitude. He mentioned that my presence was naturing and made him feel less lonely. Am I only in his life  because he feels lonely?",

    "selftext": "\nThree weeks ago me (28f) and my husband (29m) went out to a bar. When we got there, we happened to run into a middle school friend of his. We got to talking and his friend was sharing stories about when they were in middle school together. Like the time his friend walked into the wrong restroom by mistake and was made fun or for a year and when my husband got hard asking out a girl, after a few more embarrassing and funny stories his friend who we'll call Jeff says \"hey remember that dog\". I think you can see where this is going. My husband started breaking down laughing and I was totally confused. So I asked \"what dog\" Jeff explained in sixth grade was/is/whatever the terminology is a \"zoophilia\" he was sexually interested in a dog named \"champion\" he didn't do anything but got a boner after he was playing with this dog. He and his friend shocked about it for a while but he kept taking pictures of this dog. It started to move from joking territory to creepy. Three months later, he attempted to kidnap the dog. Thankfully, Jeff's father (the owner of the dog) caught him.\n\nIs it weird that I'm reconsidering my marriage even though this hasn't been a problem in decades. My whole view of my husband has changed, so am I over reacting to my husband's middle school issues?",

    "selftext": "It has been almost 15 years since it's slowly started to dawn on me that my sister never really loved me: she just thought I was so much lamer than her, that she didn't see me as a competiton.\n\nFor the context: she is 10 years older than me and for as long as I can remember, I loved her more than anyone alive. I loved her more than our parents, brothers, friends etc. She was my absolute role model and everything she did was perfect.\n\nIt is fucked up to compare kids ever, but when parents and relatives are comparing two people who are so different and not even in the same age group, that is especially fucked up.\nShe was always labeled the beautiful one, me as the smart one. She was the caring child, I was the mean one. Her life was hard, mine was easy.\nEverything that was happening to her was always celebrated if it was good, or we were all devastated together with her if it was bad - and it was never her fault when it was bad.\nEverything I ever did was considered as luck, or as normal if it was good and my fault if it was bad. \n\nShe loved me back and always worked on building my self confidence - but never to the extent of me succeeding in being better than her in any way. This was particularly obvious in her relationship with our parents, where she told me multiple times that our father wanted mom to have the abortion when she was pregnant with me. Any sign of me not liking that thought was being met with the comment along the lines of \"me being too sensitive\" or \"oh, come on, he loves you now\". I reacted explosivelly about that only once, when I told her openely to go fuck herself with those fucked up pieces of info, which, of course, ended with her being in tears, appologizing, and making me promise THAT I WILL NEVER REMIND HER ABOUT THAT EVENT. She made it about her and her feelings and I was told by the involved parties that I shouldn't have been so hard on her.\n\nThese were occasional outbursts, when I would always make a conclusion that I over reacted and I would end up crying, begging her to forgive me and promising never to do it again. Bear in mind - we are talking about my teenage yeara here, not adult me.\n\nFF to my 20s: while she had one relationship with her then long-time bf, who became almost like a family member, I mostly fucked around and either didn't really meet reciprocated feelings in guys, or I didn't even want anything serious. She eventually broke up with him - it was a family tragedy, ofc, like anything bad that happens to her - and she somehow put us both together to \"we are never getting married\" file. I mean, she never said it, but it was obvious that she is not supportive of my potential relationships. I kind of knew it, but I became sure about it when I started to date my now husband, when I was 25, and as I became more self-assured because I felt loved, she started to become more and more openely toxic, and she was doing it often. She would use every opportunity to let me know she thinks he is lazy and irresponsible, while I didn't think any of that.\nShe started to hate my hobbies, style, habits (which didn't change much - I just wasn't as miserable as before) and she was suuuuper pissed when she broke with her second bf and I got engaged.\nShe called me and raged about how it is inconsiderate that everyone is saying \"congrats\" on social media, while they are aware of her recent break up. I felt bad because during the last year of her relationship she lost one pregnancy, but I still didn't think that I should hid posts my boyfriend put on social media when he proposed.\n\nAfter that, it all went downhill.\nShe was good to me either when something super good would happen to her, or when something really bad would happen to me.\nShe hated my wedding day and pregnancy, but she was full of understanding when I had PPD. She did nothing to help, but she was good to me then.\nAs soon as I got better, she was hating me again. In the meantime - all good that was going on in her life was still celebrated and all bad was mourned, while my life was kind of unimportant to our mutual loved ones (mostly).\n\nI started to fight back, but I was rarely talking shit about her to our family, while she wasn't really private about her opinion on me. Every time when she would show her good side again, I would come back to life because I would regain the hope that the most loved person from my childhood is still there.\n\nRecently, I lost all hope that I will ever want her back in my life. Our father died and in his final months, while I was crying my guts out and doing EVERYTHING to help him - as we all did - she told me that I was selfish as always and not showing any empathy towards him.\nThat was the straw that broke the camel's back for me and I screamed at her and told her to get the fuck away from me forever.\n\nWe did communicate after that, because there were many things that had to be done with our dad, and I was there for her to be her shoulder to cry on when she needed me, but it was just because I felt I had to, for the rest of our family.\n\nAs our dad passed, my feelings of disgust came back and I am back to feeling hurt by our last fight. She mentioned it briefly and said that it was just a dumb fight, as she always does after moments like that, but to me - it wasn't. To me now, none of the fights we had were dumb and they were all about one thing: her wanting me to be the obedient, loser sister that she had when I was from 0 to 20-ish and her from 10 to 30-ish.\n\nI can't stand the thought of her hanging out with my kid anymore. My kid loves her and I was so happy when my sister and I patched our fight from a few years ago and she had good relationship with her niece, but honestly - I have two fears:\n\n1. She would fuck her up the way she fucked me up,\n2. She would be telling my kid mean things to show me as a bad person, for whatever reason.\n\nOne thing I found out later, after my PPD was gone, is that she was planning to take the kid away from me \"because it seems like I am not fit to do it\", but she never considered talking to my husband about it. Like, he didn't have PPD, he was fine - why didn't she talk to him? Why was she planning to adopt the kid who was not out for adoption?\n\nAnyway... I am done with her, but I think I will need a lot of time to process this. Maybe therapy would be beneficial.",

I\u2019m tired of saying my gf so I\u2019m going to call her Diana. \n\nTurns out the guy was a drug addict from the next town over. He was in his 60s and he had an extensive history in jail and mental hospitals. Unfortunately about two months after my post, he passed away. We didn\u2019t know anything about why until we got a chance to talk to his sister, who insisted she didn\u2019t blame Diana and that the doctors even said that he probably didn\u2019t have much longer anyway. (Diana was visibly distressed during this conversation so I\u2019m not sure whether or not the sister just said that to comfort her)\n\nAfter that Diana went on a trip to a national park during a week she knew I couldn\u2019t take off and forgot her meds. She has seizures that look like mild psychosis/magical thinking and ended up refusing to come home at the end of the trip. She kept saying that she felt like she couldn\u2019t leave the woods because she was certain there was something she needed to learn there that she hadn\u2019t yet, and when I asked her how long that might take, she said \u201csome people take a lifetime.\u201d I asked if she was breaking up with me, and she said something about feeling like she was \u201ctoo attached\u201d to me, her house, her pets, etc and that she needed to meditate on that for a while. \n\nI ended up going to her temple to see if anyone was willing to give me some perspective on the situation since she was seeing things through a Buddhist lens. It was the right choice. A monk actually drove the six hours out to her with me to talk to her in person since she wasn\u2019t picking up calls. I am so, so unbelievably grateful for that monk because Diana started taking her meds again and came home soon after. I\u2019ve never been religious but I started to read the Pali canon afterwards and that shit slaps. Diana was already volunteering her time at the temple so now we both go together when we can. \n\nAll things considered, since then, things are back to normal and going well. We\u2019re both children of divorce so even before all this we were doing prophylactic couples counseling every few months, and for a while after we were going once a week. Diana has started seeing a therapist on her own as well which I am so proud of her for since she\u2019s always hated the idea of individual therapy. \n\nWe also stepped up our home security game. Diana already had plenty of cameras, but now we have door/window alarms and motion sensors. I also convinced Diana to get another dog, so now we have a 75lb puppy\u2026 \n\nI know a lot of people were rooting for us to get married, but that\u2019s not going to happen. Legal marriage isn\u2019t something that interests us and it never has. But we did buy each other rings, and it\u2019s been a great comfort to have something physical to remind me of her on my person all the time. We\u2019re also considering having a small commitment ceremony next fall &lt;3\n\nThanks again for all the feedback on my previous post. I got a lot of great advice, and some good criticism. I showed it to Diana and she got a kick out of the comments, and we had a little mutual cry over how kind a lot of you guys were. I asked her if she was okay with me posting this update, and she clucked at me and told me to do whatever I want online as long as I\u2019m being nice (and anonymous lol). So\u2026 hope this qualifies! ",

    "selftext": "damn i will definitely be embarassed about this in the future but anyways  \ni've always been a sensitive person, i always cared about others and made sure to make them feel good and happy. My middle school years weren't the best: i had to move out of my old house and i completely changed life by moving to a town 50 minutes far from my previous residence. You can imagine that I, an introverted and nerdy kid, wasn't able to make many friends, and so i got lonely. In fact i was known as the lonely kid, no one ever wanted to talk to me and sometimes even made fun of me (i discovered some years later that everyone talked behind my back during those years, and that was the reason no one even wanted to approach me). And so i spent three years of my life by myself: i spent my days alone, definitely years that i wouldn't want to live again. Once middle school ended, i was full of hope: that same summer i made some friends and had a lot of fun with them, and so i was positive about starting high school. And so, once my first year of school started i tried to me more extroverted and social (the outcome was awkard, i'm not good at being extroverted). Even tho i tried, the outcome wasn't positive. This time no one talked behind my back, but i had trouble making friends and so i became the lonely kid once again. I was depressed, spent my days listening to music and sleeping all day just to escape that feeling of void that was suffocating, swallowing me whole. I was ready to end it all, but i wasn't brave enough to even try, so i kept living my life and eventually things got better. I made new friends, i became more social and felt truly happy after years of suffering. I am happy about how i lived the rest of my teenage years, but that feeling never got away. I am now left with an overthinking mindset (idk if i can call it like that), which leads me to anxiety about all the friendships that i currently live: i can't be calm, because i sometimes think that everyone will sooner or later go against me and make me live the hell i went through one more time. I can't trust anyone, and this thing is making me mad, because come on, why am i so defensive? why can't i just live my life like the others, and not worry about this? i don't truly know why i wrote this, probably to feel better or to relate to someone here who perhaps lived my same experience. Anyways, i feel costantly feel this overwhelming sense of entrapment in my own life, i feel like my past will always follow me, no matter what i do. No matter how many new people i will meet, i will always have this anxiety that they will disappoint me, and life is so hard this way. I don't even know if someone will read this, i will probably only get some upvotes and my post will be forgotten in this sub",

Like physically feel it- I can feel it when someone has insecurities...like not even talking about them- falling back onto their insecurities, thinking about them while saying something else, drawing from them, the way they phrase certain things, the way they keep repeating certain phrases- it's the small things. And it's not even just insecurities it's the psychological weakness.

    "selftext": "This happened in mid January. For context, I am 32F and my boyfriend is 34m, we\u2019ve been together for 3 years and we live together in a house that I own. Now for the story- my dad has been unwell for over a month and my siblings and I (mom died from cancer when I was young) have been taking care of him while we waited for test results and some answers. Last week his condition took a turn for the worst and he ended up being taken to the hospital by ambulance and has been in the icu for a week. He was diagnosed with cancer. We still don\u2019t have all the answers and I don\u2019t know what the future holds for my family. On the third day that my dad was in the icu, my boyfriend was at work and texted me about his plans for the following day that consisted of him meeting up with friends to \u201cplan their trip.\u201d I knew they had been talking loosely talking about potentially going on a trip at the end of the month, but I thought it was common sense that since my dad is in the hospital, the trip would be off\u2026. Well apparently not. Needless to say, we had an argument. I told him it\u2019s extremely hurtful that he would abandon me at a time like this. \nAfter a lot of back and forth throughout the day he let me know the trip was cancelled (nothing had been paid for or even booked yet), but at this point I just feel like the damage is done. Who would prioritize a \u201cboys trip\u201d when their partners only parent is extremely sick in the hospital. The obvious answer is to break up, but I don\u2019t know if I have it in me to go through a breakup right now. It\u2019s been a few days now, my dad is doing much better, he\u2019s out of the icu and I\u2019ve been there everyday helping him with his recovery so he can come home. I\u2019ve been off work for the past week and a half during all this and went back yesterday and have been going to the hospital between shifts. My boyfriend has been moping around the house the last few days and every time I ask him what\u2019s wrong he says \u201cnothing\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just sad.\u201d I said if this is about the trip, then just go. He says that\u2019s not what it\u2019s about. I suggested he goes to talk to someone , a therapist or a friend.. or me. He declined all of this. I asked what I can do to help, he said nothing and \u201cI\u2019m not his therapist\u201d I said nothing and just collected my stuff and went to work. I have a lot on my plate already, and I\u2019m feeling angry that he\u2019s putting this on me now as well. We spent the next few days avoiding eachother around the house which was making my mental health seriously depleted. We finally had a conversation, I told him he should go on the trip because there\u2019s no sense of him staying here if he\u2019s not even going to acknowledge me or be supportive to me and my family anyways. The next day, he booked his flight. I tried to convince myself I was okay with it, but his 5 day trip suddenly turned into 10 days, and I just knew I was done. We had a few conversations while he was away, mostly me crying and telling him how angry I am with him. He came home, and I ended it as soon as he walked in the door. He begged and pleaded, said he \u201cnever would have left\u201d if he knew I would end it because of the trip. There was a lot of back and forth and I asked him if he could just leave for a few days to give me some space, which he did. He ended up taking me on a date for Valentine\u2019s Day later that week and things seemed to be getting a little bit better. We planned a night away the following week to try to connect again. During our \u201cromantic night away\u201d he decided it was a good idea to invite his friend and friends girlfriend to join us for dinner (the girlfriend ended up not coming so it was just me, my bf and his friend) \u2026.. and then \u201csurprisingly\u201d a bunch of his other work friends just happened to be at the same restaurant. What was supposed to be a romantic evening to try to repair our relationship ended up being a table of 8 of us, talking about my boyfriends job. We went back to the hotel, got into an argument and went to bed angry. The next day we woke up and he got in the shower and left his Apple Watch on the night stand. I had that gut instinct to check his messages, and there it was. He was been messaging with another girl the entire time my dad was in the hospital and was meeting up with her for \u201ccoffee dates \u201c \u2026. Which I highly doubt is all that happened. So ya, that\u2019s it. He moved his stuff out last week , and the person I thought I knew for the last almost 4 years has become the person whose hurt me more than anyone ever has in my life. I\u2019m on my own again, going to be 33 next month, and starting from scratch. I don\u2019t know what the future holds but it has to be better than this, right? ",

    "selftext": "just saw a post about their narc maybe being DL and i\u2019m realizing mine definitely was, and after everything he did and blaming me for it he said that\u2019s why he did it and couldn\u2019t have let us every happen or get married bc of his hidden desires. (exact quote at the bottom) in the beginning, he said he had a deep fetish, he said it was humiliation at first. then the real truth was later revealed to me. and then it wasn\u2019t until after the break up he said there was sissy and cross dressing and that he might be gay. which is so bizarre bc one he only ever told me about the real kink way later and never told me the full details of it and he loves women sexually and is very sexual and addicted to porn. but he was interested in trans women and anal sex i guess.\n\nit\u2019s wild bc he always said he could never be in a relationship with a man bc he needed a woman who was submissive and he had control over basically. he wanted a woman in her feminine energy but wasn\u2019t safe enough to let me stay there. after our break up also, he went on a power kick after i was trying to say goodbye like i guess trying to regain power and he was being agressive and telling me to submit and basically confirm that he was right and i was wrong and legit got hard from it. the next day i said \u201ci will only submit to a man who protects and takes care of me and does not abuse me\u201d and he said he would still abuse me and i should stop \u201cwhinning\u201d about it.\n\nthere were times he wanted to have sex with me while watching porn and wouldn\u2019t show what the porn was, or giving him bjs and hjs while he watched porn.\n\ni\u2019ve posted my story lots but have left out this major detail bc it felt wrong to discuss but for reference, we got engaged, i uprooted my life to go move in with him in another state. 6 days after the proposal and me thousands of dollars deep into the move, he called it off unprovoked (bc by this time i had been \u201cperfect\u201d according to his unreasonable standards) but he still blamed me. this is all after months of emotional  and verbal abuse. i lost my home, a job, a baby, mental health, love, my best friend, my safety\n\nthe realization is: \n- he legit told me he loved his fetish and addictions more than me. and he also said after he broke off our engagement and putting me through absolute hell and destroying my life and financially abusing me and me loosing my home to go move with him after our engagement, AFTER blaming me for the reason why he did it and a couple weeks after i came back to my state and was recovering from the move. \n\nhe said \u201cSo we get married have kids And I say by the way I love wearing diapers. Dressing as a girl and letting dudes or someone fuck my ass? I wasn\u2019t gonna let that happen\u201d and that he wasn\u2019t sure if he was bi or gay.\n\ni couldn\u2019t tell if he was saying all of that as a ploy to make it \u201ceasier\u201d to be friends with him, bc he was actively saying he wanted me in his life and he said would it be easier if i were gay and then told me all those things. idk if it was more manipulation or if it\u2019s true. i know his kink is a major thing and it wasn\u2019t something i was into and he wants to be with someone romantically who isn\u2019t into in but still have sexual encounters with people who are into his kink. i can never tell when he was being honest or just saying something to get a certain reaction out of me. there were several times he\u2019d say \u201cim going to go fuck this girl tonight bc you stress me out\u201d and then i\u2019d find out he was home along and not with her. his mom would tell me or he later would tell me he never did. there were plenty of cases like this too. he would just say things to make me believe it. so i couldn\u2019t tell if he was saying he might be gay for that instance too. idk. \n\nin no way am i being insensitive to sexuality or kinks. i was very supportive to him through it all but this is just making me realize he was never going to follow through and legit used me. \n\n\u2014 he basically admitted to putting me through hell, abusing me very thoroughly, blaming it allllll on me and my character flaws, made me lose my home to move states with him, tell me entire family we got engaged, lose my job, and spend thousands on moving, lose a child, all to cancel our engagement and move during a mania spike he had and BLAMES IT ON ME, all while he was literally never going to be capable of following through.\n\nthere were so many signs too im realizing now that i\u2019ve missed. he used to straight up tell me that he was mirroring me and i thought that was weird bc women typically mirror the man. he used to also say he\u2019d just find someone to marry him out of convenience bc he wasn\u2019t capable of love. he was always so selfish in every aspect of our lives. he always made it known to everyone and called me his wife and loved the image that it gave him but treated me like dirt. this man was straight up telling me he was a narcissist and i missed the signs in a haze. \n\nhe emotionally, verbally, mentally and financially abused me for literally nothing. bc i was kind and sweet and supportive and empathetic and showed him love he couldn\u2019t even fathom. he literally watched me as i bent over backwards for him and took care of him and lost the stability in my life to create one with him while he was just belittling me and destroying my worth and esteem. he needed control over me bc he lacked it in his own life and addictions and self. and was never going to marry me or create the life together we planned bc his demons and desires would have never allowed it even when i was accommodating and understanding. but the blame is all on me for loving him and having needs.\n\nthere\u2019s so many factors to this and so many versions of him, it\u2019s hard to wrap my head around it all ",

    "selftext": "I don't know where to start with it all. This is going to be long, and if any of you get to the end, I appreciate you taking the time to read my story. I would say that this feels like a common place story that happens to a lot of people in different ways. I just need to get my story told. almost feels like I am just asking for pity, maybe I am, and that is an issue with myself because seeking pity is not good for one's mental health, but what I've been holding in also isn't good for my mental health. I'll start the story at 4 years ago when my relationship started. It started 7 years ago. I start there. I was a lonely type of fella and I did not have much relationship experience from my time growing up and being in high school total of 2 relationships before this current one I find myself in one 8 months with it ending with me getting cheated on and the other 1.5 years with me proposing and then getting cheated on. Both in-person and then transitioning to long-distance, you'd think I'd learned my lesson the first time. Anyways, I go about a year of being single and searching for love as all young people do, and nothing worked for me: dating apps, social events, or just finding people in places that you'd want to be able to share interest with. Until one day, I posted a nice thirst trap online to get the self-seeking validation that I felt I needed at the time, and someone slid into my DM's someone that I had known from HS but never truly talked to. I began talking with this person, and then we grew closer every day, despite being long distance with a 3-hour time difference. We Facetimed each other every once in a while and then twice a week and then every day. The problem at the time in that relationship was two things: I was not emotionally intelligent, and I had a group of guy friends that were semi-toxic. My significant other was not fond of my friends as they wanted to go out and party all the time, which I didn't mind doing, but it wasn't my cup of tea. So I spent more time talking with her, and then one day I tried to introduce her to my group of friends on Facetime, and she talked to everyone a little bit and just found them all disgusting and asked to talk to me again. She said something along the lines of Wow, can't believe you did that and hung up on me. Now for me, I was confused because my buddies did the same thing with their signifcant others and no one was upset and it was nice getting to know the person they loved back home(for a little context me and my SO had not met up yet we were still having facetime and what not). It was also a surprise for her because when she called, I was hanging out with my buddies, and one of them picked up. So after she hung up I called her back in private and I asked her what was wrong and she told me that she felt disrespected by what happened and that was our first big fight with each other, and it ended with me texting her updates of when and where I am so she knows if she can call with me. I agreed with it all, not thinking that it was a big deal. We continued the relationship with one another with basically a gradual turn of all my free time being spent with her. I neglected friends and became somewhat isolated from my world. As an inexperienced youngling, I didn't see that issue. I kept the good friends and started distancing myself from my friends we'd hang out with, but it started to be less and less as the month went by. I would say that we are about 8 months into this relationship with each other when we first decided to meet up with each other and have about a week together. Now before we met with each other she alluded that there were things that she wasn't going to give me or ask of me unless we were dating because I hadn't asked her to be my girlfriend and I don't know why but that enticed me to figure out what she was alluding to and that brought me to the point of when meeting up with her I asked her to be my gf and she said yes but I was so nervous asking her it felt like she was a bit hesistant on that matter when replying yes. That happened the first day, and then we started dating with our first week in a relationship of hanging out with each other. I stayed at her place the whole week, and we did various things and hung out with each other. It felt like things went well for the week that we spent together; it felt like we connected, and everyone had a good time before we had to say goodbye and continue our long-distance relationship. After I got back to my home things started to change with our relationship she wanted more from me in ways of being more emotionally aware of my day and tell her my feelings and how things made me feel and as the emotinally unintellegnet person I was it was hard for me to change that in my everyday life, I was just going with the flow of life and never realy discussed my emotions with others becasue it never really came up in conversation. We argued about how I was still just discussing my day with her and not sharing my emotions with her, so I worked on it and slowly got better with being in touch with my emotions, yet I feel like it was never really enough for the relationship. As the months went by, she continuously felt like I wasn't telling her enough about my life and felt left out the more I told her about my day, so I committed to telling her everything that happened in my day as she was doing to me. Now, my struggle was that there was a lot that happened in my day, so I would sometimes do it when it happened in my day. Still, I would eventually tell her about it when we called each other every day. Still, she would then get upset that she missed out on knowing when it happened and what I felt in that period. Once again, being the emotionally unavailable guy I was, I tried my best to do what I could to satisfy that need for her. At this point, you're probably wondering why we just didn't break up. I have no clue; it's probably just me being weak-willed. At this point, I spent just about every waking moment texting and talking to this girl, and we got into arguments just about every single day, either about me missing information I was telling her or me not being emotional. Being young, I thought this was healthy because the arguments led to deeper conversations with each other and figuring out what made us who we are. I would say about 4 or 5 months after our initial meetup, I had pretty much completely distanced myself from my friedns with rarely ever hanging out with them but maybe once in a blue moon, but it made it harder in my relationship to hangout with them becausea of her wanting to know everything and me jsut wanting to spend time with friedns so there was communication delay from waht was happening in the conversation and what I was doing vs what was acutally happening in my life. This all led to arguments down the line, and then our next meet up, this time I was meeting her parents and she was coming to me. I set things up so that I could stay with her and got a friend that I was closer with that she seemed to like because he was married and approved more of our relationship. We spent the time together for about 2 weeks; this time, one week just me and her at my \"place\" and then a week with her parents. It seemed like another good meet up with both of enjoying ourselves but, a little bit of tension between us from the arguments and the fact I was moving from a 3 hour time difference to a 13 hour time difference, which we both imagined would put more of a strain on our relationship, her parents liked me on a side note. We parted ways, and I began my new path in life with her being in college and me being abroad for work. We had both been right tensions did increase with each other as I was abroad it became even hadrder for me to comunicate with her with everything that was going on in my day to day life as it was for the most part always unpredictable and hard to keep up with myself and she would sleep half way through my day as the time differnece so if she didn't wake up to a butt load of text about my day she felt upset and always had this feeling of misisng out on my life, so I continued to distance myself from others and not participating in group events and when I did I tried to keep to myself to minimize the updating I had to do. At this point, she just felt like I didn't love her because I wasn't involving her in my life the same way she was involving me in her life. She told me everything about her day, so this wasn't a double standard, and she was also busy, but I would say that I was definitely busier than she was. I continued to apoligize about the communication issues with keeping in mind I still was telling her about everything that happened in my day whenever we talked on the phone especially all the things I forgot to tell her and she felt that I conviently kept forgetting to tell her about the interations that I had with Females throughout my day beacuse as you can imagine she was jealous that other females got to interact with me throught out the day more and she didn't. I was better about telling her about female interaction through my day, but I still missed a few here and there. Sometimes, I got rides from females, and she'd get upset that I didn't tell them when it happened. She always felt she never got the full story the first time and she had to ask multiple questions to get the whole story and that was tiring for her and it got to the point where, I thought I was doing a good job but was not and I just gave up on updating her one day because life just got overwhelmed and I couldn't handle life and my relationship at the same time and she ended it after that day. I was devastated as we had been going through this struggle for almost 3 years, and it just felt like it was all for nothing. We met a third time before breaking up and were going to meet up a 4th before COVID-19 occurred and travel bans happened, which didn't improve our relationship. We broke up, I got friends, and started to move on with my life, slowly finding myself and what makes me happy. For about a year, I was single. I decided to move back to the same timezone as her and go to the college that she went to. Not expecting her to be in the area, not ever really knowing why I did it either. I wanted to complete college not being in a relationship, but that was not what occured. As you can expect, we ran into each other again and started dating because she felt like I was a changed man and was able to prioritize things in my life a little better. I can say that I did grow in the time after we broke up and explored my inner workings a little more. The thing is, she thought I started dating her again because she was a different person, but she hasn't really changed all that much, still wanting the same things, and I was more able to provide those things she wanted, and it felt like things were going in the right direction. We moved in with each other and where \"dating\" for a year until she said that she wanted more and didn't feel we were growing and she said it was because I had not asked her to be my gf so about 3 months of me trying to find the right time to ask and it not working out we get into an argument about it and I asak her and she says no ask another time. So I don't plan for it and just start asking her once a week until she just says yes about 2 months later while we are living and sleeping in the same bed with each other. Anyway, things started getting a little tenser between us. I don't have many friends as I learned not to make friends in this relationship, and I don't talk to my old friends much because it just causes conflict, and I'd rather avoid than lie. We continued dating, and for about 2 years, we lived in the same place. We have had our ups and downs through the two years. I changed my job twice and have a female supervisor; as you know, she is upset about that, but she ignores it better. She says she just, at this point in the relationship, buries her emotions and hides her concerns because she doesn't want conflict in the relationship, and she only ever feels that she has problems with what is going on in the relationship. We still argue a lot and have those arguments turn into deep conversations, and I become more and more emotionally drained as these arguments happen, and I can barely keep up with my studies, work, and relationship, yet I push on. We are starting to get to the real point of this story and why I am just done is that we were initially very active sexually in the beginning of our relationship like once a week and then it moved to once a month which you know I didn't think to much of it because I figure sex drive just went down as the relationship got more secured, but we just moved to a new place and signed a 15 month lease that niether of us can afford to break and I tried to be sexual with her this morning and she told me that it felt nice but shed been thinking of her ex when we've been doing stuff and that its kinda always been that way becasue she used to be very sexually active with her ex but he was fine with not having sex and she puts herself in his position and wouldn't want that pushed uponed her and makes her feel sad and turns her off from anything that we are doing and I tried to help her get to the root of it this morning before leaving to work and I just felt that I disrepected myself by doing that and not being more upset about her thinking of her ex and it just hurts because it means just about everytime we do sexual stuff its about how she feels about her ex and makes sense why she has to sometime watch things when I go down on her. Honestly I know that this is a super toxic relationship but, I love her so much and have tried so hard in this relationship with the time and effort I put in everyday it just sucks all of it \n\nTLDR; GF thinks of ex during intimate time after 7 years of relationship and gets turned off just about every time because she pushed herself on her ex, and her ex didn't care about having sex and she didn't like the idea of being in his position. So it has tanked our relationship, and everything feels distant and We moved to new place with 15 month lease no one can afford to break. I feel stuck",

    "selftext": "I (22 F) have had a chronic condition for more than 10 years now. \n\nThe thing is, it's something I haven't seen mentioned before or other people experiencing it. I feel so alone and I've seriously considered an \"escape route\" in the sense that I genuinely do not have a will to live.\n\nI have a chronic sore throat and it's ruining my life. I cannot drink or eat anything cold without getting ill after. Absolutely anything. **I cannot just eat ice cream and enjoy cold drinks.**  I always have a lump in my throat no matter what I do. After I eat/drink something cold or when I'm sick, this lump gets thicker and inflammation follows.\n\nBut the worst of all is second hand ciggarette smoke and other dense smokes. Just feeling it makes this lump get thicker and I start coughing.\n\nI cannot walk normally on the street and always have to avoid smokers that are everywhere. I cannot go out to bars, hang with people my age because they're all smoking. I am the insane one.\n\nThe doctors do not care since there is no concerning inflammation and I've been told to just deal with the smoke and \"avoid\" it as if that's possible. (I live in Eastern Europe) I've also had my tonsils removed, because the inflammation affected my bones and heart, but even after that, there's been no improvement.\n\nThe thing that's causing it is a bacteria called staphylococcus aureus and this chronic state most likely developed when I failed to do a treatment properly. I've been desperate to find an explanation for my pain on my own and was able to find just one scientific paper studying the sensitivity of this bacteria to second hand ciggarette smoke.\n\nI wish I could live somewhere isolated without pollution from smoke, but it's not likely since I'm just an average woman. No skills to survive on my own, nor the resilience for that. I am so tired. \n\nI do not see a future for myself. I've never had a relationship due to some other reasons in the past, and I don't see myself having one because of this.\n\nAlso sorry if this isn't the appropriate sub for this. I mostly posted this as a cry for help and maybe to attempt at finding people who relate. I'll remove my post if needed. Thanks for reading.",

    "selftext": "Life is feeling real batshit today.\n\nCame across my partner\u2019s alt account on social media. Open to public viewing. They described it as an \u2018orgasm journal\u2019 where they seemed to be exploring self pleasure. Cool, love that. Very data-driven. Cut to a post about \u2018collective\u2019 episode with another online user. They had been exploring what sounds to be a lot like mutual masturbation where you\u2019re turned on by the idea of someone watching, viewing things through a data-driven lens in the name of \u2018research\u2019. Naturally I lost my shit and messaged them.\n\nWe called and I told them all of the assumptions I\u2019d made. They didn\u2019t say I was wrong, just said \u2018it\u2019s research\u2019. I feel like I\u2019m getting pulled into insanity and delusion here. It feels like kink gone wrong. What do you mean it\u2019s research?? Research is ethical? Having sexual conversations around topics that arouse you with another person for the purpose of sexual pleasure sounds like\u2026 infidelity to me? \n\nI can\u2019t believe I had to tell this person who most of the time has their head on square &amp; thinks intelligently and rationally that this constitutes as cheating. It\u2019s not research or data what are you talking about!! \n\nThey\u2019ve just posted after our break up (yes I\u2019m going to stop looking but it\u2019s been 12 hours please let me wallow) that they\u2019re open, not poly. Fast fucking turnaround when we were in a monogamous relationship literally 8 hours ago. \n\nWe were in a long term relationship and I cannot for the life of me process that this is the way it ends. Can someone please tell me I\u2019m not going insane?\n\nEdit: just to clarify - we\u2019ve had in depth conversations around our expectations of a monogamous relationship. I didn\u2019t specifically set a boundary of \u2018I am not comfortable with mutual masturbation online in the name of research\u2019 because.. that\u2019s very specific and not at all a normal conversation to have, lol. but I did explain what would be uncomfortable or deal-breaking for me and I would fully put the onus on them to have needed to clarify in this situation instead of going in blind because I think it\u2019s very clearly something I would take issue with based on every other conversation we\u2019ve had on the subject.

    "selftext": "TW: drug abuse \n\nSo, I don\u2019t know how to start. My sister has/had a long-term relationship and I even considered him my brother because he was like that with me. They even have a child together. It all started last year when my bil asked my father for 400\u20ac  but not to tell my sister and he would pay it back as soon as he got paid. To this day he never payed back and he lost my father\u2019s respect because of this. We suspected that he may be doing drugs but we kinda hoped he wouldn\u2019t do something like this because he loves his child to the moon. There were few incidents where he acted off\u2026 we never interpreted much into this and just hoped everything would be okay. He works in a field where the future is the secured and a few weeks back he told us that he and his other colleagues were laid off but they would all receive loan payments till the contract ends. Idk it came with a surprise and I had a thought that maybe he was the only person that got laid off. I asked my bf about it because his father works in the same company but in a different department. He said he didn\u2019t know anything about this. Well, wednesday was the incident that ruined my sister\u2019s life. We don\u2019t know what happened exactly but my sister has ended the relationship for good and threw him out because she found drugs. She told our mom that he had a history with drugs a long time ago but he swore it would never happen again. Since yesterday he is supposedly in rehab. I don\u2019t how to talk to my sister about this and I don\u2019t know what to think myself. He was like a brother and I always defended him to everyone. I am scared what will happen in the future, I mean what if he collapses again? Right now my sister is a single mom who works full time with only a half day daycare. I don\u2019t know whether my bil was under influence when he was watching my nibling. There were times where he was alone with my nibling for two weeks. Was he driving under influence? And was my nibling with him? For how long was the abuse? Will my sister recover from all this? Was he thinking about what his abuse will do to my sister and nibling? Was he even thinking? \n\nThere is only so much hurt that a person can endure and my sister had enough in her life. My mind all over the place and I have so much questions I would like to ask but I know that I can\u2019t get an answer. I would like to tell my bil how disappointed I am but I know that this would not help his rehab. My mind is all over the place and my heart is hurting and I can\u2019t talk to anyone expect my mother but she feels the same way expect that her heart hurts more because this is her daughter. I don\u2019t know what to do right now. I don\u2019t know what to think. I don\u2019t know what to feel. I don\u2019t know how to help my sister. \n\nI had to get this off my chest, thanks for reading",

    "selftext": "Me and my husband have been married for 3 years and we had a rough start to marriage, we were both very toxic to each other and ended up putting hands on each other, but over time we go the help we needed and we are trying to rebuild but it\u2019s been difficult very difficult. He was a virgin when I met him, and he was my second partner Ive been with. Lately I\u2019ve been feeling very lonely and discouraged from trying to be \u201csexy\u201d around him, before we got married and were dating he was very horny all the time and wanted it almost 3 or 4 times a day but now I\u2019m lucky to even get with him once every week or 2 weeks and I\u2019ve noticed that it\u2019s always me initiating it, also he doesn\u2019t really touch me he straight just only goes to fumble my boobs and nipples then goes down on me then we only do missionary and doggy that\u2019s it and it takes about 30 min. \nOnce I didn\u2019t initiate at all and wanted to see how far he will go to not having sex, it was a month and that\u2019s because I couldn\u2019t handle it anymore. Recently I\u2019ve been trying to talk to him about it but he says that he wants to build up emotionally because of our past and doesn\u2019t want to focus on the sexual stuff which I feel is important too. I\u2019ve bought lingerie to maybe inspire him but all he does is say I look beautiful and that\u2019s it he doesn\u2019t go feral he doesn\u2019t dirty talk, he doesn\u2019t admire me, he doesn\u2019t role play, he doesn\u2019t grab my ass nothing, we don\u2019t even make out. \n\nI\u2019m starting to feel more like a roommate, I stopped putting in the effort of being a \u201cwoman\u201d I stopped shaving I stopped plucking my eyebrows , I stopped waxing or trimming, I shower only once a week, because I thinks what\u2019s the point? And yes I\u2019ve brought this up to him multiple times and he says I still look beautiful and that\u2019s he still loves me. I just don\u2019t feel wanted or desired, I don\u2019t know how else to explain it to him. I\u2019ve said to get home and throw me on the bed and fuck the shit out of me but he says that no because he comes tired from work and dirty, which I don\u2019t give a fuck, I\u2019ve told him to look for more positions to try but he always says well you research and I\u2019ll do it. Which I dont want I want it to come out of him to want me to desire me. Ive put lingerie on and once i really out did myself i got my hair done and shaved trimmed everything but then he said that he doesn\u2019t get turned on by lingerie, but he also doesn\u2019t know what turns him on. Also one time we were getting into it and he pointed out I missed a spot when I shaved down there which made me feel really embarrassed and we ended up not doing it. I don\u2019t know what else to do really I\u2019ve brought this up to him a hundred times but he never gets the point and leaves it to me. What do I do? I feel so frustrated with the situation ",

But instead of feeling celebrated, I feel overlooked. Instead of joy, there\u2019s this heavy weight in my chest, pressing down on me, making it hard to swallow the disappointment.  \n\nFor almost two months now, my father hasn\u2019t been able to work due to a job-related injury. Money is tight so tight that even something as simple as a cake, a small token of acknowledgment, is out of reach. I understand. I really do. I know it\u2019s not their fault, and I know they love me, but that doesn\u2019t make it hurt any less.  \n\nBirthdays are supposed to be special, a day when you feel seen. But mine never really have been. I\u2019ve had birthdays forgotten, birthdays I had to share like they weren\u2019t fully mine, birthdays that felt more like an afterthought than a celebration. And now, here I am, reaching a turning point in my life, and it feels like just another ordinary day except worse, because deep down, I wanted it to be different.  \n\nWhat makes it harder is the facade I feel forced to maintain. Everyone around me assumes I\u2019m fine, that I\u2019m well off, that things in my life are smooth. My friends ask me what my plans are, and I don\u2019t even know how to answer. Do I pretend I have something lined up? Do I admit the truth? How do you explain to people that your birthday this huge, symbolic moment feels hollow because even the simplest things are out of reach?  \n\nI keep telling myself to be grateful, to focus on what I do have, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t struggling. It\u2019s not about material things it\u2019s about feeling valued, feeling like this day matters, feeling like I matter. And right now, I just feel invisible.  \n\nI know life isn\u2019t about birthdays, that one day in the grand scheme of things shouldn\u2019t define anything.

I can't afford to put him through college, he can't live with us because my abusive brother wouldn't tolerate a man living with his little sister. His life is full of regrets. He had a fullride scholarship back in New York but due to a misdiagnosed SLAP lesion, they fucked up his shoulder during a surgery and his American degree is basically worthless here. All that work for nothing. I don't know how to cheer him up. I don't want to lose my best friend and first love.",

    "selftext": "I don't know where to begin, but it's been eating at me for a while and for the sake of myself, I gotta get it off my chest.\n\nI (f19) met this guy in 2023, he randomly blocked me a little less than a year ago, and we lost contact. It's been 9 months, and although I don't \"think\" about him anymore (in the sense where I'll openly think \"oh I miss him\" out of the blue), I still feel like I see him in everyone. I've moved on, I don't think about him randomly, hearing his name doesn't upset me anymore, nothing about him hurts me anymore.\n\nThe problem is just that certain gestures that he'd do, certain things he'd say, every time someone does the same or does something that reminds me of him, he comes to mind immediately. Mostly it's the way he'd word stuff, and for some reason whenever someone says the same thing or acts similarly, it's like I have to tell myself it's not him. Nobody had ever made me feel the way he did, which I find weird cause we never dated. Kinda feels like I found my soulmate but lost him, if that makes sense.\n\nIt sucks, because I'm in a relationship, and I love my boyfriend to bits. We've been dating for around a month now, but despite that he's my favourite person. Being with him and being able to know him is the highlight of my life, so why does that one guy still haunt me? I feel so incredibly guilty writing this, because although it's not something I can help, I feel like shit about it. I feel like the guilt is eating me alive, and I'd bring it up with my boyfriend, but I know what he's like. If I do he'll start telling me to break up with him, even though he could say the same exact thing to me, and has actually admitted to feeling this way about someone before, and I'm not mad about it because I understand. \n",

I never even had the chance to see them with gray hair. I guess depression is just hitting me really hard today. I remember when my dad died that one single moment where you realize that you will never see either of your parents again in this lifetime. I know it sounds stupid but I could literally feel pieces of my heart breaking off. I guess I just want to know what yall do when you're feeling down and depressed. Besides smoking and drinking cause obviously that doesnt help.... I am so jealous that so many people that are way older than me still have BOTH or atleast one parent. If any of you feel this way then I am sorry.",

    "selftext": "Okay so there is this boy in our group and he pisses me off so much to the point I\u2019d rather watch paint dry than talk to him or hear his annoying voice and I\u2019m not even trying to be funny. I really think it would be more entertaining and less stressful. \n\nHe makes me want to rip my hair out. He just talks rubbish. Once he said you could go skiing in the Maldives then proceeded to say we were wrong and no he wasn\u2019t talking about jet skiing. He was talking about SNOW SKIING! another is, is that he only talks about 3 things boys, his hair and his home country. He talks about boys like they all want him. They don\u2019t! He says he going to dye his hair, he has been saying this since I\u2019ve met him he hasn\u2019t done anything to it. Then his home country. On multiple occasions he has lied to us about going back or buying plane tickets to go back. It just annoying. \n\nThen he lied to us about making plans. We invite him everywhere and he says he will come and never dose them proceeds to lie and say we never invited him anywhere. Which riled me up and to the point i shouted at him and I did take it a bit to far and rude and I hold my hands up to that it was wrong of me but then I apologised for that but he\u2019s now started it agian after I invited him to my birthday and then said I never invited him. The only reason i invited cuz everyone said\nI had to. \n\nI just can\u2019t deal with him. \n\nSorry if there are any spelling or grammar mistakes I\u2019m stressed and dyslexic. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": "I have severe mental health issues, and half of kids born to parents with severe mental illness end up developing it themselves. I also can't take care of a child even though I can take care of myself, albeit with much difficulty. I asked to get surgery at the age of 25 so that I can't have kids, thankfully my doctors instantly approved me in part due to my mental illness. Everyone is on board with it, where we live it used to be compulsory for people with psychosis but thankfully now only voluntarily allowed. I don't have any regrets about having the surgery and I'm excited for it to be done and over.\n\nI have been having thoughts of suicide because at my consultation I was explaining that I didn't want to pass it on to future generations. I was thinking about how different my life could be without it. I am happy with my life but if I could choose to have been born without my issues I would.\n\nI am high functioning as I have lived independently and paid bills since I was 21. I am thankful I could get out of an abusive situation and to have my basic needs met. However, it's hard and I sometimes question if life is worth it. I have breakdowns every day, I can't sleep, I hear voices saying scary things. I have lost important things, endangered myself and roommates by forgetting to lock the door or leaving my keys outside overnight by accident (thankfully nothing happened), been treated for injuries from self-harm and eating disorders. I was abused by family members and I was unable to understand what was going on or get out because of my psychological problems, I still can't go no contact yet and it's frustrating.",

    "selftext": "I was in a car accident in November of last year. Or rather, a car accident happened to me. I was on the interstate when I suddenly saw a set of headlights facing the median. They were in a T-bone position with the truck to my right. Before I could react, both vehicles slammed into me, totalling my car.  Thankfully (or so i thought) I wasn't injured. I got photos, names, insurance information, license plates, everything I could think of. I was told by two of the adjusters involved that I pretty much did their job for them. After 4 months of being pulled around, being told that I was not liable by all parties involved, that the claim was going to arbitration, then in subrogation, and finally being told that my insurance didn't cover damage to my own car, I am so frustrated and exhausted. I have a part-time job an hour away that I haven't been able to go to for the past 3 months. My husband has his own business that uses the only other car we have. I was told by so many people that I just needed to wait for liability to be settled and I'd get payment for my car. But today I was told that I am fully shit out of luck, that because insurance hasn't paid anything for repairs or a rental or anything that there's no point in paying for my car. I understand it's because I had basic liability, but I can't afford another car right now. \n\n  \nI've been trying to find a lawyer to help, but I've been told by literally everyone that it just isn't worth it to pursue. That the lawyers fees would be more than I'd get in a settlement. I've tried legal aid, the local law school, referral after referral, and as soon as I mention I wasn't injured it's over. I'm at such a loss. I don't know if it would be worth it to try and represent myself, or just leave it alone, but even the few thousands of dollars I could get for the value of my car would make things so much easier. I'm so frustrated that something so detrimental to my day-to-day is just not worth it for absolutely everyone. That I can lose my only asset, be told I've done everything right, and still be on the losing side because I wasn't injured. ",
