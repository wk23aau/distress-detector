    "selftext": "I just need to get this out.\n\nI\u2019m 44, an only child, and my mother was 64. Our relationship was never easy. Throughout my life, she always seemed \"embarrassed\" or \"ashamed\" of me for one reason or another. We hadn't spoken in three years, though deep down, part of me still longed for the kind of mother-daughter relationship I never had.\n\nThen, three weeks ago, I received a message on Facebook from my cousin, saying they had \"heard\" about my mother and hoped things got better. My heart sank. No matter what had happened between us, she was still my mom. I immediately started reaching out to family\u2014her siblings, my aunts and uncles\u2014only to be told they couldn\u2019t say anything and that I needed to call my stepdad.\n\nLong story short, my mother was dying. Stage 4 cancer. ICU. When I asked if I could see her, I was told she wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted to see me. That *hurt* in a way I can't even explain. By the time I finally made it to her home, she was in hospice care and could no longer speak. Her husband made it clear that she hadn't wanted me to know she was sick\u2014she didn\u2019t think I would care. *WTF.* I got to say goodbye, but only to the shell of the woman she once was. And now, I don't know how to process any of it.\n\nThe only time I ever really stood up to her\u2014never in a disrespectful way\u2014was when I asked her to stop belittling me in front of others and to show me some respect. I am college-educated, have never been arrested, and earn four times what she did. But in her eyes, none of that mattered. I was overweight. I had a teenage pregnancy many, *many* years ago. That was all she ever saw. This drove anxiety, depression and a few failed attempts...well, you know. \n\nShe never had a relationship with her only grandson, either. He wasn\u2019t told she was sick. He never got to say goodbye.\n\nIt\u2019s just... frustrating. Heartbreaking. Infuriating.\n\nThank you for letting me vent.",

    "selftext": "I have never been the skinny girl or the pretty girl, so when I became infatuated with a boy and finally heard him say yes to my request to date him, I thought I was in a fairytale. Last summer, I (18) went to visit my boyfriend (21), who lived over 400 miles away. I was given an ultimatum: if I didn't go see him, he would dump me. So, the naive me, hopelessly in love, agreed to take two weeks off my well-paying job to meet him.\n\nAfter a 14-hour train ride, I was enveloped in his embrace, and I felt so happy, thinking, \"This is it; he\u2019s the one.\" I was exhausted from the long day and immediately fell asleep in his bed. However, I woke up to a strange feeling and found myself unable to breathe. He was having sex with me and choking me. When I opened my eyes in shock, all he said was, \u201cYou like that? you fucking slut.\u201d I felt so stupid and used, I couldn\u2019t look at him the same way again.\n\nI stayed there for the rest of the two weeks, but all we did was argue. I wanted love and to spend time with him, while he just wanted to play games, use me, and sleep. Once the two weeks were over i got the train home to encounter a 7 hour delay, I spent a total of 21 hours on a train, only to be raped by a man in an alley at 3 a.m. on my way to the hotel.\n\nI called my boyfriend, crying and upset, as my face had been bashed in. He called me a whore, saying I shouldn\u2019t dress the way I did in public and that it was my own fault. Then he dumped me. I had a mental breakdown of sorts lost my job, self harmed almost daily never allowing my skin to be clean and overdosed twice. The worst part is no one believed me accusing me of being an attention seeker and dramatic and those who did believe me played it off as no big deal. Although it has been five months, I still feel unloved. I have always craved affection, and I genuinely do not believe anyone could ever love me for who I am without wanting to use me although i hope one day im proven to be wrong :)",

    "selftext": "I have been trying to process and work through what I saw yesterday, but it has been really hard. The event itself was a lot but now I\u2019m dealing with the \u201cwhy\u2019s\u201d which make me feel guilty since what happened has nothing to do with me. I was just a witness. I tried writing through it, but it hasn\u2019t been enough so I\u2019m trying again, thinking that if I get it in front of others I can start to live past it. \n\nYesterday evening, I was sitting on this big rock while I was waiting for the bus. A little ways down the road there was a taxi van. He was either backing out or adjusting his U-turn, but obviously reversing and not moving super fast. From where I was sitting, I didn\u2019t see how fast the bike courier was going when he hit the front side of the van. And the biker immediately went under the front wheel of the van and I could hear him and his bicycle crunch under the tire. \n\nThe position the biker was on the ground was how he stayed for the whole 20 minutes that he was out there. He never moved. So, I\u2019m almost positive he died during the collision or if there was some way he survived, he could have been fully paralyzed. \n\nBut there weren\u2019t many people to see the accident head on like I did. A man in his Jeep came out and a few security from the booth around (my stop is near a campus) came out to help. They checked for signs of life and directed traffic around him and had someone call 911. Police came and did much of the same. The fire department came and started doing CPR but they didn\u2019t take off the man\u2019s helmet. The ambulance came and I didn\u2019t see any defibrillator or adrenaline unless they did those things in the back once they loaded him on the gurney and took the man away. But even after they put him in the ambulance, it didn\u2019t leave or take off. There wasn\u2019t a rush. \n\nIt felt like I was out there for two hours but it all happened in about 20 minutes. And, it\u2019s hard to think about the collision and how if the biker hasn\u2019t passed away I\u2019m sure the injuries will last a lifetime. And I think about the taxi driver who just sat in the van with his head down and how he will most likely lose almost everything because of an accident. \n\nI don\u2019t know why I had to see it but I did and I don\u2019t know what to do with it if anything at all.

However, there are times when my mom feels a bit smothered by my dad, and this has led to arguments in the past, but I would say that overall she enjoys spending most of her time with him.  I've even tried inviting her to different events but she would often turn me down to spend time with my dad. I feel like this has led me to create an unrealistic expectation that my partner and I should be spending a lot of our time together.  A few of my partners have told me that they felt smothered, or that I was never satisfied with them. Was it a matter of different needs, or was I truly doing/expecting too much? Or is it a little bit of both?  People say a relationship is supposed to feel \"easy\" or \"natural\" in the beginning, but it's never felt that way for me.  I have to be doing something wrong-whether it's not communicating well enough, expecting too much from my partner, or not setting firm enough boundaries for myself, or maybe all of the above. ",

    "selftext": "I (22F) broke up with my boyfriend (20M) of 6 months on new years of 2024. I broke up with him for a plethora of reasons including him accusing me of stealing $500, him accusing me of cheating, him proposing, how he treated me, him telling me he was going to commit suicide and it was my fault, and much more. For the record, I didn\u2019t do any of the things he accused me of. Well it didn\u2019t end at the breakup. This specific individual is in the military and most of our relationship was long distance. He sent me death threats after the initial break up which I did contact the police and his commanding officer about. I told him to leave me alone and blocked him. However for the year of 2024, he had his friends that live where I live follow me and threaten any guy I was seeing into breaking up with me, he constantly messaged me on different numbers saying words coated in honey to try to get me back and he even showed up to my house when he was on leave. One of the many reasons I broke up with him was that he was home for Christmas of 2023 and refused to see me and I got really upset because I still \u201cloved him\u201d at that time. I have now learned through therapy that it wasn\u2019t love, I was just caught in the web. Well Christmas of 2024 came around and he was back on leave and he had his mom message me telling me that he was going to commit suicide if I didn\u2019t show up. I told her to leave me alone and it was of course an empty threat (maybe even a test). He left after that and apparently, according to his mom he was deployed. Well I got a text on my birthday (February 4th) saying that he still loved me and yada yada which went ignored and then I got a call from his military base. Apparently he had went missing in action and I was his beneficiary. I haven\u2019t heard anything from him since but I feel free finally. I have a date this week and I\u2019m going to see if anyone threatens my date into ending it with me. I kinda feel bad that I was so harsh but I also think it was survival. I think that if I was any less harsh, it would\u2019ve been a lifetime of pain for me. ",

Bland, so bland that eating a meal that would take me ten minutes takes up to an hour.\n\nI swear, any dish they make is outperformed, and I do not exaggarate here, by a fucking piece of bread with some salt and pepper sprinkled over it.

I'm pretty sure my parents eat that on the daily, just with a different look each day.\n\nIt's amazing, no matter what they make, be it soup, sandwiches, schnitzel, literally any fucking thing they make is just akin to the taste of a rock.\n\nI just finished dinner and wish I didn't.\nThankfully I have money of my own so I can just say that I'm not hungry and then go out on the town later.\nBut still, I am amazed how they eat that...

Fucking chicken and rice.\n\nIt's amazing I was able to eat that stuff for 18 years without consuming bleach, which, ironically, would have more taste than their cooking and give me my will to live back.\n\nOk, I'm better now, see ya.",

    "selftext": "My, f29, boss, m late 40s, kept the camera feed of me on his computer screen at all times. Obligatory throw away account cause the details in this might be easy for some of my coworkers to find this and I don't want to give up my main account. Also I was posting this on am I over reacting but my update actually came as I was typing this on that sub so now I'm switching it to here that everything seems to be wrapped up.\n\nSo I work in a mostly male dominated field in a CNC machine shop as a brake operator. I am the only woman at my company that works on the shop floor. About a year ago there was a fist fight between 2 other operators and there were no cameras inside to show who started the fight so both operators had to be let go. To prevent this from happening again the cameras went up all over the shop. Absolutely no blind spots, crystal clear HD camers, we know this because our boss has a TV screen above his desk now where he can watch all the cameras. He can have up to 8 of the camera feeds on his screen at one time and it has the ability to cycle though all of the feeds, switching feeds every few minutes. \n\nThe problem came about a week ago when a coworker of mine came up to me and told me there was only one feed on the screen. Me at my machine. I have never been written up or even talked to about problems with my work so I was very thrown off by this. When I had the opportunity where I could think of a reason to go into his office to see for myself when I walked in his office sure enough I saw my empty station on the screen. I pretended not to notice and just asked a question about a part I was working on that could be a reasonable question and went back to my work like nothing was wrong. Over the next week or so I tried to put it out of my mind but I couldn't get past it and more coworkers approached me and said they saw me on the screen. \n\nSo late last week I went to HR and asked if I was in trouble for anything. The HR guy looked surprised and asked me what I was referring to and I told him how closely I'm being watched and it seems to be just me singled out. He said he would look into it and get back to me but as far as he knew there was nothing wrong. About an hour later I get called into the managers office with HR, screens are back to normal showing 8 different work areas. I'm happy for a second until I am asked why I'm spreading misinformation. I ask what they're talking about and I proceed to be gaslighted for the next 5 or so minutes about how the cameras have always been this way and I'm seeking attention. I say multiple coworkers have mentioned to me about seeing it and we can bring them in to ask. They threaten to write me up if I keep bringing up this \"blatant lie\" and that I'm slandering the manager to my fellow coworkers.\n\nI contact a lawyer cause at this point I'm like fuck it I'm going to quit this job anyway might as well raise a little hell but then part of me decides it's just not worth it and with everything I've been through lately its just not worth it. I decided to contact my ex who I've been broken up with for a year and fill him in. We we're together for 5 years and he's the love of my life, about a year ago he was offered his dream job across the country and asked me to go with him. My mother was dying of cancer at the time and I was the only one she had left to take care of her. He planned on turning down the job to stay with ne but I told him I'd never forgive myself if he passed on his dream job for me. About 6 months ago my mother passed and idk why I didn't contact him but it kinda felt like my whole world fell apart so I just accepted this was my life now.\n\nWhen I told him what was going on he said \"why don't you come move in with me?\" I didn't know it but he hadn't dated anyone since we broke up (and neither had i) because he had always planned on us reuniting after my mother passed and when she did he didn't want to rush me cause he wanted to wait until I was ready. I wasn't ready at all until he asked me that question but without hesitation I said yes. I put in an application that day at a CNC shop near where he lives and that was yesterday. So that's where this post was going to end on am I over reacting for picking up and moving across the country. And then the phone rang.\n\nApparently the place I was hiring was impressed with my years of experience and they're a newer shop so I actually have more experience running a brake then most of their employees. They offered my about a 25% raise of what I'm currently making and I accepted on the spot. They asked when I could start and I said next week. Immediately called my boss and told him he's a fucking creep and that I quit. HR has been calling me nonstop begging for me to reconsider but that ship has sailed. Ex bf or possibly just bf again said he's excited for me to move in but will be setting me up in a separate bedroom at first just so we can take things slow and figure things out which I think is very smart of him and I'm glad cause I think we need that time too.\n\nMy current landlady is an absolute sweetheart and knows how rough this year has been for me so she's letting me break my lease with no penalties and she already has someone lined up to take my apartment. I asked if they wanted to buy some of my furniture since I'm only taking what I can fit in my truck and they offered me a thousand buck for my living room set and all my drawers and dressers. Not having to worry about all that I can fir the rest of my stuff in my truck easily and I'm starting my cross country trek tonight. Fuck creeps and if you're thinking about putting up with that bullshit, don't. There's always another option, maybe even one youd.never thought possible.\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey guys. Throwaway account here\u2014I (20F) just want to vent after a trip to the mall recently that legitimately made me realize just how much my body has changed. I tried on a dress in the size I was last year, and after I tried to force the zipper and it didn't work, I felt so disgusted with myself. \n\nI weighed myself on my scale for the first time in a while and realized I'd gained about 50 pounds in less than a year. I'd just started college, and a healthy eating and exercise routine I'd gotten into in my senior year of high school went down the drain during my first year as I began drinking more, getting takeout and eating out at least 4+ times a week, and not exercising (trying to balance a crazy social life with academics was just not something I was cut out for). \n\nThis year, I'm getting more into home cooking, exercising, and staying away from junk foods, but whenever I feel like I'm making progress I end up relapsing for some reason. For example, I made excuses during exam season and ended up getting a lot of takeout again, ruining my progress. Whenever I go out with friends or am with family, I feel too embarrassed to mention I'm trying to diet because I'd always been the chubby kid growing up, and I wanted to continue living as the \"thinner, glowed up\" person I'd become when that isn't who I am anymore. As a result, I end up eating a lot during hangouts or just giving in to temptations. I also sometimes have the bad mentality of \"I ate something unhealthy today already, might as well just use today as a cheat day\" way too often. \n\nOverall, this isn't just about the weight gain itself: I feel like I've lost the discipline I once had and my self-confidence just keeps slipping away. It's been a week or so after a stressful life season, and I'm attempting to start this process again. I'm now 3 days into my new routine of encouraging myself to get out more as well as eating healthier and reducing portions, and I've been seeing some good calorie deficits without even feeling too worn out. I hope I can keep up the progress this time. I need to do this for myself, not only for my physical appearance, but my mindset and to re-instill discipline. I'm not trying to make excuses, just ranting about everything here to get it off my chest. If anyone sees this, thanks for reading! ",

    "selftext": "I (14M) and my friend (14F) have been friends since childhood. People say that we are both attractive for our ages and because of that we often get shipped as a couple by our other friends. It doesn't bother me that much because I am used to hearing stuff like this. My father, however, gave me some requirements for marriage and they are odd. One of the requirements is my partner can't be the same age or older than me. The thing is, when we started talking over text, things escalated. Now we call each other romantic names. And the topic of us having children came up more than once. And there is also my friend (2 years older than me. Let's call him WILLIAM) and WILLIAM has feelings for my friend (F). But the guilt is eating me out. My parents gave me freedom and I am misusing it. Though we read in different schools, our friends and mutual friends know about us. Her friends often flirt with me for being very handsome. Though my face is one of my biggest insecurities. Yesterday I was in the bathroom of our community hall. And I saw her. She said hello, I said too. We talked and she started flirting with me. I didn't find it weird since she has done it more than once, so we were in the bathroom and she suddenly asked me \"Will you kiss me?\" I paused. And when I did, she came over and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I blushed so hard that when my mom noticed she said \"what happened, why are you blushing?\" I couldn't tell her the real reason, so I made one up. Next day she messaged me to meet in the same place. I went thinking she surely couldn't do it again. When I met her we talked for a few mins and she asked if I could kiss her as well. I didn't wanna hurt her but at the same time I am afraid of my parents. So I kissed her on her hand. She was happy, I was too, but deep down, I was dying. Now I am sitting in my room thinking, should I confess my feelings for her or should i tell abt my feelings to WILLIAM. I have to make a decision quick because this secret is something I cant hide forever.",

    "selftext": "I (14f) dress in a more alternative style (I'm goth but when trying to be comfortable switch over to grunge). As we all know, A LOT of alternative music is very 'depressing' if you can call it that, I think everyone understands. A large portion of alternative teens is also.., severely depressed. \n\nI met most of my alternative friends in the psych ward, or through friends of friends. I love them, they're fun and I used to feel like they understood me. I was in said psych ward for self harm and suicide about a year and a bit ago and yes, I still have my moments but I have learnt to manage my emotions, weaned off self harm and am no longer suicidal. I have been taking meds for depression and anxiety, but I got taken off a while ago and I am doing fine. I no longer have that 'what's the point of anything' outlook on life. I look forward to graduating, getting married, becoming independent and having children. I still have my fleeting problems with anxiety but as mentioned, in the long run I'm FINE. \n\nA lot of those friends have not gotten better. But not in the sense that they haven't been able to. I have been speaking to them and they have expressed that they don't want to get better. They are content being depressed. They also consume sad media constantly, like movies and music, and they're OKAY with that. \n\nI, though, have grown not so fond of it. I love them but I feel like I can't be around people that don't want to get better. I don't think it's a good influence to hang out with severe addicts. I don't want it to seem like I am abandoning them because they're too hard to deal with, but I don't want to put myself in friendgroups with alcoholics, people who are severely depressed and people who are constantly NEGATIVE. \n\nI came to this conclusion when one of my friends reccomeneded smoking to get rid of my problem, and I think that's when I knew that this is not the enviorment I want to be in. I just can't keep listening to the same problems over and over again when they don't want or care to fix them. \n\nI'm also starting to grow out of the alternative style. I'd rather wear bright colours and make myself look as colourful, joyful and feminine as possible. The goth make up is something I'm not into either anymore, I just don't like having people stare. \n\nNow, I recently turned to God and my friends have been.. not accepting. I told my best friend I wanted to try religion again and she got mad. She said I was abandoning her in atheism and \"Who will we hate on Christians with now?\" She doesn't like the idea of me going to church or ordering a Bible. We have had multiple arguments about this. She also recently did something controversial that I won't get into. I said I was reconsidering our friendship because of it and when she asked why I stated my reasons and added that I don't think her actions align with the type of people I should be surrounding myself with according to scripture. She got mad and blocked me. \n\nI'm sick of being misreable, sick of acting like nobody understands and sick of acting like I'm some tortured poet. I'm not. They're not.",

    "selftext": "This happened two years ago and I still cry when I think about this. I had a coworker at one point who had very thin boundaries - she would consistently causally trauma dump at work without regard to how it affected others and mostly coped with her trauma through drinking. I\u2019m fairly certain she was drinking at work, but never saw her take swigs. Just saw her acting intoxicated and smelling like alcohol. I grew up with an alcoholic parent, so her behavior was fairly uncomfortable for me to be around, meaning I did not get close to her even though she shared many very private things with me. I almost wish I had invested in her more just so I would know more about her family - maybe I would have had enough information to intervene if I had befriended her. \n\nOne day, her niece came in to work with her. This little girl was probably about 5. When she walked in the door, she had her hands cupped around the sides of her face so she could only see the ground in front of her. She made no eye contact and would not verbally respond to anyone, including her aunt. \n\nThis was the angriest child I have ever seen. She glared at everyone, held her hands in fists for almost the entire time she was there, stayed completely silent, and kept her back to the wall for the majority of the time she was in the shop. I\u2019ve been through a lot of trauma therapy and it was very obvious to me that this child was hyper-vigilant if not in fight or flight. \n\nAfter the child was picked up by another family member, I stepped outside for a smoke. My coworker, the aunt of the child, was already outside smoking. \n\nI sat down next to her and she casually said to me \u201cmy niece told her friend that someone licked her hooha.\u201d It was like cold water had been dumped over my head as she told me more about it. I felt so sick for so many reasons. A FIVE YEAR OLD told their friend that someone licked their private parts, that friend told her mom, who told my coworker\u2019s niece\u2019s parents. And no one was doing anything actionable. No therapy, no intervention, no questions. Just shrugs and \u201chope that\u2019s not actually happening\u201d. \n\nAfter my shift I called child services and went to the police station by my work. I tried everything I could to get a report filed, a welfare check done, literally anything. Because I didn\u2019t have the name of the child\u2019s parents, the police AND child services told me I didn\u2019t have enough information to complete a report. I called so many times with different ideas of how I could make a legitimate report, but I simply didn\u2019t have enough information. \n\nI think about this multiple times a week, sometimes every day for the entire day. I myself am someone who survived CSA. I have complex trauma and I know what it\u2019s like to be a child in a setting where no adults are protecting you, even when they know what\u2019s going on. \n\nOur boss commit suicide that same week, so everything at that work place became even more chaotic very quickly. I left because I could not cope with the instability. Part of me wishes I had stayed just to garner more information, but that work place was so toxic that I started to experience suicidal ideation. I had to leave for my safety. Now that I\u2019m farther removed from the experience, I feel like I could have pulled myself up by my bootstraps and stayed long enough to get more info for the sake of this little girl. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m sharing this. Yesterday this popped up in my head for the millionth time and I had such a strong reaction to the memory that I vomited. I will never be able to get the image of that little child\u2019s angry face out of my head. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget her and I will always wonder if there is something I could have done to help. ",

    "selftext": "20 years ago, I was a stupid teenager in love. My boyfriend was 23 and I was 16. Things started out great, but they progressively worsened as he introduced me to drugs. By the end of it all, I was working for an escort agency, giving the boyfriend my money. I was bullied and forced into fucking old men and I was scared to leave my relationship. My parents finally found me (I had run away) and managed to get me help. I turned things around and ended up doing well in life. I never told anyone what had happened and I had planned to take it to my grave.\n\nFast forward 15 years (5 years ago), a detective knocks on my door. He wanted to know about my ex and the sex trafficking. I reluctantly spoke with him and agreed to do some recorded phone calls at the police station in order to get a confession. I also turned over my high school journals that detailed the abuse and rapes. We recorded a two-hour confession that detailed everything. It felt like a slam dunk. That was 2 years ago.\n\nGuys, it's been 5 years and I am tired. I am tired of waiting 3-6 months to hear back from the detective. I'm tired of having to tell and retell my story to different detectives. The further I get away from it, the less I remember, and the less credible I sound. I'm tired of worrying about my safety, and if people will even believe me. And I'm tired of getting my hopes up, only to hear back from the DA that they're working on more pressing matters. I get that my case is \"old news\" and not a priority. I don't begrudge the detectives for prioritizing more current, relevant cases. But I'm tired of advocating for a win that I don't think I'll ever see.\n\nSo today, I will be emailing the detective and asking them to drop the case. I wanted to hang on because I wanted to get this dude on the sex offender registry, so that other girls wouldn't have to go through what I did. But I can't be a martyr and sacrifice myself any longer for this cause.\n\nI have no one to talk to about this. And I just need to say that I'm sorry, and I tried :(",

    "selftext": "When I was 14 I was online groomed by a 21 year old. While we never met and had sex (he tried hard to get us to meet) we would video call which was always sexual. He could have hundreds of pictures or videos of me nude. It lasted a year before the relationship ended. Started again when I was around 17. Not a lot of sexual stuff but very verbally abusive cause I wouldn\u2019t.  Completely ended when I was 18 cause my now husband helped me realise the whole thing was unhealthy. And therapy made me realise was grooming even though we never met. \n\nI\u2019m 27 now and 3 weeks ago I had a miscarriage for a planned pregnancy. I\u2019ve been numb or completely devastated since but I\u2019ve started missing my groomer and having dreams about meeting him to talk. I don\u2019t want to mention it in therapy and I don\u2019t want to tell my husband. We both know these feelings can pop up while I\u2019m going through therapy but the timing is so messed up that I would feel so much more shame and guilt about everything if I spend any time talking to professionals or someone I love about it. I understand I have to work through the grooming and I mostly don\u2019t talk about it even in therapy but why now? Why do the feelings and dreams come now at the worst time. Why do I miss him?",

I think what hit the most was that none of them says they wished I was there. It was simply a thing they did between them and then it was never brought up again. \n\nIt becomes more evident how used they are already without having me around. They made plans without including me. Even though, I was there. It would be nice just to get an invitation.

The problem is, whenever I get a call, my 4G+ drops to H+ and my game starts lagging, which is a huge deal in a game like MLBB where being AFK can ruin everything. So, I hung up. He called again, and I hung up again.\n\nNow, for some reason, both he and another friend are acting weird toward me\u2014like they\u2019re purposely cutting me off. They avoid me, walk ahead of me but constantly look back to check if I\u2019m gone, and just overall act distant.\n\nThe part that really got me was when I asked for a cigarette. They claimed they didn\u2019t have any, but they were literally heading to our usual smoking spot. Another friend (who isn\u2019t aware of what\u2019s going on) also asked for a cigarette, and I saw them looking back at me, almost like they were waiting for me to leave before giving him one.\n\nAt that moment, I knew they were avoiding me. So, I walked up to them quickly and made an excuse that I needed to go cook. One of them realized that I had caught on and started feeling bad. As I was leaving, he suddenly said, \u201cWait, maybe he has some.\u201d It was like he was trying to make up for it, but it just confirmed that they were avoiding me in the first place.\n\nWhat bothers me the most is that I\u2019ve always been there whenever they called or asked me to hang out. But the one time I decline, they start treating me like this? I don\u2019t get it. If they were upset that I didn\u2019t answer, why not just say something instead of acting all passive-aggressive?\n\nAm I wrong for feeling betrayed by this?\n",

When he confirmed that I was still breathing, the other guy left the room to go to sleep. That\u2019s when my ex started undressing me and then had sex with me.

He was diagnosed with it back in September of 2024 and has been in and out of the hospital since then. It started off with his liver failing and slowly went to his kidneys starting to fail. His feet, legs and stomach were pretty much always full of fluid that he was constantly needing to go get drained and he was always in pain. He went into to hospice about a week ago and one of his last wishes were to be at home so my grandparents had the hospital bed and all the equipment set up at there house.

He was confused most of the time, and the rest of the time he was sleeping. \n\nI got a call from my grandfather around 8:30am on Monday that I needed to get over there as fast as I can because they didn\u2019t think he wasn\u2019t going to make it much longer.

My grandma cranked up his oxygen and was able to get it back up to 94%. His eyes were open but you could tell he really wasn\u2019t seeing anything. He could hear us but couldn\u2019t talk, he could hardly breathe,every breath he took was a gasp and then nothing for a second and then a gasp again.

    "selftext": "\nFor the context, our love felt more beautiful than anything I\u2019d read in books or seen in movies, deeper and more real in a way that\u2019s hard to explain. Part of it was because we both had real trauma growing up, which made us so similar. We bonded so purely and beautifully, expressing our truest selves to each other. It was more than I ever could\u2019ve dreamed of. Even our first kiss, after nearly a year of waiting, was unlike anything else, the world didn\u2019t just feel like it stopped, it did. We were also overwhelmed, and he cried like babies as he kissed me. That\u2019s the kind of bond we had.\n\nI never wanted long distance, so he promised he\u2019d move to my city, but he never did, mentioning financial reasons. Still, he visited every few months, and we always looked forward to those moments. He even deactivated his socials on his own, though I never had any problem or concern with them. \n\nOf course, not everything was perfect. His one toxic trait: whenever things didn\u2019t go his way, or we argued, he\u2019d start disrespecting and insulting me. It was a dealbreaker, but I still tried to be understanding. He had no real human connections all his life. He never even got to talk much to his family because of it being dysfunctional, no close friends, zero experience in relationships. I told myself he just can\u2019t do any better, or could be because BPD runs in his family, or maybe because of the traumatic environment he grew up in. \n\nBut now, for the last four months, things were rough. We even broke up for a few days, ironically after our first intimate experience. I felt insecure or anxious afterward (he was my first boyfriend, and I have a bit of sexual trauma too), but he misunderstood it, assuming I didn\u2019t like it or didn\u2019t want it again. After that, he changed, became indifferent, stopped reassuring me, and didn\u2019t seem to care about the relationship at all or even if we break up. It reinforced my fear that he didn\u2019t feel the same anymore, trapping us in a cycle of blame and misunderstandings. I had spent so many nights crying during that time. \n\nHe eventually felt sorry and we fixed things, but I had already noticed a red flag: he seemed to care about physical intimacy more than anything; and shut down when he thought he wouldn\u2019t get it. So then I started noticing more. During this rough phase, he reactivated his accounts, made new ones and never mentioned even after we patched up, and tried to hide them when asked. It also started needling me for the first time that why had he never added me on his instagram and its been so long we\u2019re together, and I once saw a text from a coworker that felt off.\n\nI couldn\u2019t ignore it all anymore. So, I decided to have a sudden, intense conversation with him, hoping his reactions would reveal the truth. \n\nThen his reactions did reveal. A lot. Not just cheating or anything, but about his whole identity. \n\nI started asking, he was so confident with his grand words and said that I can have his passwords and his phone (because he knew I\u2019d never do that I don\u2019t believe in invading privacy in a relationship). He kept manipulating me into believing there was nothing, and I almost fell for it, he was that good. But then, we stumbled upon the conversation with his coworker. He initially refused to let me see it, then tried to manipulate the situation. When I finally read it, I noticed he had tampered with it. The last text had originally been 12 weeks ago, but now it showed 17 weeks ago. And then, the part that made my heart sink: them talking about how fun it would be when he will move to Germany, and how she would be waiting for him.\n\nThat explains why he was so excited and obsessed about moving there, it didn\u2019t make sense to me. But I believed it could be because he\u2019s travelling alone for the first time. Those texts were from months ago, right after he started that job. Now, five months in, i believe they must have something concrete going on. It\u2019s pretty clear from the way he provided no further clarifications when I saw that and refused to show anything else (they converse usually on discord he could\u2019ve shown that if he was real). \n\n\nBut what struck me even more than the cheating was seeing in real time, how good he is at manipulation. My friends warned me, but I never believed it. He seemed too pure-hearted. But that day, I saw it: how effortlessly he lies. I\u2019ve never seen anyone lie that efficiently. Even when I was trying to ask, he turned down all of my questions with so great replies that I started feeling like \u201cWhat am I even thinking?\u201d\n\n\nHe was even at that time making a grand gift for my birthday. It included multiple handmade beautiful gifts including a scrapbook, different boxes each with different kinds of letters and tapes in it for different situations. He was even better with words, the things he said, and the way he made me feel. It\u2019s driving me insane. How can someone be that person (and) be cheating at the same time?? It\u2019s giving me a complete identity crisis. If he\u2019s really this good at manipulation, like I saw yesterday, then none of his words were real. His entire personality was fake.\n\nHe was standing there so willing, so confident about giving me passwords or proving his loyalty. But the moment I \u201cactually asked\u201d, he changed completely. He stalled, started arguing and gaslighting, clearly, anything to buy time. He tried deleting chats right in front of me, thinking I wouldn\u2019t notice, thinking he could gaslight me again. Maybe he was too frantic to cover his tracks this time, but it was so obvious. This time he was maybe too much in a panic to realise how evident his manipulation is or to control what I\u2019m thinking. And I know the coworker thing is just the one thing I happened to catch. The way he deleted other chats before giving me a bit of an access, it all proves there was so much more happening, in those months. Until now. \n\nThis has traumatized me to the point where I feel like nothing is real. Like I\u2019ll wake up and everything around me will be gone, like everything is in my head. I know this is just the trauma speaking, and hopefully, I\u2019ll be okay soon. But it has shaken me to my core. If this is true, then everything\u2014he\u2014was a lie.\n\nHow can someone be so convincing, so manipulative? For the first time in my life, I\u2019ve seen deception on this scale, and it\u2019s terrifying.\n\nIn a nutshell I observed so big of a contradiction between what he is portraying so confidently and the real truth. And now I don\u2019t know who he is.",

    "selftext": "I've (17M) liked this girl for far longer I'm willing to admit. She's the most intelligent (it's actually incredible), she's sweet as pie, with a sense of humour as good as silver, and she's gorgeous. She's objectively the best. She's in a league that's hers alone. But what\u00a0*actually*\u00a0makes her special is the sense of bliss and hope her presence creates.\n\nIn June 2024, my then-best friend started talking to her\u2014intimately\u2014just two weeks after he stopped begging his ex (who he'd been super manipulative &amp; toxic to) to take him back. I trusted him when he insisted I was just being paranoid. Then, two weeks in, he became her first boyfriend. She had once hated him but dismissed his past behaviour as \u201cjust alcohol and family problems.\u201d She believes he's the only one who understands her. He lied repeatedly, told her I liked her just before asking her out, and even lied that I had slapped him. I was humiliated. Looking back, he was always a sleazy friend.\n\nIt's been 9 months since. I've become increasingly lonely as I have to avoid most hangouts because for the sakes of my mental stability I cannot bear to be around my ex friend. The rest of my friend group seems unbothered. Neutrality is king.\n\nI feel I've been unremorsefully abandoned by everyone close to me in favour of some weasel who solely acts in self-interest with no regard for morality or empathy. I feel so disposable. It feel purposeless and as if the world were mocking all which I believe in. It's killing me. Every breath is exhausting. Living like this makes life itself unbearable.\n\nThe worst part is it's all my fault. I hate myself for it. I had so much time to be the one to connect with her, or even to just admit my feelings, but I never did. I promise it wasn't a lack of will but one of wit. I would've done anything, but I didn't know anything to do. I still don't really get the whole emotional connection thing. Maybe that's why I'm disposable.\n\nI don't know what to do with myself anymore, I'd appreciate any advice.",

    "selftext": "Throwaway acc. \n\nI F29 feel stuck in my life and feel sad. I\u2019ve felt like this for a number of years. In fact it started when I started my current role in healthcare after qualifying form university. I\u2019ve thought about a career change so many times and have dabbled in a few things but haven\u2019t fully dove into anything bc as much as I dislike my job, I\u2019m good at it and earn a decent salary. It\u2019s also a safe job. \n\nLong story short, I come from a poor working class background, mum with mental health issues, parents divorced and live separately. Mum is on benefits and dad works a minimum wage job. I come from a background where we don\u2019t just abandon our parents and I love them and want to help them. I\u2019m however an only child. \n\nI\u2019ve been married to an amazing person a number of years ago and as amazing as he is, he too is burdened with family issues. We also live with the in-laws. His mother became disabled last year and a lot of her care is depended on him. He also holds responsibility for his disabled sister as well. He does a lot for everyone; he\u2019s practically had to be the dad of the family since his dad wasn\u2019t around much when they were younger. But now I see it taking a toll on him and he won\u2019t admit it, only in snippets he says \u2018I sleep so much bc I\u2019m so stressed\u2019. I try to support him as much as I can, but he\u2019s doesn\u2019t want me to get more stressed with my family stress too.\n\nI believe my stress comes from having a poor relationship with money. But let\u2019s not deny that you need money to survive in this world. However, I feel this huge financial burden that I need to provide for my parents, especially as they near to pensioning ages and I really don\u2019t want their financial stress when we have children bc no doubt it will happen. \n\nI had a plan of my job role for this year and it was going to allow me to be in a higher position and earn more money. However, this now is either not going to happen or will be delayed. Then I questioned myself, do I even want it? Or am I doing it to save my family from poverty. \n\nThe problem is that I don\u2019t want know what I want to do. I went into this career path when I was younger but I regretted it so much. Due to stress I\u2019ve developed PCOS and I\u2019m 2st heavier than my previous baseline. I\u2019m always tired, my husband is always tired and I feel that we don\u2019t enjoy life as much bc of all responsibilities and we don\u2019t even have children yet!!! Adding children onto this will just cause misery I\u2019m sure of it \n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do. We\u2019re all trying our best but before being married, even in a relationship; when I felt stuck I would change my environment and look for things to do. I can\u2019t do it as much anymore bc it\u2019s not a me decision anymore it\u2019s a we decision and although we have plans to move out, we\u2019re saving up and you know what the housing market is like, so it will take a while.\n\nAnyways thanks for reading this if you got to the end \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd",

When it was the 5 of us and I was having troubles keeping up with the older ones, we would run around each town we lived in and just have fun. We'd walk to stores and parks, we even lived in a rural hot valley area (basically a desert) and would roam around and tell each other stories. \n\nWe'd have hang out spots with other kids and play until sundown. Then we'd sprint home because Mom told us to be home by the time the street lights are on and they were already on. \n\nI miss when my brothers were into drawing so we would all sit at the table and draw together. We'd also play board games, card games  (even poker lol) all day and have a blast. When we got a console we would sit and watch my brothers play games like Skyrim, Fall Out or we would play Halo 4 together. \n\nI hold all of these moments so close to me even though i don't talk to any of my siblings anymore. I can't bring myself to, not after the trauma we all went through. My mother was terribly abusive. It was always us against her. Then it became her against me because my older siblings moved out all at once and i became the focal point for her negative emotions. I'd be lying if i said i wasn't a little resentful about that. But i understand it now.\n\nI don't have any emotional connections to my siblings anymore, last time i was around all of them they all felt like strangers.

I think it was the realization that made everyone leave. \n\nI know the abuse was happening my entire childhood, but i miss what it's like having a sibling. \n\nI crave familial connections, it's why i'm so desperate to have my own family, but not with my mother and siblings.

This girl was the classic friend \"I didn't have to worry about\" and she's absolutely beautiful and also a really kind person.

Moreover, I've always felt insecure about her and \"inferior\", in a certain way, so I would just like to put this all behind me and forget about it.

Yet, he thinks that's just how things should be.\n\n\n\nToday, I will be moving away for university.\nThis is the first time I'll be living by myself, in a huge city, as an autistic person with a lot of social anxiety and a bit agoraphobic. \nI also depend a lot on my mother.\nShe's going with me for a week to help me and support me.\n\nShe asked my step dad to feed the cat for this whole week.\nHe doesn't want to.\nHe says he will not touch her litter box and won't feed her, because according to him, the room will smell like death.\n\nI found my mom crying today because of this, she thinks he'll leave her to die or set her outside and she'll go missing, or die outside too.\nWe have no one else to ask for help.\n\nI told my mom that, she may have made me forgive this man who was homophobic towards me, made a bunch of weird sexual comments about me even when I was a minor, talked shit about me to my own family and his family, threw away two week old kittens out of the house to another side of the road in front of me, cheated on my mother multiple times, and told us to pack our things and get out whenever he felt like it, but if anything happens to my cat, I will never, EVER forgive this piece of shit.\n\nI hate this man. He has made my life miserable for years. Whenever I think he can't step lower, he does.\nThis is a life for God's sake. It's an innocent life that can't take care of itself.\n\nMy mom thinks he's doing this out of spite for her.\n\nI hate him.\nI hate him so much. I'm so tired. ",

But then I had to move to my real home with my father, mother, and brother. I joined a new school, and everything changed. I struggled to keep up with the new environment, and my schooling started falling apart. I became depressed.\n\nSomehow, I managed to pass my 10th through NIOS open school. Then I joined a government school for my 11th, but I fell into the wrong friendships. That led to me being sent off from school.\n\nHere comes the plot twist...\n\nAfter that, I was just sitting idle at home while my brother was doing his BTech in Biomedical Engineering from a well-known government college. My father had passed away by then, and I started feeling like a burden to my mother. I wanted to help her financially, so I started looking for jobs.\n\nFor two years, I worked multiple jobs\u2014petrol pump operator, hospital attender, security guard\u2014just trying to earn something.\n\nThen, in November 2019, after quitting my exhausting job as a hospital attender at the age of 19, I joined Delhivery as a courier delivery person. The job was insanely tough\u2014at least 30 deliveries per day for a salary of \u20b98,000 per month. I lasted two weeks before quitting and joining Swiggy as a delivery rider.\n\nSwiggy was fun at first. I was earning daily, spending recklessly on food and cigarettes, just living in the moment without thinking about the future.\n\nThen, two weeks later, everything changed.\n\nOne late night, around 11 PM, on my way back home, I met with a horrific accident. A truck carrying a full load of wood logs crashed into my bike.\n\nThat moment destroyed my life and shattered my mother\u2019s hopes.\n\nI was bedridden for 4 years. My injuries were severe\u2014multiple fractures, permanent damage to my hip and leg. The hospital treatment was not good enough, and recovery was extremely difficult.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t give up.\n\nAfter years of suffering, I finally started walking again. And now, I\u2019ve joined BCA online at Manipal University Jaipur to build a better future for myself.

    "selftext": "Edit: i forgot the obligatory Click meniton  \nI (16M) have a mother who loves birds, especially cockateils, she has three in total, until about 2 months ago. two of them ended up getting a little too close and WHAM. babies. Now my mother is overall not very good at parenting, she messed up me and my sister pretty bad. But when it comes to her pets she at least acts like she loves them.\n\nNow when these babies hatched, two survived, and they were looking really nice and healthy, that was until a couple weeks ago. my mother was starting to get annoyed at their constant screaming (you know... as babies do) and decided that they were eating enough seed, it wouldnt matter if they were seperated or not from their parents (they were still being fed by their mother and father occasionally throughout the day). so cue her forcibly taking them, cramming them into a small cage, and not letting them see their parents anymore so they \"wouldnt scream again\".\n\ni was going to say something, but due to being too scared to say anything (if anyone disagrees with her on something big, she gets explosive) i kept my mouth shut. i mainly helped her with them when we had to hand feed them when they were infants, so i wasnt as worried as checking on them as i should have been, becuase i thought she could handle it. aparently i was wrong, she cant, and her decision to seperate them ended up being fatal for the youngest. in heindsight i think he was stressed from being seperated from his mom so suddenly, and so he stopped eating. according to my mom, he haddent really been eating too much over the past two weeks or so (ie, since she seperated them). i could be wrong though. (i have some experience with birds and i at least do my reserch.)\n\nthe youngest couldnt stand up. just trying to walk resulted in him just stumbling and falling over. i asked my mom why dont we take them to an avian vet, to see if something was wrong, and her words were \"i dont want to deal with some sick bird, its too stressful. if they die they die. and plus the vet bill will probably be 200 dollars and i dont want to spend that much\" so cue me flabbergasted, i try and hand feed the bird, at least a little bit. and it works, he's eating some, and putting him on his mother's cage floor, and hes slowly eating some seeds. im estatic, and i think, \"oh, ill check up on him in an hour.\"\n\ncue me falling asleep for a few hours instead, and  i wake up to check on him, and he's already passed away. i tell her, and what does she say? \"oh well, i'll bury him tomorrow put him in a plastic bag until then\" (not really relevent, she buried all our previous pets in plastic ziplock bags and such so thats going to be a nice supprise for the next owner. i recommended that she stop doing that but she still does anyway)\n\ni cant belive im related to her, how can one person be so heartless. she loves all her pets until they get sick, then theyre just another burden to her, talk about unconditinal. and worst thing is, i bet she wont even listen and pretend like it died from some illness. again, it could have been something else but im pretty confident she killed it.\n\ntldr: my mom shouldnt have birds, and especially never should have tried to hatch and raise baby cockateils if she really gets annoyed that easily. birds will be noisey (i know from experience).",
