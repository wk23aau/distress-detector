    "selftext": "My partner and I were in bed watching silly videos when a clip of a comedian popped up, asking people about the weirdest place they'd had sex. Without thinking, I laughed and said, \"Oh, for us, it was definitely the beach! Remember when we used to go there?\" (For context, it was a very isolated beach.)\n\nBut then, he looked at me and said, \"Nooo, the weirdest place was in the bathroom at Asda.\"\n\nI froze. What?\n\nI stared at him, confused. \"We never had sex in a bathroom at Asda.\"\n\nHe insisted we did\u2014back when he was living with his brother and I was staying with my aunt. He even painted the scene: our son was asleep, so we snuck off to the bathroom.\n\nOnly\u2026 our son wasn\u2019t even born yet. I was pregnant at the time. And I am absolutely sure I would remember having sex in a supermarket bathroom. That kind of adrenaline rush would have stayed with me forever.\n\nYet, he kept insisting it happened.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when it hit me.\n\nDid he cheat on me and forget that the person he was with wasn\u2019t even me?\n\nThis was 10 or 11 years ago, but still, I would not have forgotten this. And I know this because I remember every place I\u2019ve ever had sex in public, even from before I was with him. So this made absolutely no sense to me.\n\nSo yeah, there you have it\u2014the truth off my chest.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nEdit or update whatever you want to call it \n\nI didn't expect this post to get so much attention. This is my first time posting here. This is not AI or fake. English is not my first language, but I am somewhat fluent. My grammar isn't the best, so I asked AI to correct it, I don't see a problem with that.\nAnd seeing how some people are roasting me in the comments for being with a cheater, saying my child deserves better, hoping he's not a doormat like his mom, and that I deserve this I can only imagine what the comments would look like if my grammar was bad!\nAs for those commenting about my child:\nHe doesn't know anything about this. He's never seen us argue, all he sees is what we let him see. Apart from the things I mentioned, we've had a very loving relationship the cheating 5 years ago I forgave and I dont regret that, we have been happy trust is still hard sometimes, but at the moment in the present he has not given me reasons to think that he has cheated or though about it. I understand what people are saying, that he might be abusive or mentally manipulating me but I dont really see it that way maybe when we argue but I don't think he does that on purpose or maybe I'm just blind .\nRight now, I\u2019m thinking this might be something he's confusing with a dream, or something like some people have said.\nThinking back, I have mentally blocked out a lot from that time, I had a very stressful and traumatic pregnancy, and it's not something I want to get into or talk about.\nI posted this just to get it off my chest. \n\nPlease don't offend me in the comments that's just mean, and don't bring my son into it he has nothing to do with this! \n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons, his initial is changed for safety, and I\u2019ll try not to include too many specific details, but this is a long one. Here goes:\n\nI started dating D after meeting at a bar, and things were amazing at first, as they usually are with narcissistic abusers. After a short period, his mask started to slip. He would sext me about his far out fantasies, some weird but benign, others dark and twisted. Sometimes I said no, but often I played along because some of the things he was suggesting I was fine experimenting with or could see myself potentially liking. And he was crazy hot, and the most charming person I\u2019d ever met. And I knew he had been a player, but I didn\u2019t mind. So had I, so it felt like a good match. I was falling in love with him and he (so he said) with me. We became official, and things immediately took a turn for the worse. \n\nThe first night he beat me up and raped me, I was on psychedelics that he encouraged me to take, and he convinced me afterwards that I had consented to the whole thing. That it was BDSM. That anything I didn\u2019t like was fine but wasn\u2019t his fault. (Mind you, BDSM requires specific, lucid, ongoing, and enthusiastic consent, and a safeword, which we did not have.) I think my brain chemistry was permanently changed that night because I sobbed in his arms and allowed myself to believe him. The gaslighting, heavy swings between silent treatment and intense attention, casual cruelty in our conversations, and lovebombing increased from there. \n\nLater on, D coerced me into group sex within which I was sexually assaulted by a stranger multiple times at his direction, before he assaulted me, damaged property, and ran before the police were called. He convinced me again that he thought I had consented to everything. He masterfully gaslit and lied and manipulated me and my memories felt untrustworthy. He convinced me I was going to ruin his life if I pressed charges. Under the trauma bond that had formed that I mistook for love, he convinced me to rescind my statement to the police. And we \u201cmade up\u201d. \n\nThe last time I saw him was the worst night of my life and the last time he raped me. I had been drinking all night at his direction, and once we started, he did not stop. Not when I was choking and struggling under him, not when I was crying and begging him to stop, not when I went limp, not when I had lost a pint of blood, not when I passed out. I am lucky to be alive. \n\nBut in the morning, the trauma had taken most of my memories. I pretended I was okay, but he knew what he had done. When I realized I had to seek medical attention the next day, he told me I was overreacting and ignored my pleas for aftercare. I begged him for compassion and promised he\u2019d done nothing wrong, but he refused. As the days passed, my memories started to return. As they did, I started to try to hold him accountable. But as I\u2019m sure many of you know, narcissism does not allow for accountability. Every attempt of mine to break up with him was foiled, until he finally decided to \u201cbreak up\u201d with me. \n\nMy horrific memories continued to return to me, and so I went to the police. Anyone want to guess how that went?\n\nWhen they closed my case citing insufficient evidence, I was devastated. But I felt more than anything that I needed to warn the next woman. I posted my experience anonymously, and a woman came forward that he had drugged and SA\u2019d years prior. More second-hand stories started coming out of the woodwork. So I posted him again. My case was closed, but my experience was real, and I realized people needed to know he was going to do it again and had probably done it before. \n\nYeah, not probably. Definitely. Dozens of women in a weekend in my extended circle of mutuals, and more outside of that, started sharing their experiences of abuse at D\u2019s hand. Everything vile under the sun\u2014sexual harassment, druggings, assault, blackmail, theft, manipulation, coercion, violence, and rape. Over MANY years. \n\nD is a true serial rapist, abuser, and predator. His disarming charm and looks and fake feminism and subsequent manipulation and gaslighting had not just worked on me, but friends and roommates and coworkers and romantic partners. It has been overwhelming, and heartbreaking, and sickening. But when I went to the cops, I thought I was alone. When I shared my experience, I thought I was alone. And now I know I\u2019m the farthest thing from alone. And you bet litigation and a reopened case are incoming.\n\nBut I\u2019m writing this post because I learned tonight about some of the things he did to another ex-girlfriend. Worse than he did to me, worse than you can imagine. For a lot longer. My body has been shaking non stop and I am livid after seeing photo evidence and hearing her story. Every time I think this whole situation can\u2019t get worse, it does. \n\nI am so beyond angry at him. I am so disgusted with myself that I allowed him into my bed and into my life\u2014that I stayed after he showed me his true colors. My belief system is so deeply rocked to my core, that a human being can be this consistently evil and on top of that, not get caught for a decade. I am terrified that he is going to come after me for exposing him to the larger community. And I am furious at all of the people around him who had to have enabled his horrific behavior. His family members who know of his history of abusing women, his male friends who listened to female friends try to share their experiences and brushed them off or gaslit them. His roommates who participated in or witnessed his crimes and kept quiet. The fucking POLICE who have done nothing to keep my city safe from this man or take my reports seriously or compassionately, despite him having multiple prior arrests and restraining orders against him. And most of all heartbroken at all the women before me who felt so alone and like they couldn\u2019t come forward. And I feel guilty that I\u2019m just a little bit angry at all of them too, because I wish just one of them had felt like I did, that I had to stop this from happening to the next girl. Because I was the next girl. And I\u2019m forever changed.\n\nI don\u2019t know where to go from here other than to a courtroom, but so much work lies ahead of me. Of us. I\u2019m in therapy and taking each day as it comes. Several of the other survivors who\u2019ve had years to heal are standing behind me and helping holding the pieces together, but it\u2019s hard. And after what I heard today, I feel broken. \n\nBut I\u2019m also spiritually wound tighter than I ever have been. Maybe the universe somehow connected us to give him one last chance to learn empathy and be a good person and partner, and give me one last chance to step away from men who disrespect my boundaries the first time. And we both failed. But the result of those failures is broken cycles\u2014I will never let a man disrespect me again for the rest of my life, and D will not be able to continue his pattern of abuse. Perhaps our paths crossed for me to be my own savior whilst being his undoing. All I know for sure is that I am not fucking alone anymore. None of us are alone anymore. And I\u2019m hopeful that our power in numbers will deliver him the consequences he deserves. \n\nThank you for reading. Please, MEN, and women, and everyone in between, believe. women. when they come forward. Believe them the first time. This incredibly fucked up situation should never ever happen again. And to survivors everywhere: you are not alone. ",

    "selftext": "As the title says, I have fallen madly in love with my best friend. We\u2019ve known each other for 2 years as we met at the start of college, and in our little friend group that consists of about 10ish people we are the closest. My passion for her has grown so much in the time that I\u2019ve met her and gotten to know more about her. We have gone on many friendly dates to restaurants and coffee shops and we have made that a routine thing. We share so many interest like our music, taste in films, food, and fashion sense. We have even gotten matching tattoos together. Whenever either of us has something happen to us we immediately share it to each other. She has only been in two relationships and in both relationships she was only used for sex and her body. I have been in a similar situation where someone will be with me just for sex. But I don\u2019t care at all about her body, don\u2019t get me wrong she has an incredible one but it\u2019s not what I\u2019m into. I\u2019m into the way that she talks with me and the way that we share jokes. I know that If I was in a relationship and we never had any sex or I never even saw her naked I would still be incredibly in love with her because I\u2019m in love with her soul and her being more than her physical body. I feel that I could give her anything she wants or needs in a relationship and I wanna tell her about my feelings, but I\u2019m so afraid that if I do that I\u2019ll lose and if I do lose her than there\u2019s no point in me being in this existence.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nFor the second consecutive year, I stayed at Great Wolf Lodge from 6/23-6/27. I visited the park, Kings Island, on 6/25 &amp; 6/27. In a perfect world, I\u2019d love to tell you about everything I did, and the people I met. But unfortunately, the sense of joy, rejuvenation, and fulfillment I get by being there was tarnished by an incident that took place at the end of the trip, and at park closing on the 27th.\n\nThis post is as long as it is to make sure I cover all the details of what happened as specifically as I can. It's now been eight months since this took place, so I needed some time before I went public about this. What I hope to accomplish with this is to have a better understanding of the world from a unique perspective, and to use this as a learning tool to learn from someone else's misjudgements. I'm posting this with the complete acceptance, understanding that this story may bring some type of criticism in my direction, and honestly, to achieve some type of closure on this particular incident. With all that being said, I'll begin...\n\nOn the night of June 27th, I was in the Fast Lane Queue for \u201cOrion\u201d to get a Post-Fireworks Night Ride. That day, I was wearing a white Ross Chastain \"Gone Fishing\" Busch Light Car T-Shirt, Wrangler Jean Shorts, and All-Black Under Armour Men's Charged Rogue 4 Running Shoes. I was at the top of the steps and happened to introduce myself to two young ladies who were sitting against the fence in the station. To best describe it as many of you know, there\u2019s a 3-4 foot gap between the station and the stairs before you actually enter the station. If I was to guess, I originally thought these two females were in their early 20\u2019s, I\u2019m 28 for context, but they ask me\u2026\n\n \u201cAre you gonna be our new besties???\u201d \n\nNo girl has ever asked me a question like that. So I\u2019m of the impression that they\u2019re attracted, to me, and assumed they\u2019re of legal age, so I jokingly responded\u2026\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna be leaving tonight, unless you had something else in mind\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd even if things worked out, I wouldn\u2019t have bothered because I have a 2 +/- Hour Drive in front of me back home to Louisville after I do this Night Ride. But the girls then look at each other very awkwardly and say something along the lines of\u2026\n\n\u201cDude WE\u2019RE 16!\u201d\n\nI profusely try to apologize, but they begin to overreact and make a scene in the station, escalating the situation, and start running down the steps of the normal queue. And I apologize to the greeter and to a ride attendant, because I didn\u2019t know that they were underage. As I\u2019ll explain later in more detail, that part of the situation, like all parts of this situation could\u2019ve been resolved with an apology, and life could\u2019ve went on. As this was misunderstanding.\n\nSome may ask why I didn\u2019t just ask how old they were. I\u2019ve been raised on the idea that asking women how old they are is inappropriate.\n\nSo I finished my ride which while it was spectacular, I\u2019m kinda nervous about what happened beforehand as I head to my locker to retrieve my belongings. Mine was on the section closest to the On-Ride Photo Desk and I\u2019m not able to open it, probably because the park is now closed, so the rental by default has expired. So while I\u2019m about to get someone to help me get this locker opened, two teenage boys confront me very aggressively on the situation before the ride saying something in the realm of\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing touching up on these little girls!!! You should know better!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wear that cross on your neck and do something like that?! How would god feel about that?\u201d\n\n*For context, I regularly wear either black or silver cross necklace. I've had many people make conversation about that.*\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed in you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere, until you apologize.\u201d\n\nThey also asked if I was at Soak City earlier, which I was to check it out for the first time and look through some of the shops. But they claimed I made inappropriate physical contact with someone there to. Which I didn\u2019t.\n\nI know that isn\u2019t exactly what these two gentlemen said, but it\u2019s what I remember as my anxiety ramped wondering how do I get outta this dilemma that just got handed to me on a silver platter. But a couple of things, I never groped these women. The park has security cameras everywhere, including in the coaster\u2019s stations, so there\u2019s proof that didn\u2019t happen, and I also attempted to explain to these two gentleman that I had no clue they were 16. Again, I thought they were in their early 20\u2019s, college age. But they weren\u2019t buying it as both told me\u2026\n\n\u201cBRO, YOU COULD TELL!\u201d\n\nMany women look older than they actually are. So you really can\u2019t sometimes.\n\nBut they both proceed to exercise public humiliation on me by shouting how I was, \u201cTouching up on little girls!\u201d to everyone who was leaving Area 72 that evening. Like they\u2019re the men from \u201cDads Against Predators\u201d on Locals.\n\nFinally, security steps in to figure out what was going on, and by the request of these young men. One guard originally begins to interview me, but then attends to the younger gentleman who initiated the confrontation, so another guard interviews me and I explain everything as detailed as I can, and as calm as I can l which in the moment, was pretty impossible to accomplish. I finally got my things outta my locker, then this guard escorts me to the front of the park to see what his supervisor or coworkers had to say on the matter, and they told me\u2026\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re good to go sir, nothing else is gonna happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext time when you\u2019re having small talk, just be more careful.\u201d\n\nSo I walk the path back over to Great Wolf where my car was parked. I checked out from there that morning and was granted permission to keep my car parked there. But as I\u2019m then at the North-End of the parking lot, in the small section that walks Southeast-to-Northwest, what appears to be a Black 2014 Honda Civic pulls up, and it\u2019s the teenagers again. The gentleman in the passenger side ask for my name, number, address, and zip-code. Which I like this whole time, cooperate and disclose it. And many of you may ask, why would you give your information to them? They aren\u2019t police or security. I thought that being honest, and cooperative would salvage my reputation in this situation. And what if they can tell that I\u2019m lying. So after doing so, he says to me\u2026\n\n\u201cWe just got banned for a month. This is my favorite place to go to. Have a good night, I love you.\u201d\n\nThen they take off into the night.\n\nTo be honest, I should\u2019ve walked down Columbia Road instead of the walk path to avoid the possibility of further encounters. But at that point, I thought the teens left at that point. Or ask security to escort me to my car, if they\u2019re allowed to do that.\n\nAfter filling up my car at the GoCo on Kings Mills Road, I began my drive home. I look over to my left on Southbound I-71 to look at the park one last time, despite it looking so spectacular in person at night, I was unable to enjoy it because of what all just happened.\n\nHere\u2019s how this situation should\u2019ve been resolved\u2026\n\nIf I were the girls, I\u2019d peacefully, and politely inform me, \u201cSorry to tell you, but we\u2019re actually 16.\u201d \n\nThen I\u2019d have responded, \u201cMy apologies, I didn\u2019t know that. I\u2019ll back off, I apologize.\u201d \n\nThen the girls should\u2019ve said, \u201cYou\u2019re fine. It\u2019s all good\u201d. Then life would\u2019ve moved on and the situation would\u2019ve never escalated to the point it did.\n\nBut to begin with, if the girls never asked that question, none of this would have ever happened to begin with...\n\nIf I were either of the boys, I would have started with professionally and calmly said, \u201cExcuse me sir, you gotta minute to talk?\u201d\n\nAnd I would\u2019ve said, \u201cSure. No problem.\u201d\n\nThey could\u2019ve have offered to buy me a Dasani, then said, \u201cDo you know why we\u2019re wanting to speak with you??? Okay, there was an incident involving several young ladies in the station a few minutes ago, would you mind sharing your side of the story?\u201d\n\nAnd I would\u2019ve done just that. So they have both sides of the story and develop a conclusion and they finished the meeting by stating, \u201cOkay, we believe you did make a mistake, you didn\u2019t know their age, just be more careful next time. Thank You for talking with us and have a good night.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a reason for the saying, \u201cCooler heads prevail.\u201d You gotta assure everyone\u2019s calm in order to then get to the bottom of any situation. That never happened.\n\nThere also has to be a presumption of innocence established in the investigation process as well. That\u2019s why in the legal system, \u201cAll suspects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.\u201d Which thanks to security for helping with this incident and siding with me on this.\n\nOn June 28th, one of the male parties in the incident made a post to this group that afternoon, which was a motive to making this post in response. I waited til\u2019 now to conduct this post so I made sure I could tell my side in the most detailed and comprehensive way possible. But prior to the post either being deleted, or taken down, I monitored it by reading all the comments throughout the time that post remained up. To start, I read that I was reported to Mason Police. I was waiting to see if either they would call me for an interview, I never did. I thought about calling them myself, but when talking to someone about the matter, they recommended I didn\u2019t. This individual also claimed in the comments\u2026\n\n \u201cI watched him do what he did.\u201d\n\nBut in the post, he states\u2026\n\n\u201c2 girls came running down the stairs\u201d\n\nWhich implies that he was either at the bottom of the stairs or still at ground-level. And in addition to the wall that divides the Fast-Lane queue to the regular queue after the show building, there would be no possibility for him to have seen the incident unfold. So it seems very contradicting.\n\nAlso, another user had stated\u2026\n\n\u201cthe girls wouldn\u2019t of lied about something like that\u201d\n\nThis where I channel my inner Alex Jones and become a tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist\u2026\n\nIn retrospect, hindsight is always 20/20, I believe the possibility that those girls asked me that question, \u201cAre you gonna be our new besties???\u201d to bait me. I\u2019ll even go a step further, that I\u2019m of the belief that they might\u2019ve been of legal age, but claimed they were 16 as a convenient excuse to cause a problem. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s complete speculation. In today\u2019s society, select people love to cause and/or escalate issues to play the victim card because it gets them attention. On top of that, they also delivered misinformation by stating I had groped them. Like I mentioned earlier, there was a 4ft gap between us, that would\u2019ve been impossible. And security cameras are everywhere, and if footage was pulled up, it shows I never did that. So they lied about that to artificially make the situation look worse to garner more attention and spark more outrage. This is why you have to hear both sides to the story, then develop the conclusion. Not just hear one side and ride with it. Again, what other reason would these two girls ask me that question?\n\nIn the minutes, hours, and days following, this has greatly &amp; negatively affected my mental health as I\u2019ve had many thoughts rush through my head. I thought maybe it was best I should wait a couple years before visiting again. I\u2019m worried about the people around who witnessed what happened, how will they think of me? What\u2019s the ride attendants at Orion gonna think of me? What\u2019s gonna happen if these teens see me again? Are they gonna forget about what happened, or will they try to engage in some type of conflict? How will I be able to pick myself up from this? And am I sure I\u2019ll still be a positive asset to society? Thankfully, I didn\u2019t have to wait too long to answer that last question. On July 3rd, I visited Ark Encounter, and it felt therapeutic to be on I-71 again, then be around people again. While there, I\u2019d happen to see a mom try taking a family photo, but she wouldn\u2019t be in it, so I\u2019d ask\u2026 \n\n\u201cExcuse me ma'am, if you wanna be in the shot, I\u2019ll take the photo.\u201d\n\nAnd that situation happened 4 or 5 times that day, and to see the sense of joy, appreciation, and thankfulness expressed by these families to me reassured that I was good person, and a positive asset to society.\n\nI\u2019ve talked to many people about this for advice and support. While at the Goco/Popeyes/Dunkin Donuts on Kings Mills Road to fill up, and I talked to the guy working there about this and mentioned it was teens just looking to cause issues. When I woke up Friday afternoon, I talked to my parents immediately about this, if I didn\u2019t, they\u2019d notice something was bothering me. I also talked to select people at Work, on XBOX, and to other friends of mine, and everyone unanimously have said that I did nothing wrong, and agreed it was a misunderstanding. I wanna thank everyone who I\u2019ve reached out to for support, as this has been a difficult time. I\u2019m surprised everyone has sided with me on this, they didn\u2019t have to, but I\u2019m grateful for helping me get through this.\n\nI can only imagine the stress and anxiety women, especially attractive women feel in public. To go to any Zoo, Bar, Restaurant, Bowling Alley, Amusement Park, Movie Theater, etc. has to be sometimes unbearable. To always be looked at, or to have someone always making advances towards you has to feel vulnerable and invasive. With that in consideration, I do what\u2019s necessary to respect women\u2019s boundaries when out in public. So to even claim that I\u2019m a Predator is absolutely inaccurate. As mentioned earlier, this was a misunderstanding. These girls asked a question that led me to assume they were attracted to me, and of age. I responded based off that, then they blew it out of proportion and caused a huge mess at the end of what was supposed to be another fun and memorable multi-day trip up there.\n\nIn conclusion, the last, absolute last things I\u2019d want to do is make enemies inside the gates of Kings Island. Not within Mason, Ohio, not within Warren County, not within the Cincinnati Tri-State Area, and not within the State of Ohio period. And the other last thing I wanted is to be on the radar of the City of Mason Police Department. I imagine a day where I can call Mason, Ohio home, so I want to be on good terms with everyone I encounter. To the other parties involved if they read this post, I hope we can mutually apologize come to a better understanding of what took place so we can be on good terms with each other, achieve closure, and move forward on a positive note. I\u2019m gonna be visiting the park again this year, so I don\u2019t want us to cross paths and have any further conflict or sense of animosity or discomfort. While I\u2019m not wishing ill will on anyone, these four people possibly will be faced with a situation that\u2019s a misunderstanding as well. If so, I\u2019d want their situation to be handled calmly and smoothened out as well and as quickly as possible so they don\u2019t face any hate or animosity from the opposing parties of whatever situation faces them. And I apologize to the two young men for getting banned. Y\u2019all unfortunately, were denied the opportunity to see the Fourth of July Celebration fireworks display, and more valuable time to ride \u201cOrion\u201d, \u201cThe Beast\u201d, or whatever y\u2019all\u2019s favorite coaster might be. While I understand they were trying to stand up for what's right, it still wasn't the correct way to do so, and hopefully they learn from this as well. For me, I just use it as a learning experience to be extra careful on who I'm talking to, and not make decisions off assumptions. Which I apologize to the young ladies for doing so. I\u2019m someone who\u2019s very respectful to people\u2019s boundaries, and wouldn\u2019t wanna make decisions about that makes someone feel uncomfortable. But I do hope they apologize for asking a question that expresses attraction, only to turnaround and cause a scene that could\u2019ve been resolved with a simple apology. Nobody would\u2019ve gotten banned, and security wouldn\u2019t have gotten involved. I'm gonna be presented with 1,000 different situations and scenarios, and I'll be fine in 925 of them. Nobody is perfect. Also, it's been important for me to allow time to heal the wounds as the situation shrinks farther in the past. I come to Kings Island for peace and serenity, not drama and distress. And this sadly, was drama and distress. I've met many people in my now four visits to the park and had wonderful converstations and engagements with those people, both fellow guests, and employees. It's very unfortunate this all happened, and was more heartbreaking that it happened at the very end of this trip I took. I refuse to allow that to be the last memory I have of the park this year.\n\nThank you to everyone who took time outta their day to read this and whether or not you\u2019re going to the park today, have a great day everyone\u2026",

    "selftext": "I (F31) am immunocompromised. I have a chronic pain condition, autoimmune disorders, and multiple sleep disorders. I was even born with some of these issues, I've been in pain for forever and I get sick a lot which makes everything worse.\nI hate being a burden on people, most of the time I hide my pain. I am good at that up to a point. Probably most people who technically know me have no idea how sick I actually am while the people who really know me are unfortunately, more exposed to how bad it is for me. \n\nYesterday morning I was in PAIN, like absurd pain, like the worst pain I have ever felt. I've felt that exact pain exactly 3 other times in my life. All 3 times I was rushed to the ER under the assumption that my appendix was having kittens or something. No appendix issues were found and eventually, after about 12 hours of hell, the pain goes away. This time was no different, except this time I knew there was no reason to go to the hospital, at aprox 11 hours in it finally subsided and I was able to crash.\n\n My best friend/roommate (M24) was in the house for the first half of this. Mind you I was moaning, scream crying and begging the universe for help most of the morning. I told him the about going to the hospital each time before and receiving no help and no answers. He seemed concerned but that was it. He didn't even check on me before leaving for the day. (I was supposed to be puppy sitting while he was at work. \n\nMy bf (M36) came over about two hours after the pain subsided. He was very informed about how the day had gone for me as I had been texting him all day while he was stuck at work and school. He barely acknowledged my condition when he came in, still glued to his phone even though I started bawling like a baby as soon as he came in. I know his day wasn't easy, I ended up massaging his arm, and even skipping the snuggs and cry session I had requested via text, to hold space for how he was doing emotionally. We went to bed. He did ask how my pain was and spent a moment checking for classic appendicitis symptoms. But he was a million miles away...... \n\nI know that I am always in pain and I don't want people to dote on me but I felt so invisible and neglected today I could almost blow away in the wind. I don't think anyone did anything wrong. My whole family does the same thing (remember I've been in pain my whole life). I'm just kind of devastated. I had one of the hardest most painful days of my life, and I did it alone, I still need to cry, I still need to be held.......",

They planned on having a family intervention and question him on where the money has gone but then he just died!\nIt wasnt a surprise for anyone that he died but like goddamn what could this old man use all that money for??\nLike he would barely get out of bed he was so sick.

    "selftext": "# How I Started a Bag Store and What Went Wrong\n\n# \ud83d\udce2 Why I\u2019m Writing This Post\n\nI want to share my story about how I started a business from scratch, faced unexpected challenges, and now find myself at a crossroads. This isn\u2019t just about bags\u2014it\u2019s about resilience, risks, and the struggle to keep going when everything seems to work against you.\n\nI genuinely want to hear your thoughts because, honestly, I don't know what to do next.\n\n# \ud83c\udfe0 Life Before Everything Changed\n\nBefore all of this, my family and I had stable jobs, and life was fairly predictable. But then, everything shifted. My parents lost their jobs, and I had to step up to support them. I also had to make the tough decision to send my wife and child abroad to ensure their safety while I stayed behind and worked.\n\nI took a job as the head of security for a wealthy businessman. Every cent I made went to supporting my family. I lived on the bare minimum, just making sure I could keep going physically and mentally.\n\n# \ud83d\udc5c How the Idea of the Store Was Born\n\nMy mother, after months of being unable to work, started looking for a way to do something productive. She remembered the small bag-making business that my wife and I had started before the pandemic, which we had to shut down due to COVID-19.\n\nShe decided to try reviving it, and we applied for a small business grant. The process was slow, and after waiting nearly a year, we were approved\u2014but for much less money than we had originally planned for. We had to decide whether to take the risk and move forward or let the idea go.\n\n# \ud83d\udca1 Why We Decided to Start the Business Anyway\n\nMy mother had no prior experience in fashion or sewing\u2014she had worked in an office her entire life. But she was determined to learn. I helped her enroll in **bag design and sewing courses**, and she began developing the first models.\n\nMeanwhile, in my free time, I worked on setting up our **Etsy store**. We put everything we had into making this business work.\n\n# \u2708\ufe0f A New Opportunity\u2026 and Another Setback\n\nWhile all of this was happening, my employer decided to relocate to **Valencia, Spain**, and offered me a job there. It seemed like a great opportunity, so I moved my family and followed him.\n\nOver several months, I:\n\n* Helped relocate his family and others.\n* Assisted in finding and purchasing a new business (a plywood factory for investment purposes).\n\nBut after everything was set up, he **fired me** without warning, leaving me unemployed in a foreign country with no backup plan.\n\n# \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Where Are We Now?\n\nRight now, my family and I are living in Spain, relying on **our last savings (enough for about 4\u20135 months)**. Meanwhile, our **Etsy store has not generated a single sale**, and my mother is struggling to keep up with rent for the workshop.\n\n# \u2753 What Are We Doing Wrong? I Need Your Advice!\n\n* **Our bags are high-quality, handcrafted leather pieces.** We set the price range at **X\u2013Y$**, but we haven\u2019t made a single sale.\n* We tried advertising on **Etsy and Instagram**, but conversion is extremely low.\n* Maybe we\u2019ve chosen the wrong target audience, or our product descriptions aren\u2019t engaging enough?\n\n\ud83d\udd0e **Please check out our store and give honest feedback!** Maybe you\u2019ll see mistakes that we\u2019re not noticing? Any advice or critique would help us understand what needs to change to keep this business alive.\n\n**I\u2019m attaching the store link and a video of our production process. I\u2019d be grateful for any input!** \ud83d\ude4f",

ESPECIALLY people i dont know. You dont know who else ive offered a ride to and its not your car to offer !!!!\n\n2. To me it seems extremely rude and entitled. I dont care how close of friends we are, at least give me the heads up that you\u2019re bringing someone else. Im not a bitch, i wont say no just bc idk them or like bc it was unexpected. I just get extremely annoyed when you dont even give me the courtesy of asking???? Again its not your car to offer spots in. And if its a group plan, you dont know if im giving other people rides !! If you would have asked me \u201chey, i invited x person, can you give them a ride too?\u201d I can have the chance to say \u201coh sorry my car is full im sorry!\u201d \n\nBut no, u just show up with them and then im in the awkward position of turning them away bc theres no space and then i look like a bitch\n\nI just want the courtesy yk??? And ive communicated to my friends how it bothers me and how if they plan on inviting someone else and they are expecting ME to give them a ride, ASK ME !\n\nI literally just let one of my friends know yesterday privately how much it bothered me and he said ok. He proceeded to do it again today so instead of waiting till we were in private, i just told him in front of his guest i said \u201cim sorry my car is full. I have to go pick up my friend so theres no extra seats. if you wouldve let me know then maybe i couldve saved her a seat but i didnt know she was coming.\u201d And he claimed to \u201cnot know\u201d that his guest was gonna come but he literally invited her \u2026 -_-. And again I literally would not have had a problem saving her a seat!! He just NEVER told me he invited her so i offered rides to other people!!!! Wtf\n\nThis is rational right? Or am i just being mean. I definitely couldve worded it better bc in the end i did make his guest feel a bit bad but i was just so frustrated! Especially since i had JUST talked to him about this yesterday!!!!! It lowkey makes me feel taken advantage of like why cant u just give me the courtesy of telling me who u plan to bring into MY car. Im literally not even stingy with giving rides either, 95% of the time i say yes unless i absolutely cant. So WHY NOT JUST ASK ME. Cause now i look mean and like a bitch. \n\nWould this bother you too? ",

    "selftext": "Hi. I when I was 12 I was playing in an arcade on the slot machines and a guy came up to me and started feeding my machine with cash.   I went back every week and he paid whilst I played.  This happended over a period which I cannot remember and then one day he started to stroke my penis.   Nobody had ever touched me here before so naturally my body reacted and I got erect even though i was scared as hell.\n\nI continued to go back for six months then one day he took me to a cafe on the pier and bought me dinner. Burger chips etc.  He undid my zip on my trousers and got my cock out and jerked me off and I came my first ever ejaculation.  I keep blaming myself because I kept going back to get jerked off and fed. My mom was single parent and dad moved away. I was left alone for hours when she was working.\n\nI now realise I was groomed and sexually assaulted .  I still have these feelings of excitement when I remember this first time which then turn immediately to disgust at myself for saying nothing and letting it continue.\n\nI have had therapy when i was 16. Long story but I was addicted to the machines by now and another guy started doing the same and pay me \u00a340 for the privilege.  The money just went back on the machines.   \n\nThis second guy groomed me so much I ended up going to his flat to see his spectrum computer and he continued there which turned to blowing me and paying me 40.   The last time i went he raped me.   I ran away after and stayed out late and the police were out looking for me.  I was scared to go home as much bottom was so painful.\n\nThe police found me hiding under the pier and took me home.  I told them and mum that I had realised I was late home and rather than face the music stayed out as I was scared of getting into trouble. So naturally I was in a vicious circle the later it became.   \n\nThe accepted it and nothing was said about the assault.   I don't remember how I dealt with the pain but my brain has blocked some stuff out.\n\nFF three years and the police turned up at myself home and said I had been exposing my penis to the public. I seriously honestly have no recollection of this at all. They cautioned me and my mum shouted and screamed when they went asking why until I broke down after she said 'has someone hurt you\".\n\nShe got the police back and I made a statement.    To this day I've never been told what happened the guy. Whethery they caught him or not but I never had to go to court.   For years I thought they  filed it nfa as I was just a dirty rent boy who deserved what he got.   I feel let down by the police as I know now that I was a child and it was grooming secual assault and rape.\n\nI am a gay man and have never been able to \" take it\" (sorry for the crudeness) due to the memory.  I know it's not everything but I know I'm a disappointment for not being a real gay man.  When I have these feelings of not being good enough for anyone or deserving of anything I struggle and want to run away. As i am a let down to others for not getting over it.  I've been in a relationship for 28nyesrs and my partner he knows everything but I still regularly have these days of being not enoug, people pleasing and feeling like everyone would be better without me.\n\nFor some reason I just had my first nightmare in over 35 years and it started with the first day of being touched at 12 and ended with the rape and police.   I woke up [to my disgust] with an erection which soon went down when i was awake.   I feel sick and can't believer my body reacted in this way to a traumatic memory. I have felt guilty all these years that the guys who assaulted me made me erect and ejaculate but the therapist said it was just a natural reaction to being touched down there.  And I've accepted it wasn't my fault.  Until now.   That dream has taken me back over 40 years and to wake up erect makes me wanna kill myself. What sick fuck am i?  Or was it my 12 year old inner person that made me.erect.   I am due at work in a cople of hours and can't face the world. I am disgusted with myself again after all the years of counselling and accepting i was a child and they we're adults and as such I took no blame whatsoever.\n\nBut this fucking nightmare has moved the goalposts.   Why the fuck would I wake up sexually excited over something so traumatic?\n\nThe only thing I can think of is yesterday my partner and I and his sister found out their dad, my dad in law has secondary cancer and metastatic cancer which is obious a traumatic.  Could this trigger earlier trauma?  But the sick feeling of waking up with an erection makes me feel so low i can't tell anyone.  I won't kill myself dw.  I am a people pleaser and would never put my friends and family through that.  I have cptsd as 8 years ago my best mate took his life and I found him.   So I could never put others through what I have\n So in not killing myself I am a failure to me twice.  As I am pleasing others instead of me.   I just wanna go back to the day before yesterday when I felt a normal person. Instead a funked up freak of nature.",

Seems like no matter what I do nothing gets through to him about finding help, speaking with someone far more qualified than I am or even admitting he needs to get things under control before he puts himself in even worse health.

Only thing is I love him so much that I can't do anything but go along with it because i'm petrified of waking up one day after being honest with him and finding out he did himself in. \n\nI have no one to talk to about this. My friends keep telling me to leave him and they see how tired I am from dating him and constantly trying to keep his spirits up. I know we're heading down that road if this keeps up, but I also know that if we do end things I'll always be dreading *that* phone call letting me know he took his own life.

    "selftext": "What she did hasn\u2019t had lasting financial or safety effects on me, but I just feel pissed that she had the thought to treat a human like that. I was meant to go to a concert with her and one of her friends. Everything was fine until a few hours before when she decided to started making long messages and voice notes about how everything was just going to crazy and chaos. I was informed last minute that her friend has problems being at concerts and around any people due to social anxiety. I said I understood as I had suffered with it (still do at times) and had only really gotten over it recently. And then it just gets worse and worse \u201ccan\u2019t pick you up anymore\u201d \u201cmy friend isn\u2019t calming down, she\u2019s been freaking out about this since we bought the tickets months ago.\u201d \u201cWe probably won\u2019t talk to you much you might just had to stand a hit away from us.\u201d \u201cYou can be there just do your own thing\u201d I told her to just tell me if I can\u2019t come and she told me it\u2019s probably best if I don\u2019t. 11 year friendship, just treated like an ant on the ground stepped in on and killed. I asked her why she didn\u2019t just tell me MONTHS ago if her friend was uncomfortable with me there. I could have made other plans or tried to message her friend, help her know that I won\u2019t judge her and she doesn\u2019t have to interact with me if she\u2019s uncomfortable. But I was left with 4 hours to get other plans. Thankfully sold my ticket last minute but lost lots of money from it. I got mad at her but I don\u2019t know if I feel sorry. A friend of mine that knows her too, but it\u2019s not like we\u2019d ever all hung out or even mention eachother to eachother, said maybe I should have been more considerate and just left it because her sister had passed away a few years ago and she still struggles. I told her I understand that, I don\u2019t expect her to not ever be affected my that again. But I also told her that I won\u2019t be excusing her if she treats me badly. When I\u2019ve grieved I\u2019ve never used it as an excuse to treat people badly. I\u2019ve heard other stories about her not treating people the best, and I feel like she now hides behind this and uses grief as her excuse. I never got an actual apology, just a \u201cidk what to say\u201d. I\u2019m not putting this up to grief, even if it was it doesn\u2019t excuse what she did. She had months of time to inform me that the situation may not have been appropriate, as her friend is uncomfortable around anyone  new and had been \u201canxious for months leading up to this\u201d (her words) I don\u2019t need the full diagnosis and pry into her friends life because I\u2019m not entitled to that. But if I had just been told months before that she was feeling anxious about going to a a concert with an unfamiliar person, I could have seen if the friend wanted to meet in a quiet place with the mutual friend or meet over text. Or I could have made other plans. It\u2019s fine now,  it\u2019s been a little bit of time since then. I don\u2019t talk to her much at all only if I have a question, but I don\u2019t forgive her for the reason that she treated a human like that.",

He always told me I was an exception because when his with me he tries to control his anger. He mentioned having anger issues.

There are other circumstances but hey atleast he didn't lay his hands on me right\u00bf.  He says communicate with him but when I do why do it turns to an argument. I've tried breaking up with him few times but he has his ways to make me feel guilty and I'll always come back. I think about the good times we had everyday at the same time I had to say to myself I don't feel secure anymore in that relationship and I have to think of the my future. It was my bday today and he sent me a greeting then the convo went to him wanting to go back to our relationship. I had to slap myself and block him for good. \n\nI just wanna rant.

I was assigned to a work station like any other night, nobody was giving me weird looks or anything, just a normal night. Recently, I was given a warning for too many absences, and I acknowledged that, but I was under the impression that my last two absences were excuse because I brought in a note from a doctor. About a week after my last absence from work, my alarm didn't wake me up in time for work, and I ended up being thirty minutes late. At the time, nobody said anything, so I took that to mean that there were no problems. That was a week ago.\n\nI know that I fucked up. They don't pay me to be absent, and there are plenty of people willing to take my job if I'm not performing well enough, and I can't perform well if I'm not there. I can't tell my family yet. It's me, my ex, and three step-sons. I am currently our only source of income because my ex is waiting to have her second pelvic fusion surgery. She will - in theory -  be able to work after her second surgery, but in the meantime I'm the only one. We do get some assistance, but we are hanging by a thread at any given moment.\n\nI'm scared, I'm angry at myself, and I feel numb at the same time. I'm typing this less than an hour after it happened, I don't think that it's sunk in yet. I will tell my family tomorrow, and I will also start applying for jobs tonight. I just feel like such a failure.

    "selftext": "I (36f) went on a weekend trip with this guy (43m). He lived abroad most of his life so he doesn't know our tourist destinations that well. We went to this tiny town that everyone who lives here has been to multiple times, and because it was a long weekend, everything was fully booked, so our hotel was far away from the town's center. \n\nI liked him for almost half a year, but I've known him for years, he is one of my favorite artists and he has a very niche IG account. We met in person last year and we were both awe struck about each other when we met, like I couldn't believe how handsome he was in person and he kept asking me to hug him, I could feel him smelling my hair. \n\nI went to visit him while I was abroad in his city back in January, and when I saw him he totally tricked me into getting to his apartment and well... We ended up doing it. But I didn't want to catch feelings for him, so I decided not to visit him again while I was in his city. \n\nHe then decided to come visit here for the long weekend. He's pretty handsome and definitely draws female attention to him, and he always tells me about all the girls that approach him in public. I guess he wants to make me jealous? Anyway, I punch back and I tell him about the guys I date. Dumb little game, I know. \n\n\nSo, this weekend we went on this trip together, since he doesn't know his way around I had to be on top of the booking. I booked two separate bedrooms. My plan was to have a nice weekend with him and NOT GET ATTACHED, because tbh he's way too handsome and I don't think I could manage all the jealousy that comes with having someone like him as a partner. \n\nThe getaway went ok, We couldn't get our hands of each other, but my poor planning skills ruined some parts of the trip and he was noticably irritated, but didn't blame it on me. I ended up knowing him better, we had long talks, he was very sweet to me. He showed me some of his work unedited. We talked about our childhoods and  all. \n\n\nAt some point he said something like \"I know that for you this is something superficial\" , and when I asked him what he meant he said that he knew I was there for the sex and that I only used guys for pleasure. I told him that I actually had admired him for years and that I wasn't at all interested in sleeping with him when we first met, I was just so glad to meet one of my favorite artists. And I did tell him I cared deeply about him, but I knew that I wasn't special for him at all either, and I had no reason to believe he wanted anything else than just having a good time with me, as he is surrounded by beautiful woman all the time, I was just the flavor of the week. He seemed a bit offended by that comment , he said he doesn't  see girls that way and that he only opens up to someone special. We agreed that we both like each other and we both caf\u00e9 for each other , so that the best thing would be to take advantage of the time together, and maybe do physical stuff while we still can when we have the chance, but remain good friends until we're old. \n\nI don't know, it was a weird conversation and i can't shake the feeling that he was just trying to make me say that I was in love with him or something because of his narcissistic nature. I have shielded my heart from guys like him years ago because I know falling for them doesn't ever end well. \n\nAnyway, at the end of the trip we couldn't get a bus back to our city and he got pretty mad. I felt awful and I wasn't looking forward to spend the next 3 hours next to him being mad. But he explained to me that it was just his survival skills, nothing personal. He went back to being all touchy feely and even told me he had referred to me as \"his wife\" to some lady who asked him who I was to him. I told him he was full of it, I knew he was just trying to manipulate me. He fell asleep on my lap for most of the trip , holding my hand while I caressed his hair. He drooled on my pants and he was so embarrassed haha so sweet.\n\nAnd then.... Once we arrived and left the bus, he just asked me if I could get a bus to my place from where we were. Plain and cold. I said yeah , so he just turned around and said see ya then! No kiss, no hug, nothing. I called him out on it, he turned around, gave me a small peck kiss and then went away. \n\nI was just in awe about how he could just shift from being so sweet to basically abandoning me there like as I was some stranger. \n\nI think thats what really bothers me. We shared some good moments, and I opened up about my feelings for him. I told him that maybe we couldn't be good as a couple because neither one of us is willing to settle down, but that I did want him in my life as a friend as I admired him too much. And he agreed! But the way he left me there just made me feel like he never really cared. \n\nAnd I am here now as a 36 yo woman crying like a teenager because I feel I lost someone I was really starting to care about. \n\nI know I can't get his heart , I'm not special, I'm not as pretty , and I am old, so I don't even entertain the idea of him ever falling for me, and I know, I knew since we started this whole thing to prevent myself from getting hurt.  but I did want to be able to maybe go out with him for coffee and talk about art for years. I wanted a friendship. \n\nI'm so confused. \n\nI guess I just wanted to write about it and get it off my chest so that it doesn't eat me anymore.  I don't want to, and I also can't tell my friends because he is kind of famous in our circles (and one of my best friends told me he was a major player so I should stay away from him), and I'm kind of embarrassed of how it played out. \n\nI miss him. I messaged him a few hours after I got home back from our trip, he just put a heart react on my message and that was it. I don't think I can push it anymore, I should wait for him to write me, and I'm dying thinking he might never write again. Ah well, I ended up being hurt despite all my efforts not to. \n\nThanks for reading. If you have any advice about how to handle this,  it would be highly appreciated. ",

    "selftext": "\n\nWhat is the actual contribution of entertainers and influencers to society?\n\nGrowing up, I always thought about what my contribution to society would be. I believed that a meaningful life should involve helping others in a tangible way\u2014whether it\u2019s building bridges, being a doctor who treats patients, a teacher who educates, or even a wedding planner who helps people organize one of the most important days of their lives. Even a makeup artist contributes by helping people feel comfortable in their own skin through skillful techniques.\n\nBut when I look at idols, entertainers, and influencers, I can\u2019t help but wonder: What is their actual purpose beyond surface-level happiness? Sure, they make people feel entertained, maybe even inspired, but does that really compare to professions that create real change?\n\nAnd yet, these are the people society worships the most. They get millions, live in luxury, and are treated like they\u2019ve accomplished something great\u2014while doctors, engineers, teachers, and everyday workers struggle for recognition or financial stability. It feels unfair that popularity is more valuable than actual contribution.\n\nI know entertainment is a part of life, and I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s useless. But on a deeper level, I wonder\u2026 what even is their life purpose? If your whole job is just singing, dancing, or making videos, what\u2019s the end goal? It\u2019s not like they\u2019re solving world problems, creating lasting change, or advancing society.\n\nDoes anyone else ever think about this? Or am I just overanalyzing it?\n\n\n",

She can\u2019t hold a job due to her mental issues she is bipolar and i suspect maybe she might have schizophrenia. I noticed within the past year that she was going down a mental decline. In september things blew up. I get a call one day from her and she started yelling and screaming that somebody put a bomb in the trucks gas tank. She told me to take everyone\u2019s names to which i did so she would calm down. i was not taking her seriously because this has happened before just not to this extent. She immediately starts screaming \u201cDo you want me to die???\u201d So i took names. Which was consisted of people that didnt like her.\n\nHer roommate who she does not get along with was pounding on the door and the cops were circling around her windows according to her. she ended up taking her barricade down that she had up and went to the hospital. She gets out the hospital and proceeds to go back to the hospital 3 days after getting released. Her roommate told us he got an eviction notice for her (it\u2019s his house). My mom (35F) tried to cool the situation down and we didn\u2019t hear about it again. Okay, then she gets out a second time. She goes back to her house, she calls me for a couple days and then its radio silent. Time passed and we went to see her and her roommate tells us she went to jail. Okay wtf happened. She dumped his urine containers for the hospital on him and broke a window. \n\nNovember passes by. I haven\u2019t gotten a call from jail. I go put money on her card. Still nothing. I contacted the police multiple times to get in contact with her. \u201cYou gotta call this department\u201d \u201cWe will tell an officer\u201d Well fuck you because its been weeks and i haven\u2019t heard jack shit. One day in mid december i get a call. The jail transferred her to the hospital so now she is going to the psych ward. She takes the phone and we started talking and she told me that people died and how they died in jail and how the jail straight jacked her. Sent her to a psych ward. She calls me everyday and cries and screams at me to get her out and that they discharged her. She spends her birthday in jail and I wasnt allowed to see her. She gets out on new years eve. My mom and I know she is getting evicted but we don\u2019t know if she knows yet. I barely know whats going on. We go back to her house.\n\nThey greet each other and i catch their conversation and he tells her to get her stuff out. We take her back to our house. I give her my room and i stay by my boyfriends house. She stayed in bed for 3 days. Just sleeping. She ends up getting in contact with another one of her old roommates and he said she can stay with him. My grandma had gotten an injury 2 years ago and won a case for it, and was waiting to get her money. I have no idea how legal stuff and money work. She stays by friend for a couple days and then her roommate called me and told me she went to jail. This was 2 in the morning. She got out December 31st and went back to jail January 5th. I look up her charges and she had 4 counts of breaking a restraining order and unauthorized entry of a dwelling. Bond at $19,000. February passes. We have not heard anything and we got mail from her lawyer. We learn she was carrying $1,000 when she went to jail. \n\nI just now get a call from another hospital. Nurse says she is discharged. Huh?? I call my mom and she doesnt want to go get her, same case with my uncle. And im trying to figure out what to do when the nurse calls again and proceeds to tell me there was a miscommunication between nurse and officer. Grandma was going back to jail. \u201cWhy did they bring her back\u201d I asked. Nurse said she had an ankle monitor on and the officers left her. But turns out they came back for her. Wtf!!? \u201cWell, may I ask why she\u2019s there?\u201d The nurse tells me everything came out negative and that she didn\u2019t have paralysis or anything. Yeah well turns out my grandma has been in a catatonic state and was using the bathroom on herself. Nurse said it\u2019s not physical it\u2019s psychiatric. They took her back to jail Nobody seems to care. My mom is fed up with her and my uncle doesn\u2019t do a damn for her. Im so upset. What do I do? They changed her medicine and she broke. She isn\u2019t moving. She is using it on herself. What do I do?? What can I do? Im sorry for making such a long post and that everything is everywhere. Im so stressed. Is there a way to get in contact with her? Her lawyers? What do I even do.\n",

    "selftext": "To be honest, I\u2019m just venting. I\u2019m so indifferent to the whole situation. Also, I just want to share that I only wish him well and not trying to paint him as the bad guy. Just wanted to make some sense of the night. \n\nThe chances of it happening is just so little since he doesn\u2019t even live close to that neighborhood and it\u2019s not close to mine either. Somehow I ended up seeing him with another girl. \n\nImmediately made me remember the last time we spent time together. To paint the picture, he kept rationalizing being not ready for monogamy with me. A lil context - he already talked about him only being/wanting to be in monogamy. He admitted to me that he was seeing other people while he was with me (context: we saw each other every other day-ish). Lastly, after trying to rationalize, he started talking about all things that his ex did to him that hurt him for an hour. \n\nDuring that bit I didn\u2019t say a word and I just had my eyes down low, listening. He didn\u2019t even caring if I\u2019m feeling anything in that moment. Not even checking in on me. Rambling about all details of why he called off the wedding for an hour. Which just reflects how unhealed he was. \n\nHe got up to use the washroom and mentioning returning and before he came back, my Uber was booked and already waiting for me.\n\nI chose myself.\n\nA bit more context - I\u2019m not trying to paint him as the bad guy, he was nice to me but people can be flawed and unhealed. He was the one to start talking about future/plans/trips and we even started doing exercise together. He proudly showed me to his family and also was the one mentioning proudly that he\u2019s dating me \n\nI admit though I\u2019m happy for him to be going to dates, I felt a bit sad. Part of the sadness is some dysphoria. Seeing him with a cis girl made me feel gender dysphoria, I felt like I\u2019m not as feminine as cis girls (which is partly true). Even thought that he must have left me because I\u2019m trans - could be the truth but with a very little possibility, he\u2019s bi. \n\nThe past bunch of months, I have been thinking about it enjoying the happy return to singlehood and having nothing to do with dating.\n\n I\u2019m choosing peace of singlehood and enjoying company of the ones I love, giving them more time \ud83e\udd0d ",

    "selftext": "This started years ago now and I\u2019ve pretty much let it go, but I never talked about it fully with people (out of trying to not pull people into it) when it was happening so here goes. Warning-It\u2019s long lol \n\nI met this friend through another friend, and we quickly became close. We ended up working together as well (for my parents, another area of my life I needed to have boundaries but I was 19 and thought it would be fine), would hang out after work\u2026 we called each other \u201ctwin\u201d because we had a lot in common. We got hired for a creative project together as we were both into photography. We worked on personal creative projects together\u2026 we were together CONSTANTLY. \n\nWe were teenagers, and as teenage girls often are, we were constantly talking about different guys we were interested in, and I found out she was interested in my brother. They went on a date and my brother very quickly realized they were not compatible. This is where I can pinpoint a change in our friendship. \n\nShe stopped asking me to hang out. I would ask her to hang out and she would be busy. She would constantly hang out with our mutual friends. At the time, I thought reaching out and asking if I had done anything wrong to warrant not being invited places I had previously been invited to was the right choice, and got told \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it, everything is good.\u201d I was getting married at the time and had already asked her to be my maid of honor, so I assumed that maybe it was a rough patch, I was stressed, etc. (tip: don\u2019t assume everything is fine, she\u2019s in all my wedding photos now lol)\n\nThe REAL switch to trying to ruin my life was after I got married. I have been photographing for years, and decided to try to pursue it as a business as my parent\u2019s business had closed. She HATED that because she did photography too, and suddenly any similarities we had were me \u201ccopying her\u201d. I posted a story on IG about prices, she posted \u201cthe original is always better than the copy.\u201d One of her friends (that I didn\u2019t know was her friend at the time) modeled for me, and she posted that \u201cpeople always try to undercut your business.\u201d At one point, I posted something (I don\u2019t even remember what it was at this point) and she posted within 5 minutes and said \u201cOkay, she\u2019s obviously copying me right?\u201d\n\nNow, full transparency- I did not handle this well. I tried to talk it out with her, tried everything I knew, and she would smile to my face and tell me everything was okay and then continue to do this. I found myself looking at her posts constantly because she would never say what I had done to hurt her to my face but would post consistently, so I felt like at least I could try to piece together what had gone wrong (and also, if she felt I had been copying her, I wanted to make sure I didn\u2019t post anything similar to her because I genuinely just wanted it to stop.) We talked a couple times, tried to make amends, but she still would post about me often. \n\nA couple years later, I did a photoshoot with another photographer modeling for me for a concept around a pregnancy loss. I have chronic health issues and so does this photographer, and I decided to center it around healing. It was a beautiful project. The DAY I posted about it, she posted a video on TikTok that said \u201cif you want to be me just say that.\u201d I didn\u2019t follow her, but with her being a contact in my phone sometimes her videos would still pop up. That was it. After all the posts and all the years of just dealing with it, I was done. She had tried to isolate me from members of my husband\u2019s family, she had deleted texts and then posted screenshots of our \u201cconversations\u201d and I had just turned the other cheek\u2026 but if she could somehow take a photoshoot about MY pregnancy loss and make it about her, I was done. I blocked her on everything. And then I started seeing friends of hers looking at my posts, so I blocked several of them as well. \n\nI\u2019m 28 now and have a wonderful life with my husband and our son. I do photography part time now so I can stay home and take care of him. I have talked to her once since, and I asked her why she did all of that. She told me that it was because she had a hard time with her dynamic with my brother and my family after working for my parents. I asked her specifically what I did, and all she said was that I was \u201cclingy and she wanted other friends\u201d. I personally have let a lot of it go, but there\u2019s always little reminders of it because our circles are so intertwined and tonight I feel like it\u2019s okay to talk about to strangers on the internet because I never said anything to anyone else when it was happening except for my husband and a few friends, never did anything about it and just prayed she would stop. \n\nSo there\u2019s that. Just a big ol\u2019 \u201cget it off my chest\u201d. The biggest thing I learned from it is friends that aren\u2019t willing to talk through it are not friends I want to have, and that sometimes you just need to block and walk. ",

Relationships. All that. It was bad for a while, but I worked thru it.\n\nSince then I've been mostly single. Sort of a loner. Dated,  nothing serious. Closed myself off, from friends too. Life moves forward. Career takes off. My job requires a lot of moving. \n\nEnter my lesbian friend, who is honestly funny and so good hearted that it's made the craziness of the world bearable. I'm a male. We became quick friends both being new and looking for things to do.\n\nShe's refilled my faith in humanity. She's got hobbies, independent ideas and cares about people she doesn't know. She has sympathy for people that hate her. She's willing to be the butt of the joke and then dish it out.\n\nI want to make clear that this isn't about a secret love or desire to date her to get over my ex fianc\u00e9. She's just a good person and friend. I just like her. She's helped me realize how much I've shut myself off from the world.\n\nAnd she's reminded me of why it's so important to have connections and friends.\n\nShe's a bit of an introvert, and I'm too so we've been helping each other with that.

    "selftext": "I'm not sure where to post this, but I really need advice, that's why I made an account just fot this, because I'm starting to question my sanity. \n\nI recently started living alone in my first apartment. I'm extremely careful, I always lock the doors and windows at night, and I don't have any pets. I used to have occasional bouts of sleep paralysis during a stressful phase, but they were relatively \"harmless\" dark figures just staring at me, hearing weird noises etc.. But since I've lived here, it's different. \n\nNow I wake up several times a week in the middle of the night, completely paralyzed. I can only move my eyes, hear and feel. And every time I see this big, dark shadowy figure in my room. But it doesn't just stand in the corner. It slowly comes towards me. It pulls my blanket away, then my pants - and then it starts touching me in a way that feels far too real. \n\nIt starts touching me with its mouth.  It licks me, sucks me, as if it is completely obsessed with my vagina. And the most disturbing thing is: I feel EVERYTHING. Every detail. Much more intensely than any real, human contact I have ever had. It brings me to orgasm over and over until the sensations are so overwhelming that I pass out. And when I wake up in the morning, my blanket is actually at the foot of the bed or on the floor, my pants exactly where \"it\" threw them. \n\nFor the ones who wants to imagine it, the figure is black, shadowy, with glowing white eyes but sometimes they look red, and it is very large. It has a somewhat human shape, but also somehow not. There is a dark aura around it, like black smoke. The hands are very large, and the fingers are extremely long. The only thing I remember is that in one of my earlier sleep paralyses, years ago, I saw these hands or very similar looking hands, trying to grab me. But I was able to free myself from the paralysis in time, bec my sister suddenly came in my room and turned the lights on. Its mouth is not visible, but when it begins with the act, I can make out the outline of the mouth, and it has a very long tongue. You can then imagine where the tongue goes. It doesnt say anything or even talk to me.\n\nI know it might feel like a particularly realistic sleep paralysis, but how can things be moving in my room? I'm scared. It happens almost every night, and although it doesn't hurt, the thought that \"it\" might do more at some point scares me. What if it's not just a hallucination? \n\nAnd before anyone asks: No, I'm not desperate or lonely. I'm single right now, but I'm happy with it.  I don't miss anyone, feel \"untouched\" or crave closeness. I've had relationships in the past, but right now I'm enjoying my own life, so I understand even less why this is happening. But my biggest concern is that, deep down, I'm starting to enjoy it. There are moments when I catch myself thinking: Don't stop. Keep going. And that terrifies me even more. \n\nI have a disturbing theory: What if it isn't just a sleep paralysis? I know its not a dream, bec I'm fully awake, I'm just unable to move or make a sound. What if it is some kind of entity or demon that possessed me? I know how crazy this sounds, but if you were in my shoes\u2026 would you really rule it out? \n\nI feel like I can't talk to anyone about this. It's so humiliating, and the worst part is\u2026 what if it keeps coming to me every night until the day I die, bec I don\u2019t do anything about it? I'm desperate and conflicted because, as terrifying as it is, it also feels good. And I'm starting to crave it.  I don\u2019t think a real man could ever satisfy me again like this. \n\nI've tried to relax before sleep and I don't have any stress in life at the moment, but it still visits me almost every night. And like i said, I'm extremely embarrassed to talk to other people in real life because I've started to enjoy it and I don't have any money for fancy therapies. What if this continues for years? I feel everything and when I wake up in the morning my intimate area feels a bit numb and tingly as if someone had been fiddling with it, so it's not fake, it's really happening to me. I almost always pass out from all the orgasms. Being satisfied so intensely every night can be dangerous, right? Idk.\n\nHave any of you ever experienced something like this? Am I just crazy or is something going on here that I can\u2019t explain?",

I was told by multiple people and girls would treat me like dirt and constantly remind me I\u2019m ugly throughout my life. Over the past 2 years, I made a decision after being insulted brutally on a \u201cfriend\u201d app called Wizz (more like a dating app). I was really skinny and hence I decided to eat more and bulk up to gain some muscle mass as well as starting skincare and hopping on minoxidil for better hair quality for my facial hair, scalp hair and eyebrows too along with multiple other changes. Anyway, these 2 years increased my looks considerably to the point where I almost looked like a different human being. During this however my self esteem was still incredibly low. For the past few months, I noticed a girl that was constantly staring at me and I first thought oh she must think I\u2019m ugly hence she\u2019s staring. Later on she started laughing with her friend group while looking at me so I thought wow she must think I\u2019m extremely ugly. This was not new to me. More recently, she added me over Snapchat which she got from a friend of mine as I\u2019ve found out recently and she had a little conversation with me (I\u2019ll call her J). J sent a snap of herself and told me she had seen me around and that she really liked me. This however triggered me and I remembered the treatment I had received up until now, especially the treatment on Wizz. In that moment, I snapped and insulted the mole on her cheek as well as her forehead and told her I\u2019d have to be blind or in a coma for her to ever have a chance with me. This was quite recent. More recently, I\u2019ve had a female cashier give me a discount on some shopping I was doing to make a milk cake because I\u2019m \u201chandsome\u201d. It honestly disgusted me and I genuinely just left the shop without any of the ingredients. It hasn\u2019t been long since I\u2019ve become apparently \u201cattractive\u201d and I\u2019m getting a whole lot more attention from girls and I hate it. Fuck these girls. They treated me like shit for all these years when I was ugly and now they think they have a chance when I\u2019m \u201cattractive\u201d. Makes me want to punch them all in the face. I notice a lot of little changes in my daily interactions even with my family. It\u2019s revolting. ",

The message and feelings are still mine as I re-read it to be 100% sure. Just thought you all should no.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI\u2019m writing this because it\u2019s been weighing on my mind for a long time. It keeps happening, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019m the common factor.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve wanted to make a difference in someone\u2019s life. In high school, I dreamed of becoming a teacher to help kids. At one point, I even considered becoming a doctor or a nurse to be there for people in their worst moments. But over the years, those dreams faded\u2014because every time I\u2019ve tried to help, things have ended the same way.\n\nIt seems like whenever someone needs emergency medical care and I step in to help, they don\u2019t make it.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# The Moments That Haunt Me\n\nOne of the first times this happened, I was around 18-20 years old. I was walking home from Walmart when I heard a crash. Looking over, I saw a motorcycle had been t-boned by a car, and the driver was on the ground. Without thinking, I ran toward him, weaving through traffic. I took his hand and spoke to him, trying to keep him calm while others applied pressure to his wounds. He handed me his phone and asked me to call a family member to let them know he was going to the hospital. I did exactly that, then gave the phone back to him. Soon after, paramedics arrived and took him away. Later, I read that he had died from his injuries. At the time, I didn\u2019t think much of it beyond the tragedy of the accident.\n\nA few years later, I was at home when my stepfather suddenly jumped up and said, \u201cCall an ambulance.\u201d We did, and while waiting, I ran upstairs to grab him a shirt as asked. I helped him put it on, talking to him, reassuring him that everything would be okay. The paramedics arrived and took him away. Shortly after, he went into heart failure and died.\n\nThen, a few years after that, I was living in an apartment building. One day, I glanced out the window out of boredom and saw my neighbors unloading groceries. Out of nowhere, the wife collapsed, and her husband barely caught her in time. I didn\u2019t hesitate\u2014I bolted out of my apartment without even locking the door, ran down the hallway, hit the elevator button, and after a few seconds of waiting, said, \u201cFuck it,\u201d and took the stairs. I got to them as fast as I could. Her husband was on the phone with paramedics while I held her, trying to comfort her as he gathered her meds and health cards. The building superintendent came out, just standing there, saying, \u201cShe\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d Just being completely useless . It took the paramedics over 30 minutes to arrive. The moment I stepped back to let them work, they had to use a defibrillator\u2014 there heart had stopped. She didn\u2019t make it.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# The Fear That Lingers\n\nThese are just a few of the moments that have left me feeling this way. I may add more as I remember them. But because of them, I feel like I can\u2019t help people\u2014because when I do, it only seems to end badly. I honestly have never had someone survive going to the hospital after I 'help'.\n\nIt\u2019s been about three years since I last experienced something like this, and I hope I never do again. But I\u2019m scared that if it happens again, I\u2019ll freeze up. That fear eats at me\u2014the fear that I won\u2019t be able to help, that I\u2019ll hesitate, that I\u2019ll fail someone when they need me most.\n\nI\u2019m shaking as I write this, scared of being judged, of being called a coward. But I needed to get this off my chest because it\u2019s been haunting me for far too long. I am shaking trying to hit the post button",

I'll probably delete this at some point after. \n\nI'm 27M and I'm a \"rent man\". Another term for what I do, is \"male escort\". But I live in a small, sleepy town, and we just don't call ourselves escorts.\n\nI decided to get into this because I needed some money to help me finish my degree. I'm also in good shape so I thought it would be an easy side hustle. I didn't/ don't have a partner and I haven't been interested in dating.\n\nBusiness is generally very slow. When I first started, I only had 1 client who I would visit every week. After that, she moved away and I had two more clients that I would see periodically. It was always a very clinical and mechanical experience (Get in, do what needs to be done, get out). \n\nThings were quiet for about a year and a half. I wasn't really providing services anymore. But a few months ago, I got a message on my profile from a lady who was interested in my services. She was just reaching out, asking how it works.\n\nWe spoke for a bit and we decided to meet up. My services are customisable and she selected a variation of the \"boyfriend experience\". \n\nI went to her house and I was... Surprised? She had a really nice place. In a rich neighbourhood. I'm sure this might not be out of the ordinary for other male escorts but my previous clients weren't situated in rich neighbourhoods. I didn't grow up rich. \n\nShe was very welcoming. She was a few years older than me. She seemed to have a successful career. We sat in the living room and just talked. She told me that she's had sex for her whole adult life, and she's enjoyed it for the most part. But she's had some kind of sexual awakening recently and she's looking for someone to explore this with. She said she doesn't even care if we didn't have sex that night. She wanted to talk to make sure that we would be a good fit for what she had in mind, and if I was okay with it. That was also a first for me. My previous clients didn't really care what I was okay with. \n\nAnyway. Lots has happened since then. I see her maybe once every two weeks. And it's always an incredible experience. I can't explain it. Sometimes we have sex. Sometimes we dont. Sometimes we eat pizza and watch movies, sometimes we drink and have sex. It's so passionate. Sometimes it's primal. Sometimes it's lazy and intense. It's not the mechanical sex that I'm used to. She truly turns me on. She likes it when I'm satisfied. \n\nSometimes we just talk and nothing else. I've opened up to her about my life. She pays me every time. I've even started insisting that she doesn't need to. But she believes in me and my future and wants to support me in finishing my degree. \n\nThe problem is, I no longer see this as a professional relationship. I really like her. And she seems to really care about me, as a person.  We know so much about each other but I feel so weird to say that we're friends... She pays me for my time so are we really friends? \n\nAnd sometimes I let my mind wander... What if we were more?\n\nShe's quite an incredible woman. And we've had many deep conversations. She's been through a lot. \n\nOne of the topics that came up was her previous relationships. Because I was wondering why she would approach a service, instead of exploring this with perhaps, a romantic partner? And I guess, long story short, she was in a relationship with a man who absolutely destroyed her. She no longer trusts people enough to share her life with. \n\nShe wants to be alone. Forever. But she desperately wants to explore her sexual side. I guess that's where I come in. \n\nBy the way. I know who this man is. It's a small town. F*ck you for what you did. You had such a great woman. What's wrong with you?\n\nI haven't heard from her in a while. And I desperately want to reach out to her. I'm trying not to lose myself in this situation. I keep telling myself, she's just my client and nothing more. This is just me doing my job. But I know that I feel a certain way. Unfortunately, I don't think she'll ever see me as anything more. ",

    "selftext": "Recently I fell out with a friend of mine who I've known for a little over a year. It's most likely my fault given that I: A) have talked to them about it already, B) Am somewhat aware that I probably sucked at some point in time (that I don't entirely remember) .\n\n\nIt started around 3-4 months ago when all my friends made plans to hangout together out of town, a few don't show up because of curfew, although they didnt make any real attempt to meet with any of us or let us know where they were until leaving to go home. \n\nThey argued they told us about curfew beforehand, we mentioned how we deliberately shifted the schedule up by a few hours to accommodate that, they then said we didn't even agree on a meeting place (we did), they apologize and swear it won't happen again. \n\n\nAfter this, I was upset for quite a while with one of them (whom I was closer to) and gave them the cold shoulder for a while. We don't talk for ages since I don't speak much with others in lessons and they kept wandering off with my other friend. Meanwhile another one of my friends who organised the hangout trip is slowly losing patience with friend A and B because they keep ditching her when leaving to buy lunch which also kinda ticks me off because Its getting hard not to see a pattern forming\n\n Distance grows, I dont do much about it since I attributed it to something else entirely and wanted to give them space (this is around 2 months back). We still don't talk properly. They ghost me starting from around a month ago and don't talk to me in person or respond to my texts. \n\nEventually I ask to meet up and talk about it and they agree. When asking them, they say the reason why is that I don't really talk to them, kept moving away whenever they sat near, compared their skills to another person's even though they're the same grade, made snide comments, people who're friends with me aren't nice to them etc.\n\nI don't remember a ton of this and while some of it is probably coincidence (moving away from them), there's a solid chance that some of it IS stuff I've done. I can be pretty horrible sometimes, especially when I'm not doing so well mentally and I'm so angry with myself that I crashed a friendship with someone I cared about over crap communication and my own assholery. I wish I could say that I atleast know where I went wrong, but I *can't* since I don't remember the whole bloody thing happening. Another of my friends has distanced themselves from my current group to join another group with this person and I can't tell whether they actually want to remain friends with me, or if it's just because they can't bring themselves to stop talking with me entirely. There's also the chance that their negative impression of me is creating a negative impression of everyone associated with me AND that I'm 90% sure their new friends keep talking shit about me since they all go quiet whenever I get too close (although there could be any random thing they're talking about). To top this all off, I'm not even sure if my own friends enjoy my presence and I feel myself drifting from them (although this part is probably in my head and a reflection of current circumstances)\n\nTLDR: I hate myself, my friend hates me, their new friends hate me, I can't tell if another friend hates me and my current friends might hate me. It's been a long week. I'm sick. And tired. ",

Most of it was due to having undiagnosed disorders and the rest was due to family issues. The symptoms flared towards the end of 2019 when I moved in with my sister while in university.\n\nI don't want to get into so many details but I have had thoughts of su**ide since high school and they came strong during that period. My parents were arguing a lot during lockdown which worsened my DP/DR because I had to shield my younger siblings from being caught up in the mess.\n\nI ended up thinking of death so frequently that I couldn't sleep at night. Some days I would stay up until midnight just to celebrate seeing the next day. I tried to get my parents to help but mom refused saying that I would get over it. I had yo write several suicide letters for them to agree.\n\nThe second therapist paid attention and had me sign No Suicide contracts and one psychiatrist attempted to talk to me telling me to think of how other people would feel after a final diagnosis of MDD. I tried to keep busy with extra courses after graduating and looking for jobs. I even tried spirituality and manifesting to get my mind to a better position.\n\nI have no interest in anything. I don't want to do anything. I have no job, no money, no friends, no one to talk to. I was a foodie and now I eat because it has been a routine. Music is just filling a void when it gave dopamine. Colours are turning to black and white. I have slowly turned into a shell of a human being. I don't know if I want help any more. I don't even know what I want.\n\nI can't make attempts anymore.

    "selftext": "Yup you read the title.\n\nSo my birthday was a little while ago, it was my 20th and honestly I was pretty damn depressed for it. Didn't have a lot of friends to celebrate with and was basically alone, and it felt(still feels) really weird not being a 'kid' anymore. \n\nI decided to treat myself to a beach day, both to go romp around and also cause I needed some driftwood for an aquarium I was setting up. I have no car though, so had to take the bus to get up which had a very inconvenient schedule. \n\nSo I got to the beach, found some sticks and got so distracted that I unfortunately missed the bus pick up. \n\nNow there was another bus coming in a couple hours, and I could always call a ride too if needed. So I decided that, now that I was here for at least a couple hours, I might as well do some more exploring. This particular beach stretched for 3 miles north up to another beach, where on the other side there was a small resturant. I was pretty hungry at this point, so thought it'd be fun to walk up there and catch  bus later that evening at that spot instead. \n\nSo I cruised up the beach, and got some really great views of the clouds and sinking sun along the way. I eventually got to the cutoff to where the other beach started; however, while the map only portrayed a small stream separating them, by now the ride had come in and that tiny stream was basically a river. \n\nAfter scouring the area for a bridge or easier way across, I stupidly chose to wade through a shallower point, which worked and I made it to the other side of the beach, soggy but triumphant. I had no change of clothes in my pack. \n\nSo after drying off a tiny bit I walked up to the resturant, and when I got inside I realized this wasn't just some little beach shack, it was a full on fancy ass resturant. My belly was roaring though, so I decided to give it a try. \n\n I asked for outdoor seating for obvious reasons, and was really surprised to see them setting the table with fancy cloths and a bunch of different forks and silverware and shit. I ordered crabcakes and some jumbo shrimp which were the cheapest things there, but combined still cost a whopping $70. They eventually bring out two tiny, barely palm sized, pencil-thin crab patties and 5 individual finger length shrimp, both elaborately decorated in the middle of these giant white plates. For the cost of it all I was half convinced I'd be able to keep the plates too. \n\nI kept getting odd looks from the other diners, who were almost all either in pairs or groups. I was the only lone person there. Not to mention still pretty soggy, dressed like a casual vagabond and with my backpack as my only companion in the opposite chair. Yeah, I stuck out like a giddamned giraffe in a horse ranch. \n\nEventually I finished up and caught the bus back home, where I promptly went to sleep. \n\nHappy 20th birthday bud, there's $70 bucks you ain't getting back and an experience you'll cherish for all the wrong reasons. \n\n",

Life has actually gotten way better recently. From not knowing what I want to do with my life to being so close to going to a world renowned university to train in to become a Nurse in two specialities. I\u2019m finally getting where I need to be. I\u2019m finally getting sleep, I leave the house a little bit more and I am well liked at work and seen as an asset. My anti depressants have solved a life long period of uncontrollable lows and self-neglect yet I am not fully there where I can begin improving myself.\n\nI\u2019m still obese, I\u2019m still balding and I\u2019m still ugly objectively. But I\u2019m proud of myself I am on cusp of greatness and yet at night I still question what I\u2019m even doing this for, yeah my ego is now bloated but my family are no longer In this swirl of poverty, I will not be able to lift them out of it. My brother and sister are in good places in life and my mother is no longer struggling. There are times I find myself truly at peace. \n\nBut there is this deep loneliness within me. It\u2019s a weakness, I can\u2019t help it and it\u2019s selfish but I want someone to love, and to love me. I can\u2019t help it I thought losing weight might help which it didn\u2019t, neither didn\u2019t overwhelming myself with hobbies and spending time with friends and family. I think truly after so many years I can\u2019t ignore my minds call to want someone to not just see me as a good friend. I want to be more than just needed. I\u2019m needed at work I\u2019m great at what I do but that is. I thing on the feeling of truly being wanted, laying upon eyes of someone who sees you for who you really are. I want someone to share little secrets with, to spend time with and devote myself to.\n\nI want to leave work one day knowing that I\u2019m not just coming to an empty house. It\u2019s so selfish to think I\u2019m entitled this but why not me? Is my personality screwed, it\u2019s my looks, my mannerisms? I get along fine with everyone I\u2019m really social at work and even outside of work barring my current situation but that for another reason.\n\nDo I just reek desperation? Am I unlovable? The answer is no I was loved once maybe even two more times but those relationships could not hold it bring questions to my head once more.\n\nI\u2019m going work my ass off it\u2019s just what I do. I\u2019ll spend my life helping others and caring for the vulnerable, being the person I wish I had in my life when I struggled. But at the end of the day I just don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing this for? The further my career goes forward I am scared that I\u2019ll become the guy who says I\u2019m married to work when I damn well know I want a family. \n\nEitherway I wish something changes soon.

    "selftext": "Good morning yall! A couple days ago I made a post at 3 in the morning to confess to doing my roommates dishes because I secretly love to watch her do a happy dance when she sees her favorite mug is clean for her to use again. That post changed our lives and I'm only being a little dramatic by saying that.\n\nI gotta say thanks to everyone who upvoted and commented on my original post, I'm still shook at just how many people read about me and my mug happy best friend. The amount of people saying my post made them smile or reminded them of their own friendships or significant others has kept me smiling for days. I'm kind of into making people happy, if that wasnt already obvious, so the fact that so many people had even a moment of positivity because of me has been awesome.\n\nWhen I made that original post it was because I just wanted to tell someone about the mug dancing but I knew Gwen wouldn't like it if I told anyone we knew so I came to reddit to shout to the void and oh boy, did the void shout back. There were so many comments asking if I really thought we were just friends, and I'll be honest when I made that post we absolutely were just friends. We had never talked about being more than friends and I was happy being friends because we have an amazing friendship. I hadn't really thought about there being a possibility for more because dating was always something I planned to do when I had my life together or when I had more money. I never let myself consider what I was missing out on by waiting for the \"right time.\" Her finding my post opened up the chance for Gwen and I to talk about things that we hadn't before and over breakfast that morning we found where we stood with each other and what we thought things could look like moving forward depending on what we both agreed was the best course. We didn't make any solid plans or decisions and didn't want to rush into something that would ruin the good we already had going for us, but I'll admit I was hoping for a specific outcome.\n\nThere was one comment on that first post that had really caught my attention. To paraphrase, they told me to think about how I would feel if someone else got to see Gwen do her happy mug dance instead of me and it hit me so hard. I didn't mind the idea of someone else seeing her so happy. I just dont know if anyone she dates would notice what I did and decide to do what I did. What if they didn't care or didn't think it was that important or any of the other things I do to make her laugh or smile. I really didn't like the thought of not being there to make sure she has that extra reason to smile in the morning. (Gwen wants me to admit that I'm a sappy moron because I teared up writing this. Im a sensitive man in touch with my emotions and you know you love it so shut it you \ud83d\ude1d.)\n\nTo all the people saying it's possible for platonic relationships to be like ours you are absolutely correct. Our friend group is very open with physical and verbal affection and we help each other all time with big and small things. We all say I love you to each other, it's just normal communication for us as a group, not just between Gwen and I. Honestly, if I hadn't made my original post I'm not sure when or if we would have gotten to the point we are now. Maybe we would have continued as we were and that would have been just as happy of an outcome, just a different one, like a choose your own adventure with multiple options for a good resolution.\n\nWhich brings me to the actual update. Gwen and I agreed we want to try dating. We aren't putting a new label on our relationship yet, but our first date is next week. I'm making it all a surprise. Gwen helped write this post and will be reading the comments so I can't give any details, but it's going to be the best first date she has ever been on, or I'll eat my candy corn patterned socks. I think she might be the one for me and I'm going to take every chance I can to make sure she thinks the same about me.\n\nYall are the best and we love you. Do something kind for your loved ones for us and everyone can and should find something to happy dance about, it makes life more fun.\n\nLove Gwen and Peter \ud83e\ude77\ud83d\udd78",

    "selftext": "I (25M) have been with my gf (26F) for 3 months now and I don't know if I'm overthinking this and self sabotaging my relationship or if there are larger issues.\n\nAs I mentioned in another post, we've disagreed about washing rice before and someone gave me some solid advice about how to talk to her about it. I felt we had a positive and productive conversation, but it all started because she got mad that I washed the rice for a certain dish.\n\nShe's also recently got upset with me over a project she asked me to tackle, just assembling a lamp we bought at the store. I made the mistake of trying to screw in a screw that had a defect and got stuck. She wasn't screaming or anything, but she was upset that I tried to use it anyway. I got it out and replaced it and the lamp turned out well.\n\nShe has childhood trauma to do with strict parents who would severely punish her if she didn't do things the exact way they wanted and so I think she gets stressed when something isn't going to plan.\n\nI feel like an idiot when these sort of things happen. They're such simple mistakes, easily avoided and yet I make them.\n\nShe's also been stressed with her kitten that still needs to get spayed, she's been in heat alot and she yells at the cat when she won't be quiet. I think this isn't right and have tried gently mentioning that her cat is just doing what cats do and she needs to try and ignore her.\n\nI made a larger mistake the other day when I asked to try her THC vape. She said that beginners should always be in a safe place and try to relax. I asked in jest \"do I feel safe here?\" And she asked the same. I thought about it a bit and promptly got distracted by other thoughts. I have ADHD and sometimes this sort of thing happens. I'm still ashamed of it because when I realized I trailed off and said \"I do feel safe here\" She made a a comment stating \"That took a long time for you to figure out\" I didn't respond, I knew I got distracted and I started silently panicking thinking, \"I do feel safe here but nothing I say now will convince her. I wouldn't have tried the THC if I didn't, I wouldn't leave my knife at home if I didn't, I wouldn't be with her if I didn't\" but I gave some lame excuse about thinking too deeply about it and tried to laugh it off.\n\nI feel like an idiot. She makes me happy. She's important to me. I'm worried that her trauma will drive us apart. I don't know what to do to work through this.",

    "selftext": "I graduated last year and am now atending a university. The diffrence is astonishing. I realized that the behavior I had to endure was way more off the charts than I thought.   \nI am transgender (ftm) and autistic. In my old class was another autistic kid whose autism presented diffrently from mine. Funny enough I was always excluded and people didnt like me for being weird and missing out on social clues. But when I got diagnosed and received accommodations that was me getting favors and faking autism for attention. I know of some rumors that were spread about me but I have no clue how or who started those. Apperently I was a lesbian (never was) and some were convinced that I would get mad and loud when I get missgenderd. I dont know why anyone believed that since I did get missgendered quite often and literally only corrected the people with a hey sorry it is actually him or sth.   \nOne kid in particular seemed to have it out for and said some homphobic stuff though he only did it when I wasnt present (others snithed) or he thought I wouldnt hear him. He actually once ran up to me while carrying a knife. A joke. surrrreeee My class loved jokes. They would act as if they were jerking off in the back of the room or say something rather loudly etc when I held presentations. I always went to the teachers and asked for help. No one ever helped me. Some wanted to but had to catch them in the act which wasnt that easy and the other teachers didnt seem to care enough. Though every adult always reassured me that I would be fine and nothing would happen to me.   \nI wasnt the easiest kid to be around since I literally learned how to be nice in 10th grade and sucked a great deal before and during that learning. But I was always willing to reflect and talk about my misstakes. \n\nI am now in a much better place. Everyone respects me and I feel comfortable learning again. Though I am starting to feel angry that this extreme behaviuor was ever permitted and given space at that school. I love some of my teachers they were the kindest people I ever met and helped me greatly. Others not so much. Bullying really sucks and I needed to get this off my chest",

    "selftext": "I (25M) got this gorgeous girl\u2019s number at a bar last Saturday; she and I had this amazing and absolutely fluid conversation before I invited her and her friend to join my table, where my friends sat. It was extremely enjoyable, and she and I were flirting back-and-forth (mind you I\u2019ve hardly flirted with anyone since my ex cheated on me sometime ago). \n\nBefore she and her friend left for another bar, I asked for her number, but I quickly told her: \u201cIf you\u2019re not comfortable with it, you really don\u2019t have to. I just think you\u2019re cute and witty and I\u2019d love to talk to you more.\u201d She replies with, and this made my smile like an idiot, \u201cI\u2019m not uncomfortable at all. I was waiting for you to ask.\u201d\n\nGot her number, wish her a great rest of her night, and we separate to our respective friend groups. Then, I text her the following afternoon, and since then we\u2019ve had these fantastic, flirty, and personal conversations. \n\nHere\u2019s the issue: She doesn\u2019t text back too often. Let me preface this by saying, I know people get busy or preoccupied or even forget to text others back, but I\u2019m talking hours on hours without a response from her. When she does, she immediately reciprocates my energy and the conversation returns to being wonderful.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an attempt of mine to gripe, all things considered. I just find myself feeling like a high school with a crush again, she genuinely makes me grin like a fool and fills my stomach with butterflies. More than anything, I want to talk to her. \n\nOf course I busy myself while she isn\u2019t responding and try not to think too hard on it while I\u2019m occupying myself, but I really pray she texts back soon. I\u2019m tempted to ask her to FaceTime, if she\u2019s cool with it, because of how greatly I want to keep talking to her.",

    "selftext": "I still wish he would come back, don't get me wrong... That hasn't disappeared just yet and I suspect it won't for a little bit.\n\n\nI started doing dance classes again and my first couple of classes were hard. I hadn't danced in awhile, and the emotions were still heavy. In fact, I went home and bawled in my roommates arms because I was just hit with memories of my favorite routine of chatting with you after class, and looking forward to being with you online when I got home. But the drive was hard, and not quiet since I had a comfort song blasting and me just yelling into the car how much I loved you and what an idiot you are to walk away.\n\n\nI had another class just yesterday and I felt incredibly good doing it since it was a familiar choreo. I smiled. I was proud of myself. I laughed with my friends. And when I got out, I felt angry...\n\n\nI was angry because I disliked how you made me feel hurt, unseen, invalidated,  and frightened during our breakup. Angry that you decided to give up. I'm not going to try to convince you to stay, so okay, I'll go. Especially since you'd do that explosive reaction again with the justification being you had no choice to in order to be heard. Ya know, my counselor said that's what people who do the abuse in abusive relationships say. \n\"If only she didn't do [trigger], then I wouldn't of [hit/screamed/throw/etc.] her.\" I know you're not abusive though. I know you're flawed and that response is something you can work on if you recognize it to be. I wanted to do that with you. I wanted to work me. On us. But no, you gave up and walked away.\n\n\nAnd although I know we had good times, I now notice a lot more things in our relationship that weren't that great. Things I wish a partner would do for me. The slow roll into complacency. How I feel fooled being charmed by you. That I tell you how I feel when I'm in some mood is not your responsibility to fix, and to please let me figure out how to make myself feel better and I'll tell you. But no, you make yourself take responsibility anyways and feel bad about yourself and frustrated at me when you can't \"solve it\" right away. What the hell?! Don't you listen?! And I tell you my love language is words of affirmation and I barely hear any compliments from you. I don't remember the last time you called me beautiful or cute. I don't ever remember you telling me you appreciate me unless I ASK or do it first by giving you all my words of praise. If you're proud of me or happy I'm yours. I said those things to you all the time! The random \"I Love You\"'s because I feel it in that moment. Things I brought up I'd like to do but it gets overlooked and forgotten, and then you get mad at me when I try to remind you, and more angry when I'm sad you don't remember. And how I see you were also not telling me things that made you irritated and let build up, but fault me for being the only one who does it.\n\n\nI also told you I'm scared you'd talk to me like you talk to your parents. You gave me that \"wtf\" face like you'd never. And yet there you were screaming at me, assaulting me with words trying to blame me and all your \"what about you?!\" arguments. Also how we agreed to disagree early on in a convo before our fight that giving someone the same energy they give you is a choice and can be potentially hazardous in a relationship. Especially during an argument. Communication is important, but what's the point when you assume your partner is intentionally attacking you when it's anything but?! I should've known better. I should've known when I saw those signs. \n\n\nYou're so frustrating. How did I deal with all that?!\nAnd you know what's more frustrating?! IT'S ALL SOLVABLE. They were things we could work on. Things we could put out onto the table, talk about our grievances, and set out a plan to address them. I think at one time I said maybe we should see a Couple's counselor to better understand  each other, but that was swept aside. \n\n\n\nI know I can be frustrating too. I know it do things that make you mad. But no one deserves to be treated the way you treat me during arguments. You once brought out something in me that made me hate myself in an argument. All because it was so heightened and just not healthy because I was trying to match your energy. I hated it. I dont like being so angry I'd say things I regret and would hate myself for later, along with the fact I'm sure it hurts you! Why would you want that dynamic?! Why are you okay with that?! It's unhealthy! How did it feel when I said I felt hurt, attacked, and frustrated like you but didn't want to scream or escalate things so I cried instead?! You probably thought I was pathetic...\n\n\nAnd so fine... Go find someone else who can match your energy without feeling shitty about themselves and about hurting you. Find someone who argues the same way you do and see how disrespectful, exhausting, and hurtful it is. Because that's not what I want. ",

    "selftext": "I\u2019m not sure if this is the right sub, but i need an outlet to post this anonymously \n\n\n\nwhen i was 14, my brother passed away suddenly. he was born with HLHS -Hypoplastic left heart syndrome which is a rare congenital heart defect in which the left side of the heart is severely underdeveloped. He had many surgeries as a child, which i won\u2019t get in to, but the important thing to note is that from the ages of 7-18 he was physically fine. sure, he sweat a lot, and slept more the most teens,  but nothing extreme. \n\nin February 2020 he got sick, his livers started failing, he would faint randomly, and when they got it checked out it turn out he was in heart failure. \nhowever, he started taking new meds and was seemingly improving.\n\none night at the beginning of March, he and my sister had a baking contest, and both made desserts. we tasted them and ranked them, his chocolate mousse won by a landslide. \ni had the grand idea of putting whipped cream on the back of my hand and hitting it into the air and the trying to catch it in my mouth. me and my siblings all tried it and my brother laughed so hard his face turned blue. it was a night filled of laughter and jokes. that\u2019s the last time i saw him\u2026alive. \n\nthe next morning both of my parents went out to work, which was unusual because my mother works from home and was my brothers primary caregiver, i stayed home from school for a reason i can\u2019t remember now. \n\nat around 10am my father called me to check on my brother who wasn\u2019t answering his phone, and to make sure he takes his meds. while still on the phone with my dad, i go to my brothers room, when i walk the smell hits me like a ton of bricks, but my father was rushing me, so I tiptoe over to his bed and i see him with his eyes rolled back and mouth slightly agape, i tried to shake him but his skin was cold and that\u2019s what i noticed his arms were a deep shade bluish purple- i told my dad to call the EMTs because my brother was not waking up. i remember drinking water, unlocking the door, and waiting in the living room. \nemts burst through the door, professional looking people running in and out of our small apartment. and then the rush slowed down i wasn\u2019t informed on much and i was nervous to interfere. now there are more professional people running in and out with my small apartment , although now some were patiently waiting for my father to arrive , and since my mum wasn\u2019t answering her phone, oblivious to her only sons passing, all i could do is wait.\ni remember feeling awkward and unsure of what to do with all these personnel in my home, so i just kept offering everyone water and snacks- but they would just look at me with sad eyes and politely decline. \n\nI was only 14 so there were some issues of them telling me things but after about an hour, while My Father was on his way, a kind  man with a thick southern drawl sat me down. he informed me that my brother had passed away by the looks of it he had already been gone for quite some time.\n\nI responded with an understanding nod. \ni didn\u2019t cry.\nI remember when My Father came home, hearing the news and holding back tears, I let the professionals do the talking while I sat in my room, my Father joined me, and I held his hands while the police questioned us. \n \nI\u2019ll never forget the whale of agony my sister let out when she got home and heard the news. \n\nthe rest of the day is a blur. his funeral was the next day and rained and hailed so hard, my shoes were soaked through to my socks.\n\nI had a complicated relationship with my brother, but at the very least, I\u2019m glad that he died at home in the comfort of his own bed and not in a hospital bed hooked up to machines and wires - he hated the hospital.\n\nit\u2019s so incredibly hard and painful especially \nsince five years ago was a different world. He passed away right before Covid lockdown started happening. it feels like i knew him a lifetime ago.\n sometimes I forget his face and struggle remember what he looks like and it scares me because it\u2019s only been five years and ,statistically speaking, I have around 70 more years to go . \nevery family event is painful, all days of celebration and holidays are surrounded with this dark cloud -that feeling that there\u2019s someone that isn\u2019t here ,that should be here. \n\n\nI hope this post is coherent -i\u2019m after a long day at work.\nfeel free to ask anything in the comment if anything needs clarification.",

    "selftext": "Throwaway account because my brother follows my main account and I don't want him finding this. Sorta long post, so beware. And English isn't my first language - I hope it's not too bad.\n\nSo recently, my parents passed away, both my mom and dad. it's still kinda hard to believe that they are really gone. I'm 17 years old, so it's been a bit rough for me.\n\nMy parent's relationship had never been good. My dad was a serial cheater, I don't know the full details but I know he had a bunch of mistresses and constantly slept with other younger women, he might even have other children... My mom always knew this apparently, but never left because she was only a high-school graduate with no prospects for a job to provide for us. \n\nI had told her to leave, but I knew it was fruitless.\n\nRecently, they'd been fighting so much, to the point where it was unbearable. In the entirety last year and even this year there was constant arguments in my home. They would have screaming matches and fights, I would always hear banging and yelling, I could barely sleep at night because of their fights. They've broken so much stuff in the house, doors, the TV, I've stepped on glass shattered glass before after a bad fight.\n\nThere was not much I could do but to just endure it and try to focus on my studies, i couldn't intervene, and i was forbidden from telling anyone. We also had a bunch of financial problems. I'm at a point in my life where I need to focus heavily on my education and make sure to get good grades, but the stress of it all was making it impossible. My mom would constantly pressure me to get good grades and I really tried to get good grades but I just can't, i really tried my best.\n\nI was mentally and physically exhausted. I was under alot of stress because of all of this, I literally just wanted to die so i didn't have to deal with it anymore. it felt like my own home wasn't home anymore and that I couldn't find peace anywhere. They would try to rope me into their fights and it just stressed me out more, I really couldn't do a thing about it. My physical health was depleting rapidly, I was gaining weight, I was always sick, always tired, I wasn't getting enough sleep.\n\nAlso my brother lives abroad, he has a job and a house and everything, and my mum for some reason doesn't wanna tell him ALL the details (he knew some stuff, but not to the extent that I did) so I was all alone in this. \n\nAnyway, almost 2 months ago I remember my parents had a huge fight, they broke the TV again, and it literally lasted all night, I couldn't sleep AT ALL. After that my dad went to work in the morning and didn't come home till like 12am. that same night my mom had come to my room and talked to me and told me that she knows how much I suffer, and she told me to study hard so that I can get out of here, and she gave me a hug, she hasn't hugged me or touched me since idk so I was just sorta stiff and didn't say anything.\n\nIn the morning I had school, so I went, I was really tired and slept through my entire econ class... at some point, during another class, the supervisor called me to her office, and when I went there, my homeroom teacher, the principal, and my aunt (my dad's sister) were there.. I knew what happened immediately.\n\nMy parents had gotten into a car accident and died in the hospital during surgery. The police think it was a suicide, but I don't really wanna know.\n\nSince I'm a minor, and still in school (I still have a year left, I'll be in 12th grade soon), my dad's sister took me in but his other siblings also visit me often, I don't have any contact with my mum's side. Living with my aunt and uncle has been okay, though I don't feel much at home. After I'm done with school and my A-levels (no i am not from the UK), I'll be moving to the US, where my brother lives. I already have a visa and scholarship.\n \nI recently went to a psychiatrist where I was told that I have severe depression and anxiety and BPD.\n\nI didn't see their dead bodies because I didn't have the courage, and I couldn't cry at the funeral, because I felt so... numb? after all that happened, I didn't know how to feel at all. I cried after I came home, all of it felt like overwhelming. I feel like a horrible person for not grieving enough, but idk what else to feel, I don't want to tell my brother yet.\n\nI've just been trying to study for my final exams soon, it's this year and I need to finish revising. I try to play games too, but I don't really have much energy. My friends from school have been very supportive and kind.\n\nAnyway, that's all I guess, I know it's really long, but I just wanted to ramble, because other than my really close online friend, I haven't told anyone.

I know it's not my fault but I blame myself. I'm scared she might become or is suicidal like my sister was. My sister was in the hospital for mental health a few times and this first started when I was younger. She threatened to cut her hand off the night I was supposed to sleep in hee room. (BTW she is 5 years older than me). I blame myself for that too. I am not suicidal or do self harm or depressed. I don't have a therapist but I used to due to bullying which I no longer deal with. I Don t have many friends that's something I've always had in life. I have I tight group of friends but I feel like I'm a bad friend. I feel like my classmates don't like me because I smell bad due to me not showing enough even tho I try too or am weird and I consider English as my first language but I've lived in a French speaking countrie my entire life and I feel like my speaking in French isn't good but they don't know that so they just think I'm a weirdo who can't speak or even read properly ( I'm dyslexic). My parents aren't abusive in any way shape or form. I just want someone to love me. I feel like I live day to day trying to repese these feelings and live life and tell myself everything is going to be fine but I m scared for the future. I know that my adulthood is in years but I'm still scared. I feel like I'm not good at anything everyday i just go home and watch videos on my phone. I'm very self conscious of my athleticism, I'm not at all flexible or strong or fast and my stamina is horrible. I feel like people would think I'm over-exaggerating if I tell them this. \n\nI feel like monster and I just want someone anyone to tell me that s not true. I know that the person reading this will probably see this feel bad for a bit or just don't care at all and forget about it. I know this is probably just a scream in to the void but I just want to be heard and loved. My family loves me but I feel like it's not enough.\n\nPlease just tell me I'm not a bad person. And if I am, just tell me.\n\n This is just something I needed to get off my chest.

    "selftext": "tldr: My mom's friend helped me through a tough time and get into college. We got really close and we've been hooking up since. No one knows.\n\nShe worked with my mom. They grew close over the years and became even closer the summer before I left for college because my parents were going through a nasty divorce. She threw me a birthday party when my parents were too busy fighting in court to remember. She made a big effort to be there for my mom and by proxy she was also there for me. We grew close because she would bring over dinner (and eat with me), drive me places, pick me up and bring me home, and even helped me with school. My mom picked up another job to help pay for the divorce lawyer so she was gone a lot. She helped me prepare for my college interviews, wrote me references, and connected me with people she knew. Most nights she'd feed me dinner, clean up, and make sure I was home instead of out partying, then lock up our house and sometimes sleep there on the couch or my moms bed until my mom got home.\n\nI always was attracted to her since she was younger than my mom, but still had that fit work out milf type of look. I would check her out often and even use her as the focal point of my masturbation. It got to the point where I snuck into her laundry basket a few times to check out her used lingerie.\n\nWe grew closer and talked about sex. It started from her giving me advice on navigating the dating world and a \"girls\" perspective. I felt comfortable with her helping me figure out these social situations since she is young and attractive, I just figured she understood. I complained about girls, friends, anxiety. She was a great listener and I would love receiving comforting hugs from. her. I would always get aroused from talking with her about things. One night when we hugged she felt my hard arousal accidentally press up against her, but nothing happened.\n\nMy fantasy was just that, a fantasy until I went to college. My parents were still dragging the divorce out so she graciously helped me shop, pack, and even dropped me off. It was only 45 mins away from home, I wanted to go further away, but I'm just lucky to even get into college with all the stress. Her texts were often and short, so it wasn't unusual for us to be casual with each other. One night I got really drunk and texted her pretty late thinking she wouldn't get it until later in the morning. I mentioned how I thought about her during random hook ups or masturbation. Well to my surprise she replied and we engaged in a little back and forth. This happened a few times over the course of my first semester and I did try to push the flirting boundaries when we talked about intimate things. It usually started with reminders for me to practice safe sex and then lead to talking about sex in general. I could tell she was really careful about being intimate with me. A few times it slipped into flirty territory.\n\nThere was a blizzard as everyone was leaving for winter break. I could have taken the train, but I texted her that I didn't have a ride home because I wanted to spend time with her.\u00a0It was late and the storm was pretty bad by the time she dropped me off. She insisted that she'd come in and make me dinner. At some point a bottle of wine was consumed. She mentioned that my mom was working until 10pm that night so she stayed up with me to watch a movie. We ended up talking about all the things that happened that semester and I admitted to her her my lack of confidence with girls. I joked that if only I could get some practice in real life instead of watching porn I could find the clit.\n\nWell one thing led to another and we spent a lot of break together. Since coming back to school, she's been driving here and getting a hotel for us once a week. I'm afraid that I won't like girls my age anymore after this and that she's making it so fun and easy that I'm not making an effort to meet girls my age. Not really sure what to do, but needed to get this off my chest. It's just nice having someone to have sex with so easily instead of putting in effort to flirt, play games, go out drinking and risking being with a random girl.",

    "selftext": "I\u2019ve worked with this woman for about 4 years. We\u2019ve traveled together on business several times. I\u2019ve always been a pretty shy guy, but am especially cautious when socializing with women I work with. I try to be myself but not act in a manner such that they could feel uncomfortable (basically I\u2019m afraid of flirting because I want to be a good human being and also keep my job). \n\nWhen I\u2019m with this woman it\u2019s pretty chill. We chat about our travels and places we want to go. She occasionally tells me very personal things, one time she randomly told me she had an IUD after we were just sitting in silence for a few seconds. \n\nAnyway I think she\u2019s great. She\u2019s very smart and successful. We both make 140k+ at basically the same job. She owns her own house but I\u2019m not quite there yet. She\u2019s funny, cute, and very fashionable. The little things like the way she paints her nails (neat like a professional does them for her on the daily) and wears her hair are so unique and attractive. \n\nSometimes things feel fantasy like when we\u2019re traveling together. We might both reach for the temperature controls in the car at the same time because the AC is too cold and touch hands. We say the same things at the same time and have the same thoughts when a random event happens in front of us. \n\nSometimes she would say interesting things like \u201cif it was appropriate I\u2019d invite you to stay at my house\u201d because the office is far for me and close to her. Or if I talked about moving she\u2019d get excited and joke that I could be her neighbor. I always wondered if she was attracted to me, but she shows mixed signals. She\u2019s a very smart woman so it\u2019s possible she thinks the same way I do and doesn\u2019t want to jeopardize her career. She\u2019s had boyfriends on and off and I\u2019m not even sure what her current status is. \n\nI feel like in an alternate reality we would be the perfect couple. But in this reality we\u2019ll just be coworkers who live a couple hours apart. It\u2019s frustrating. I\u2019ve never been sexually active before because I\u2019m waiting for someone who electrifies me as much as she does to truly desire me, and to be in the right situation for it. That\u2019s hard to find. \n\nTLDR; just a dumb man crushing on a coworker \n\nUpdate: I don\u2019t think I can ask her out. Messaged her at work today to ask how things have been and the conversation felt one sided. I can\u2019t deal with the humiliation, embarrassment, and fear of her getting freaked out by me doing so ",

After a while, they all asked for nudes, and some even threatened to leave me if I didn\u2019t send them. I knew it wasn\u2019t right, but I kept sending them anyway, without really thinking about the consequences. I kept convincing myself that maybe it would be different this time, that maybe they would care about me, but deep down I knew I was making a mistake. Once I sent them, I immediately felt disgusted with myself. The shame hit me hard, and I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what I\u2019d done. I felt like I had given away something of myself, something I couldn\u2019t get back, and it made me feel empty and worthless. I just wanted to feel wanted and loved, but now it feels like I\u2019ve only been used. Long story short, they all left me\u2014some blocked me, others ghosted me without a word. I know I should have stopped after the first guy, but I was so desperate for affection that I ignored my own worth and let myself get caught up in it. I feel so small and discarded now. Looking back, I\u2019m filled with regret, and I can't shake the feeling that I was taken advantage of. The shame eats me alive, and I\u2019m constantly terrified that my pictures are out there somewhere, being shared without my consent. It haunts me.

I won't go over the details of why we split or our reconciliation since I'm sure the average redditor can click buttons and most likely read. He was the one taking me out, and promised that it would, in his words, \"knock my socks off\" to make up for his neglect of me. He sure as hell delivered.\n\nA little backstory, we've been together since we were 15 and 16 respectively, and have never moved out of our hometown. This year would have been our 20th anniversary (of getting together, not marriage). We were dating secretly for about five years before our parents caught us one day during summer break. The fallout from finding out their son was gay actually made his parents split. His dad wanted to send him away to conversion therapy. He's seen his father maybe once per year on average, and every time he's incredibly cold towards me. Would never refer to me as his son-in-law, only my husband's \"pal.\" I wonder why. Anyway, not what you're here to read. I'll get on with the lore.\n\nHe picked me up from the house and wouldn't tell me where we were going, but told me to dress warmly. He ended up taking me to the place where we met: a run down ice skating rink in our town. He used to do hockey, and I spent some time trying to learn figure skating until people started beating me up for it. Both sports would practice at the same time and I remember barely being able to keep my eyes off him. We went skating, I tried to pull off a few of the moves I remembered (he only had to catch me from falling on my ass once or twice, and I won't complain about an attractive man that I love hooking his arm around my waist), and we spent an hour or so there until our feet hurt. At one point I said that my face was getting cold, so he skated around in front of me and placed his gloved hands on my cheeks to warm me up. I just about burned a hole in the ice from how hard I was blushing, I swear to God.\n\nHe wasn't done then. We left and went to dinner, specifically the restaurant where we had our first date. It's a cheap hole-in-the-wall place, seeing as we were poor teenagers when we first met. We chatted and ate food that probably took 5 years off our lives, he was an incorrigible flirt, and even held my hand underneath the table like he did all those years ago. I know I said I never stopped loving him, and I stand by that, but I think I somehow fell in love with him a thousand times over again during that meal.\n\nAt the end of dinner, he asked if I had energy for one more simple thing, to which I agreed. He took me a while out of town to a dark sky zone park, specifically the one where he proposed to me ten years ago. He set out a blanket to sit on and another to cuddle under, and we went stargazing all bundled up together. You never know how much you miss the sound of someone's heartbeat until you haven't heard it for so long. We shared a bottle of sparkling grape juice in plastic champagne flutes and dumb, giggly kisses. It felt so similar yet so different. He told me in a moment of quiet that he loved me, and oh, God. It took everything I had not to cry. I barely hesitated before asking if he wanted to change venues. He seemed surprised, but eagerly accepted.\n\nI ended up at his place, as some of you may have seen from my edit on my second post yesterday. I wanted to take it slower than this, but it was so hard to. I was so starved of affection and hadn't been intimate with anyone for just about six years. I'm gonna keep what happened at his between us, but all I'll say is that his medication was no issue and all of you should be jealous. I woke up in his bed this morning, reached over for him, and pulled him close just like I used to do. I haven't been this happy in a long time. We had a sleepy discussion and decided to get back together, but we're not using the term boyfriends. It just feels weird after all this time. So he's my partner, or my lover. He's mine.\n\nThank you, reddit. Wouldn't have done it without a little push from the internet. Let's see where all this goes.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone I (20m) miss my (19f) exgf so much. When we first met eachother 2 years ago everything was perfect. We were in love and having good times no matter what. We were long distance (about an hour and 30 minutes from each other) and we hated it, but it never mattered. The more days that went by the more in love we were. \n\nAt the time I was struggling with really bad paranoia and I quit my job and ran away to go live with her. I left my family and most importantly my grandmother behind. I wanted to show her everything I wanted was with her and her only, but I think that was one of the worst decisions we made during our relationship. We were only together for 2-3 months at the time and I stayed with her brother while she lived with her mom and step dad. \n\nWe started spending every second together and it was just getting even better, but we started getting aggravated with eachother more. I eventually got a job 1-2 months after moving in with her brother. Then things started to pick up again, probably because of the motivation of going to work and getting money to spend on her. She never cared about the money. I did, it\u2019s the only way I knew how to prove my love. \n\nHer mom and step dad were both alcoholics and abused eachother quite often and they really weren\u2019t a fan of me for some reason. They got in a fight one night and started treating my ex wrong so I stepped in and pulled her out of that situation before she got hurt and I took her to taco bell at 3am. \n\nAfter that we started fighting a whole lot more because money was getting tight and it was the only thing that made me feel stable. I wasn\u2019t comfortable living with her brother at all and was starting to wish I never moved in. We started getting more and more distant until the day she got me a cat. A beautiful baby and I named her Honey. She was the sweetest thing ever and it brought me and my ex closer than ever. \n\nThen I got kicked out of her brothers for unknown reasons. I just had to be out by the weekend, so I called up my family for some help and me and my ex moved into a camper with some of my distant relatives. We were still arguing and growing more distant but we worked out some of the problems but it just wasn\u2019t enough. We ended up moving back in with our families separately and only seeing eachother on the weekends, but going from living with eachother for over a year and then all of a sudden splitting apart again brought some issues. My trust issues got very very bad and I started with my outbursts and starting arguments for no reason. We both did and we would blame eachother for everything. \n\nI broke up with her and got back with her multiple times. I started running from our problems and coming back expecting it to be the way it was when we first got together, but it never turned out that way. I started focusing on myself and what I could do to be better for her. I tried so many things and so many ways but I could never find a way that worked and made us both happy. I wanted it to work out so much but she got fed up with me and blocked me on everything. I broke her heart so many times and lied to her because I didn\u2019t wanna admit I was wrong. I miss her so god damn much and wish I could go back in time to fix things. I want to hold her one more time. I want to give her all the affection she deserves. I wish I payed a little bit more attention to her and put myself to the side for once. \n\nMy only regret so far in life I wish I treated you a little bit better Peyton. If by any chance you find this and read it, just know I\u2019m still trying my best and not giving up just for the chance I get to love you like I should have. Honey was the best thing we ever had and you\u2019re the only other person that I share those memories with. You have her kitten and I miss getting to see her. You\u2019re my fucking soulmate Peyton and I will never love anyone else like I love you. If my life ends with you not by my side then it was all a waste. My life will have no meaning. \n ",

If you did, I'm sorry, and I'm glad you're still here.\n\nI'll get to the point. I prepared to commit suicide, something that has been on my mind every day for the past year and a half. Approximately. I decided to finally do it in January, I think. Ghosted all my friends, ruined every relationship within my family, completely neglected my schoolwork to the point that it's not salvageable anymore and that I'd have to drop out if I didn't die (though, honestly, I gave up on that much earlier).\n\nI wrote the letters. I bought the rope. I chose the place.\n\nBut I am *scared.* I'm fucking terrified. I don't want to die anymore, but now it feels like I don't have a choice. That I already made this decision, and I have to follow through. It's not that I want to live... I don't. At least not the life I have now. It's not even something worth being called a life. I do realize that it is only myself who can save me, that it is in my hands to turn my life around, that I am the only one responsible for my own happiness. I know things can change, theoretically, but I know myself, and I know that I am too weak to try and face the consequences of my own actions in an attempt to fix this. To rebuild the last bridge I burned. I'm not sure I want to.\n\nI don't know what I want. The idea of living is dreadful. The idea of death, although once so comforting, is terrifying. I want nothing, but I *don't* want to die.\n\nI have tried to kill myself before, when I was a teenager. Multiple times. Never before have I experienced this crippling horror at the idea of dying, not even when I thought I succeeded. The thought now makes me nauseous with fear, and I don't know what to do, because I *have to* die.\n\nThank you for reading. I'm sorry if this post doesn't fit the subreddit, or if I don't make much sense, and I'm sorry if I sound pretentious. I'm really not trying to be. I'm not sure *what* I'm trying to go for with this post, in all honesty, or what I'm looking for. I'm just lost, and I don't understand why I'm suddenly so afraid of something I ruined my life for. I feel pathetic.",

    "selftext": "I\u2019m reaching out to this community because I\u2019m really worried about my cousin, who has been battling alcoholism for the past six years. He\u2019s never liked drinking, but after so much time, he feels completely trapped in a cycle of addiction. On top of that, he has significant mental health issues, and he lost his mother a while ago, dad left him, which has only deepened his struggles.\n\nToday, his behavior was really concerning. He was talking constantly, repeating words over and over, and even making a song out of them. He was jumping around in the bathroom, laughing uncontrollably\u2014though it was forced, almost like a nervous laughter. He was narrating random, nonsensical stories, smiling in a way that didn\u2019t feel normal. This isn\u2019t the way he usually behaves. He\u2019s normally very calm and thoughtful, even shy but today he was completely out of character.\n\nHe\u2019s been becoming more antisocial lately, and despite me being the only one visiting him, he still feels incredibly lonely. He\u2019s tried therapy, but it hasn\u2019t helped much, and he often feels like he\u2019s beyond saving. He has also mentioned feeling like he might end it all, though not directly. I\u2019m really scared for him, but I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\n\nI love him deeply, and I\u2019m doing everything I can to support him, but I can\u2019t fix this alone. I\u2019m looking for any advice, support, or resources\u2014whether it\u2019s therapy recommendations, strategies to help him when he spirals, or even just emotional support from people who understand what this is like.\n\nI\u2019m open to any suggestions, even if they\u2019re hard to hear. Please, if anyone has experience with something similar or knows of any supportive communities, I\u2019d really appreciate your input.",

    "selftext": "This is going to be a long one\u2014sorry in advance.\n\nI (29F) got divorced three years ago from my manipulative ex-husband after being with him for 6.5 years. We had no kids because he didn\u2019t want any responsibility. I\u2019ve moved on from him in the sense that I don\u2019t want him back, but I feel like the emotional and psychological abuse I went through changed me in ways I can\u2019t undo.\n\nWhenever a potential new partner comes into my life, I can\u2019t seem to accept them. The moment I see something I don\u2019t agree with, even if it\u2019s small, I start emotionally distancing myself to avoid getting hurt. I don\u2019t even know what a healthy relationship looks like.\n\nOn top of that, I live in a Middle Eastern country where everyone constantly pressures me to get married before I become \u201ctoo old.\u201d It just makes me feel worse\u2014like the manipulation and mistreatment I faced really broke something in me, and I don\u2019t know how to fix it.\n\nWhat my ex did to me\n\nTo summarize: he cheated on me multiple times, and I only found out about all of them at once. He never got me gifts\u2014only things he wanted me to have so he could show off his status. He never initiated intimacy; it was always up to me. He didn\u2019t want kids, but the moment he felt like I was pulling away, he suddenly wanted them\u2014basically trying to baby trap me even though it was obvious our relationship was already over.\n\nWhen I needed help\u2014like when my car wouldn\u2019t start or the faucets were bursting\u2014he never answered my calls. I had to handle everything myself. He claimed he had OCD about cleanliness but would leave trash and dirty clothes everywhere, expecting me to clean up after him just because I was a stay-at-home wife at the time.\n\nFinancially, he cut me off (except for food and clothes) when I got a part-time job and started making more than him for like three months. In my culture, the husband is supposed to provide for his wife, but as soon as I had my own income (which was around 4k a year, yes a year), he refused to spend a single cent on me unless it was food or clothes (had to pay my own cell-service, gas, etc\u2026 which he previously paid for).\n\nWhen we traveled, it was never about me\u2014it was just because he wanted to see the world, and his friends couldn\u2019t afford to go with him. When I put effort into our relationship\u2014planning picnics, buying games so we could play together, setting up dates, booking hotels\u2014he ignored it all, (yes I slept in a hotel by myself which is a huge NO-NO in my culture because he wanted to hang out with his boys instead). I tried everything to make it work, and the only complaint he had about me was that I \u201cdidn\u2019t clean enough.\u201d He would literally swipe his finger over a light switch, show me the dust, and act like that was a real issue.\n\nOur last conversation? He told me I was perfect, that he was sorry he cheated, and that was it. Only when he realized that I was really leaving him, that he started crying in the corner of the apartment we had like a 3-year-old toddler. 2 days later he was like I did everything for you and it\u2019s all your fault I cheated\u2026 :)\n\nWhere I\u2019m at now\n\nThe cheating destroyed me. I never even checked his phone because I respected his privacy, and in return, I got blindsided. I lost myself completely. People see me as this cheerful, bubbly person, but it\u2019s just a facade so my parents don\u2019t worry about me.\n\nAfter the divorce, I moved back in with them (which is normal in my culture). My dad even built me a small studio flat upstairs, so I have my own space. But I stopped working, so I have no income. Even if I got a full-time job, the salaries here are terrible\u2014around $15,500 USD a year, even though I have nine years of experience in marketing and content. Realistically, I should be making $20K\u2013$30K, but that\u2019s a whole other issue.\n\nI just feel like I have nothing to live for. My biggest dream in life is to have a family and kids, but the dating scene is discouraging. I do have hobbies\u2014I love reading, drawing, playing video games, watching anime/TV/movies, taking walks, and doing at-home pilates. So it\u2019s not like I do nothing with my life, but inside, I feel completely empty.\n\nMy struggle with marriage \n\nI\u2019m very traditional\u2014not because of my family, but because I truly believe a husband should take care of his wife. That doesn\u2019t mean I expect to be spoiled and contribute nothing, but I don\u2019t think it should be my responsibility to cook, clean, and do everything 24/7.\n\nMost men here, though, want a wife to take care of them. I keep getting set up with men through my family, and it\u2019s always the same story\u2014they expect a woman to be a maid, not a partner. I feel like I\u2019m running out of time to get married, and it\u2019s making me anxious because I really want to build a family.\n\nMy thoughts are all over the place, and I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nPS: This is the first time I\u2019ve ever shared something this personal. I don\u2019t even know if this makes sense. English isn\u2019t my first language, so sorry if it\u2019s messy.\n",

    "selftext": "This also gon be long (i cant help it, i am literally crying as i typed this)...\n\nTLDR: I\u2019m leaving for college soon, and while I\u2019m excited, I\u2019m struggling with the thought of leaving my mom behind. We\u2019ve always been close since my dad works overseas, but lately, I\u2019ve been unintentionally pulling away, getting irritable, and saying things I regret. I thought distancing myself would make leaving easier, but it only hurts more. Seeing how much my mom will miss me\u2014made me realize I don\u2019t want to leave things on a sour note. I keep having vivid dreams about my departure, and the guilt of how I\u2019ve treated her is overwhelming. I want to fix things before I go, but I don\u2019t know how.\n\nI\u2019m moving away for college in a few months, and as excited as I am for this new chapter, I can\u2019t stop thinking about how much I\u2019m going to miss my mom. She\u2019s been my biggest source of comfort my whole life, and since my dad works overseas, we\u2019ve always had a strong bond. But now that I\u2019m getting closer to leaving, I feel this huge mix of emotions that I don\u2019t know how to deal with.\n\nLately, I\u2019ve noticed myself pulling away a little\u2014not intentionally, but I think it\u2019s my way of trying to make leaving easier. Instead, it\u2019s just making me feel worse. I\u2019ve been more irritable, and I hate that I\u2019ve raised my voice at times when I never used to, I always used to listen to her life stories even if I had heard them countless times, her rants too, whenever she shouted for reasons I wasn't even wrong... But now I am talking back to her, get angry on her and say awful things, when she tells her stories I say they are boring and please shut up, I don't know why I am doing this... I still want to listen to her rants and yapping but I am not able to, I am going into that angry zone and I have done many mistakes. I haven\u2019t even apologized properly, and that weighs on me. It\u2019s like I\u2019m watching myself act this way but can\u2019t stop.\n\nI know this is all part of growing up, but the thought of leaving her behind, even temporarily, is really hard. I don\u2019t have many close friends, so my mom has always been the one I could talk to. But over time, I started keeping things to myself, thinking I shouldn\u2019t burden her with my problems. I used to be able to just rest my head in her lap and cry when things got hard\u2014when I got bullied, when I felt alone\u2014but I haven\u2019t done that in years. It makes me sad because I feel like I\u2019ve lost that connection a bit, and I don\u2019t want to leave things this way And now, when I probably need it the most, I feel like I can\u2019t show her the weak side of me that I have long pretended to have erased.\n\nThe other day, something happened that really got to me. My mom was taking a nap, and before sleeping, she had asked me to grab some groceries. While she was resting, my little sister was joking around and said, \"He left for college,\" and my mom suddenly started crying in sleep. She thought I had already gone. I was still at home, but seeing that broke me. I rushed to get the groceries, but I was tearing up the whole time. It made me realize just how hard this is going to be\u2014for both of us, and precisely the reason I was trying to distance myself from her that she doesn't grieve much but no, now I feel that she will cry more that I left and our relation were sour and not mended, I genuinely want to say sorry right now but I am stuck and I am going crazy.\n\nAt night, I keep having vivid dreams about the day I leave, and they feel so real (I do have genetic hyperphantasia (from my mom that too)) that I wake up feeling broken. Every time, it\u2019s like I\u2019m reliving the moment before it even happens (I know mom must be having those dreams too). It makes me feel so helpless because no matter what I do, that day is still coming. I was going to leave this January, but postponed it to August, because in January we were close to ripping each other off, that level of arguments... But now things are settling down, but still it isn't back to what it was last year...\n\nI know I have to go, and I know my mom wants the best for me. She always encourages me, and I\u2019m so grateful for everything she\u2019s done\u2014raising me, taking care of me, making sure I don't feel alone (I do feel, but I pretend I don't to not hurt her, I do have suicidal thoughts sometimes, but I hold back that it will all fall into place soon, however indefinite the \"soon\" is). I just want to spend these last few months showing her how much she means to me and making good memories before I leave. I just want to do the right thing, but I feel so lost. I thought distancing myself would help, but it only hurts more... Idk how to leave without hurting my mom... How do I say goodbye without breaking her heart... All of these are constantly revolving in my mind and I'm going crazy... I still have a few months but I don't know how I'll manage... I want to mend things... But I am thrown into my guilt...\n\nFor those who\u2019ve gone through something similar, how did you make the transition easier? How did you make sure your mom knew how much you appreciated her before you left? I don\u2019t want to take this time for granted, and I\u2019d love to hear any advice on how to make these last few months meaningful for both of us. I know now that pushing my mom away won\u2019t make leaving any easier\u2014if anything, it\u2019ll only make it worse. I tried to make her love me less so she wouldn't hurt when I leave, but all I did was create more pain for both of us. I don\u2019t want her to remember our last months together with regret. I just want to fix things before it\u2019s too late\n\nAnd lastly, Just to clarify, this is about my bond with my mom as a parent, nothing else. We\u2019re Asian\u2014if I ever even thought otherwise, she\u2019d personally set me straight with a slipper and more ultimate weapons. My dad works overseas but is always present, calling daily morning and night and supporting her even more than I do, listening to her rants and all. I love my mom because she\u2019s always been there for me, and I\u2019ve supported her in return. She doesn\u2019t rely on me for happiness\u2014I rely on her. I know I have to leave one day, but I just want to make things right before I go.",

(dont tell me about diaries, i suck at writing) and\n\nTLDR: Before COVID, I was social and talkative, but after the pandemic, I lost that ability. My friendships faded, and now I barely talk at all. Conversations feel forced, and I overthink everything. I keep things to myself because I have no one to truly open up to. Even online, my attempts to connect go unanswered. I miss the version of me that could talk freely, without hesitation. I don\u2019t know how to fix it, and I just wish someone understood.  \n  \nBefore COVID, I was a completely different person. I wasn\u2019t exactly an extrovert, but I talked a lot\u2014so much that teachers had to tell me to quiet down in class. I had a normal social life, and conversations came naturally. But after the pandemic, something changed. I used to have a few friends, and talking felt effortless. But when everything went online, I realized something: those connections were weaker than I thought. Conversations faded, and soon, I was just... alone.\n\nNow, I barely talk at all. I don\u2019t have close friends, and I find myself avoiding conversations altogether. It\u2019s not that I hate people\u2014I just don\u2019t know how to talk anymore. It feels like I lost the ability somewhere along the way. Even when I try, it feels forced, like I don\u2019t belong in the conversation. I started keeping things to myself\u2014not because I wanted to, but because I had to. There was no one to talk to. If I spoke up in online classes, I\u2019d either get ignored, get shut down by teachers, or feel like I was saying something dumb. Friends who I thought were there just\u2026 weren\u2019t. And slowly, I just stopped trying.\n\nEven now, in person, I can\u2019t bring myself to talk like I used to. I hold back. I overthink. I don\u2019t have friends anymore. I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend, and honestly, I don\u2019t need one for the reasons most of my classmates seem to. I just wish I had someone to talk to\u2014someone I could open up to about things I can\u2019t even tell my mom anymore (see this post). She\u2019s been my only real friend for years, but as I grew older, I started holding back. I don\u2019t want to worry her, and I don\u2019t want to burden her with my thoughts. But that means I end up keeping everything inside, with no one to really share it with.\n\nI don\u2019t know how I ended up like this. I miss the version of me that could just talk without hesitation. I miss feeling like I had people to talk to at all. People say it's just a phase, but how long does a phase last? It\u2019s been 5-6 years, and I\u2019m still waiting to snap out of it\u2014feeling like a tether floating in space, cut off from its base, holding onto nothing but a fragile strand of hope that maybe, just maybe, something will push me back.\n\nI overthink at the silliest of times. Even now, as I type, I am overthinking. It\u2019s been two hours since I started writing this small post, but my mind is stuck in a loop\u2014how to write, what to write, how much to write, is this sentence wrong, what if I\u2019m misunderstood, what if the post gets removed, what if there\u2019s no reply? My mind just doesn\u2019t stop.\n\nI don\u2019t know if anyone else has experienced this\u2014going from talkative and social to completely silent and disconnected. I don\u2019t know how to fix it either. I miss being able to just talk without overthinking everything. I miss having someone to truly connect with. I miss the part of me that could engage in conversations without second-guessing every word. Back then, I could even talk to girls without feeling like I was just spouting nonsense. Not that I ever got much of a response, but at least I was able to talk. Now, I hesitate for so long that by the time I figure out what to say, the moment has already passed. The person has already walked away.\n\nWhenever I see friends posting on Instagram, I reach out\u2014\"What\u2019s up?\" \"Nice!\" \"Cool!\" \"How have you been?\" But most of the time, there\u2019s no reply. And if there is, it\u2019s a dry \"okay\" or \"cool,\" like they don\u2019t want to engage in a conversation no matter how hard I try. I don\u2019t have any social skills anymore. I don\u2019t have humor. I don\u2019t know how to flirt or even start a normal conversation. I have to ask ChatGPT just to figure out how to say something.\n\nHas anyone else gone through this? How did you handle it?  \nI just wish someone understood. I am tired of being alone, and reaching out isn't helping anymore",

She looked at me like I mattered, and for the first time in a long time, I felt seen. We worked in the same company but had never noticed each other before that night.\n\nFrom that moment on, my life revolved around her. We weren\u2019t officially together, but we acted like we were. She\u2019d come over almost every night, we\u2019d talk for hours, fall asleep in each other\u2019s arms. It felt real.

But months passed, and nothing changed. Every time I tried to define what we were, she pulled away. And yet, she always came back.\n\nShe had a drinking problem.
