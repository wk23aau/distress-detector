    "selftext": "im struggling a lot. \n\nfor a lot of my life, i can never bring myself to do things. If i was reading or watching something while another important thing was pending, i'd never get up. The constant nagging inside me to finish that work would eat me up from the inside. If i did focus on something, it would be too much, if my folks weren't around to remind me, i'd forget to eat or sleep until that thing i focused on was done. I was called lazy, and irregular.\n\nnow, i'm in high school. this is probably the most important thing of my life, the set factor to tell if i'll even make it to college. i look at my grades and i feel something inside me die. for a lot of my life, i was an average student. i would never do homework because i'd forget/something would distract me, but my tests and quizzes would bring me up to at least a b average. i'd never pay attention in class either, since i was too busy daydreaming or something, i would just figure things out along the way. \n\nnow as someone whos learning more advanced things in my school, its harder to keep up. to be honest, i don't think i ever learned to study. i even got up to the advanced classes in my school and theyre just kicking my ass. (one of my teachers even talked to me today about moving down to a lower level. it was humiliating.) sometimes i feel like wanting to cry while getting ready for school since i know i'l fail and fail and fail again and again. it doesnt help that i go to a really good school, which seems contradictory, but everyone's so smart here. i watch my friends who bawl their eyes out over having gpas of 4s and 4.5s, while i can barely get mine to stay in the 3 range. \n\ni just feel like ive let my family down. as an oldest sibling, i have to set a good example for my younger siblings, but i cant. my parents worked their asses off to get to where they are now only to have a kid who is failing school. \n\ni dont know whats wrong with me. am i stupid? sometimes id talk to close friends (not mentioning my grades because im so ashamed) and the way they react makes me think that they have an easier time learning stuff and focusing. what do they have that i don't? its like im slower than them and i still cant get myself to do the slightest bit better.

My dad (he was driving) pulled out as they are yelling at are car. I thought they where lost but my dad said that it may be alert dogs. We drove pass them to see if they when to one house. We drove to the house and I went down the drive (dad stayed by the road for owner running after them/make sure they don't run into the road). The drive was steep and the dog circled me as I descended. The was a lot of trash bags and trash all around. The was like five square feet and it piled up three feet. The house looked abandoned and I saw a window broken only the screen left. A third dog inside screaming it's head off. The was a large plant in a pot on the porch that difficult to move around.  The door was  open not enough to see a sliver inside but just enough to push it open with no real force. I repeatedly thought about tapping it and the door creaking open to see a rotting body. As I slowly bring my hand to the door, moments before I touching it a woman run out of the back yard thanking us for getting her dog back home stating that one dog was not hers. I still feel odd about her say one wasn't hers. Not the rotting house of bile and filth but the one sentence she said to us.",

    "selftext": "I definitely need to see a therapist about this one :\n(TW: CA, SA, and self-harm)\n\nI (21F) had this life-altering experience when I was around 15 or 16, during high school. At the time, the friend group was fairly large and a friend of mine started dating a new student, we all had gotten close pretty quick since we all hung out together and that was the dynamic then.\n\nDuring class one day he sent me a Snapchat asking if I could step out to talk about my friend\u2014his girlfriend. Thinking something was wrong, I asked the teacher if I could be excused (which she allowed because we were just making valentine\u2019s day cards and class would be over shortly.) What started as an innocent conversation about childish relationship drama suddenly shifted.\n\n(TW) I was choked to the point where I lost focus in my eyes, and what felt like blood circulation being cut off, I\u2019d been sa\u2019d and I froze... while I was panicking internally I kept thinking it wouldn\u2019t go any farther knowing we were LITERALLY in a main hallway with a camera right above us. So it felt impossible that something like this could be happening in such a visible place... clearly i was wrong and naive.\n\nAt the time, I didn\u2019t fully understand what had happened, but the bell had rung and our friend group met as usual, walking each other to our next period. That\u2019s when I had a panic attack. A friend noticed and as I\u2019m trying to explain what happened she notices our vice principal, of course my friend tells her, to which I\u2019m immediately sent to the principal\u2019s office.\n\nI explained everything. They told me they would \u201cconduct an investigation\u201d and sent me home. I was never given the opportunity to write a report. I ended up missing a month+ of school with no updates on the situation. My parents would constantly call the school wondering when I\u2019ll be able to go back, how i\u2019m going to catch up on my work etc. we eventually were called in for a meeting. Most of the meeting now is a blur, besides the infamous hurtful quote of all time \u201cIt seems like you wanted to,\u201d  my heart drops and I shut down, I remember the same unable to breathe  feeling and was in complete shock as my parents scolded me. \n\nI was still sent home after this as they would figure out our next steps. From when the situation first began to the conclusion we\u2019d gotten (TW) I endured physical, verbal, and emotional abuse from my parents. Over time, I started believing it was my fault\u2014something I still struggle with today. That belief led to years of severe self exiting ideations and harm.\n\n(Note the both of us were eventually allowed back in school, but I had be isolated in a office and he\u2019d been in ISD (in school detention, eventually he moved))\n\nFast forward to years of no contact, he reached out with an apology. By then, I had already let go and forgiven the situation. If I\u2019m honest, I hold far more resentment toward my parents than him\u2014at least he apologized\u2026.\n\nMore recently, we crossed paths on social media. We caught up through texts, he would apologized again, I\u2019d make dark humor jokes out of it, called, etc., it felt like the old friends we were before the bad. And for a moment, I thought he had changed. I felt relieved\u2014happy even\u2014to know he had grown into a better person. As time passed I stopped hearing from him\u2026 and out of curiosity I ask his roommate if everything was okay with him.\n\nI found out he had been arrested.\n(TW) Domestic assault and battery plus Domestic assault and battery by strangulation.\n(Note: He\u2019s now released and there were no charges from the plaintiff)\n\nGuys \u2014 It feels like I\u2019m subconsciously reliving that nightmare that once was. I don\u2019t know why, and I can\u2019t shake it. The scariest part is I can\u2019t stop thinking about the woman he hurt\u2026 I don\u2019t even know her, but I\u2019m fixated on her. And for him\u2026 I don\u2019t know where to begin on how I feel.. I feel stupid, guilt, naive to thinking he was a good person\u2026 I feel empathy, concern, and curiosity\u2026 I feel angry, condemnation, and to shame him\u2026 I feel like I need to do something but I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nWhat is wrong with me?!

I don\u2019t want to ruin our friendship with this, I can\u2019t lose him. \n\nAnother thing is, I\u2019m fully not his type. He loves tall, masculine, strong men, and I\u2019m none of that. I\u2019m 5\u20192, not strong and feminine leaning in my appearance, I\u2019m the complete opposite of his type and it kills me to know that. \n\nI\u2019m just so lost, I want to tell him how I feel, but I don\u2019t want to ruin things.

This immediately worried me because he's been talking a lot lately about suicidal feelings and he refuses to seek help because he \"don't have the time or money\" and insist he'd never do anything, just saying hoping he dies in a accident so his family would be taken care of. \n\n Everyone has heard of those Disney trips that are before divorce, abandonment, or suicide and I'm really worried that's what this is.

It mostly stopped when I was around 10 I think.\n\nI hated it all, but I didn't really say or do anything, because I guess it was harmless?\n\nAny ways I'm a pretty hands-off person now, and don't do a lot of physical touch with anyone, and my therapist thinks that's how it started.\n\nI can believe that, but he keeps calling it \"sexual assault/harassment\" which I feel is too far a stretch as it wasn't sexual, and that's a very serious conviction.\n\nThey tried to argue what if my uncles did that to my sister?

    "selftext": "TW: MENTION OF DR*G USE. \n\n\n\n\n\nI spent years, from 18 to 31, almost my entire adult life being manipulated and abused by my ex. Who I knew was an alcoholic but I didn't realize was a drug addict. (meth and cocaine, apparently)\n Boy, that was a doozy when I figured that out. So naive on my part. \n\n Until therapy. Therapy was great for me. I didn't even know I was being abused until my therapist was basically like, \"Hey. None of this is normal. This is not okay.\" Even though my family and friends were worried for me and tried to get me to see it, I continued to stand up for my ex and cover for them until therapy. \n\nWherever you are Therapist Jas, you helped me start to save myself. \n\nWhen I decided I wanted out, all i wanted were my things and my dogs. No smear campaign. No fights. Just my items and to disappear into the void. Things did not work out like that, actually. \n\nThey didn't allow me to take most of my things, most of which were given to me by my great grandma and grandma.\n\n I left with two duffel bags and a tote. \n\nOn the day they were \"nice enough\" to let me get more of my things, all i ended up with was my great grandmas table (which was a win to me) and some lovely boxes of actual garbage can trash that they put together for me. Including but not limited to old food wrappers, contents from multiple ash trays, a sex toy I'd never seen, and most of my photos ripped into tiny shreds. They would not let me have my dogs. \n\nLike a buffoon, for weeks I attempted to get my dogs back. They couldn't afford to feed the dogs much less themselves so I offered to buy the food, cover upcoming vet bills, allow visits.\n \nThey kept my dogs. I never got to see them again. I never even got to go inside the home and say goodbye. \n\nIt's been a few years but I found out recently that my ex lost their house. And then another. So satisfying for me to hear honestly, But what threw me off the most was when I found out what happened to my dogs, thanks to One of my exes family members. \n\nOne \"ran away\". This particular dog never left the yard. Never left my side. She was a very good girl. In the 10 years I'd had her, not once was she ever lost or missing. \n\nOne \"we don't know\" what happened. So a dog just disappeared into thin air. Got it. \n\nAnd the last one...\n\nWas neglected and malnourished and treated so badly he went blind. He was so bad that by the time one of my \"exes friends\" took him to the vet there was nothing they could do but put him down. \n\nThe family member said it wasn't two weeks later and the ex got a new dog. \n\nI was devastated. That particular family member no longer has dealings of any kind with my ex, but found me to let me know about what happened. I appreciated that, even though I was heartbroken. He knew i fought hard for those babies and I would have kept fighting but i couldn't because I ended up getting a well deserved order of protection for a multitude of other reasons. \n\nIt's been a few years. I'm married and a mom now. I live a very safe, comfortable, happy life with a man that is extremely good to me. I'm still working to rewire my brain from the years of chaos and abuse. I'm still pretty triggered by certain things and I still have nightmares from time to time. \n\n\nBut most of all, I'm still grieving my dogs. I wanted to save them. I wanted to fight for them. I wanted them with me. To live happy, free lives. I miss them. And I hope they didn't think they did anything wrong when I left. I hope they know I cry everytime their pictures come up on my photo memories. I hope they know I did my best and I never forgot them. I hope they knew I loved them and that I still do. \n\n\nAnd I hope that my ex never has a moment of peace or fortune or anything close to good for what they did to my dogs. Not even what they did to me. But to my innocent, sweet, loyal, amazing dogs. ",

    "selftext": "tw for rape/abuse/controlling behaviour\n\nhi guys i am very nervous to post this as it is my first post on reddit and i couldn't figure out how to go anonymous without making a new email but here it is. \n\ni (f19) have known my boyfriend (m19) since april 2023 and have been with him officially since june 2023, he previously had a girlfriend 'polly' (f19) from january 2021 to around december 2022, she broke up with him at this point but he said that after a few weeks of her ignoring him they rekindled but issues were still arising so they officially split in march 2023 and he hasn't been in contact with her since.\n\nhe has expressed to me that she had issues with her mother and often stayed at his house for extended periods of time, was a big smoker at the time and would often steal from his older brother when she had no money, and that she was depressed/depressive throughout the relationship and was also prescribed medication towards the end of their relationship which he said was changing her behaviour and attitude negatively, he believes this is why she left him in december 2022 because of their differing views. he also told me that she has history of making accusations, before she had reported him i was asking him questions about her and their relationship and he said that in the beginning he got a message from a boy who had been previously accused of rape by her saying that she was a liar, he obviously believed her as they were together but in hindsight this should've been a red flag he also said that they didn't have much of a sexual relationship and she was very paranoid with protection which obviously would make sense if she was a victim of rape so i guess that's how he thought of it but later on down the line she denied that she was raped and said that it was consensual.\n\nin september 2023 his ex accused him of coercive and controlling behaviour (we didnt know when she first filed the report until months later) and he was taken into police custody in october 2023 for a few hours. initially she had reported that he was abusive towards her but quickly dropped the gbh charges, i assume she didn't have enough evidence - his solicitor stated that the evidence she saw for the gbh charges consisted of 2 photos of grazes and bruises she had. she initially said that he had punched her 100 times in one period of time, also in one of her statements she said that she had taken photos of bruises on her arm that he had given her as she was sat in his bed next to him this alone is baffling to me as if he was 'so controlling' i don't believe he would let her do this especially if he was the cause.\n\ni completely believe him when he says that he did not do it as i have been with him for about the same amount of time they were together and have had none of the same issues with him, also i have read/heard multiple of her and her family's claims and the written ones just don't match up - for example, her brother said he saw my boyfriend strangling her and her face was purple and her mother said that on the same day and time he only had her pinned on the bed. this instantly gives me red flags.\n\nmy first thought was obviously that since they broke up and got back together multiple times throughout their relationship she was hoping that the same would happen but he met me and moved on instead (her friend had messaged her when she was not speaking to him and told her that 'polly' had advised him to move on). also it is very possible that she was aware that he was with me and not just having time to himself as his mother frequently posts on facebook and had made a post in july 2023 that she was picking him up from the city that i live in and mentioned me in the post, my boyfriend's mother has proof that she has been frequenting her profile as she accidentally requested to be her friend one day. the only piece of evidence that i have seen that i am aware she has kept (evidence she had of bruises from an injury have been thrown out with the gbh charge) is a clipped screenshot of him texting her saying 'i'll find another girl to abuse' obviously i have defended this as a retaliation to her emotional manipulation/abuse his solicitor also requested that the police access her phone to retrieve all of their iMessage conversation for context. personally i believe that him saying that is not an omission but an inappropriate joke of some sort.\n\nshe claimed that while they were together he would tell her what she could and couldn't wear, wouldn't let her see her friends or family, wouldn't let her take her pills, wouldn't let her attend school, etc. i have seen photos of her in his phone of them together with his friends, i also met his friends and they brought her up casually before he knew she had reported him so no mal intent there in my opinion, i have also seen photos of her school work.\n\ni do not believe a word that she said in her statements she said that she was so badly affected by him that she cannot sleep comfortably, walk for long periods, sit comfortably in a car or travel by airplane but she continues to post herself at clubs in the city that i live in (him and her don't), she has gone on multiple holidays since reporting him, one she showed on instagram just shy of 2 months after she made her original report, etc.\n\nof course when they were together he was also between the ages of 15 and 17 so i am honestly surprised that it is even been taken to crown court and gone of for so long it seems so menial to me.\n\ni am just nervous as it seems that in court he will be judged by a jury and i know they are to be unbiased but it is still nerve wracking to know that his fate lies in the hands of strangers, he has made it known to me that he would like a restraining order to be put in place, i would prefer a protection order as from what i know they are longer lasting, i think that he could also charge her with deformation of character as she was telling his friends that he was abusive to her during the first summer that we were together (june/july 2023). \n\nplease don't suggest that i leave him often when i share this with friends they say i should just leave him to avoid the stress but it is not about me, i love him and want to be there and support him the best that i can but i honestly don't know what i would do if he was found guilty and sentenced for a long period of time, we having been talking about saving up for a deposit on a house, getting married and having a baby in the coming years.\n\ni don't really know what i'm expecting from this in all honesty but just wanted to share without feeling like a burden, i'm sure there is more information that i have missed as this is just a late night rant of sorts so i may make some edits at a different time but feel free to ask any questions or give any advice.",

    "selftext": "I (26F) had been feeling like a caretaker for most of my relationship with my ex-partner (39M) who is an alcoholic. He would be sober for a long time, and then relapse. The more I thought about the relapses, the timing seemed way too convenient. He would relapse during times, when I went to see family, when I got a new job, when I got my graduate school qualifying exams, when I went to travel abroad alone for the first time in several years. It started feeling like he was punishing me for having a life of my own.\n\nThroughout the relationship, I had financially supported him. Even when he was sober, it was not uncommon that rent was late, he was in medical debt because of avoiding to get a good insurance plan, he never paid taxes, etc. I was always \"borrowing\" him money that I ended up realizing I will never get back. \n\nEnough was enough.\n\nHe asked me to quit my job and move to a new location with him, which I did. I gave up EVERYTHING only for him to relapse. \n\nThat's when I decided that I am done, and that I need to live my own life. I knew that he had taken money from our mutual savings (so 90% mine, 10% his) without asking me before, so I \"forgot\" my credit and debit cards on to the kitchen table while starting to move my stuff out, and took his wallet from his pocket, placing it on the bottom of his bedside drawer. He was going to hit withdrawals if he didn't have money for booze, so I knew he was going to steal my cards. It was not until a day later that they \"disappeared\" and I saw charges made. Booze. Sex club(?), Casinos. Lots of takeout. Impulsive purchases online.\n\nI called the police, reported the cards missing, and said that my ex was the suspect, and that he is currently trying to drink himself to death (which he always is when he relapses and doesn't hesitate to say it). They came over immediately, I was there too, and they found the cards in his possession, and as he turned violent towards them yelling I set him up, he was arrested him on the spot. I've come clean to the police about his tax avoidance as well, along with illegal threats against me from 2-3 years ago (that I have screenshots of), as the statute of limitations has not run out. \n\nHe's looking at several charges now, including resisting arrest,  illegal threats, stealing, potential tax evasion and negligence, several fines, and isn't a first-time offender. I don't know how he's doing, whether he's sober, I don't care. I have my own life to live. \n\nSince then, I've begun making more money, and traveling the world, and I am finally starting to feel like myself again. I've even made new friends, which I haven't for years, as all of my old friends made me choose between them and him, and I foolishly chose him. ",

This isn\u2019t just her story\u2014it\u2019s mine too.\n\nHer Story: How She Was Trapped\n\nShe met him thinking he was just a good friend. He never acted inappropriate, never said anything with double meaning. He built trust first, slowly making her believe he was a safe person.\n\nThen one day, they went on a trip together. She tried to refuse weed, but he kept pushing until she gave in. Once she was intoxicated, everything changed. He made her believe he liked her, even loved her. And in that manipulated state, he took what he wanted.\n\nThe next day, she still couldn\u2019t process what happened. She even wore a skirt for him, as if she was trying to convince herself that it was something real, something meaningful. But when the trip ended, so did his act. He turned cold\u2014immediately, like she never mattered.\n\nIt took time for her to accept it. First, she blamed herself. Then, she started questioning reality. Finally, she realized\u2014she was just another toy to him.\n\nShe told me:\n\n\"I didn\u2019t know it was all his plan. I was just a toy for him.\"\n\n\"I feel dirty. I feel like I\u2019m not clean anymore.\"\n\n\"Why did he act like he cared, only to throw me away?\"\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a love affair.\nThis was grooming.\n\nHe conditioned her trust, intoxicated her, used her, then discarded her. And even after realizing everything, she still blamed herself.\n\n\n---\n\nMy Story: Why This Hurts Me Too\n\nShe told me everything. And I believed her. I still do. But the hardest part? Other people don\u2019t.\n\nEven my own uncle dismissed it. He refused to believe the evidence, called her a liar, and even defended the abuser.

    "selftext": "Me and the Situationship old enough to be my dad are not seeing each other anymore. I was very excited and relieved, he's started seeing other people. I know if I ended things he'd just give me the silent treatment, yell at me, attempt to make me look bad at work, or physically hurt me all things he's done at work when he thinks I'm rejecting him. \n\nSo I was very happy and relieved to find out he went on a date with someone else, he even gave me the silent treatment all day yesterday. Today though, he's acting normal though, saying hi and trying to make jokes. I found out I might have to work with him tomorrow so i asked the one supervisor that I do trust if I could skip working with him. I've already told a few supervisors i feel uncomfortable with him and everyone just laughs it off, \"oh yeah he's just a character, that's him.\" Situationship even gloats, \"my job is whatever I want, they're not gonna do anything. Our boss isn't gonna do anything I told her already.\"\n\nTrusted Supervisor doesn't know anything that's happened outside of work, I only told him what Situationship has done AT work. I'm so embarrassed, nervous, I even feel humiliated. I don't want to make an official report but Trusted Supervisor is telling me to take it to the highest in the office, our boss's boss's boss. I am dreading it. I have 2 weeks or he'll make the report himself.\n\nI'm not gonna mention the assault, the weird relationship we had outside of work, only the inappropriate behavior that happened during work but still. I'm worried Situationship will say I just have a vendetta against him. He already gets away with everything, maybe he will bring up our relationship outside of work to cover his ass. Situationship just gets to do whatever he wants and it's irritating me. \n\nHe called another supervisor (who's black) a monkey and almost dropped the N-word. He was screaming this in my face on the street, we work at a hospital and multiple people heard this. No one cares, the supervisors I have told just said, \"yikes yeah he was really mad that day.\" \n\nDread dread dread that's all I feel right now. ",

Yesterday, I'm getting texts in the gc but I'm not really reading them until I see Angela says my name. I respond how did my name get brought up. Angela says when we all were hanging out yesterday I didn't engage with anyone or say anything and it took her a minute to realize I was there. Then Angela, Randi, &amp; Kasey are all basically saying I don't talk when I'm with them, all I just follow them around, force them to sign me in their dorm to \"hangout\" with them, &amp; they know nothing about me. I texted back saying \"I do talk sometimes its just sometimes I don't talk bc of social anxiety or bc I have nothing to say. The other day only asked yall to sign me bc it was raining hard and I didn't want to walk across campus to my dorm in the rain. I wasn't going to hangout yesterday but then after we left the dining hall Brigitte said she would sign me in and I felt bad asking her to sign me out after she just signed me in. If yall don't wanna hangout with me I won't come around anymore.\" Angela, Randi, &amp; Kasey said we do want to hangout with you we just want you to talk and engage with us instead of sitting there and being a wallflower and something must be wrong with us since you been with us since last semester. I tell them nothing is wrong is them its me and I'll feel like I'm not anyone's friend in the gc and it's my fault bc I don't talk enough but I'm trying more now that I'm in college and I'll still eat with yall and try to more but idk abt hangout rn. About 5 min after I send that message I was walking to class with my I was walking to class with my headphones on and passed Angela. I didn't feel like talking so I didn't say anything. She responds to me in the gc saying I said hi to you and you literally just ignored me. how can we get to know you if when we give you the opportunity and you're not here with us I respond to her and say I didn't see u I had my headphones on and I was going to class. Then Kasey says you did see her. Then a few of the other people in the gc tried to defend me. Today I walk in the dining hall and I see some them sitting together.

I've been having an ongoing issue with two co-workers who have basically just been mean girls since the day I started a couple years ago, and the only thing that I'm guilty of doing is trying to do my job to the fullest, which I know they haven't been a fan of because I draw more attention to our team which means more work might be given to our team and more responsibilities which they don't want. I know they don't want this because they have actually vocalized that to our manager, whenever there's a chance for more opportunities or extra work to be done they both shut the idea down so hard and fast and I'm usually the one who's okay doing the small tasks.\n\nThere's multiple incidents where they have both been unprofessional and have come at me in aggressive ways for various reasons. Every single incident has had another teammate witnessed the whole thing. my manager is aware that there is an ongoing issue and there have been corrective actions taken for one coworker since they have complaints in multiple departments from multiple people.\n\nAnd last Thursday they decided to ambush me in a meeting accusing me of not doing my job or avoiding work and insinuating that I was lying when I tried to tell them what was going on, and I had it, so I talked to my manager and they suggested I go to HR, because if I didn't they were going to report it so I figured well if it's going to happen one way or the other I might as well do it. so I reported this to HR something I have never done before. And I have anxiety through the roof, because I've never gone to HR with a problem before because normally in my other jobs the mean girls are the girls that the managers adore and they see me as the problem.\n\nSo in my head I'm going to lose my job because I'm the problem, when I haven't instigated anything.

    "selftext": "\n\nFor context, I (45F) have rental policies which I'm very particular about. One of these policies is that tenants are prohibited from having any colors in their house except beige, white, and black. Although this might seem strict, I allow tenants to have colorful screens, clothing, and food boxes (albeit in the trash). I also provide storage for food, which is properly colored to fit my needs. I also do check-ins every two months to make sure my terms are followed, and the property is not damaged. Occasionally, they'll be unannounced so there will be no cover-ups.\n\nOne of my tenants (29F), has been renting with me for five years. We went over the lease agreement, and she agreed to my terms. Since then, she has gotten pregnant and birthed a beautiful baby girl named Paisleigh, whom I insisted upon the name for.\n\nIn the present, it's a brisk August morning. As usual, I go to check my property. It is completely in shambles. The decorations, furniture, walls, and all of that were fine, but there was one massive oversight. Toys scattered everywhere. I would be fine if they were correctly colored, but no. These are colorful toys. Dolls, stacking donuts, blocks, wooden cars, rubber ducks. It was such a disgrace to my property, I had to look away. I reminded my tenant that of course, she can have toys in the house, but they must be in accord with the rental policy. She apologizes, and I leave. I thought my warning would be okay.\n\nFast forward to a few months later, I return, again unannounced. Still, she keeps these pigmented, bright toys around. I further warn her, but it's not enough. She insists bright colors are good for development. Later that night, I enter her house using my spare key, silently creeping into her room. The baby is sleeping inside a playpen, so no worries there. I wait to make sure that she's truly sleeping, then I pounce. I acutely latch onto her throat, and she screams. I feel her voice box vibrating through my strangling hands as she tries to scream, but nothing comes out, just sputtering and choking. I keep choking as she thrashes about, until around three minutes later, and I know I'm done. She has no pulse, and her body is as limp as a ragdoll.\n\nI transport her corpse and the sleeping baby into the car, driving to a beachside town to dump the body. I drive back to my house, and I don't know what to do with the baby, so I decide to barbeque her. As she sleeps, I preheat the grill, lighting it ablaze, and then after about 14 minutes, I set her on the cooking rack. Soon I can hear wailing from under the hood of the grill, before she could gasp for air anymore. It's terrible and loud, but eventually, with the smell of charred meat, it ceases. I drive to a nearby college town to dump the second body.\n\n\n",

    "selftext": " To preface I am in college now and this was almost 3 years ago. Okay so I (F 20) had a big group of friends in high school. We all got really close senior year and there were a lot of characters so I will be using fake names. It was around prom season this whole thing started. There was a boy I was talking to and he wasn\u2019t super favored by alot of people but everyone talked to him because he was like a class clown. We\u2019ll call him Jacob. Jacob had originally planned of going to prom with a girl Tess. Tess never wanted to go with him so when he met me and we started talking he told her that they shouldn\u2019t go together because it would have been boring because she didn\u2019t even want to go with him. This was wrong I know and should\u2019ve told me something because me and Jacob went on to date and he was actually insane. \n\nAnyways this caused a big drama and caused Tess and her close friends to hate me. Tess\u2019s friends were friends with some of my friends and my friends began to act weird to me. Not talking to me all that often but that was fine because I still had my core friends. My core friends being Sasha, Kylie, and Khloe. I ended up having a falling out with Kylie and Khloe too due to all of our other friends deciding to hate me for dating Jacob but that\u2019s besides the point. \n\nJump to prom and all of the weird behavior continued and I had to go on a party bus with all the people who I know knew were talking shit about me. I ended up leaving with Sasha and Khloe because I couldn\u2019t stand to be on the bus and we met up with Jacob. Prom ended so odd and it was clear no one wanted to talk to me because I was with Jacob. \n\nFast forward to the summer after prom. One of the boys who was in my old friend group posted something on his spam story on Instagram with a video from the party bus from prom, \u201c Missing prom. Don\u2019t see any \u2018dirty looks\u2019 but I digress\u201d. This was a direct dig at me because I had told Khloe that whole group had been giving me and Sasha dirty looks on the bus.  Me and Khloe had already fallen out by this time . (Sorry for all the jumping around Im just trying to give context). So I tell Jacob who I\u2019m already dating by this point that he had posted something so Jacob decides to post on his story a picture from prom captioned \u201cI loved prom but definitely not those dirty looks\ud83d\ude0d\u201d. This starts a war in instagram notes of all places. We\u2019ll call the boy who posted Joey. Joey begins posting in his instagram notes saying how me and Jacob are so mad and then begins and argument with Jacob on instagram notes. I was mortified because really? Instagram notes? \n\nBut anyways they go back and forth with petty comments to each other but I stay out of it. This goes on for probably 20 minutes. Then joey decides to personally attack me and posts \u201cLetting him hit in 3 weeks? Not very disney of you\u201d And he always used to say I could be an actor on Disney channel so I knew this particular comment was for me. I start crying because now personal information is being shared. Oh and every person I used to be friends with was egging him on in their instagram notes. I want to be clear that other than going to prom with Jacob I had never said or done anything to any of the people that were mad at me and posting about me. Joey keeps going and decides to post about things I only told Khloe and Kylie. About my personal sex life with Jacob. Joey posts that on instagram notes and I freak out because now everyone is looking at this and most people know it\u2019s about me. \n\nThat\u2019s when I start getting texts from fake numbers. Slut shaming me, calling me ugly, threatening me and telling me to respond. I couldn\u2019t deal with it. It all ended 20 or so minutes later but I was like wtf. I don\u2019t talk to any of these people anymore other than Sasha. Jacob ended up being a maniac so we broke up. Anyways this all happened almost 3 years ago I guess I just wanted to see what people would say and if going to prom with Jacob made me deserve all this?",

They took classes in their senior year to create a decent portfolio, and that\u2019s all. All they did was tracing shitty Pinterest drawings before that.

    "selftext": "Well when i was under the age of 6 i had 5 siblings. The two came after I turned 10. I didn't play with them at all because by the time the last two were of playing age I was already a teen. \n\nBut my mom always made sure that we behaved in public. Whether it would be by her pulling us to the side by the ear and threatening an ass whooping or to leave us at home, it worked. We would walk single file behind her, sit at restaurant tables and chat quietly with each other, never raising our voices. We ended up homeless for a year or two when i was young, so we were put in one small room. We were made to clean the house and learn chores so we could help the people we were staying with. \n\nWhen my mom was able to find a house, she said it was always hard because renters always thought that many kids wouldn't be worth a tenant. So anytime we moved we would clean the house spotless. We moved a lot. We also would clean spotless whenever the land lord was visiting. \n\nMy mom knew how it looked to have so many kids behind her, especially when her husband wasn't around because of work so it was only him. She thought people saw her as a poor, ghetto woman with an army of kids who she couldn't control so she made damn sure we wouldn't be like that. \n\nBut like why have that many kids in the first place.... or continue having them even after experiencing homelessness? We were back and forth between many of friends and family after my parents divorced. And we moved 13 times before I was in high school. Yet she still had kids but that's another topic for another day.... \n\nThat basically taught all of us to keep up with appearances. My mom was also incredibly mentally, physically and emotionally abusive so there was always fear in my house. It was my siblings and I against her, so we were all close and together. \n\nBut then we started to turn on each other as we got older, probably from my older siblings maturing and growing bitter and angry at the abuse. I'm going through that phase now. \n\nEither way it led me to become emotionally detached from my siblings. There was always just so many things going on, it was hard to keep up. \n\nOnce my older siblings moved out I was the oldest in the house and it became my responsibility to cook and clean for everyone. I got tired of it and moved out a month after graduating. \n\nI got sick of taking care of others when I was a child, so I just left. Another step i took to separate myself from my family. \n\nSure, having big families are fun. It's never quiet, immediate family reunions are crazy and loud (my mom also had 7 siblings so imagine how big they got), you get to grow up with multiple best friends, but when you have an emotionally and mentally unstable mother with an enabler husband, it's terrible. Never a peaceful moment, especially not with the homelessness or having to share rooms with siblings when we got our own houses, constant arguments because nobody knew how to regulate themselves and constant abuse. \n\nIt drove my older sister insane. I haven't seen her in years. It's driving me insane now. \n\nI never had room to be myself, not until after i turned 18. I never got to properly develop so now I have mental issues. And chronic illnesses. \n\nGrowing up with 7 siblings was hard. My mom's attention was only focused on the younger one. Yeah, we would have fun times and a lot of them but that doesn't overshadow the abuse or anything else.\n\nI always get jealous of people who are close to their siblings. I can never have that, not anymore. I can barely form and maintain friendships, much less familial relationships. \n\nNot to mention how people react whenever i tell them how many siblings I have. I've had to fight  few people who talked crap about my mom being a whore. My siblings have had to fight other kids for the same thing. Nothing says bonding time more than beating the kid who made fun of your younger sibling. Classy? No. Fun? Yes. ",

    "selftext": "My (30f) ex (33m)  is dating a neighbour in my building. We broke up about 8 months ago. We were together 3.5 years. Throughout the course of our relationship there were definitely issues. We lived together for two years and after the break up we still lived together for a month and a half as we had to sell our house. What's wild is we talked about getting married two months before we broke up and he was 100% on board. We broke up over a really intense fight where he blamed me for something he lost. It's a long story, but we fought for 3 days, decided to take a break for a week to think about what we wanted to do about this. He decided to end the relationship.\n\nLiving together still was hell. He was awful. He threatened to throw my stuff away because he thought I was dating. I found out he made two catfishing dating profiles right after we broke up which he later matched with me on and then would block me. I found out from a close friend of his what he was doing. Curiousity got the better of me. I made a real profile of myself to see if it was true. He swiped on me, blocked me, and remade those profiles a few times. He called me dumb each time I disagreed with him with things concerning selling our house. He skipped out on the last mortgage payment. He also refused to help prepare the house for sale. I did everything on my own. Meanwhile he still ate my food, kept walking in on me while I was changing (the door didn\u2019t lock), and would sometimes pressure me to still sleep in our bed because as he put it: \u201cwe slept together for almost 4 years, what\u2019s a few more nights.\u201d He also got me an insanely expensive birthday gift and wrote me in as a plus one to a wedding both after we broke up. For weeks after he moved out, he kept trying to sleep at our old house for a whole week. I put my foot down here and told him I needed space. \n\nI tried to be respectful as possible from the start to honor his wishes. I didn\u2019t want to be with someone who didn\u2019t want to be with me. Besides one conversation about our relationship after we broke up a few weeks in, I left him alone. I only talked about the house or things we had to communicate about. I tried setting some boundaries, but after he called me dumb, I gave up and bit my tongue through it until he moved out. \n\nHe always knew where I was moving to, it was also in our documents for the notary. I told him when I found a place which street and he mentioned the building. Since I moved in, I swore I saw him often driving by. I knew he bought a car (that also looks incredibly similar to mine). I also was pretty sure I saw his bike parked outside my building a few times. I heard from a cousin who followed him on Strava that he also ran close to my place or in my street multiple times a week for months. Then there was when I had a dating profile, I saw he was on there for real as himself and it kept saying he was 650 feet away and sometimes 1 mile away. I'd sometimes block him and then he'd have a brand new dating profile again showing the same sometimes. Each time I deleted him, for months he popped back up. It was triggering me so much. I did delete all dating apps two months ago. I had a stalker (different guy) for five years with court dates and all. This same ex helped me through this. He was so empathetic about everything I went through with having a stalker. And here my ex is, also invading my space. In a different way, sure. \n\nNow last Saturday I saw him help a girl move a piano in. He was in the entry way of my building. I felt my heart race and my anxiety spike. There was another guy there so I was hoping that maybe this guy was her boyfriend and he was just friends with them. Then this morning, as I was returning from walking what used to be our dog (now just mine), he walked out of the elevator freshly showered. He smugly greeted me as if I was an old acquittance.  As I looked out the window of the elevator, I saw he used a key to the building. That made me feel a bit uncomfortable too. I was now even more suspicious and panicking. I texted a mutual friend. I don't care that he's dating. If I saw him in the city on a date, I probably wouldn\u2019t react much. I do care that he's in my space. The mutual friend confirmed he's seeing someone and told me her name. We have a group chat with everyone that lives in the building and low and behold there she was.\n\nJust...what the fuck. Who does this? He knew when he probably first went to her place that I live here too. And when I guess things got more serious, he also knew. What's worse is that that friend told me a friend of ours set them up who also knew exactly where I moved to. If I was dating someone and I found out they lived in his building, I\u2019d either stop seeing that guy, I would send a courtesy text, or I\u2019d at least ask the person I\u2019m seeing if we could primarily hang out in my building. \n\nI feel he could have at the very least sent a message. I thought I was being paranoid for months thinking I saw signs of him being in my space. Now I hate the fact that I may run into him this often, but I would have much rather known he\u2019s dating someone than think he was stalking me. I also was just moving on with my life. Seeing him is still a bit upsetting. It's one thing if this was years later, but it's only been 8 months.\n\nAll of the things he's done since\u2026It's so unbelievably cruel. I am so angry. I haven't messaged him because I don't think he'd respect my boundaries. I just want to move on. I deserve that. I don't deserve this.\n\nI've come to the conclusion that he should be the one who feels uncomfortable seeing me. Not the other way around. I shouldn't have to feel uncomfortable in my own space.\n\nSorry for the cursing, but what a motherfucking asshole. Never called an ex that, but he absolutely deserves the title.\n\nJust needed some other people to know about this jerk.",

Now I am married with a son and another one along the way. Anyways, there have been three situations where I asked her to come and stay with us for a bit. We initially both stayed in the same city but now are 2 hour flight away.\n\n1) First, my husband had a work trip in Oct last year. The morning sickness was at its peak at 3 months. And I just wanted someone around incase there is a medical emergency for 3-4 days. We have a nanny to help with my son for most of the day. So all she had to do was just be around. She refused saying she has a neighbour\u2019s birthday party to attend. I let it go.\n\n2) Last month, I called her and asked her if \nshe can be with my son for 3-4 days when I will be in the hospital around my due date. Again the nanny is there. She just has to manage the night when he is sleeping. She refused saying she can\u2019t leave my dad alone during easter time and needs to cook for him. My dad is a perfectly abled man who can cook his own food.\n\n3) Yesterday, my husband\u2019s side of the family had an emergency situation and my husband had to leave for his parent\u2019s place for 3-4 days. This time I was sure I will not ask my mom to come down again. But my husband called my mom and literally begged her to come down as he didn\u2019t want to leave me alone with my son at this juncture. Her cold response was that she has to be with my dad and cook for him etc. She asked us to keep the nanny to stay over for a couple of days. I fully support my husband\u2019s decision to be with his parents at this time for reasons I can\u2019t divulge. \n\nAfter yesterday, I lost it with her. I told her that she wont hear from me again and she is a sad excuse for a mom who can\u2019t even be with her daughter when there can be a medical emergency. And in case I die she need not come either. So she blamed me for moving cities without considering all this. And that my dad has slogged all his life to educate us etc. how can I think she can leave him and rush to me. For context, I moved cities because I got a better job that pays her bills to a certain extent and gives me some semblance of work life balance. As for my dad, he is not a baby.\nWhat kind of mother would want to miss the birth of her grandchild or not want to be with her daughter when she is almost due",

Even in its most ordinary forms, sex is still pretty great, and people still get something out of it. Otherwise, why would so many pursue it despite its imperfections?  \n\nIt\u2019s frustrating to watch others freely explore, make mistakes, regret, have intimate conversations, go on dates, or even just buy condoms \u201cjust in case\u201d\u2014gaining experience all the while. People say, \u201cOh, but sometimes sex can be bad!\u201d But many of us haven\u2019t even had the chance to have sex at all, good or bad. That\u2019s the frustration. \n\nTo all the virgins who want to claim it\u2019s unimportant to them: I\u2019m glad it isn\u2019t for you. Maybe you have low libido, or dating isn\u2019t your focus\u2014that\u2019s valid, and I\u2019m happy for you. But just because you\u2019re a virgin and don\u2019t care doesn\u2019t mean I have to feel the same.  \n\nTo the fatalists: Stop projecting worst-case scenarios and using your bad experiences to dissuade others. Using your story as a universal warning against sex is like telling no one to drive because you had an accident. Yes, sex can get complicated, like anything human, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should avoid it by default or assume the worst.  \n\nAnd stop recommending prostitutes. First, it\u2019s not legal where I live. Second, sex workers might satisfy curiosity about the act, but they can\u2019t replicate the intimacy of someone choosing you.  \n\nTo everyone who says sex isn\u2019t important: Would you trade places? Would you spend the rest of your life without sex, without being touched, without anyone calling you attractive? If it\u2019s so \u201coverrated,\u201d why not? Would you stay in a relationship with a partner who never touches you, has sex with you, or makes sexual comments? If it\u2019s truly irrelevant, this shouldn\u2019t bother you. After all, if you tell me to \u201cjust focus on hobbies and friends,\u201d you should be able to do the same to prove your point.\n\nAnd don\u2019t hit me with, \u201cWho says sex is overrated? No one says that!\u201d I\u2019m tired of hearing it in every post I make, or in others\u2019 posts people claiming it\u2019s \u201cnot a big deal,\u201d \u201coverrated,\u201d or \u201cno different from masturbation.\u201d It\u2019s a lie they don\u2019t even believe themselves. They trot it out to comfort virgins, but in the real world, look how much energy, money, and drama people invest in sex. If it were \u201cnothing,\u201d why does it drive so much behavior? Sex isn\u2019t everything, but it\u2019s not \u201cnothing\u201d either.  \n\nIf sex is \u201coverrated,\u201d why don\u2019t you stop seeking it? Why not live as if it doesn\u2019t exist? Until then, your indifference just sounds like privilege disguised as wisdom.",
