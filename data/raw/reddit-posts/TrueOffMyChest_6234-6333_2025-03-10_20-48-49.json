    "selftext": "When I was 17(F), I met someone. A woman. Online. I never met her in real life, even years later. We only spoke on the phone once for an hour (years later). It was basically a purely texting relationship. \n\nIt was a blogging site, one of those where you just wrote an online diary, basically. We hit it off as conversation partners, but it wasn\u2019t more than that for around a year. We didn\u2019t even talk that often, but when we did it was magical. She was much older than me, and I knew it from the beginning. She was 31 when we met. It was weird for me to talk to someone older, but it just worked, and I didn\u2019t think about it much, so I rolled with it. We talked almost exclusively about a shared hobby. \n\nA year later I was having a complete breakdown. It was my first major mental health breakdown. I think I was just lost in transitioning from school life to college life. I suffered alone for a year (I didn\u2019t really have a support system), and after that, I decided to open up about it in my online diary. I didn\u2019t know what I expected, if I expected anyone to care. But she suddenly supported me. She talked to me a lot. She said she had been through the same things, so she understood what I was feeling. And that\u2019s how it started: she explained to me A LOT about how mental health works. When I was a teenager, I didn\u2019t \u201cbelieve in mental health\u201d. Till it bit me in the ass: I mean, I had this major breakdown, and suddenly, my \u201cnonexistent\u201d mental health incapacitated me. I had severe fatigue, panic attacks, even diarrhea. So, the woman basically taught me some basic concepts, explained some basic things to me. I started to read up on therapy, psychology, we\u2019d discuss issues. \n\nIt was also magical: she just got me. I\u2019d never had the privilege of having anyone in my life who understood me, gave me a manual to myself. I internalized my family\u2019s approach of \u2018you\u2019re just a lost cause hysterical little shit, and there\u2019s nothing left to do with you but ignore you when you get difficult\u2019. And with her, I suddenly understood that I wasn\u2019t hysterical. That my feelings had a cause. That I could actually fulfill my needs, and there would be no breakdown. So, she taught me how to relate to myself in a healthier way, how to be on my side, always. And the best part? She never actually lectured me on anything, never made me do anything, never got mad at me for not trying anything. And she was always respectful to me despite the age difference. She never played the \u2018I\u2019m older and I know better\u2019 card, even though she was definitely older and knew better. She just explained how things work (for her, and how she thought it worked for me, too because we\u2019re so similar), and I could take it or leave it. She just treated me the way that I understood how to treat myself. Like, she\u2019d do or tell me things that\u2019d calm me down, or help me get out of despair, or a panic attack, and I made a mental note \u2018oh, that\u2019s what I need when I\u2019m having a panic attack. Yes, this works for me when I\u2019m overwhelmed. Ok, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll ask for when I need support next time\u2019. \n\nI think I was going through this very major and life-changing breakdown for about a year. My health was never the same after that (still isn\u2019t, 13 years later), but I was slowly learning to live with this new version of myself. I felt more stable, but I still needed a lot of support. And she was there. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be alive or (relatively) sane right now if it wasn\u2019t for her during that first year, if it wasn\u2019t for her guidance and gentleness. I really had no one, especially no one who understood me like she did. She\u2019s the one who made me try therapy. Not by talking about it (she never went to therapy herself), but a couple of months after we started talking about my mental health, I was reading some posts about therapy, and understood that what I felt with her, I could find in therapy. And I got really interested in it: with her, I couldn\u2019t ask for more or for a more stable presence. With a therapist, I could get that presence for an hour a week on a regular basis. Well, I never found that therapist with whom I had this magic. Never found anyone even remotely not hurtful, actually (I have a bad trauma from therapy by now, tried 20 therapists). The woman was really the only person in the world who got me to relax and listen to her without fighting and rejecting right away. Others would just trigger me hard, trigger a defensive response and then hurt me when I couldn\u2019t accept what they were saying, even though I was fighting myself hard not to push them away. With her, it felt like she was going through the minefield of my psyche, knowing exactly where to go and where not to go and how to neutralize at least some of the mines without setting an explosion off. And the most awesome effect was that the neutralization usually had ripple effect: she\u2019d make one small thing feel slightly better, and I could feel the chain reaction of things correcting themselves months later, things that were unrelated to the first conversation.  \n\nIt went on for years. I mean, she wasn\u2019t my therapist, but\u2026 We talked about our lives, hobbies, mental health. It was always the older-younger dynamics, but not in a bad patronizing way: she\u2019d just explain things, but she never pushed. She never said that because I\u2019m younger I don\u2019t get to have a different opinion. Never laughed at me. Never tried to make me respect her. She didn\u2019t need to: I\u2019ve never respected anyone like this in my life. She doesn\u2019t have a conventional successful life: never married, never moved out of her family\u2019s apartment, she didn\u2019t even work most of her thirties (for reasons I didn\u2019t fully understand but never pushed her to share). But I respected her more than anyone who had all those. She was very smart, driven, understood things deeply, always treated people with respect, everyone, she had this quality of attracting people to her, like, she didn\u2019t wait for anyone to start talking to her (like I did), if she saw someone she found interesting, she\u2019d just initiate. And she treated vulnerability with care. Doesn\u2019t matter what happened between us, doesn\u2019t matter if I hurt her (unintentionally. I\u2019d never do anything bad to her intentionally), doesn\u2019t matter what was happening \u2014 she never used any one of my open wounds, never chose to set any of the mines just to hurt me back. And she could do it at any moment. She spoke my language, she knew how to put things exactly in a way that her words would have the most effect, so she could destroy me. She never ever even tried in all those years. Not even when the relationship went sour and she was annoyed with me for years. She\u2019d snap at the small things (once she started aggressively attacking me in a discussion about Harry Potter\u2026 Not me\u2014my thought process. That\u2019s when I knew it wasn\u2019t just a rough patch but truly over), but she never went for my traumas. Not even when she didn\u2019t enjoy me anymore. \n\nAs I said, the way she treated me had a ripple effect, fixing things without her even trying. Through the years, the way she treated me, talked to me, I developed that inner compass as I call it: basically, this feeling that in my life, I\u2019m the one who always knows best. Even if I make mistakes, I\u2019m still the one who knows best, and I\u2019ll course correct if I make a mistake. I don\u2019t mean that I feel that I\u2019m always right about everything \u2014 just in my life, in things that concern me. It was very different from what my family told me: you\u2019re incapable of anything, you should listen to us, you don\u2019t have a brain. That inner compass made me finally start living my life. Not what my family thought was best \u2014 what I felt like doing. And the most beautiful part of it was that these things were not what the woman wanted either. They were truly mine. I moved to another country \u2014 something I always wanted. She clearly couldn\u2019t understand my decision, but that didn\u2019t matter. It was mine. I started speaking another language (English) more because that\u2019s what I always wanted, and she couldn\u2019t understand it either. And it didn\u2019t matter. I knew what I wanted. And a thousand choices like that that she watched me make and kept her mouth shut enough. Because of this inner compass, I feel like there will always be a part of her in me, wherever I go. \n\nAs I\u2019ve said, the relationship went sour. With years, I understood that this dynamics of her keeping me at arm\u2019s length (I never knew much about her, her struggles, she never let me support her) doesn\u2019t work for me anymore. And I wanted to actually talk on the phone, actually meet her. All I could get out of her was one phone call, and after that she was always \u201cnot in a good place\u201d for a call. I finally was brave enough to admit to myself that I wanted more of her (and that I\u2019m an equal in this relationship and an adult, too, so I have the right to pursue it), and wanted to have a relationship. She was vague about it. And then her reaction made me not sure about it, too. At some point she did try to rely on me more, and I didn\u2019t get it, I guess, and it hurt her immensely (and when I understood that I hurt her, it was hard to forgive myself: she was someone I NEVER wanted to hurt. Not for any reason). And then we talked about everything \u2014 the dynamics, my feelings, our wants and desires \u2014 and just like that it was over, slowly, quietly, not really too painfully (and immensely painfully for me at the same time, but, I mean, she didn\u2019t really hurt my feelings. I was just hurting because it ended). It was 7 years after we started talking. \n\nBut I could never forget her. I\u2019d text her sometimes, just to know how she is. Nothing too personal \u2014 just to know if she was ok. She\u2019d get annoyed at me for that. I couldn\u2019t really understand why\u2026 She\u2019d say something about me \u201ctrying to be a people-pleaser and showing that I still care when I don\u2019t\u201d. At some point, I asked her if I should stop texting her because I clearly annoy her. She said yes. I tried. I tried for two years. And then I texted her again and said that I\u2019m not a child anymore (I was 28 at the time), and I don\u2019t want to live in a world where we don\u2019t talk. We didn\u2019t have to be best friends, but I was certain we had to talk. Sometimes. About anything. At some point. And she agreed. It was weird, and I was the one texting her mostly. And then it fizzled out. \n\nI never talked to her about it. There was nothing left to talk about, nothing left to say. But I still think about her when something good happens in my life. When something bad happens, and I handle it like a capable adult without falling apart. When I manage to choose myself instead of caving in. \n\nYesterday was one of those days I couldn\u2019t keep it in (the last one was a year ago, and she did acknowledge it, even if briefly). I texted: \u201cHey, it\u2019s one of those days when I can\u2019t help it but want to wish you the best. So, here I am, wishing you the best. You\u2019re incredible, and I feel so lucky to happen to live on this Earth when you exist\u201d. She read it immediately, and\u2026 left me on read. I\u2019m not sure why. She used to tell me that she doesn\u2019t know what to say when people tell her good things, and she used to do it with me, too. But she usually acknowledged it. Now she didn\u2019t. Did she think I was weird for texting it? Did I make it awkward? Was it too much? I guess I\u2019ll never know. But ChatGPT told me to try and write it in a journal, so, here I am, on this sub, trying not to bother the most magical connection of my life with my gratitude. \n\nI\u2019ve been in love; I have parents; siblings (well, cousins); I\u2019ve had best friends. And this connection was everything in one: an older sibling who\u2019s almost like a parent who\u2019s also my best friend and with whom I\u2019m absolutely in love. She was my first adult love: the love when you don\u2019t just fall for someone because you think they\u2019re perfect, but the love when the more you see the imperfections, the more you respect and love the person. You understand how difficult their life is, and respect how beautifully they\u2019re fighting and what a strong and capable person they are despite all their limitations. \n\nMy life (and mental health) are in no way perfect. I\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes, some of which I won\u2019t ever be able to fully correct. But the peaceful moments that I have, the good things, the authentic parts of my life, the parts where I feel like I\u2019m living my life and not someone else\u2019s, I owe to her. ",

    "selftext": "The one person who was always there for me was a girl i had fallen for. She was the first one in years that made me actually feel this way about someone. She was loving caring and amazing and she would drop everything for me. If texted her she was there but today she was distant. And i know why. She told me she didn't have the same feelings and i know that and i have to be okay with that and I'm trying to. But it's really difficult to. She started talking to this new guy and I'm pretty sure they went out today because she looked so nice in the one snap i got from her. It was her going out look. And the only time she doesn't instantly respond to me is when she's out with someone like that. If it's one of her girlfriends she's normally really quick and talkitive with me still. And it sucks. It really hurts and she called today to say she had a birthday gift for me which is nice because i don't really celebrate my birthday i don't like making a day about me but it's such a kind gesture. And i could tell she was really happy in her voice. And she said she had a good day and wouldn't tell me why which means it's probably the guy. And it's not like she's hiding that fact i asked her not to tell me about him and those experiences because it made me feel bad and insecure but honestly i don't know if hurts worse not being told but it still feels bad. Anyways I'm really lonely feeling right now and just wanted a connection from someone and nobody is there to answer me it seems. All the people who i used to be able to pick up and talk to whenever whenever don't respond to me anymore and when i reach out in a time like this just to feel a small connection nobody is there. And i feel so alone and I've never felt this way. I've always been happy alone but it's so different this time and i don't like it. It's been a couple nights I've felt like this but this just feels so bad in an empty way. ",

In a way this more just confirmed that he has cheated. I\u2019ve also always been a sneaky person, when i was younger i would always listen through the doors and behind walls whenever my parents would fight, just so i can know everything and see how transparent they\u2019d actually be with me. I\u2019ve just always been nosy. A while back I was maybe 13 or 14, me and my family decided to upgrade all of our phones. When each of us transferred all of our information to our new devices some of the applications pop up. And at 13 i was the most chronically online emo loser who grew up in the 2000-2010s era so i recognize a grindr logo when i see one. That day my dad did look a bit like he knew that i saw but he probably thought i didn\u2019t know what it was he had on his phone. I just told myself maybe i thought i had seen that logo, and left it alone, until now. Tonight after my nightly routine i forgot my hair ties in my parents room so i decided to sneak in there while my dad was asleep, and his phone was unlocked with a chat opened. Like i said\u2026.im nosy. I didn\u2019t see anything but i 100% knew it was grinder because i saw the logo. I did take a photo while his phone was open too , i dont know why but something was telling me to! I also wasn\u2019t sure if this was something my mother knew of and just never said anything. Just because i feel like it\u2019s her natural response to something like that. I love my dad, he\u2019s still a father to me and my siblings, and he works hard.

Nor they found what I had (I had like deep tests, including bloods and cameras in my stomach).\nIt caused a depression (or the depression caused it? Who knows?).

I finally recovered after like 8 months in hell. I was able later to enjoy my life.\n\nNow, as I am about to do something thrilling in my life for a few months, symptoms are back. It's been one month. I'm unable to eat, and I want to puke like a lot (like I have no appetite at all, I have dark thoughts, eructations...) Don't know why, might be after a COVID infection I had (but like I've had 6 of them till 2020 so I don't know). Or a changing environment. I left my city.\nIt's bad, but that time I got antidepressants quick, whereby I hope my symptoms will get better. I searched on the Internet, might be dyspexia. \n\nSi if anyone is experiencing something similar (or generally troubles with their intestines yk), you're not alone. We are a lot struggling with a society that does not understand us. I always had the feeling that, for people, when you don't have something killing you like cancer, it's no big deal you are overreacting and complaining for nothing.\nCancer is terrible, worse for most of them, but our troubles count. Especially when you can't enjoy a meal, a party, or just hanging out with friends because of that.\n\nGotta wait one week for the effects of my antidepressants, we'll see. The only good thing is that it disappeared one time, so it can disappear again.\n\nBless you guys, ",

    "selftext": "Just here to vent. \n\nI (29m) have never had any real friends. I've always just had people that I know. Now, I'm at the point where I realize that I don't have anyone at all. I thought that I had friends at various points in my life, but they never stuck around for one reason or another. They were only \"friends\" with me out of convenience, meaning that they didn't have any of their actual friends around and buddied up to me to pass the time. Then there were those who were only \"friends\" with me to get what they wanted out of me before ghosting me or flipping out when I stopped providing what they wanted and ditched me. Those \"friends\" who wanted rides or money or favors that monopolized my time and resources to the point where trying to tell them that they were asking too much of me made them lash out. Those \"friends\" who wanted everything from me, from a listening ear to a walking atm, but who wouldn't do nearly the same thing for me. Those \"friends\" were some of the worst, but, honestly, the worst ones were those who tried to buddy up to me because they \"felt bad that I was all by myself\" because friendships built out of pity have the least amount of respect for the one being pitied. \n\nHonestly, I'm tired of it. I'm tired of feeling and being alone in crowded rooms. I'm tired of not having anyone around who cares about me and actually wants me around. I'm tired of being made to feel like it's a chore for others to talk to me. I'm tired of caring more about others than they do for me. I'm tired of being so lonely. \n\nI haven't had any real social connections in years and it's, obviously, starting to get to me. I just want to have people to talk to about random, every day crap. Or, better yet, I want to have people to have serious conversations with about the universe and life or whatever over a bonfire or in a random spot in the middle of the desert on a clear, star filled night. I want to have people who don't look at me funny when I say we should go on a random adventure to a museum that I think looks cool or some gimmicky attraction that I found that looks like it would be fun. I like gimmicks and museums and want people around who aren't going to call me weird for liking them and wanting to go experience them. I want someone to go fishing with who isn't going to say they're bored every five minutes or tell me we should just go to a bar because \"it's the same thing.\" It's not the same thing and I don't drink. I just want to have people around who take as much interest in me as I do in them without calling me or my interests weird or creepy or boring or lame. \n\nI want to go to museums and attractions with people. I want to go on random adventures to random places; maybe go randonauting or urban exploring- there's plenty of places to see. I want to go fishing with people. I want to watch football and baseball with people; maybe even go to a local game together. I want to have people who'll play basketball or badminton or Pok\u00e9mon Go with me. I want to go bowling and to the arcade and to the put-put spot with people. I want to play billiards with someone who isn't going to call me creepy for loving to play it. I want to drive around aimlessly listening to true crime podcasts or creepypastas (Creepsmcpasta specifically) or just with people who'll share music with me and not call my taste in music weird or old-fashioned. I want to go have lunch in my car in the Sonic stalls with someone (don't know why, it just sounds like it'd be fun). And on that note, I want to have someone who's willing to go try new food places with me. I want to have someone to talk to about anything and everything. I want to be able to talk to someone about who's the best Robin or how Anissa is the worst character in Invincible (even worse than Immortal). I want to have someone to talk to about some random occult things that I read about or saw on the internet. I think it'd be kinda fun to pull out the Ouija board or some tarot cards or something. I want someone to share random fun facts with me as much as I like to share with them. I want to be tagged in random posts on social media or actually have someone acknowledge that we did something together or, better yet, have people who'll want to take pictures with me without telling me that I ruined the picture by smiling weird or just telling me that they don't like taking pictures with me. I want to have a barbeque by the pool in the summer; maybe throw a football around in the street. Or maybe have some random potluck and I'll make some Currywurst for people to try. I want people to teach me some of the languages that they speak or maybe want to learn one with me or I'll teach them some German. \n\nHonestly, as long as I had someone around who would share with me what I share with them, then that would be enough. Looking back on what I've already written, none of that would actually matter in comparison to just knowing that I had a friend. But, writing this all out and venting just makes me feel pathetic. It makes me feel even worse than having my family question me when I go out because I don't have friends so why am I out. That hurts on it's own, but the vibe of desperation that this seems like feels worse than that. I don't know. I've gotten this far, but it feels like none of it even matters and there's no point regardless. I'm just that person who doesn't have friends and it's just one of those things that needs to be accepted even though it hurts. It is what it is. It's really not like it matters anyway because if the rest of this year plays out how I'm expecting it to, I won't be here by this time next year anyway, so that just makes it easier, I guess. So, why not vent and ruminate for a while and see how I feel later on? Maybe things will be different and I'll feel differently. Plus, thinking about everything makes me think that I'm just better off alone regardless, but, even then, it doesn't make the pain of that loneliness go away, so at least having some type of outlet helps in it's own way. It's better than nothing and just keeping all of this bottled up at least. ",

And im not going to get her to do something shes not comfortable with or doesnt want to do. We also spoke about how id like to see more effort and enthusiasm during sex from her as i felt a bit like my pleasure wasnt that important which isnt a great feeling let me tell you, and she hasnt really put any more effort into it minus the absolute bare minimum.\n\nIf im completely honest, im terrified. Im scared of what the future will be, scared that I wont find someone else, scared about hurting her which is the last thing I want to do is hurt her but I also need to take care of my own happiness. This is my first proper relationship and girlfriend, I've never had to break up with someone and im so scared.\n\nMy minds still a bit mad trying to process my decision so sorry if this doesnt read very well.\n\nEdit: more things to get off my chest jesus sorry. \nI do still love her, and this yoyo effect I'm feeling of wanting to break up then doubting has made me feel so numb scared and empty I feel so lost.

    "selftext": "TLDR; I am a sex worker and I let a client get too obsessed. He threatened suicide when I ended things with him and I went to the police on the off chance he was serious. It turned out to just be another ploy to try and get me to talk to him. \n\nLet's preface this with I am an independent sex worker. I do in person sex work by the hour and it's my job because I enjoy it and it gives me a lot of financial security.\n\nMy best friend, \"Celia\", also does sex work and we share notes about the job, and even have the same clients on occasion. \n\nShe met \"John\" first. John is an obese 300lb man, early 30s, and a high maintenance client. He was very recently divorced because he cheated on his high school sweetheart wife with another friend from high school. He left his wife, only to have his new girlfriend leave him about a month later for another man. Why did he cheat on his wife? Because she had \"gained so much weight that he no longer found her attractive\" (I saw photos of her, she was barely overweight. He on the other hand nearly doubled his weight since they got married). \n\nJohn is a home inspector for an insurance company. He makes good money by inspecting a high volume of homes, but part of the job is using all the data collected to write personalized reports on each home inspection. When John was married, his wife did the reports for him (this was illegal because the information is supposed to be confidential, but he was able to get away with it because they lived together and she used his work PC to help him out).\n\nSo he left his wife, then his girlfriend of two months left him. He was desperate to get her back any which way, and knew she needed money, so he offered to pay her to do the reports for him (which worked out because his wife was no longer willing to do them). He figured out a way to log into his work from her PC, trained her up, and used his position as her boss to make her spend as much time with him as possible so he could potentially win her back (he would only ever pay her in person, for example, and coerce her into spending hours with him before he paid her the money). This isn't important to the story, it just gives background information on his history of inappropriate relationships and manipulating women. \n\nIn the meantime, he started seeing escorts to fill the sexual void. Eventually he met Celia and very quickly fell into limerance. For the first time since his ex girlfriend left him, John had a new woman to obsess over. He shared his whole life story with Celia, texted her all the time, and visited her more often than he could afford. She found him exhausting to see (he had strangled dick syndrome from a porn addiction, and struggled to get off, but would urge her to keep trying). He talked constantly about himself, overshared about his childhood trauma, and would stay longer than he paid for, forcing her to have to kick him out each time. She set boundaries about him texting her so much and taking so much of her emotional energy, but he kept breaking them. \n\nSo she enlisted my help. I have a few more years experience under my belt, and felt confident that I could handle his neediness. After she talked me up, he agreed to meet me. \n\nThe appointment was a success. I was able to work around his strangled dick problem and he began to see us both regularly. But it became obvious that he was obsessive and inappropriate. He talked about Celia non-stop and shared personal details about their time together with me. He also shared private details about his ex-wife and ex-girlfriend. \n\nWhen he saw Celia, he talked about me and overshared in a similar way.  It made her very uncomfortable and she set boundaries around it. He didn't abide by the boundaries, so she fired him. \n\nHe was devastated... But I was able to distract him and help him process the heartbreak. He felt betrayed by her, because she treated him as a client and he felt like he deserved better treatment. I gently defended her actions, but not so much that it would offend him.\n\nBy this point I was earning steady money seeing him, so I didn't want to risk jeopardizing that cash flow. \n\nI could see that he needed the full girlfriend experience, so I gave it to him. He was very insecure so I often needed to reassure him that he could count on me, that I would be a stable person in his life, so long as he kept paying my rates for time together. I allowed him to take me to dinner off the clock occasionally, and texted him back on occasion (I didn't get triggered by his incessant texting in the same way as Celia).\n\nIt worked out pretty decently for a few months. I felt like I was meeting his needs, and he seemed happier and more stable. Unfortunately, my carefully set boundaries started to erode. He didn't see me as an escort anymore, he saw me as a sugar baby... Then as a girlfriend. He told me he loved me. Often. He started celebrating \"anniversaries\" for us and booking me for holidays.\n\nI, too, found his company exhausting. The whining, the complaining, the bad decisions, the love bombing, the delusional thinking.... It started to be too much. I felt like I was wearing a thick mask while I was with him, forcing myself not to show my disgust. I hated the way he bragged about how much money he made, while breaking the rules to do it. I hated his \"nice guy\" syndrome and how entitled he felt to attention from women. I hated the way he would eat dairy despite being lactose intolerant. I hated the way he binged on McDonald's after eating a large dinner with bottomless cokes. I hated the way he touched me and kissed me. I hated the self obsession, and the victim mentality he had. \n\nI couldn't stand his inability to take any personal accountability in his life. I eventually learned that despite making over 300k a year he was completely maxed out in debt because he had a gambling addiction in addition to his sex addiction. He learned to count cards at the casino and managed to con a younger card counter (I think he was only 21) into lending him tens of thousands of dollars to \"invest\" into being an advantage player at the casino. Unfortunately John lacked discipline and lost everything on slot machines. To his credit, he is planning to pay the kid back, but learning about this made me incredibly nervous and I started to get the sense that I was in over my head. \n\n I hated the way that he would talk about being sexually abused as a child without warning in excruciating and disgusting detail. I hated that he would rather spend money he didn't have on escorts and gambling than see a therapist. \n\nI felt gross and drained for hours or even days after seeing him, and would sometimes have to turn down other work because I didn't feel up to it. \n\nThe last straw for me happened Feb 16. We were supposed to see each other on Valentine's day, but I fell ill with the flu a few days earlier. He complained every day while I was sick and pestered me, dangling the money for my overnight fee over my head. He wasn't able to schedule another overnight until March, so if I didn't see him by Sunday, I would lose out on the $2000. Also he just really really really needed to get laid, and if I didn't see him, he'd go see another escort. \n\nSo, still feverish and really fucking ill, I let him come see me. \n\nIt's important to note that the first time he booked me for an overnight, he touched me in my sleep. This is a hard NO for me, and I let him know. Subsequent overnights, he did not cross that boundary. But this night, I woke up again to him assaulting my body in my sleep. My heart was racing and I felt so violated that I wanted to cry. I didn't want major confrontation, so I just pushed his hands away and told him I was still trying to sleep. But I spent the rest of the night on high alert, only able to doze for short periods of time. \n\nAfter that, I knew it was time to stop seeing him. Because we planned our appointments for each month up to two months in advance, it did not seem appropriate to simply ghost him. I struggled to find the right way to end it. I knew he was obsessively attached to me and it would be chaotic no matter how gently I tried to let him go. \n\nThen an opportunity presented itself. He saw another escort and fell asleep in his car in her parking lot. He woke up to the police questioning him and searching his car and phone. He cracked under pressure and admitted to paying for sexual services. He told them about me and about her. They chose not to arrest him or press charges, but when he related all the information to me, I decided to seize this excuse to stop seeing him. I told him that for my safety I did not want him to ever contact me again. \n\nAt first he said he understood and said goodbye. And then for the next five days, he bombarded me with texts and emails. He also sent YouTube videos of him crying and begging, snot dripping. Or drunk and begging and crying. Then sober and matter of factly laying out the reasons why my fears about his interaction with the cops was unfounded. More texts, more emails from different accounts. \n\nI responded to none of it. It made me feel even more disgusted by him, honestly. I hoped that he would eventually tire and just go the fuck away. \n\nThen he emailed me a suicide note. I didn't receive it until nearly four hours after he sent it because I was busy working. It stated that by the time I received it, it was already too late to stop him. But then three hours after the email, he sent me a YouTube video suicide note, which seemed fishy. \n\nIt has my already frazzled nerves in shambles. I worried that I could somehow be found responsible if he was found dead and they traced the cause back to me. \n\nI eventually gave in and called the police. I posed as a girlfriend and I hoped it would be a one and done call, but they kept calling me back for more information (I knew his address and full name and vehicle) and they wanted copies of his suicide letters. \n\nThey tracked him down and it turned out he was absolutely fine. He just wanted me to talk to him, and was willing to do anything to make it happen.\n\nI guess the cop successfully conveyed to him that he needed to stop harassing me, because the emails, texts and videos stopped. He did message my friend, but she told him the same thing the cop did - that he had to stop harassing me through her or else we'd go to the police. \n\nI wish I had ignored his suicide note. I feel tricked and I'm still angry about it. ",

They\u2019ve been together quite literally half her life, since she was in high school and at the time I was about 12 years old. At first he was an amazing brother in law and did all the cool stuff that comes with the brother territory. Then once I reached 14 all hell broke loose. I won\u2019t go into too much detail but my sister\u2019s baby daddy sexually assaulted me from from the ages of 14 until I was almost 17. Her and I had a huge falling out after the fact due to her denying it ever happened even though she was there for a few of the occurrences. He\u2019s a very violent man and has even attempted to murder a misbehaving dog by strangulation that he had owned. I always had a sneaking suspicion that he had been laying his hands on my sister but after two days ago, my suspicions have been confirmed. A few days ago I got a call from my nana(f 71) stating that the baby daddy had beaten my sister pretty badly. He blackened her eye, busted her lip, attempted to strangle her(he left hand prints on her neck), and beat her in the stomach with a broom handle. In a panic, she managed to get away, escaping to a neighbor woman\u2019s house a few blocks away. After he tried searching for her in his pickup truck, he then called my father and stated she was missing. He even tried filing a missing person report for her. Unfortunately for him, my sister had already contacted the authorities and notified them of the attempted murder. The cops escorted her the next day to get her two children from him and she\u2019s currently in a women\u2019s shelter until my nana can get to her. \n\nI don\u2019t wish what she went through on anyone and I hate that she even had to endure any of that. I can only imagine the turmoil and sorrow she feels. Especially having been with someone for so very long. The problem I\u2019m struggling with is setting aside my pride and being there for her in her time of need. We haven\u2019t spoken in 5 years. At this point we\u2019re two very different people.  I think back to me being that scared 14 year old that no one believed or cared to stand up for. I had messages and physical marks on me at the time and the adults failed me. I know she was a victim too, but it\u2019s hard for me to forget her part as well. Any advice would be much appreciated, but please be kind. Thanks Reddit. ",

Moving out seems like an impossible goal, and even if I manage to get my own place, I worry that I will still be struggling just to make ends meet. When I think about the future, all I can picture is an endless cycle of stress, waking up, going to work, barely making enough to feed myself, coming home exhausted, and then doing it all over again the next day. It feels like I will be stuck in survival mode with no time or money to actually live.\n\nI want more than that. I want to travel, to see the world, to experience things beyond the daily grind, but I cannot afford to. I am happy right now, but I know childhood does not last forever, and that terrifies me. What happens when it is gone? What happens when I am on my own, facing a future that feels like nothing but work and struggle? I do not want to live just to survive. I want to spend the one life I have being truly happy right up until the moment it ends, but right now I cannot see a future where that is possible.\n\nI think I might just join the military so I can feel something, and if that goes well, I could get free college.

Depression has been a constant in my life, and I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s something seriously wrong with me mentally. I\u2019ve never sought professional help never in my life. Instead, I\u2019ve coped by abusing drugs like MDMA, LSD, and and ket, weed every single day since I was 14. It\u2019s been my crutch, but it\u2019s not working anymore.\nI\u2019ve never had a real girlfriend, though that\u2019s not even my main issue. The real problem is I can\u2019t stay consistent with anything working out, holding a job, nothing. Today, I was supposed to get up and go to work, but I just couldn\u2019t be bothered. I bailed. It feels like my brain is fighting against me. I\u2019m suicidal 24/7. When I hit these lows, they last about three months, then I get a month of \u201cnormal\u201d before it crashes again. Right now, I\u2019m in one of those dark phases, and it\u2019s so bad I\u2019m genuinely debating whether to end my life today. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\nMy body\u2019s a mess too I go from fat to skinny and fat to skinny again, stuck in this weird in between because of how depression screws with me. I\u2019ve felt like this my whole life, and I\u2019m terrified it\u2019ll never change. I\u2019m getting older, life\u2019s getting more harder and serious, and everything\u2019s so damn expensive. I have no ambitions, no goals. I never went to school. I blow all my money, I\u2019m in debt, and I live alone. I feel like a corrupt soul. I say I believe in God, but I don\u2019t really. I\u2019m a fake religious person, a fake human.\nMy friends are starting to ditch me because of how I am, and I don\u2019t blame them. I\u2019ve had enough. I feel like death is the only way out of this hell because I can\u2019t imagine dragging this on until I\u2019m 28, 35, or older. It\u2019s already unbearable. My mom\u2019s tried to help me so many times, but she\u2019s given up too. I always end up back at square one, no matter what.

It\u2019s horrible, she has no sense of direction and I feel so stupid following her around.\n\nShe also talks in circles which makes me so angry.

She then asks, \u201coh so you don\u2019t want a burrito?\u201d So I thought maybe she bought ingredients for a burrito so I said sure I\u2019ll have a burrito.

I also feel more slow and held down when I\u2019m with her. Like when she makes a dumb decision I\u2019m usually around her so I have to help her correct her mistake. \n\nAnytime I do something alone I feel a huge wave of happiness go through my body because I don\u2019t feel held back from her behaviour. Overall she\u2019s a good person but I honestly don\u2019t think I can continue a relationship with her. Her misjudgments cause me so much financial loss and general stress. ",

It has brought me a lot of teasing and stares, and even though I have the mildest case, I have a small banana-shaped protrusion on my sternum. I\u2019ve wanted surgery since I was 14.\n\nAs a first option, they wanted me to wear a compression brace for a year, which is complete nonsense. I knew it wouldn\u2019t fix what I have, and even the doctor said so. I fought for years to get surgery until one day they took me to the sub-capital to see a doctor. The doctor told me it was a very mild case and that the surgery was very simple: they would cut two cartilages, push the sternum inward, and that was it. This happened in June 2024. I was very excited about the idea of having a normal chest.\n\nMy experience with this condition has been horrible and has caused me a lot of insecurity. Every time I wear a t-shirt, the lump is noticeable, making me look much fatter than I actually am. I\u2019ve been training for five years, and it\u2019s horrible to see how I can\u2019t make progress in my chest because this damn protrusion sticks out\u2014it\u2019s all I\u2019ve seen in the mirror for five years.\n\nGoing back to what I was saying, my parents postponed the surgery until 2025. I got angry with them and gave them an ultimatum: \u201cEither I get the surgery, or I leave the house.\u201d I want to clarify that this was the only thing I was asking for, the only thing I wanted. I\u2019m the youngest child, and I have a 29-year-old sister who is studying her second degree because she realized that the first one wouldn\u2019t get her a job. My father has always helped her with her apartment and university expenses. I\u2019ve always known she was the favorite, and I wasn\u2019t asking for much\u2014just this surgery.\n\nToday we went to see a doctor in our city, and instead of agreeing with the previous doctor, he said they would have to break my abdomen, cut all the cartilage, and insert a prosthesis. I suspect this was all planned because my father is a doctor, and I have a feeling he talked to this doctor to make me change my mind or to have an excuse to say no. I walked home because I was so angry at them. I\u2019ve been fighting for this surgery for about five years, and they found the perfect excuse to deny it.\n\nTonight at dinner, I ate in my room. I\u2019m so tired of them\u2014they are the most vile, cruel, and arbitrary people I know. I hate them for making me go through my entire adolescence and now my adulthood with this lump in my chest just because they don\u2019t want me to have surgery. They have no idea how much I\u2019ve suffered or how much I wish with all my heart to die. I wish I could just wake up one day and no longer exist in this horrible world. I hate the parents I got, and I hate my sister for being the favorite. If I could, I\u2019d take a gun and blow my brains out so I wouldn\u2019t have to endure this anymore\u2014but I will make them pay. As soon as I get a job, I\u2019ll leave this place and never speak to them again. When they\u2019re old, I\u2019ll put them in a nursing home\u2014and I\u2019m being generous.

I just  hope when I have the nerve to finally end it they are worse off than me.\nIm evil and Im bitter. They destroyed it. We could\u2019ve been a family. But it was easier to hate and abuse instead of just getting rid of me and I just ended up hurting people I cared about most.\n\nIm sorry my friends whom have forgotten me. I didnt know I was being abused. I didnt realize I was hurting you so badly; but I wish you could\u2019ve told me, but its also my fault for nor providing you a safe space . I hope when or if you see my missing posters; or obituary(tho I doubt I\u2019ll have either) my demise makes you smile and alleviates and hatred you have for me.\nI never forget your faces or your voices.

This is the third time it\u2019s happened, and I feel like it\u2019s destroying me because, with the first two, I ended up pushing them away, and we eventually became strangers again.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m obsessing over a really close friend in our small friend group of three. We\u2019ve known each other for almost three years, give or take, and we\u2019re so close we even refer to each other as \u201csiblings.\u201d But recently, something changed ad I've started obsessing once again. I can\u2019t stop thinking about them. I always want to talk, hang out, or just spend time with them. And when they spend that time with someone else, I get jealous to the point where it physically hurts and I even feel betrayed in a way.\n\nBefore you think I\u2019m completely nuts, I know this isn\u2019t okay. I don\u2019t start arguments, and I never tell them how I feel because I know I don\u2019t have the right to control who they spend time with or talk to. I would never want to make them uncomfortable or make them feel like they owe me anything. But that doesn\u2019t stop the thoughts from eating me alive. I cannot help but wish I had them all to myself.\n\nSometimes, instead of hanging out, I\u2019ll say, \u201cI\u2019m tired\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t feel like going out,\u201d when in reality, I do want to spend time with them\u2014but I just can\u2019t handle it mentally.

You say you love me, but why didn\u2019t you act like it? I tried to show you love and you didn\u2019t want it. There\u2019s only so much I can do before I can\u2019t anymore. \n\nYou say you miss me. But you never talked to me. You hid all your feelings from me. We\u2019d go to therapy and it felt like an attack on everything I did. It felt like anything and everything I did was wrong. \n\nI was always the one in the wrong. \n\nBut what about the things you did that hurt me?\n\nYeah I\u2019m good at compartmentalizing. I\u2019m good at bottling up my feelings to make others comfortable. It didn\u2019t feel like you cared that I was doing it since it gave more room for you to talk about how you were feeling. \n\nI gave so much of myself to you. \n\nDid you really love me?\n\nOr did you just love the idea of me?\n\nSomeone to listen to you and ask how your days were and what? Why didn\u2019t you do that for me? I wore myself out trying to make you happy. Happy with me. Happy with you. Happy with literally anything. I couldn\u2019t do it. \n\nI miss the days that we could sit and talk for hours. I miss the days that you would smile when you saw me. I miss the days that felt like you truly loved me. I miss the days that we were actually friends. \n\nBut maybe it wasn\u2019t real. Maybe it was the attention I gave you? Or the gifts? Or maybe I was a distraction? Something shiny and new. Uncharted territory. I don\u2019t know. \n\nI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re telling people. That I broke it off? That I did this and that and whatnot? You blocked me so it\u2019s not like I can try to support you. Not that you were accepting of my support over the last year plus. I really tried. And it felt like you just didn\u2019t care. \n\nI shouldn\u2019t have looked you up on here. I noticed you blocked me days ago. You didn\u2019t tell me where you were moving-not that it\u2019s my business, but it really sucks being completely blocked out by someone who is saying they love me. \n\nLoved me. \n\nMy heart hurts. And I can\u2019t even talk to my best friend about it. \n\nYou wanna know why I\u2019ve been talking to her? Because my world revolved around you. I stopped talking to my friends. All of my friends. Because you were my world. But I was just a bother to you. An annoyance. A burden. \n\nI needed someone to talk to and she messaged me. She wasn\u2019t a bad person so I don\u2019t know where you got that from. If anything, I was the bad person in that situation. I let you be mean to her. I let you do what you wanted because I thought you were my forever. But you didn\u2019t think I was your forever. You don\u2019t treat your forever the way you treated me. How are you so okay with just disappearing on me?    \n\nI truly hope you can find happiness. I wasn\u2019t the one for you and that\u2019s okay. I hope you can show love to the next person you find. Not as a rarity, but strong and unwavering. Love them with everything you have, because you deserve love and to love. \n\nI just wasn\u2019t enough. \n\nI wasn\u2019t ever going to be enough. \n\nI just wish you\u2019d have told me sooner. ",

I cant!\" i tried to move it even slightly in order to try obeying what she said but the pain was terrible, horrendous, unbearable, i cant think of words that can extensively describe how much pain i was in\n\ni dont quite remember it all but i think when i tried to use my left hand to write i was yelled at too, and my mom minimized my pain by saying smth along the lines of \"it isnt that bad\" and i was also condescendingly asked if i wanted to go the doctor which i again refused fearing surgery and also bc having my parents yell at me made me upset\n\nall this time i remember i still had that blue vet wrap on, my hand was shaking and in so much pain, i forget if my mom did the usual \"let me feel it\" thing but if she did i most definitely refused and probably yanked it away, based on the fact I still had that vet wrap on i think it was probably the next day\n\ni was allowed to write with my left hand but not without being scolded, i remember writing down things in notebooks for fun with my left hand, and i even decided that a character id made had my left hand's handwriting, i eventually got better writing with my left hand and honestly really had fun with it\n\nwhile i wrote and did things with my left hand i also did not use my right hand or bend my wrist, at least i did as little as possible, i kept on using the vet wrap to stablize it until it wouldn't stick no more, then i found some wrap i has gotten from when i sprained my leg and so i it instead, and remembered how i treated my sprained leg, used that was refrence for resting my hand and also didn't move it bc it was painful\n\ni dont remember much else abt the recovery, i think i stopped wrapping it and started using my right hand again as soon as the pain lessoned, which probably was after like a month or two perhaps? ik it takes longer for a broken bone to recover but the pain does go away pretty quickly honestly, i remember my mom expecting me to recover from my \"sprain\" in about a week and was upset i still refused to use it and instead write with my left hand\n\ni did keep on writing with my left hand sometimes for awhile after that just for fun, which ironically probably helped my right hand recover lol\n\ni dont quite know how long after it was but i think it was a decent chunk after but within the same year, i once again slipped and fell and i forget which handi landed on but based on the pain and how caught myself (the same way again) i think it was my right, which i once again assumed was a sprain, but only a minor one, so i again pulled out the wrap i had and i think for abt a day or 3 days wrapped my hand, i remember not having much pain and wondering if it still needed wrapped the next day, but i still ended up keeping it on i think\n\nand until i was a teen it never hit me that the pain i feltin my bones was not a normal sprain thing but probably a broken bone, and it really hit me after a horse broke my foot 2 years ago that yea, that probably wasnt a sprain... bc like it was while less pain, that pain i got from my broken foot felt literally like a lesser version of the pain i felt in my hand when i was a kid\n\ntbh im not completely sure if i did break my hand as ive never rly had it inspected for past breaks, unlike my foot it doesn't rly act up when the weather changes or from overuse etc, at least i think so? i never rly took notice of anything like thay as a kid because i was never aware or looking for anybpain related to broken bones, so im open to anyone suggesting its something else, not for legitimate medical advice as well, ik i shouldnt get it from here and its already healed, just out of curiosity, i wonder if it was like a pinched nerve maybe, but it didnt feel like one at all (ive unfortunately had and continue of have pinched nerves in my neck \ud83d\ude43)",

He always respected me and my boundaries. He accepted everything about me. He's the only guy to actually plan a date with me rather than putting in the minimum effort of asking me which restaurant I want to go to. I broke up with him because I didn't feel like I was good enough for him. He was on the football team and I was an awkward emo kid. I blew him off at first because I had been asked out by another football player as a joke a couple weeks prior. So for our entire relationship I just kept waiting for him to reveal that it had all been a joke too. My first real kiss was an uncomfortable situation that felt pressured and forced, and I know that had it been with him it would have been so natural. I lost my virginity to someone who had zero respect for me who broke up with me because his dad said he should play the field. Itbshould have been him. I married someone abusive and ended up divorced by the time I was 27, and now I have a child with someone who I live with and still only see on weekends most of the time because he would rather play videogames all night and sleep all day than actually put in effort with me and our child. Hs bf and I hooked up years ago when we were between relationships and I psyched myself out again thinking I wasn't good enough and ended up blowing up on him over something that could have been easily talked through.

    "selftext": "I agonize over my life. I am officially married but basically no relationship or sex in about 5 years.  My husband is bipolar and treats me like crap even though I am the sole supporter in a tropical country.  I have a business and work my ass off to support my legal husband and 23 year old daughter. She works now so not so much support. While in my home country I stay with a friend of the opposite sex and pay rent albeit not anywhere near market rent. When I am in my home country I pay my way.  But my \u201cfriend\u201d definitely likes me. He made advances on me and because he did so much for me I almost felt to secure my life I needed to reciprocate or I would be on the street. My \u201chusband\u201d has never shown me he really cares. He is bipolar and I was emotionally and physically abused for years. I met my friend and moved in.  I run a business in my home country and travel back a lot to tend to biz.  I never wanted a relationship with anyone but felt guilted into it or I would be on the street. I could not afford an airbnb and needed to stay with my friend. Well he made advances and me feeling pressured went along with it to secure my and my family\u2019s well being. I care about this person a lot but am not willing to give up my life in my tropical country.  I have 5 dogs that I cannot take to my home country and could not afford to live there. So I let the relationship continue. I feel major guilt every single day of my life. I do not want to lead this other relationship on but know I will be homeless when i go back.  I broke it off because the guilt was too much but he still is hanging on hoping I come back. I want to live in my home in my tropical country with little to no stress with my dogs. My husband and I have separate rooms and do not have any intimacy for at least 5 years. My issue is my husband has worked really hard to improve. He is an asshole but less and less. My \u201cfriend\u201d in my home country is a good guy but very insecure. I do not want to hurt anyone but it is inevitable. He does things for me without me asking and then holds it over my head. I am so torn. He lives in a dog free building so no way to take my babies there. I don\u2019t know what to do. I never wanted this chaos. My life is upside down. I want to just do myself in and end it but my two kids 23 and 30 are my best friends and their lives would be destroyed so thats just not an option. I hate my life so much. I want my kids and my dogs. I wish my life was easy. ",

    "selftext": "So, I'm from a very close-init family, we love each other a lot and have always been together. My grandma had three children, uncle A, uncle B, and my dad, and then grandpa had a child with another woman, uncle C. This is about uncle B.\n\nI don't like his current gf. She immediately trauma dumped on my grandma to gain sympathy, then proceeded to imply she was old and getting forgetful and clumsy (grandma's perfectly fine, she's as healthy as they come), then she brought along her son she had with another man, who I have no trouble with. She herself isn't bad, but the way she and her son behave is weird, because it's like they're not a part of our family, they just kinda live there, and I have the feeling that she wants to kick my grandma out and have the house to herself, which isn't possible because it's decided 50/50 between uncle A and uncle B, but she's tried to buy the other half to uncle A, who firmly refused, because once they both pass away, the house is mine.\n\nThe worst part about all this is my uncle's behavior since she arrived. He works with my mom at a local restaurant, nothing fancy, its main target are the broke college students nearby, but they get paid well. My mom had a cousin of hers working as a waiter there, and he wasn't the best, but hey, acceptable,  but uncle B decided to start saying that he was more trouble that its worth, and that his girlfriend's son should work there, my mom firmly refused. My grandma has anxiety of going out on her own for years now and since she only lives with uncle B and his girlfriend, she constantly relies on him to get medicine or to just go out, and he's been getting extremely rude with her for no reason whenever she asks to go out, yelling and saying \"he needs his own time too\". We threw a party for grandma's birthday a while ago, and you'd expect him to sit with his mother, but no, he went and sat with his gf's family, completely ignoring grandma. I fell and got hurt pretty badly a while ago, and everyone called me and asked of I was okay, but him? Not a peep. \n\nMy last straw came a few days ago, my mom suffers really bad anxiety/panic attacks sometimes and he caused her one. Long story short, he missed work without calling in advance and my mom had to cover his shift and then tried to reprehend him because she's the manager of the restaurant. He completely flipped out and said something along the lines of \"leave, it doesn't matter, (gf's name) can replace you\", and my mom got really mad, and said \"I don't want to have anything to do with you as work or as family, you're never stepping foot into my house again\". \n\nNow I love my uncle, but his gf has completely ruined everything, I don't like her, I see her and I feel angry, but I can't do anything because I'm forced to interact with her, and you'd think my lack of warmth would tell her to not talk to me, but she talks to me as if she was my aunt, SHE'S NOT, and I genuinely wish I could just make her go away and make things go back to normal.

For example, my job for the past few months has just been to watch a fence for 12 hours straight.\n\nIve been working 50 - 60 hours a week for two years doing this sort of work and it's extremely mind numbing. There's no challenge, there's no getting better at my job. I am a body. That's it.

I can't even go to school part time to move into the industry that I want to because I don't have a consistent schedule.\n\nI feel like I'm trapped working this job and it's sucked me dry of any passion or desire to engage with hobbies I used to love or to go out and try to make new friends.",

    "selftext": "I've been doing some thinking about all the conversations I have had with people and I think I have a issue with coming off as \"authentic\" or \"comfortable\". I met this guy online he was really nice I gave him my phone number and we hit off, we have been talking for two days the second day we call I remember he said \"oh!, someone is calling me bye!\" and I didn't think anything of it but uhm I haven't really heard from him since I texted him and he kinda left me on read and I texted him again I don't think he bothered looking at the message and I think I don't want to believe that I had just got ghosted but I think I did? And I don't blame him really because I don't know how to talk to people. I've noticed that I overshare and I can be awkward and maybe I make people sad when I talk to them but at the sametime I don't know how to approach people, or how to really make connections so I just blurt things out and I can see why that would drive someone away that kind of thing is so tiring to deal with. I also noticed when we were talking to him he said now you sound more relaxes or more comfortable or you're not trying too hard and i've got that a lot, I don't know what that meana though because sometimes thats how I genuinely act, I guess because i'm so awkward some of the things I say come off as forced but I can't help it and I don't know what to say really and I don't want to interview people and be like, oh so you like this? and this? and that? how do you feel about this? asking a ton of questions. I also was talking to someone before this guy not ina romantic sense but I think I made things awkward with that person too, I think I made them sad and I didn't mean to but it just happens sorta and I don't notice until like a day later or so and its like damn I shouldve approached it like this or like that. And even when i'm trying to talk with new people I always overthink what I want to say, I LITERALLY WAS OVERTHINKING WHAT I WANTED TO SAY TO BOOK A HAIR STYLING APPOINTMENT LIKE COME ON, thats just pathetic that it took me 3 days to ask my stylist how much is this or how do I get to her studio because I was ovethinking what I wanted to say and because I felt embarrassed and ashamed. And I started to realize that even my bestfriends don't really know what to say to certain things I say so its an awkward silence before I have to be like so uhm ahaha sorry about that!! and I have to make a stupid joke or something because I know they don't know what the hell to say and I made the whole convo awkward. I haven't even spoken to my bestfriend of 5 years, in which I should be thr most comfortable speaking to in like 5 days because i'm trying to think of something to talk about, again this is so pathetic and I don't know why im like this, it shouldn't be hard to talk to people but for some reason for me it is and it just makes me kinda angry and kinda sad and jealous because everyone makes it seem so effortless to talk to people and have a regular convo where you're like \"AUGH I SHOULDNT HAVE SAID THAT IM GONNA PUT MY HEAD IN A WALL!!\".",

    "selftext": "So, towards the end of summer last year, my coworker (26m) and I (24f) went on a date and ended up fooling around a few times after that. I had had a huge crush on him for a while and was so excited to finally go out with him. The date was super nice, but the hookups were unexpectedly really good. I don\u2019t have a lot of experience whereas he does, and he knew that, and he let me take control of the pace and the things we did which made me feel comfortable enough to try stuff with him I hadn\u2019t done before. Unfortunately, life stuff happened all at once, and he ended things like two weeks after the first date. I was crushed. I was hurt, disappointed, confused, and quite honestly, very sexually frustrated. I really, really liked him, and we had gotten very intimate very quickly with the expectation that there would be a lot more to come, and then all of a sudden, it was over. I felt like I was left high and dry.\n\nThe thing is, a couple of months ago, we basically ended up confessing over text that we both still wanted each other in that way and almost made plans to meet up again, but more life stuff got in the way, and we both agreed that it would still be a bad idea to do anyway. But now every time I see him at work, I can\u2019t help but think about the things we said and did, and how much I want to do it again. The fact that I know that a part of him still desires me in that way is kind of driving me crazy. I could torture myself overanalyzing every normal conversation, every glance, every little interaction.\n\nIt would very likely be a terrible idea to do it again, and it would probably end worse than it did the first time, but the feelings just won\u2019t go away no matter how much I remind myself of these things. I am down so, so bad for this guy.",

    "selftext": "So I recently exposed a narcissist but my situation is very different and I can\u2019t find anything online about this situation. So I came here for potential outcomes. \n\nSo back in 2023 of March I started talking to this guy and he knew me from my childhood (we were not best friends we just saw each other in passing during our middle school years) and it went well at first. (It only lasted two weeks) While we were getting to know each other I got on his IG and saw this girl constantly posting on his page but he never paid her any mind and of course I asked and he denies it. But he must have sensed that I was hot on his tail so he decided to end things but still wanted to be friends even though we were never friends but I just said ok. What he didn\u2019t know is that I knew I was blocked after I questioned him about the girl on IG so I made a fake page to see what was up. And even though he said he wanted to end things he was still keeping in touch with me. Even though I\u2019m blocked on his IG so in April 2023 I saw him with that girl and he she got him to move down there with her. He is originally from my city and this girl lives in the DMV area. And with me investigating I realized that it\u2019s a money thing so basically this guy is a prostitute she buys him stuff and he agrees to be her bf. So of course I wanted revenge but I wanted to wait until it was unexpected so for a whole year I gathered information on this girl and realized she may be a narcissist. With my digging on this girl I got her phone number driver license address email you name it I got it. And I tucked it away. So in March of 2024 I made a fake number and pretended that I knew her from one of the colleges she went to but I told her that I wanted to stay anonymous. And she went for it and all I did was expose her bf for being with me. I also wanted to add that had I not been hot on his tail he would have continued to date me. And when I found out about the girl I cut all communication with him and he found a way to contact me and wanted me back and I told him no. He even told me he never wanted us to stop talking but he needed help from this girl and I had all that in the screenshots. And you best believe I sent them screenshots to her when I was hiding behind the fake number. This girl really wanted to know who I was so I decided to give her a call and actually reveal myself and we were on the phone for 27 mins. Mind you I recorded our conversation as well because I don\u2019t trust this bitch. But while we were on the phone she talked bad about her bf and her bf family and I did defend the family because I actually know them. Because the city we are from is small. And at one point in time I was close with the guys cousin. She said really bad things about the bf mom too. And I didn\u2019t like that so I spoke up and I think she could tell I wasn\u2019t going for any of her lies because I knew she was lying. And I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t like that. I actually got off the phone with her because she wouldn\u2019t let me go. So the day after I spoke to the girl her bf called me screaming at me and accusing me of all these things I didn\u2019t even say. I couldn\u2019t even get a word in but I knew she was going to lie so I wasn\u2019t tripping because in my head I was going to get my lick back. Fuck this hoe. The guy wasn\u2019t even mad that I hurt gf feelings he was mad that I lied on his family and said bad things about him. Which I didn\u2019t say anything bad about him or his family. So after I took a verbal beating from this guy I just said cool. But I wasn\u2019t done yet. So I waited for about six months so now we are in September 2024 and from March of 2024 to September 2024 I kept my eye on them and I watched her crumble because she is very transparent on the internet and the bf broke up with her while she begged for him back because he realized that she lied on me and she must have found me on social media because she changed everything about herself to mimic me. Mind you when I spoke to her in March of 2024 she claims that he begs her but social media says otherwise. And between March of 2024 to September of 2024 this girl and her friends and her momma started to bother me because apparently I\u2019m the reason why her bf won\u2019t speak to her and I still keep calling her bf and pulling him away from her but I haven\u2019t seen that man since March of 2023 nor have I spoke to him the only time I spoke to him was in March of 2024 and that\u2019s because he yelled at me. So in September of 2024 I reached out to him I unblocked him on IG (in case you are wondering he did block me first on IG but unblocked me on IG to get in contact with me because I had him block on everything else then when he asked for a second chance and I told him no I blocked him on IG and he been on that list since September of 2024 and then I blocked him again because he is a dick) and sent him all the details of the conversation I had with the gf. I even revealed to him that I was behind the fake number but he told me to leave him alone so I said ok bet and changed my number and reblocked him on IG. But what I banked on was how much he liked me so I knew he was going to read and listen to all the things I sent and within three days he started calling my fake number (because he couldn\u2019t get in contact with me because I changed my real number) so I deleted my fake number and got rid of my social media account because he had his family look for me too. He also offered to send me money to talk to him but I declined. And of course I\u2019m still watching this all play out on my fake pages and again because she is so transparent on social media she is having a breakdown because he now knows the truth and she can no longer lie on me to him at least. But he is stupid anyway because why would you believe a liar with no proof but I guess because she is a narcissist and the guy isn\u2019t good at setting boundaries. I never been involved with a narcissist well I don\u2019t think I have been and I think it\u2019s because I\u2019m too outspoken and I have no problem getting into a fights. I promise you this is not what the fuck you want but overall I\u2019m a pretty peaceful young lady if I do say so myself. Anywho, this girl is upset that not only is he furious with her but also his family is happy that someone was able to finally expose her for the liar and manipulator that she is (I didn\u2019t know that his family didn\u2019t like her) but apparently she plays victim and uses this guys insecurities and her money so she can get her way and this relationship was going on for years. I\u2019m basically the hero. But I wasn\u2019t done with this bitch yet so I got my black ass on Twitter and put her on blast so much so she lost a lot of followers on social media and her momma is off of social media completely because her momma was bothering me too. And I did this a few weeks ago me exposing this girl on Twitter. So now I\u2019m satisfied. But I wanted to know what happens when you expose a narcissist? I wasn\u2019t the one being manipulated but it was like I was the defender of someone who was being manipulated. And I came here to see if I could get any info because I couldn\u2019t find anything.

The staff are bullies. I\u2019m being bullied by three seniors who are ganging up on me. Higher ups told me to be quiet basically when I reported it. \n\nI\u2019ve been run down, chest infection after chest infection, extreme fatigue etc then I went off sick five weeks ago after being told to shut my mouth basically and I\u2019ve been fine since. In a good head space, no fatigue etc. \n\nI\u2019ve job searched every day. No suitable roles as I am specialised theatre nurse. All I keep seeing is clinical assessor/Pip roles and I\u2019m at such a breaking point with my role that I am close to going for that one and it\u2019s hated by people and run by private companies who can sack you at  any time. \n\nI have to return back to an environment where the people are nasty, where the seniors are out to get me (and they are) and where I no longer feel I am learning, improving or getting anywhere. No amount of effort I put in works there anymore, and I\u2019ve tried my hardest. \n\nI\u2019ve even contemplated leaving nursing entirely but no other role pays the same and I cannot afford to retrain for something. \n\nI have a mortgage, pets to feed, bills to pay and now I have to accept the fact that i have to stay in this place for longer until I find somewhere else and even then, work never let me leave for an interview. I have to stay in my work prison and serve a never ending sentence. \n\nThe last day before I went off sick I genuinely contemplated driving my car off the bridge on the way home.

    "selftext": "I worked at three of the biggest influencer marketing agencies over the last decade, and now that I don't, it's finally safe for me to speak the truth without risk to my career - I need to expose that whole industry as a scam and no one is talking about it..\n\n\"Influencer Marketting\" agencies make almost all their money NOT from sponsorships but from influencers paying them monthly fees to FIND them sponsorships that never happen. I was shocked each time I got a new job at a new \"influencer marketing agency\" to discover they all work the same way- colleagues who mentioned it were fired or made redundant. It's kind of like a pyramid scheme... Out of thousands of influencers paying monthly \"subscription fees\", almost no sponsorships actually happened in the years I was there. All of our workload was dedicated to finding more influencers to sign up rather than sponsorship companies.\n\nThink about it- why would we need sign ups in the first place if we can find sponsors? We'd obviously take a cut of sponsorship as that would make more money- right??!! What's going on is dishonest &amp; takin advantage of the poor.\n\nMost people think that a large following of 500K+ followers, makes that person wealthy. The reality is that 99% of people with 500k followers on insta and tiktok (and in many cases, youtube shorts), make nothing. I\u2019ve worked with influencers sleeping in cars, couch-surfing, living below the poverty line for years, incredulous to the fact they aren't making anything, while my colleagues persuaded them to continue building a following and that sponsors were \"just around the corner\". We would be told to persuade these people to by dangling carrots like this. Many of them worked 20 hours a day to build a following- often from uplifting or positive content- and weren't narcissists- it is not a pleasant life, and I knew of so many like this.\n\nI don't like how the industry is taking advantage of these people. Websites like SocialBlade are hilarious - the number of times I've seen them claim people are making $500K+ per year but in reality, they're earning nothing... It happens all the time.\n\nThe key is that most audiences aren't monetisable no matter how big they are, and the ones that ARE monetisable (e.g. \"technical\" topics), are nigh on impossible to persuade sponsors to bite because they're all so stuck in the past (they think of social media as something \"free\" and will only pay to advertise on TV or via traditional routes).\n\nTo make things worse, 99% of companies reaching out just want free advertising. They offer \u201cexposure\u201d or a cheap free product and refuse to pay. They all think that someone with a large social media following is a philanthropist millionaire, or can eat \"free products\", didn't work full time to build that following, and doesn't need income.\n\nMeanwhile, marketing agencies exploit this situation by selling influencers false hope and taking their money with no return. It has to be biggest public perception vs. reality mismatch I\u2019ve ever seen.. on such a grand scale.\n\nNo one is talking about this. Agencies won't talk about it because their income comes from maintaining the lie. Influencers themselves won't talk about it as they fear it might destroy their chances of getting a sponsor in future (which is never going to happen!!). So I had to get this off my chest, now that I don't work for them anymore. I'm frankly amazed these \"companies\" haven't been shut down.\n\nI'm sorry but I can't name myself or the companies for obvious reasons, but they're all the same (afaik), and I can't give examples of specific social media accounts for similar reasons unfortunately. Therefore, you don't have to believe me on this, but I speak the truth &amp; just happy to get this off my chest.\n\nMy advice to you if you're unable to find sponsors for social media following:  \n\\- Don't waste any more time on it. Views can't pay your bills. Don't waste your life..  \n\\- Don't trust any social media \"marketting agency\" that requires a monthly subscription fee from you (if they are genuine, they'll operate on a percentage of sponsorship deals that they obtain for you - NOT a monthly fee from you)  \n\\- Don't trust when anyone tells you \"you're just marketting wrong- it's impossible to have no income on 500k followers\" - they don't know what they're talking about unfortunately. Most influencers even in the 500k braket make NOTHING, but none will admit it for fear of it sabotaging their future chances.  \n\\- Spend your time re-skilling to do something else that will make a living, don't fall for this scam.  \n\\- Even monetisable accounts with monetizable topics are VERY HARD to get sponsors for, that's why so many don't have a sponsor for years.  \n\\- Don't fall for the \"if I get a big following I will automatically find ways to make an income\" trap\n\nThere.

Mind you, im newly 22 and already get told i look like im 17. Im not completely opposed to dating out of my age range, but are there things i need to worry about with this? Is it a predatory thing?

    "selftext": "Throw away account so no one sees this. \n\nI have been working really hard the last 5 years or so to improve my life. \n\nA little background about me- I come from a low-income, below poverty line house hold. Grew up in housing during my childhood. Majority of my family including cousins are either on social assistance, housing, drug addicts, alcoholic, ect. \n\n6 or 7 years ago, I was on social assistance myself. I didn't finish high-school. I was drinking daily. Ended up in an abusive relationship. Managed to get a cleaning job. \n\nSince then I've gotten my GED, partially went through college, ended up building a career before I completed college, am now a program manager on my way to making 90k a year in a field i love that feels like I'm making a difference in people's lives, in a happy loving fulfilling relationship where I live with my partner, we plan to buy a house soon and are thinking about marriage and kids. I have a car. I've essentially hit all of the life goal milestones I wanted to hit by the time I was 30 and more (I just turned 30 a few weeks ago). I've been to therapy, ive been on a good medication for my mental health, I've done the work.\n\nI feel like my life is finally on the right track. Because of this, I've finally been able to shift my focus to more \"shallow\" or less important things that have been kinda low on my radar. \n\nFirst let me say, I love myself - not in a self centered kind of way, but I appreciate that I'm resilient, goal oriented, determined, am empathetic to peoples experiences, and I have a lot of love to give. And I have a lot of respect and compassion for myself- just as I do for others. \n\nWith that being said, my appearance has always been something that's bothered me. I've always had bad skin, I gained quite a bit of weight over the last 4 years- and I'm just not in a place where I feel good about how I look. So I've decided, this year, that's what I'm going to work on. I've bought more professional clothes, started my skin journey to help with my skin texture and acne scars and redness. And planning on getting my teeth fixed. Getting a good hair regime. And controversial- i decided id try ozempic. My insurance is covering it so essentially it's like why not? Why wouldn't I give this thing a try to support me in losing weight and feeling better about my appearance. It's not that I think I'm UGLY I know I'm not- i just feel like I haven't really taken care of myself and I'm working on it. \n\nAnyway long story short- I feel like I'm getting some much push back randomly now. And the more I think of it the more I realize how much push back I've gotten generally on decisions I've made. \n\nMy dad once said how will you live on your own your on welfare (this was 7 years ago before I met my boyfriend and 3 months before I got a fulltime job as a cleaner and my own apartment)\n\nMany times as I've changed jobs to move up and learn more I've gotten aren't you scared? Are you sure you want to do this?\n\nAnd now from some family members and old friends its - wow that treatment is a lot of money, I've heard so many negatives about ozempic etc. My own mother has issues with me improving the way I look for some reason.\n\nI just don't understand it. I would never try to put someone down for bettering themselves in anyway. It's actually almost hurtful.\n\nOf course I realize I don't have to and won't listen to others on my life choices, because my choices have gotten me to where I am today. I guess I'm just venting because it feels like the people who don't even make decisions try to influence yours. \n\nAnyway thats all haha.",

The following month he flew out to see me and I spent that whole weekend with him. We had an instant connection and even nine months later things still feel really great. \n\nHim and I live only a few states apart so for the past nine months we have been traveling a lot just to see eachother. We have been traveling back and forth so much that this weekend is our 20th visit with eachother and we have spent roughly 100 days together in person! \n\nWhen we first started seeing each other I didn\u2019t tell anyone because I was too afraid of the judgment people would say. I have no clue how people in my family or community might feel about our age gap. Overtime it just got more and more involved but I still did my best to hide my relationship from everyone.\n\nThis upcoming May I need to find a new place to live and I don\u2019t really have many options. The best case scenario is for my partner to move to my state and for us to live together. That is a realistic plan for us but the only issue is that I don\u2019t think I can hide that from my friends/family. I am also starting to think about just telling them since there are times where it is hard to have to hide my relationship, especially when it\u2019s such a big part of my life. \n\nI am really worried about what my family might say.

    "selftext": "I fuck up everything good in my life. I had the most amazing guy and I fucked it up. \n\nI\u2019m a miserable, depressed piece of shit. With no self esteem and severe social anxiety. \n\nMy life sucks. I ruin everything for everyone including myself. I drain the happiness and fun out of everything. I don\u2019t know how to laugh, be myself or make jokes anymore. \n\nI take several medications. Nothing helps anymore.\n\nI had multiple shots at my dream job and I fucked every last one of them up. \n\nI\u2019m 25 with no future and no friends. All of my college friends moved away and forgot about me. I don\u2019t have any friends. The only time I get a text message is when my medications are ready. \n\nI\u2019m stuck at home being a caregiver for my sick mother. Who sometimes still controls me like a child. I have too much guilt to leave her behind and go else where. \n\nI have no money, no license (bc I\u2019m too much of a pussy to get behind the wheel), no car. Nothing. \n\nI\u2019m not a normal girl. I hate dress clothes, don\u2019t want children, no make up. Only video games, superheros and having a potty mouth worse than a sailor. I\u2019m clingy, rude, no social skills, and can be loud. Who would like that? Even my own fucking dog hates my guts.\n\nMy boyfriend dumped me, my soul cat of 17+ years just died, I knocked my front tooth out which won\u2019t be fixed for another 2 months, I live in a shitty apartment with insanely loud neighbors to where I can\u2019t sleep at night. Shall I go on?\n\nIt\u2019s been 25 years of miserable years and bad luck. If I didn\u2019t have bad luck, I wouldn\u2019t have any at all!\n\nMy life is gonna end at a ripe old age with no one that cares about me or would even come to my funeral. I\u2019ll be alone and miserable forever. \n\nIn the end, it\u2019ll always just be me, myself and I. \n\nI feel at least a bit better getting that all out.. ",

    "selftext": "I, (21 f)am dating my high school sweetheart again after years of not seeing or speaking to each other. \n\nWe met working a shitty fast food job in high school, and I fell in love with her almost immediately. She\u2019s smart, so fun to be around, made me laugh and made me feel genuinely loved and appreciated for the first time in my life. I felt more confident, more comfortable around her. Not to mention she\u2019s also the most gorgeous person i\u2019ve ever seen. \n\nWe dated for a bit, and then she broke up with me towards the end of our senior year. I was heartbroken, and went off to college still processing and dealing with the breakup. As silly as it sounds and I know most people think this with their first love, but I really thought i was going to marry this girl. We chatted on and off throughout my freshman year, just normal shit like \u201chey how are you doing\u201d and \u201cwe should catch up\u201d before I finally decided it was finally time to fully move on and forget about her, so I blocked her on everything that summer, and deleted her number. \n\nWhile i still thought of her from time to time, I wasn\u2019t angry or hurt about the breakup anymore, I had accepted that 17-year-olds know nothing about love, and all I can do with heartbreak is learn from it. \n\nFast forward to the beginning of my junior year of college, and I\u2019ve dated on and off for years now and was in the process of trying to end a terrible long term relationship. I drove from college to my hometown, around 3 hours, to be with my friends after ending things while my new ex blew up my phone with calls and messages telling me what a horrible person i was for breaking up with her (I was not, she treated me terrible and refused to listen to me when I had an issue). \n\nMy friends and I decided to grab food and hangout in my car in one of the parking lots in our hometown. We pulled in, and I saw my first Ex\u2019s car. It had a very distinctive bumper sticker, so I knew it was her. I didn\u2019t get out or try to say anything, but my heart skipped a beat. I really truly believed I would never see this girl again. I debated reaching out, but in the end I unblocked her on snapchat and reached out with a simple \u201chey! were you at x lot the other night?\u201d and we spent a few weeks catching up and then hung out for the first time in years. \n\nShe told me she missed me, and had always regretted the way things ended between us. I had no intention of trying to date again when I reached out, but I admit I did miss her too. That was about 9 months ago, and one thing led to another and now we are fully back together and it\u2019s been amazing. \n\nI know it\u2019s only been three years since we broke up originally, and I will say that I still don\u2019t know anything about love. I\u2019m a different person than I was in high school, and so is she. She makes me feel like the most beautiful person in the world, and i\u2019ve never come close to feeling this way for anyone but her. All I do know is that as long as I\u2019m able, I will do my best to love her the way she deserves, because as far as i\u2019m concerned she does the same for me. I can\u2019t help but wonder how my life would be different now if we hadn\u2019t gone to that one parking lot that night. \n\nThank you for reading, xoxo",

I had no idea she was sick. she passed in july of last year, and the county I am in is so backed up that the medical examiner took 8 months to get back to us. we all assumed it was a fentanyl overdose that she may have come in contact with because one of her friends was an addict. it turns out that she had no drugs in her system.\n\ni\u2019ve been waiting for 8 months. i\u2019m only 20. my dad hasn\u2019t been around at all for my whole life. my mom picked terrible men. her whole life has been around horrible men. she was raised being beaten by her father by anything and everything possible he could find. she married a man who got addicted to crack, my father. she then married another man who cheated on her the entire relationship with other men. the final man, a man who had stolen from her in a relationship prior and who has killed 2 of his previous partners indirectly, took her, too.\n\nthe only answer it could be is that the final man took her from us. he had never killed them exactly, but both of his previous wives were completely clean before they met him. 5 and 7 years later, they both died of a heroin overdose.\n\nI cut off my relationship with my mom in 2019 due to something I was a victim of when I was younger by the man who cheated on her with other men. he did some fucked up things. a lot of fucked up things. he let a lot of fucked up things happen to me under his supervision. I had caught a disease from what he did/let happen and decided to move in with my grandma because I did not like the man she was now with, the man who (may) have killed her, the final man. I had no contact with her after I got a restraining order.\n\nshe and I had started to get along for once in 4 years. I had hugged her (albeit halfassedly) for the first and last time. she cried and cried. I don\u2019t know what I would have done if she were to have passed and I didn\u2019t get on good terms with her again.\n\nI wanted to see her succeed in her life. she spent all of her life desperate to be shown that she was worthy of being loved. I tried to show her before she passed, a few months before, that the way I had loved her growing up was enough proof that she was worthy of love. that if she can say she isn\u2019t worthy of it, then my love I showed her as a kid meant nothing. she finally started to understand.\n\nwe were going to go to college together. I wanted to help her get her GED. to start going to school. to make the loser of a boyfriend she has had for years go work instead of making her work 2 part time jobs being disabled and still not being able to make the rent. he did nothing for her other than steal from her and hurt her.\n\nI had to protect myself by moving out those years ago. she didn\u2019t want to listen when I knew he was bad news. i\u2019ve known since I was 14. I just wish I could have done something to save her. I wish he never met her. I wish I could have been there to stand up for her when he hit her.\n\ni\u2019m terrified. i\u2019m so scared of being angry. I don\u2019t know how to deal with the fact that someone took her from me. she was my everything for years. someone so cruel took her from me and made her be in pain. no one knew he had hit her. no one knew her migraine was not just a migraine. she couldn\u2019t tell anyone or go to the doctor because she would have to admit he hurt her. again.\n\ni thought I processed it all when she died. but being told today that she died due to blunt force trauma and brain bleeding makes me feel like I lost her this morning. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know how to feel. I feel like my world just broke. again. and now I have to deal with detectives, with getting information, with anything that I can do to help them investigate.\n\nI just want my mom back.",

I suffer from anxiety and depression and was diagnosed with Cyclothymic Disorder. So yes, I deal with body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria. I won't deny that it likely fuels a lot of my feelings. \n\nBut despite that, I am extremely self-conscious of my weight. And you'd think I'd be fine with it. I support body positivity heavily and would not ever judge others about their weight. Weight is not a proper scale of health, nor should it be tied to your self-worth; weight is weight. It only ever seems to be myself that I judge for my stomach. \n\nI have a potbelly. When I look in the mirror, all I see is my too-large stomach. And how it doesn't match the body that I'm SUPPOSED to have. And I do everything in my power to hide it because it causes me so much embarrassment. I wear high waisted skirts and pants, I'll tighten my belt just a little too much to tie it in, and I'll wear shape wear all so I don't have to acknowledge it. It makes me feel like less of a woman. Which I know is stupid. Women come in all shapes and sizes. Hell, my girlfriend is plus-sized and she's the most attractive woman I've ever laid eyes on. And yet, I still can't help but compare myself to other women, who have flat stomachs and small shoulders. \n\nI can never stick with exercise long enough to see any results. I like eating unhealthy, sugary foods. I eat a lot, in part to help my chest grow bigger, as HRT affects new fat distribution. I like to eat. And I live in the south, so you KNOW the food here is good. I'm terrible at forming habits. It feels like no matter what I do, I'll never have the body that I actually want.\n\nSo, sometimes, I wish I had an eating disorder. I've TRIED to give myself an eating disorder. I wish that I could go days without food and let my stomach shrink, just so I can finally look the way I want. I wish I could live on scraps of food. But I can't. Food is always there, mocking me until I finally give in.\n\nAnd the worst part is that I feel like I can't tell anybody. I can't talk to my girlfriend about it because it's a trigger for her own weight dysphoria. I have no friends I can talk to about it, and I'm terrified to talk to my parents about it. I hate the way my body looks and I wish I could just force it to look the way I want.",

    "selftext": "Basically, the title, here's some context.\n\nI (F19) and my best friend D(F19), have been close friends since elementary school. The summer before COVID me and my parents moved to South Florida for the start of high school, and still we talked everyday. We would talk on Facetime for hours, fall asleep on the phone, play multiplayer games, and watch movies through shared play together. We got through college app season together, first jobs, and she was the first person I came out to. I've never had a sibling, but I'll always call her my sister. Even though we've practically been 1000+ miles apart for almost 6 years, she's always my #1 call. I tell her I love her everytime we hang up. \n\nD is in college in New Jersey for nursing, and just recently started sessions with a psychiatrist. She is actively on medication for depression and sleep.  She's always been a very introverted person, but recently she has been telling me that she's been going to different club meetups and parties. I was excited for her because this was a chance for her to make some friends and get out more. We downloaded Life360 together and I told her to keep her phone charged, text me when she got back, and have fun.\n\nI'm not dumb, I know kids are drinking alcohol and smoking at college events. Personally, I've made a life choice to stay away from that crap, but I don't hold judgment to my friends and others partaking. However, D has skipped the little white claws and high noons and started drinking straight vodka and tequila whenever she goes out. At first, when she told me, I just assumed she was taking a little shot here and there and calling it a day. However, some of her friends who know me and our relationship have let me know via Insta that she's drinking to the point of blacking out and keeps multiple bottles of alcohol in her dorm room. I've called D and told her that she's turning into an alcoholic, that she should stop going out as much, and that drinking leads to more destructive behaviors. She brushed me off and called me judgemental and stuck up. She's even blown off our gaming nights to go smoke with her friends. \n\nLast night she texted and told me she had to call me about something serious. She told me that she was drinking alone last night to the point of wanting to kill herself.  Her roommates had found her called the police and she was brought to a psych ward. She told me that the police and her dad found out about the alcohol and that she ended up coming out to her dad unintentionally. She\u2019s also been lying to her psychiatrist and has been skipping her meds. She said she's been admitted and was calling to let me know so I wouldn't worry. I just told her that I love her like always, and that I'm glad she's still here. \n\nBut after getting off that phone call, all I could think was \u201cI fucking told you so. I told you the dangers of drinking and you ignored me.\u201d I\u2019ll I feel is anger. I feel angry that she would think that way about herself and want to leave me and her parents and her little sister. I\u2019m angry at her on campus \u201cfriends\u201d who observed this behavior and didn\u2019t stop it. They let her get this bad and I wasn\u2019t there to help her. It kills me that I\u2019m halfway across the country and can\u2019t afford to see her and make sure she\u2019s okay. And most of all, I\u2019m upset that if she ended up killing herself, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything about it. I\u2019m just her former middle school friend on FaceTime a million miles away.\n\nI haven\u2019t cried or felt sad and I\u2019m not sure if this is normal.",

    "selftext": "TW: Violence and threats\n\nI work at a care home for people with various physical and mental disabilities. The one thing I absolutely hate is how passive management is with the participants. They let them make any decision they want even if it ends up with someone falling down the stairs with little to no consequences.\n\nThe one guy they are horrible with and let him get away with anything. He is extremely violent and has hurt me and others on numerous occasions. The only consequence he faces is when he breaks things he just doesn't get to use it till it's fixed or replaced. Which is nothing, the worst part is this guy is smart and knows he can do whatever he wants and get away with it.\n\nThe worst time I experienced this was when me and another staff took him out to buy him candy with his own money. He wanted to buy a knife (it was a butter knife) and we said 'no'. It took alot just to get him away from the knifes and out the door. We managed to get him some of his candy and as protocol we gave him some. Still mad with us daring to say 'no' he threw the candy at me and tried to run back to the store to \"get the knife so I can stab you f*ckers\". I had to do a hold to stop him from going too far and hurting someone else. However the hold we are trained to do doesn't restrain both hands so they decided to scratch at my arm hard, to the point I was bleeding. It took a long time to calm him down and get him back in the car. The part that broke me was the fact he wanted me the one shaking and crying to apologize and my coworker who did nothing but call management to let them know what was going on also tried to get me to apologize. I couldn't cause I went completely non-verbal and just got in the car. I missed a week of work cause I was terrified of that participant and was locked up in my room. I filed a report for injuries, but nothing came of it.\n\nNow I just hate the participant. I'll never do anything to hurt or try and upset him, but I will always hate him and wish for his downfall.\n\nOne thing I want to note is that I understand alot of the people I work with can't control how they act. This one in particular also struggles to control their anger. However I've seen them handle 'no' from their parents and staff he likes and he was completely fine. He just doesn't like me and gets upset any time I ask him to do something or deter him away from dangerous things (I'm not rude about it I always ask very nicely I'm just not a guy or pretty enough so he hates me).\n\nTLDR: I despise a guy cause he can get away with anything he wants, including hurting others and he knows it.",

    "selftext": "Last year, I think I was sent an email in December saying that I \"needed to send proof of income\" effectively tomorrow. It was also a \"2nd notice.\" assuming the 1st one was lost in the mail. I was already gathering that for a different service, so I just made copies of the pay stubs, waited an hour, and turned in everything asked. That is when I was told that I had been Flagged for something involving income and needed to see a medicare insurance adjuster. I wondered if any were available and was told no and that I needed to come back tomorrow or call in.\n\nI asked if I could make an appointment but was told none were available, as \"due to holiday training and staff shortages, we are unable to fill requests for appointments at the moment.\" However, I would \"put a note in my file that it was a late notice.\"\n\nI asked if I could get an extraction as I never received proper notice. I was then told, \"Also, due to staffing shortages and holiday training, we cannot do extractions, nor can we, as we are not responsible for lost or delayed mail.\"\n\nShe then told me that the best option was to come in at 7 in the morning to be the first in line. I told them that I work tomorrow and can't come in. I was told I didn't have to, but it would be at the \"small penalty\" of losing my medical and dental through California. So I did that and was one of the first 15 people waiting in line for the doors to open in cold, rainy weather. I got a ticket and waited for about an hour, thinking I could make it to work on time at 1030am. I sat and told them I was there for a medical adjustment with a medicare insurance adjuster.\n\nI was told they were not one and that the hour's wait was to set an appointment. I was told I could have called or come in earlier to have a specialist set it up. I told them I tried yesterday, and there were none available. I was hit with, \"Well, it's not my fault you poorly planned this. Seeing as you had 2 weeks.\" I told them about the late notice and a note in the file. The man eye-rolled me and just scribed out the latter on my ticket. Telling me to expect my number to be called again in 2 hours and that in the future to be \"more mindful of prep and time management.\"\n\nI called my boss; he was surprised but was cool with me coming in later as long as I kept him updated. And so I waited as eight became 9 and 9 became 10. I checked in as it should be around time for the meeting and was told due to a lack of adjusters today, there will likely be unseen delays. So I had just to wait, and I skipped breakfast to get there, messing with my phone and eating some of the fruit offered there. I messaged my boss every half hour as he was skeptical that any department could wait this long.\n\nby the 11 or 12th hour of the day, they started giving out parking passes as the parking lot had a two-hour limit and needed one. There was a small argument between one of the managers and staff members about whether they should ask the ones here over the limit just to move their cars as they technically violate the parking code, and we shouldn't be encouraging that behavior. a 3rd staff member had to step in just to hand out the passes.\n\nSo, by the 13th hour and a half, when I was falling asleep and wondering how much of my shift I would have left, someone poked me in the face and told me to look up. A new number had popped up. It was mine.\n\nI go through the door with paperwork in hand to see the Ajestor about what the problem was. It turns out they wanted to know if I had SSI payments and asked why I didn't have any from SSI. I told her that I wasn't on SSI, and she told me that was the problem. When applying for Calcover, I marked down that I had a federally recognized disability, autism. So they wanted to see if I was making too much for the program; when I didn't show any SSI payouts, i was flagged for possible fraud and they tried to ask me in person if I had any other forms of assisted living payouts or financial aid. I told them i was disqualified due to being able to work.\n\nSo the adjustor told me that next time, I needed to uncheck that box as legally, for health care, I didn't have a federally recognized disability as it implies I'm getting federal aid. So I waited nearly 6 hours for a 15-minute meeting asking me not to say I have autism on a federal level.\n\nMy god, why do we put people through this?",

    "selftext": "I don't really know what to make of this, and I don't really have anyone to talk to about it. I (23F) started my master's this academic year and was brought in as a graduate assistant in one of the academic advising offices on campus. Our office has a new director who comes from a high school administration background and relatively new advisors (two of them, both have been here five years max).\n\nUntil yesterday, I didn't know why the previous GA left her role. She clearly left in a hurry because my office (her office) still had wall decorations, cork boards with posters and flyers, supplies, and cabinets chock-full of folders with papers, guides, flyers - you name it, it's here. It looked like the place was already in use is what I'm getting at. She created entire binders about our department's programs and even fully stocked the supply closet that we have. I knew she hadn't left due to graduation, it had to be either right before she graduated or she hadn't renewed her contract, but I didn't know why. It's not really my business, but I was curious and wanted to be sure it wasn't for something nefarious.\n\nSo, my suspicions rise when a classmate of mine, M, recognized the office that I said I'm a GA for (a handful of us are GAs, most of them for our college, but me in this advising office) and she brought up that she used to work there in undergrad until she graduated last year. M started asking about names from when she was there, and it became apparent we've had a lot of staff changes in less than a year. I thought, \"Interesting, I wonder why?\" She also did not like most of the people (advisors/director) who are/were here. I kind of shrugged it off, figuring that she probably just had some bad experiences or that the leadership prior to our current director was suboptimal, because I liked my coworkers. Na\u00efvet\u00e9 on my part, I'll admit.\n\nBut something hasn't quite left me since that day: M said the previous director, let's call him Colin, resigned after being caught in a relationship with a student. I took this with a grain of salt because I hadn't heard that, not even from the other student workers who like to gossip, and M had made it clear that she didn't enjoy the office atmosphere.\n\nThings came to a head for me yesterday, when I met with the current director to discuss some issues with the website. Things progressed to how she doesn't like how disorganized the supply closet currently is, and her plans to clean it out with our administrative assistant over spring break. She mentioned having so much stuff left behind by the previous GA, like thick binders of who-knows-what, and not knowing what to do with them. They're multiple 5-inch binders stuffed to the brim.\n\nBringing up the GA snowballed until Director casually mentioned how my coworker, let's call him Andrew, one of the two advisors in our department, was the one caught making sexual advances - and *toward the previous GA.* They had gone out for drinks after-hours (unsure if it was with a group), and he had texted her inappropriately about hooking up. The then-director, Colin, received word of this but didn't want to do anything about it. He was promptly fired for his inaction once an actual, full-blown Title IX case opened against Andrew.\n\nThe GA left after this incident and no one has seen her since. She left everything behind. Her friends harassed the office to try and hold Colin accountable, but it wasn't until the case was opened that action was taken.\n\nI'm in shock and just don't know how to process these instances. *He* came onto my predecessor, yet she left, and he is still working here. I don't even know if she's graduated, but it makes sense now why her stuff was left behind and why nobody talks about her aside from the student workers who don't know the truth.",

But since last year, it has been a bit up and down between all the three of us. It all started when my ex suddenly showed up at my door wanting to talk. But this girl friend of mine got angry at me because I asked back the money I am owed back, and went and told my boyfriend that my ex showed up, we \u201ctalked\u201d and some other stuff. This caused a major break in between our relationship, and I only knew about this recently that she was the one who ratted me out when it wasn\u2019t her place. I would have told him, but she went ahead and told him adding unnecessary untrue details to it.\n\nWe had some misunderstandings, and we moved past that. But as of now, she seems to be becoming more possessive of him, though she has her own boyfriend. She expects him to take her out everywhere, doesn\u2019t include me, and he seems to be doing it. But when I ask him, it\u2019s always reasons and excuses. \n\nShe still owes me a little around $600, and I am honestly scared to ask her about it. They have been doing a lot of video calls, texting constantly and I know it may be nothing but I just cannot digest the fact. I know I need to be more trusting but I feel like a third wheel in my own relationship. He expects me to adjust to this, but why should I be adjusting in MY relationship.\n\nYesterday night, I questioned him about it and he came to hit me. I got shocked that he raised his hand on me when I asked why did he video call her. He keeps saying I am more important to him and I am his first priority but I just cannot understand why he would get so angry when I questioned about it. This was the third time in a row he raised his hand on me. But later consoled me. I asked him to choose between me or her, he said he is in a situation where she is his roommate and he cannot do anything. I hate the fact that she is so touchy around him, I just hate it. \n \nI trust him that he wouldn\u2019t do anything behind my back like sleep with her, but I just cannot let it go.

The moment I push back, I\u2019m met with guilt-tripping and emotional manipulation: \"You\u2019re disobedient.\" \"You\u2019ve dishonored us.\" \"I will never forgive you until the Day of Judgment.\"\n\nAnd many of the things they react this way to aren\u2019t even that big of a deal. For example, I\u2019ve always wanted to cut my hair short, but my mother made it clear that if I ever did, she wouldn\u2019t forgive me and that it would be a a sin hanging over my neck until Judgment Day. Even something as small as asking them to knock before walking into my bedroom turns into an argument, as if having basic privacy is an act of rebellion.\n\nAnd if not through words, they use threats. They tell me they\u2019ll force me into marrying someone against my will or that they\u2019d lock me in a room if I disobey them. Even if they don\u2019t act on these threats, just hearing them is enough to make me feel powerless, like my life isn\u2019t really mine to control.\n\nIt feels like their love is tied to control as if I can only be a \"good\" son or daughter if I follow everything they say without question. Their obsession with obedience and authority makes it impossible for them to see me as an independent person. It\u2019s as if my life belongs to them, and any choice I make for myself is seen as betrayal.\n\nI know they believe they\u2019re acting out of love, but it doesn\u2019t feel like love. It feels like a cage. It\u2019s exhausting to constantly be torn between my own happiness and their expectations. I\u2019m tired of feeling like my worth is tied to how obedient I am. I just want to be allowed to make my own decisions without fear, guilt, or the weight of their disappointment crushing me.\n\nWhat hurts even more is that when I try to talk about this, I\u2019m always met with the same dismissive responses: \"They\u2019re your parents, you must obey them no matter what\" Society expects the owns who go through this to just accept it, as if their love should come with conditions and control. But I don\u2019t want to spend my life suffocating under obligations I never agreed to. ",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I really need some advice cause this is insane, I live in a fairly small country and recently I began dating someone (like it's been 7 months) we get along great and everything is fine, i was out shopping with my mom today and she pointed out someone to me and told me they're my cousin. I'm literally speechless, the person she pointed out is literally the brother of the individual I'm dating, I tried asking how we are related and I doubt it's a close relative, most likely distant and they are not directly related to me. None the less I feel sick and I'm just really uncomfortable, I plan to speak to them about it tonight cause I'm thinking of ending things, I don't think i can continue dating them and I'm glad i found out relatively early on. \n\nI'm confused about how i should feel i know it's not my fault because I didnt know but it still makes me feel disgusted.\n\nI need advice on how to cope with this. \n\n** EDIT: please read the comments before answering, for those of you who want to know, I'm not going to be with this person in any way, shape or form, I was not in a relationship with them we were just going on dates and that. I'm not interested in being with any one remotely related to me. \n\n",

    "selftext": "I have been struggling with depression and bipolar for years but being back with loved ones (family, friends and lover) made me realize how loved I am. There has been some added responsibilities and I learned how to be more compassionate and empathetic after 10 years of living abroad. Some years, alone. \n\nI don't believe life gets better before. Now I discovered that it does get better but not in a typical way where suddenly your career, health, relationships would work out at the same time. There will be some tests that would drive me insane but I knew I would pull through. \n\nMaybe when I'm 40 I would be back to square one but the lesson I learned before will always be relevant. \n\n",
