    "selftext": "I recently switched jobs and was excited at the prospect of making some friends. I don't need friends to go club ing with or anything. Just people I can chat with at work and goof off a little, text a meme once in a while. I didnt realize until my first day that there isn't a lot of staff and I am one of two guys. Doesn't really bother me, I'm gay and generally get along just fine with women once they realize. Most of the people there are an age bracket or more older than me. There are four girls that are a bit older than me but close enough. One is very mean so nobody likes her, but I really like the other three. \n\nThey have all been friendly with me and helpful with questions. I think I'm an okay person to get along with. I'm a good worker, I'm friendly, I'm pretty easygoing, and I have good hygiene so I dodge all the major strikes. From what I can tell we all align in bigger moral ideas and opinions..I was hopeful. I tried to talk to them a couple times  a day and joke around a little. \n\nUnfortunately I'm annoying and weird. I don't know how not to be, but people have told me I'm both. I was extremely unpopular throughout school and got beat up for it. I try to not talk to much. . I ask a lot of questions, probably to many for working there for a couple months but it's a hard job. My mouth is a little faster than my brain sometimes, but nobody has ever described me as mean.  People always tell me I'm weird but dont give specifics. Again, I try my best not to be. I don't have anything I'm obsessed with, I dress an look normal, I am pretty good at adjusting conversation for what is appropriate. I don't know what's wrong with me but something is. I'm a rather anxious person, and maybe that makes me a bit awkward and annoying, but to the point of not liking me idk. I hope not.\n\nI just know that this week I've started to see them pull away. I don't think they want to talk to me anymore and I don't know why.  None of them have asked for my number or to hang out, they commonly go to lunch together when their breaks allow and I've never been invited. I was devastated when I was talking to one of them when it was slow and I could see in her eyes she didn't want to talk to me.\n\nA couple of the older people (like fifty plus) are nice to me at least, but I'm not going to hang out with women over twice my age. I'm just lonely. Theres a couple people I'm afraid of talking to because they're not so nice. I don't know what I'm going to do if the three I was hoping would at least become my work friends end up hating me as well. If nobody likes me maybe I'll get fired. I'm on a probation period now and the economy isn't exactly helping. \n\nIs there any way to figure out what's wrong with me? Could I turn it around or now that they've turned negative is it a lost cause? Maybe it's stupid wanting friends at work I mean this isn't summer camp it's work. Maybe I'm a bad annoying person who never shuts up and just don't realize it. ",

If not, have a nice walk. So he ends up taking the lift.\n\nNow. Should I tell his wife? We are not friends, and I do not think much of her...\nBut, the first couple of times I shrugged it off \"not my life or problem\"....\nNow it's almost all the time and no longer think it's appropriate even if you dislike the person or not.. \nShould I tell his close friends?\nTell his inlaws?\nTell his wife?

The boy is having trouble reading words like \u201cdroid\u201d, \u201cgiggled\u201d, \u201cmeant\u201d, etc. nobody seems to take the time to teach him and he\u2019s literally getting packets and homework assignments that they barely work on in school. He\u2019s in an inner city school and I have another cousin attending there too. It\u2019s so sad how poor these kids\u2019 education really is. This boy can hold a good conversation about most things and can understand what you teach him when he stops beating himself up over stuff and takes the time. Because of this experience along with the other cousin of mine who goes to the same school, I\u2019ve really lost faith in our education systems and the future of our people and country. At his age I, and even the kids who didn\u2019t like reading, could easily read chapter books. These kids are incapable of doing that. Also common core math is frustratingly annoying.

This weekend I was using his phone to look up a restaurant and I saw in his search history/bar that he looked up at least 2 specific women\u2019s only fans leaked. And he clicked on multiple websites just to find these women\u2019s leaked images. I also thought to look at his twitter after finding this out and saw he looked them up there too. Between these 2 women he clicked on at least 10 different websites to find these women\u2019s leaked photos. the funniest part is that me and these women look nothing alike. These women are beautiful, dark hair, dark eyes. While I\u2019m a redhead with blue eyes. Our bodies are completely different as well. I just feel ugly. He was saying all men do it but I don\u2019t believe that. It just hurts that he sought these women out hard to find pictures of them to pleasure himself to when we\u2019ve been in a committed relationship. I know this is a controversial thing among people but I\u2019ve always thought why do you feel the need to pleasure yourself to other women when you have me? And finding out these women look nothing like me just makes me feel not good enough and it makes me feel so ugly. He knows I\u2019ve battled with weight and eating disorders and I feel like this is making it worse and it is torturing me. The worst part to me is he sought so hard for pictures of them when he went across multiple social media platforms to find them and pleasure himself and knowing they don\u2019t look like me and knowing he\u2019s in a committed relationship. How can I believe when he calls me beautiful yet pleasures himself to women that look nothing like me.

We both told each other prior to us even being \"official\" that we don't really know what it means to be in love, but based on everything i have read, i believe i am in love. We have been together for a short time but have known each other for a long time. I don't believe he will ever love me and there's an internal dichotomy of \"i am okay with unrequited love because we make a good partnership and he is sweet and considerate to me\" and \"what is wrong with me why am i not enough what if one day he realizes he can do better and leaves me.\" I worry a lot when we're together lately that he's thinking of someone else, a past love, maybe someone he's still in love or obsessed with. I of course cannot ask him because it would kill me if the answer is yes, he is thinking about someone else and wishes i was her instead. I already know that he's never really had feelings towards me, which is leading to my skepticism so far. I can take him at face value now when he says he likes me, but it didn't come easy and doesn't come without a voice in the back of my mind saying it's not true. \n\nI found out tonight that basically I'm coming on too strong i guess with verbal affection (\"i miss you\" things like that), and i worry that turns him off from me. I worry that it makes him not want to be with me. I worry that it makes him think I'm desperate, which he did essentially accuse me of a few weekends ago. But i worry that it pushes him away from me. He likes physical reassurances that i want to be with him, physical affection and intimacy, and i need the inverse to feel secure. And i can tell he's making an effort, i think he can tell I'm making an effort. But I worry I've pushed things too far by being too verbally affectionate. I'm worried he's thinking of breaking up with me. \n\nThis weekend I have been considering telling him I love him and it's okay if he doesn't return the feeling, but now I can't. I try very hard to be present and suppress my fears and insecurities when we're together, but I'm sure it's noticeable at times still. There are women from his past I know he had a thing for, and I feel so uncomfortable when he talks about them, I don't know if he's noticed that, and he doesn't do it often but it is very painful. I wonder if he wishes I was one of them instead of who I am. He has denied it, but I do still think a huge reason he's with me is my body. I know he's been attracted to me physically all these years, and so I worry that that is the main draw to me, the main thing that makes him want to stick around. I worry another reason is because we're getting older and we both feel like we're missing life milestones and we could be each other's solution for that. \n\nI am so insecure and scared and worried in this relationship, but I have wanted it for over 10 years, more than 10 years have I had a crush on him. So I am okay with the fact he will never love me. But I do need to cry about it sometimes. ",

I\u2019m 30  years old, 20k in cc debt, 100k owed in loans, 25k owed in student loans, and I was too embarrassed to ever tell my partner the truth. Covid, struggling with mental health, lifestyle creep, all contributed to overspending, not utilizing credit cards correctly, and trying to be something I\u2019m not in front of everyone in my life for the past 3 years. Essentially, and everyone in my circle thinks I\u2019m well off when I\u2019m actually a lying coward. \n\nThe guilt and anxiety of the debt got so bad that I ended my long term relationship. My partner makes 45k and I make 3 times their salary, so planning our wedding was nauseating as I knew there was no way we can afford it as my partner has been depending on me for financial support. Little did they know, we are so poor and I\u2019m in so much debt that it would crush me to continue our relationship and go through with a wedding with this gigantic mess. They don\u2019t deserve it, and they deserve better than me. \n\nI\u2019m so embarrassed. But I realize that ending the relationship and working towards paying down debt aggressively was the only way I can move forward without feeling more like a piece of shit than I already do. Right now they still don\u2019t know the truth, and they are probably so confused, hurt, and angry right now because the relationship seemingly ended out of nowhere. But I\u2019m only trying to protect them, and I hate myself that I let this drag on for as long as it did. I only hope that the damage and hurt I\u2019m saving them from will outweigh the damage and hurt I\u2019ve already caused. For now, I\u2019m just relieved that the love of my life is now safe from me, my lies, and my debt. I love you and I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t able to be a better person for you. Thank you for all these years.",

    "selftext": "Okay I don't even know where to start. Our relationship has always been weird. We are definitely more open to talking about very tabo/ out there topics. But I won't be honest I lost trust a year ago. (maybe I like to be hurt idk). I (23F) have been with my partner (22F) for over a year now. The first time this happened we here (friends) to the public but together in private. It she was in the bathroom at a club with another girl. She told me after I asked 3 times. And it also took me asking so many times what happened and \"is there anything else\" for her to finally admits it. Then the second time was the exact same thing at the club but she was drinking that night and I saw it all happen. The third time I went away for to work in a different city for my job for two weeks and the girl she was seeing texted me the SS of there messages. It was so bad one of them said \" I could cheat on her and she wouldn't even know\". When I confronted her she lied to my face.\nLike she always does. And even went as far as saying that these are photoshopped. She denied and lied and always played the victim. Saying she was forced and felt like she had too. And then blame me for things that made no sense what so ever. The third time was recent. She went out with new friends she met online. She told me there names it was all good she said she was going over to hang out and play games. She don't come back to her house until 5:30 am. (1 have her location). I knew in my gut something happened. When I told her it feels off like you cheated because you came back so late she brushed it off like it was nothing. I'll break it down how this one went. I called her to talk about it she told me they kissed once and that's it. I was very upset. Then we talked more about it that night. She told me they held hands that this girl \"listened to her and heard her\". ( she had a tendency to completely blow up at me in arguments so l don't always tend to listen when she's yelling at me). Then she said she wanted and open relationship with this girl has her gf and me in the side. I then saw her two days later.\nShe told me in person they kissed max 3 time and she had her arm over her. I once again had to ask 10000 times to get this info. And I asked her\n1000000 more times \"are you sure there is nothing else\". I then asked her to get me food and water because I wasn't feeling good. I looked through her phone I know I shouldn't have but I did. I say the most disturbing texts of my life. They were very inappropriate with each other and have been texting like this for a week now. Very lovey texts too all day and night. Calling me her friend and saying she's with her \"friend\" AKA ME! Telling her jokes | was saying but as if it was coming from my partner to this girl. Telling her she's skinny and pretty. ( l am a comfortable weight I like my size, I also work out and enjoy building muscle and strength not slimming figure). I confronted her and he lied again. Right after lying to my face and telling me there wasn't more. I lost it and read the entire texts with her sitting in the ground in my room. Now she's all sweet with me. She's at my house watching my dog while I visit my dad (I had already planned this trip and that's why she was at my house in the first place). I go back to my house tomorrow where she will be.",

I ran away from my mother and my father because me mother is an alcoholic and my father went to prison for child abuse material (photos of me). I ended up in foster care for a while, living on the streets with my son for a year, and finally landed a job and got to sleep in the back room of the cafe. My mother found us, and I panicked, flew him back to our home country and now he lives with my boyfriends parents. So now, my boss, and a coworker and I all moved into a flat together, because I was struggling being away from my son. A couple months later, the boss says he's inherited an old miners cottage and will NOT be moving in, he offered it to me, I took it. My mother has a new husband, and he's lovely, so I invited them, and my older sister to stay with me, I didn't realise they thought it would turn into freeloading. My sister got a job and moved into the city and I'm so proud of her! My step dad works as a teacher and he's great, helps around the house, cooks when I'm not feeling well, ect. My mother however, shows up uninvited, drinks herself half blind and then calls me to pick her up, I can't say no to her, she's my mum, I love her, even if she was an arse. Sometimes, I wish they told me thank you, even just once. My son is little and the sweetest kid I know, but it sucks to sometimes feel like I'm overlooked.

    "selftext": "Whenever I read through best of reddit or any of the various relationships subs, I see guys who are basically the \"nice guy\", who only befriend women they want to date.  It basically always sends my mind careening back to obsess about how or if I was a \"nice guy\" in high school.\n\nI pined for a girl all through high school.  My graduating class was 465 kids but we were in all the honors/advanced classes and did debate/forensics/scholars bowl/mock trial together as well.  There was basically a group of about 25-35 people who did all the honors stuff and we were basically a high school within the school.\n\nAnyway, if this now woman even bothers to remember me, she probably views me as the quintessential \"nice guy\", and honestly I am so embarrassed/guilty about it that my neruodivergernt mind can't ever let it fully go. \n\nLike I said, I made friends with this girl when we were sophomores (our high school was 10/11/12), and she already had a boyfriend.  I *really* was not trying to be *that guy*, but I think everyone in our class (and I later found out several of our teachers) knew I had feelings for her.  I am certain she did.  \n\nJunior year she breaks up with her boyfriend and has a new one before I even knew.  Our senior year, there was a really tragic situation and the person she was seeing passed away. Now, I am not such an AH as to immediately make a move or anything but by the spring I got the idea she basically wanted me to ask her out.  So I did. However, earlier in the year, before the event that resulted in her being single, I asked another girl from the group of AP students to Prom. This girl had then written me a letter explaining that she hadn't expected to be asked at all, and was flattered and would accept as long as I understood it was completely platonic. I said I understood and that was fine.\n\nNow, I don't know what other people would have done, but it never crossed my mind to try and back out of taking the first girl I had asked.  We had another friend who was kind of looking for a date and the two of the ended up going together.  The monday after Prom she dumped me for him. So we dated for like all of 3 weeks.  I did some dumb stuff.  I wrote a cringey please don't break up letter.  I tried to be more outgoing with our friend group, and it came across as weird and try hard.  I asked out another girl who I thought was cute but had nothing in common with and got rejected and told to my face that I should just wait till college because *any girl in our high school* would know they were a rebound and that nobody would not be interested.\n\n\nNow what really sucked was that we got to go to national tournaments for both Mock Trial and Debate/Forensics together. So I had basically two school funded pseudo vacations with my \"ex\" and without her boyfriend and while I had a good time, it was also really rough for my 18 year old self. It was just impossible to fit myself back into the \"just a friend box.\"  I still had strong feelings, she knew that, and I hope I didn't make her miserable.  While going to fetch her and  the girls she was sharing a hotel room with at the Forensics national tournament, I heard her talking about me through the door saying that I was \"too intense\" and that was part of why she broke up with me.  That has stuck with me my entire life (my wife loves how \"intense\" I can be so things worked out).\n\nWhile at the mock trial national tournament, one evening our coach/chaperone pulled me aside and just asked how I was doing.  As we talked I ended up breaking down and crying. That's also where I found out that yes the teachers all knew as well, and yes they did have opinions on student relationships.\n\nAnyway, I look back now and clearly, yes this stuff did *affect* me.  It contributed to who I am today, but at the same time, it seems dumb because we only dated for less than a month.  But, for me  there was also friendship with her knowing she had me as a backup/fallback if she ever wanted. That probably seems really incel/misogynistic but I willingly put myself there and she couldn't possibly have been unaware.  It was clearly super unhealthy for me, unfair to her, and that is why I look back and feel guilty and embarrassed.  The fact I am now 41 and can still remember and write about all of this shows that it for sure impacted me, but like I said when I think back on it, I pretty much figure she must think I am/was the sort of \"nice guy\" who befriends women exclusively to try and date them.\n\nI feel a fair amount of guilt over this, not the least of which is in part because I have been married for 15 years to the most beautiful, amazing woman I could imagine.  Yet, any time I read a story on reddit with a guy complaining about who women they know date, or women talking about why do guys act like this, I am basically catapult to thinking about how immature I was.

    "selftext": "So the other day, a close male friend of mine told me he is sending his fiance on an expensive solo paid vacation. I inquired why he wasn't going with her, and he informed me in so many words \"because he has needs\" and that he has his own hotel booked with the sole intention of cheating/unfaithfulness. \n\nWhy? Because apparently her genitalia is offensive and disgusting to him and he can't perform oral sex on her. He told me he must perform oral sex to be fulfilled in life, and he \"just has to\". \n\nI asked him why he wasn't just being honest with her, and he said it was because it would crush her. I said If oral sex is THAT important to you then you guys need to break up. He refused to break up saying he loved her and they had built a life together and then he wouldn't have anyone to help him with his special needs daughter. And he is ADAMANT he will not get caught unless I say something to his fiance. \n\nI inquired about lights out, blindfolds, etc. He absolutely refused and says her stuff is beyond disgusting. \n\nLet me be clear. He is not a prize in any way. Without him paying for the privilege, I don't see any random woman near him just randomly accepting oral sex from him. So I'm not sure if this will happen. But it's definitely put me in a weird situation because I am friends with both of them. I don't want to get involved but I feel this is really awful for him to do. It's changed how I look at him completely. I never would have thought him capable of something like this. \n\nJust needed to get this out of my brain. I feel so bad for her. \n\nEDIT:\n\nWow. I did not expect this to blow up like that. I will try to clarify some of the questions I've received.\u00a0\n1) yes, I also wish this was fake. It isn't.\u00a0\n\n2) they are not married. They are engaged. The special needs child is not theirs. The biological mother of the child lives in another state.\u00a0\n\n3) for those asking why I'm friends with someone, Why does anyone have friends? Nobody is perfect and everyone makes mistakes. But I've been friends with him for a decade. Longer than I've known his fiance who I met through him. He's been a really wonderful friend. And He's never mentioned or thought or indicated any kind of behavior like this to me until this JUST HAPPENED, YESTERDAY, and I was completely shocked and struggling to process it. That is why I said what I said in the original post. My vision of him has shattered. I am not sure yet how I am going to proceed.\u00a0\n\n4) those asking for information about her genitalia, I really do not have the answers you are seeking. I asked about smell or scent or taste and he was adamant it was strictly because of appearance. The only description I got, which left me very confused,\u00a0 was that it \"looks like a pokemon\". He also did mention that she has a disorder (I forgot the name) of where the hair follicles of your pubic hair turns slightly ulcerous and the hair follicles become infected. He said this also disgusts him because apparently it's \"open wounds\".\nI asked all the questions you guys are asking. Why isn't she on medication or treatment for the condition. Labiaplasty. Etc.\u00a0 The short and unfortunate answer is lack of funds and lack of health insurance for both parties. We live in a VERY poor area of a VERY red state. And yes, I told him he should have paid for her healthcare instead of a vacation.\u00a0\n\n5) I am certain he is not gay.\u00a0\n\n6) for those of you that have reached out privately to confirm if I am someone you know and if this story is about your partner, I want to say how sorry I am and how sad I am that this is happening to other people. I can't even imagine.\u00a0",

Average looking, a regular irl social group, good career ambitions and in school for them, etc. But in every situation all I can think of is the long term position I need to be in and how much time I'm wasting not doing and saying whatever I can to most efficiently get to that position, a long term irl relationship.

    "selftext": "Hey, everyone. First time posting on Reddit (thanks to The Click for giving me enough confidence to post).\n\nI was baptized, had my First Holy Communion, and I am an Altar Server in the Catholic Church. Now that I\u2019m old enough, I have started Confirmation classes. However, I am not happy with this.\nI am an alt/punk kid that identifies as trans, bi, and grey-asexual. With my bright blue and red half-and-half dyed hair and \u201codd\u201d fashion sense, I stick out like a sore thumb.\nI feel like I was forced into this just to make my mom and grandmother happy. I have expressed my discomfort in Catholic beliefs for over a year now, but it feels like nobody is listening to me. I don\u2019t feel anything when I attempt to pray. It feels like God isn\u2019t listening. I don\u2019t feel loved, and I don\u2019t feel light from Him.\nI\u2019ve walked out of Confirmation Class crying more times than I can count. I feel out of place and uncomfortable at church events and retreats. I don\u2019t feel a connection to anything that is said at masses.\nToday was the final straw. There was Confession instead of class. My mom and I were sitting together, listening to the process for Confession and we were given a few questions as food for thought. I really didn\u2019t like the questions, especially the ones about my relationship with God. I started crying again, as I hated the fact that I just didn\u2019t see it the way others did.\nI managed to go up and get my confession over with, but after I still felt nothing. My mom sighed, handed me some tissues, and we stepped out and talked for a bit.\nInstead the discussion being consoling, it just felt like she was making up excuses to get me to stay in Catholicism. I told her that I felt nothing connection and that this is making me unhappy.\nWe ended up leaving. She didn\u2019t speak to me about it on the car ride home. She only talked about other random things to try to lighten the tension, I didn\u2019t want to hear it. It feels like she\u2019s ignoring me. I don\u2019t know what to do.\nSorry for the long ramble, but I just needed to let this out.\nAny advice or kind words are appreciated. \nNote:  I am not targeting anyone who is religious. Religion can be great and can bring people together. If you have found comfort in religion, stick with that comfort.",

    "selftext": " Her husband died today. She had been faithfully taking care of him for a while, now. His body was lying in the middle of their small, stuffy, overheated living room. She had been doing cpr on him, following the 911 operator\u2019s instructions. \n\n\nHe\u2019d been sick for a long time. Agent Orange lung cancer from his time in Vietnam. Even so, she was not prepared for his passing in any way. \n\n\nShe\u2019s one of those women that is unable to function on her own. She always depended on her husband to tell her what to do.  \n\n\nWhile we were waiting on the  coroner to arrive, several of us were in the crowded living room, trying to comfort the new widow. The conversation drifted through various death and health-related subjects, all of it floating past the dead person on the floor like he wasn\u2019t even there - and he really wasn\u2019t. \n\n\nThere was no sense of a person under that white sheet.  Their two small dogs both gave off a sense of a soul, that awareness of being, just like the living people in the room did. That person-shaped lump under the sheet could have been rolled up bedclothes for all the \u201cawareness\u201d it gave off. \n\n\nHe, his soul, his essence, the thing that made him, him, was no longer there. It really brought home to me that the physical body is not really the person. It\u2019s just what people see. It\u2019s the soul, the part of a person you can\u2019t see, that makes you, you. \n\n\nA family friend came to take her and her two little dogs to his house. She\u2019s lost, grieving, and woefully unprepared, now adrift without her longtime safe harbor. \nShe\u2019s in her late 70\u2019s. I doubt if she\u2019ll live there in that house alone. She\u2019ll probably sell the place. \n\n\nI wonder if she will forever see her husband lying on that tiny living room floor, first as she was desperately doing cpr on him, and then as the EMT\u2019s draped that white sheet over him, covering his face. \n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone now,\u201d everyone\n told her. \u201cHe\u2019s not suffering anymore.\u201d And he did suffer, for years, always struggling to get enough air into his lungs, even while breathing pure oxygen. \n\n\nSo it\u2019s her and the two little dogs now. Her family friend will have to emotionally carry her through the next days and weeks of the funeral, Social Security, VA, death certificates, all the financial, insurance, and vehicle paperwork they failed to set up ahead of time in order to avoid just such a situation as this. \n\n\nI guess it can be understood that one or both of them just couldn\u2019t bear to think about \u201cthe end\u201d for him, even though it was staring them squarely in the face. It IS an awfully hard thing to think about and accept. \n\n\nShe did all she could to care for him, knowing how it would eventually end, while desperately denying it. Now she\u2019s broken. I don\u2019t think, with her dependent personality, that she will ever fully recover. \n\n\nI truly hope though, moving forward, that she invests as much care and loving into herself as she did her husband. She has severely neglected herself - her health, appearance, everything, in favor of caring for him. I hope she realizes it\u2019s her turn, now, to care for and love herself. \n\n\nLife goes on. \n\n\nThat fact may be the hardest part of any of this for her. \n",

Excitement, passion, the feeling of being cherished body and soul. I realized these were things I desired so badly. My sex life with my fianc\u00e9 is pretty dead.

He also brought some drinks for us.\n\nWe were drinking a bit and went for one round then drank some more. I was sipping mine over the night and hadn't noticed until later but he had around three beers. The second time we went he was struggling to get it up (because of the alcohol) and I gave him head to help. He slapped my face while I was (which we had talked about but I was hesitant so I wasn't expecting it) I could feel it through my entire skull but didn't stop or say anything.\n\nThe whole time before this he was gentle when I gave him head because of my gag reflex but he started pushing it a bit (not too much though and I could pull away). I think he was getting frustrated that he couldn't get off at this point and flipped me onto by back (I was on a bed he was standing next to). He said he was going to finish on my face. I didn't say anything but the idea of that is so disgusting and I was fearful I guess. He would switch between jerking off and using my mouth (forcefully at this point and my whole body was kind of heaving when I gagged). I was shaking a bit, even my jaw was trembling. At one point my jaw trembled a bit more obviously and he laughed a bit- I think at that. I don't think he could tell that I was uncomfortable and right after this he leaned over my face to try to finish on my chest instead. I was still shaking and at this point crying a bit (my eyes were already a bit wet from gagging). He couldn't see me crying though.\n\nAll I could think was that I felt horrible and I wanted to go home.\n\nHe eventually gave up but noticed at that point that something was up. I wasn't looking at him or saying anything and he asked if he pushed too far. I still wasn't saying anything and I was crying. He hugged me and I cried a bit heavily but quietly- not sure if he noticed. He told me that if I wasn't comfortable I need to tell him to stop right away.\n\nWe showered after and I was still shaken.\n\nWe went to bed right after and the next morning we had fun like usual. He's a good guy and prioritizes me getting off and things like that. I don't blame him for what happened- or didn't until I asked a guy friend if he would stop if someone was shaking and he said yes- like it's obvious. I'm wondering if maybe the alcohol could have caused him to not notice or what?\n\nAnd I understand that even if you consent but don't really want it it still feels horrible and that's why even two days after I feel sick to my stomach thinking about it. I just don't know how to stop thinking about it.\n\n  \nEDIT: Thank you everyone for commenting! I will definitely be talking with him more in-depth about boundaries, safe-words, and physical stops too. \n\nA few other things: he is not my boyfriend- this is a strictly fwb situation and neither of us want a relationship. I don't think what happened was assault I just felt horrible during it but I understand that he's not at fault. The reason I made this post was I was trying to classify what happened to try to feel better and understand- it was a miscommunication for sure and I feel a LOT better about it.  ",

    "selftext": "I (27f) got engaged 6 months ago to my now ex fianc\u00e9 (let\u2019s call him Ross) (30m). However that month was hell with my grandma (who I was extremely close to) dying. I wasn\u2019t dealing with it I was just ignoring the pain and saying I was fine. Well about 3 weeks after we got engaged and my grandma dying I had drinks with a friend (27f). What started off as just a drink or two quickly turned to shots and not remembering even leaving the lounge. Now most of this is from what I have been told by the friend, her husband, and my ex fianc\u00e9. Friends husband (let\u2019s call him Craig) had to come and pick us up and took us back to their place. My fianc\u00e9 had his son and we lived about a hour away from the friends and where we got drinks so he was not able to come get me. The friend and I apparently crashed in their bed with Craig having to wake me up when Ross called. Now this is where stories have changed. At first Ross and I were told that my friend and Craig started doing stuff in the same bed I was in and I woke up and joined in. Whereas recently they have started to say I started everything. The only memory that I have during any of this is thinking \u201cwhat the fuck am I doing\u201d and I then proceeded to run out of the room. According to my ex fianc\u00e9 I then called him and was trying to seduce him over the phone. This is when I apparently told him what happened and he said I sounded excited. My next memory is being on the phone with him and him yelling at me that I had called him just to tell him I cheated on him. We apparently talked a little longer and then hung up. And that night is the night my life fell apart. \n\nSince that night we have tried to make it work but as you can tell he is now my ex fianc\u00e9. He continues to holds resentment towards me and the friends on what happened. I would also like to say that they are no longer friends either after that and the friend texting me telling me that she was the martyr in my relationship. \n\nWell now that everything has ended and stuff has come to light I am struggling. Craig was sober through the whole night and the friend while originally saying she didn\u2019t remember anything is now saying that she remembers all of it. I am the only one that doesn\u2019t remember leaving the lounge or anything at their house besides that one thought and the one line from the phone call. I am feeling very used and taken advantage of because sober or even buzzed I would have never hooked up with anyone but my fianc\u00e9.  Together we have experimented but it was together. I am so unsure of how to feel about that night. Now I am not looking for advice, sympathy, or really anything I just thought it might help if I write this all down. And maybe someone can learn from my story that just because you think you can trust people to protect you that may not be the case and one night can take the life your building away. \n\nIf there are questions I\u2019ll do my best to answer them in the comments.

    "selftext": "I don't really know how to start this or end it or what I'm really trying to say, so please excuse any rambling/unnecessary information.\n\nI'm a 22 year old female who had little to no experience having friends throughout high school. In elementary school I had a fairly large circle of friends, but around the time puberty hit and I became more self aware I realized that my peers found me weird. I was pretty much exclusively friends with guys and I was basically a full head taller than anyone around me, including my male friends. I was pretty bad at actually holding a conversation (I still am) and my interests strayed from even my small group of friends. Middle school came, and that was fine, I still had my group of friends. But in classes where I wasn't sitting with them or we had differing lunch periods, I was basically silent. I was too nervous to make any attempt to talk to those around me or try out social skills.\n\n  \nHigh school was terrible. At first I had the same lunch period as my friends, but then my table slowly filled with other people until my seat was seized by other people and my \"friends\" made no attempt to save me a spot. It felt like I was unable to speak anymore. I had a surgery that took me out of school for 6 weeks, and by the time I came back I was basically a stranger. I unironically tried to live high school like a shadow, keeping my mouth shut except to participate in classes that required it and to participate in group projects.\n\n  \nI didn't really consider myself as having friends until I joined this group on discord. The people in it have changed and we've hopped servers a few times, but the central people have stayed the same. The most relevant are (Fake names, although I'm not worried they'll find this) Cas, NB 22, Ian, M 22, and James, M 23. These people form the core of my friend group.\n\n  \nI don't really know when it started. I think I was about 19. I had been feeling depressed for a few weeks, and self harming was basically my exclusive way of relieving stress. I was questioning my worth even as a human being, fantasizing about ways to remove myself from this world. I guess I started questioning if my larger friend group even wanted me around, since I was so easily discarded by the one I had since childhood. I didn't disclose my depression, didn't mention self harm, didn't share that I wanted to die. I wanted them to feel bad for me, so I accused them of not valuing me as a friend and then, to them, disappeared off the platform for two weeks.\n\n  \nThe next time I checked discord, I had paragraphs of apologies and worried messages basically begging me to come back. It felt euphoric. Even people outside the circle that I consider my closest friends were messaging me, wondering when I'd be back. At the time I don't think I even realize I was being manipulative. But I definitely got hooked on the euphoria of their reaction. The feeling of being wanted.\n\n  \nI've spent the last 3 years doing basically the same thing. Not at the same level. I would guilt trip them for hanging out with other friends. If they said something mean to me I would sulk for days until they apologized, even if it was my fault. I give them the cold shoulder if they do something that displeases me even to a minor degree. I push their buttons until they snap to see what they let me get away with. If I'm angry, they get quiet and relent to anything I say or do. Even then, they always come back.\n\nRecently Cas has been hanging out with two different groups of friends more than us. They keep getting involved in new communities related to their interests and being an important part of other peoples groups. The time they spend with me and the others has dwindled so significantly that I've become a twisted amount of jealous. I've been thinking of ways to convince them to cut those people off. Ways to convince them that the others aren't worth their time, or that they're bad people. I actively want to isolate them from the other groups so that their only choice is us. I want to make them feel bad for thinking that they should devote attention to anything else.\n\n  \nI got on anti depressants a month ago and started attending therapy. The combination is opening my eyes to the things that I do. I am disgusted with myself. I am afraid that I'm going to go to far and they're going to realize what I do and cut me off. I deserve it. I want to be better for them, but as I am now I'm probably more comparable to cancer on the group than a friend. I think I'm afraid that it's too late. I don't know. I don't really want pity.  I'm even disgusted that I feel pity for myself when I put myself in this situation. Even now I don't know if I can be a better person, but I'm too deep into anti depressants to think that I should just remove myself from this world. I just needed to tell someone.",

    "selftext": "I hate that he still makes me insecure and question myself even now, so I needed to vent.\n\nThis post is about me (F), my ex (M), and \"Will,\". We're all in our early 20s, and this all mostly happened \"long\" distance, since both my ex and Will live a couple of hours drive from me.\n\nThe timeline of everything is a bit complicated, but I'll do my best to explain.\n\nMy relationship with my ex was shitty.\nI let myself be pressured into an open relationship because I was too afraid to lose him, and I was, honestly, dumb.\n\nHe used to be my friend, and I though - more, he led me to belive - we had the same ideals about things like relationships.\n\nThis went on for a while, untill he mentioned having a girlfriend.\nI was hurt, thinking I had misunderstood everything, but I wanted to do the right thing and asked if she was fine with how we talked and if maybe we needed to take a step back.\n\nHe claimed it was fine, that they had talked about me a lot, that she knew everything about how we talked and had no problems with it.\n\nI believed him, probably because I wanted to, so we kept talking as usual, even if I eliminated every possible \"hint\" on my end. \n\nEven if I was sad about my unreciprocated crush, I started working on getting rid of my feelings for him.\nIt was not a good period. I am very sensitive to rejection and was stuck between wanting to end the friendship for peace of mind and not wanting to lose someone I cared about. \n\nThen, he came back. While we were on a phone call, he said something pretty explicit, and I gave in.\nI know I was wrong for it, but I just assumed he had broken up with his girlfriend. \nHe had talked about her only one other time, and just to complain about how they were having trouble because his libido was higher than hers. (I know, ew, but rose-colored glasses were still doing their work.)\n\nSo, I flirted back, and we started saying some explicit stuff too, which never happened before that moment.\nHe was also asking for pictures, and being pushy when I told him I wasn\u2019t comfortable yet.\nThis went on for a week before it occurred to me that maybe I should ask about his \"ex.\"\n\nWell, they were still together. He told me he loved her, and she knew he was polyamorous, so he decided he would talk to her.\n\nAnyway, he talked to her.\n\nRadio silence for a week followed.\nFirst, he had to talk to her and suddently felt bad talking to me, and later, he was always \"too tired from that conversation\" to tell me anything.\n\nFinally, I pressured him enough to tell me that his girlfriend, \"Anne,\" wanted to think about things, but we could still be friends as usual.\n\nThat week of silence had made me so scared of losing him that I agreed, and six months of hell started.\nHe would flirt, then ignore me, then get mad at me for being upset.\nI would have breakdowns, ask him to just end everything, and he would guilt me by saying he and Anne were \"working so hard on all of this\" and I was just going to make it all useless, which was unfair to them.\n\nAfter those six month I finally decided to end it. It was hard\u2014he made me feel crazy and like I had used him. He managed to basically twist everything in HIM ending things with ME, but still \"gracing\" me with his presence in my life.\n\nAfter another month, he called.\nHe told me that even if I had hurt him a lot, he understood why I was feeling so anxious and that Anne had finally agreed to us having a poly relationship, where he would date both her and me.\n\nLike the idiot I am, I agreed. I talked to Anne to make sure it was alright, we set boundaries, and we gave it a try.\n\nSkip to another six months later, and things are not good.\nAnne broke up with my ex, and he became depressed. He would do nothing all day, only call me to get him to get out of bed or for s*x stuff.\n\nHe wanted to go to uni but said it was too hard, so he looked for a job\u2014but he was not committing to that either.\n\nHe also started getting very upset for things I did or did not choose to do.\nHe got mad at me for gifting a drawing (I'm a small artist) to a friend\u2014something I have done countless times for countless people, him included.\n\nAnother time, he got mad because a client I had done a commission for gave me a small extra as a thanks, because he was \"disrespecting my boundary\"\n\nHe got mad at me for asking him to please use \"they/them\" pronouns while talking about my best friend of eight years.\n\nHe gave me the silent treatment for going to a concert with the same friend\u2014one I had booked before we were even officially together and had plans to go to before this whole situation even started.\n\nSkip again to the last two weeks of the relationship, and we have plans of going to a convention. Will, a mutual friend, is going to be there too.\nMy ex is supposed to join me on Friday\u2014we have tickets for Saturday.\n\nThursday, Will arrived in my town, and since we had never met in person, he asked me to join him and a group of friends for dinner.\n\nI figured it's a good way to meet, since we would not be alone.\nMy ex knew, said he had no problems with it, so I went.\n\nIt's important to note that my ex wanted to keep our relationship a secret, even though I had asked him to share it with friends, Will included. \n\nAt this dinner, Will was nothing but kind, maybe a bit too affectionate for a friend, but I honestly did not pay much attention to it. \nI am not good at telling when people have feelings for me, and Will's an outgoing guy, so I thought it was just that.\n\nThe next day, my ex arrived and I hosted him.\nThat night, one of the two major events that led me to the breakup happened.\n\n(TW for SA)\n\nI was sleeping, and my ex woke me up for s*x by touching me inappropriately.\nI tell I'm to stop because I'm tired.\n\nHe pouts, and I ask him what's wrong.\nHe tells me, \"I missed you a lot, and you just want to sleep.\"\nI repeat I'm tired and really excited for the next day, and I'm sorry, but I'm really too sleepy to be in the mood.\n\nHe's still upset but agrees, and we go back to sleep.\n\nThis happens again. At least another two times, but I don't really know because I still need a few minutes to understand stuff once I've been woken up. I'm starting to feel unsafe.\n\nThe next day, I wake up with a bad stomach and back pain.\nHe \"jokes\" that maybe he did something to me in my sleep.\nI am disgusted and want to get out of bed.\n\nHe hugs me to keeps me there, and it takes me a while to manage to even just get up.\n\nAnd then, the slowest morning of my life starts.\nI wanted to get dressed, make breakfast for both of us, and then go to the convention by 10:30 AM.\n\nBy 11 AM, I was in tears (I do cry a lot when I'm stressed), begging my ex to just let me get ready\u2014and to get ready himself\u2014because I had paid a lot for the ticket, and it was important to me to be there.\nI'm also someone who manages anxiety by having \"plans\", and having someone just ignoring an agreed upon plan without comunicating makes me stressed. He knew this.\n\nWe finally got on the train, and I was upset. \nHe was mad at me for being upset, and we argued.\nHe told me he thought it was better to get there later but knew I would \"get worked up\" if he told me, so he didn\u2019t want to \"deal with me.\" Instead, he just took things slow so that \"I had to adapt to his pace\", and it was the better like that.\n\nI was so shocked about what he was saying, for the first time I felt like he was the crazy one and not me.\n\nI tried to make him see why that was wrong. \nI said, \"Remember when you got to an event you really cared about 30 minutes late and were sad? This is the same for me.\"\nLike he's some toddler who needs to learn empathy.\nHe agreed it was the same but still refused to apologize, so I let it go to enjoy the convention.\n\nI was on edge all day, constantly thinking about what I would do if \"something bad\" happened, even though I wasn\u2019t sure why I felt that way.\n\nWe met Will and finally told him we were a couple\u2014 to be honest, he had to ask because my ex did not want me to say it, he just agreed to hold my hand and \"not lie if he asks\".\n\nThe rest of my ex's stay went normally. He left, and a couple of days later, Will called me to tell me he had feelings for me.\nHe made it clear he didn\u2019t expect anything from me, planned to take as many steps back as needed, and that my ex already knew. \n\nI honestly did not expect it because I had never done anything for him.\nWith both my first and second boyfriends (the one in this story), we got close after I supported them through a rough period, but I had never done that for Will.\n\nThat also made me think a lot\u2014my ex had a very \"transactional\" mindset. He never did anything just for nothing, and I didn\u2019t like that about him. But he had convinced me it was normal, that I was just a people-pleaser. (I am, but not as detached from reality as he made me out to be.)\n\nHe would always list things he did for me (like consoling me when I was stressed) and things I didn't do for him (like not being good enough at listening him rant about his life because I don't understand his struggles enought to comfort him, and I'm not logical enough for giving advice, apparently.)\n\nI decided to take a few days to process my feelings and focus on my relationship with my ex, figuring out how to deal with everything, even if right then I did not feel close to him at all.\n\nThen, the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back came.\n\nAs stupid as it seems, it was a drawing\u2014just a dumb character that Will had made, standing close to my dumb character and hugging them.\n\nI had done this MANY TIMES.\nI love drawing people's characters with mine. I do it for friends, even for mutuals and strangers on the internet, just because I enjoy it. It\u2019s something I love doing, and people usally like receiving them so it's a win-win.\n\nI had been working on it before Will\u2019s confession, it was done and I posted it, like I do for any other drawing I finish.\nI really did not see it as important, I had done countless similar drawings and I was also trying to keep a regular posting schedule, so that my account would get more interactions and I could maybe get commissions.\n\nOne day, first thing in the morning, my ex texted me a screenshot of it.\n\"I was finally happy after a while, but this ruined my day.\"\nAnd\n\"I was also going to 'touch myself' but I don't want to anymore\"\n(First, ew, second, good, maybe do something else with your day)\n\nI couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\n\nI messaged Anne, and we finally shared everything about him.\nWe had never done that before because he didn\u2019t want us to, always claiming to be a private person and saying it was unfair to talk about our relationship.\n\nBut all his gaslighting came out. We shared stories, feelings we had both experienced but that he had convinced us were just in our heads\u2014the same things I just described in this post, things I thought were just me being too sensitive, timelines that didn\u2019t add up...\n\nI was sad \u2014 for about a day \u2014 but mostly, I was angry.\n\nThat night, I called him, confronted him, and then broke up with him. \nHe played dumb, kept saying he knew nothing about it and I should have talked about it.\nBut he never apologized for what he did. Just for \"what I felt he did\".\nI was disgusted and furious.\n\nLater that night, while I was crying myself to sleep, Will called, and I told him what had happened.\nHe was so kind and caring\u2014he comforted me, helped me calm down, and validated my feelings.\n\nI fell asleep with him on the phone.\n\nI know this was long, but I needed to explain why I moved on so fast. I don\u2019t love my ex at all from the moment I texted Anne. It was like a switch flipped. \nI went from loving him to feeling nothing but hate and disgust in about two hours.\n\nAnd I admit that Will was part of why I broke up\u2014not because I wanted to be with him, but because he showed me what genuine affection feels like.\n\nI never told Will I had feelings for him before breaking up, but I did tell him he was a good person and that I liked him in general.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Will and I started dating. At first, we planned to just talk and be very close friends until I felt 100% over the anger and hurt, but it just happened.\n\nHe took a train at 5 AM to be with me when my cat was diagnosed with cancer. He hugged me, made me watch a movie to take my mind off of it, shared stories about his old cat that had the same illness, and told me to cherish every moment I had with her.\n\nIn that moment, I knew he was the person I wanted to be with. That was the kind of care and emotional maturity I had always looked for in a partner.\n(Of course there was more, but that was an important moment for me)\n\nSo, we officially started dating shortly after.\n\n(For those wondering, my cat is still okay. She\u2019s a fighter. Even though the tumor can\u2019t be operated on, we\u2019re making sure she has the best possible quality of life with the help of our vet. She\u2019s had a great 14 years so far, and we want to keep it that way. She and her brother are getting lots of cuddles and treats.)\n\nSo\u2026 I know this was long and messy, but the point is: my ex has been going around asking about me and Will, and I hate that he gets to think of himself as the victim.\nI may have made mistakes, but his actions were malicious.\n\nI also really regret letting all of that happen. I used to think I knew how to spot a toxic partner, but I let him do his thing without noticing.\n\nI just wanted to vent.\nThank you for bearing with me, and sorry for any mistakes. ",

We used to be extremely close, and always teased each other jokingly. \n\nBut since reconnecting with them, I've just been feeling a lot more sensitive to their comments? It feels silly as I know they don't mean anything bad by their words, but I just find myself wondering if they even really like me as a person or if they're judging me.\n\nCouple of examples: I have pet cats and this friend knows I love them. They've never liked cats, which is fine. They sent over a funny video of a cat, but that somehow devolved into them telling me how much they hate cats, and talking about how they also thought cats made their owners bitches, etc... I just tried to brush it off and joke back, defending my stance on cats a little bit. This isn't the first time I've had to hear about someone's grievances with cats, but it's just such a conversation killer for me. Like cool, you hate the animals I happen to really like. I am so glad you have given me this reminder lol.\n\nThe other thing that bothered me a bit was just a comment that made me feel like they thought I was immature. I said something like \"Oh this slaps\" and they immediately said \"Don't say that, you're 31.\" It's such a small thing but I guess I've always been a bit anxious about seeming \"mature\" enough to people, so it did sting a bit. \n\nI imagine a lot of this is just my own anxieties getting the best of me, as well as the fact that it's been so long that we're almost strangers in a lot of ways.

    "selftext": "I have a few friends who are very close to their parents and they know their parents love them and are their #1 biggest fan no matter what they do. It\u2019s very fascinating to witness, and simultaneously upsetting because I can\u2019t help but compare it to my own situation.\n\nMy parents have never been the affectionate, loving type but I didn\u2019t realize just how little they cared for me until I moved out of the family home before marriage. Coming from a very conservative Muslim culture this is looked down on, because people assume you are living away from your family as a single woman to do haram (forbidden) activities in the religion. However I just wanted to have my own space and be independent, that\u2019s all. My parents did not take it well, my mother told me I was selfish and deserve everything bad in life for abandoning them.\n\nThis was over a year ago and the relationship is still quite strained. I\u2019ve called a few times since and my mother was super rude and irritated like I was bothering her for calling her. So I stopped, and I haven\u2019t spoken to my family in a few months. I\u2019m not sure how you can claim to love your child and practically disown them for wanting to live their own lives. So I know now I am not loved by them.\n\nIt\u2019s really sad to not receive unconditional love from your parents because you will never get unconditional love anywhere else. Not from friends, not even from your spouse. You will forever feel unloved and worthless. Most relationships are fickle and very conditional. You family is meant to be your rock. But I have none.\n\nSometimes I wonder why I am even in this world.",

    "selftext": "I've only told maybe 2 people for my entire life about this, but it's been weighing on me recently. I feel like I need to just shout to the void about it.\n\nI(28M) befriended one of my teachers when I was 14. At the time, he was 35. For more background, I was F at the time (now FtM). He was my middle school teacher and when I switched schools, I added him on Facebook. It wasn't until around my freshman year of high school that we really started to talk. \n\nAt first, I basically harassed him, sending him messages daily, until he started to reply and it became conversational. After about a year, we began messaging each other daily. It was never anything inappropriate; we mainly talked about games, music, art, daily life, etc. (normal friendly type conversation). We never hung out or met up or anything. The only time I saw him after he was my teacher was one time at a school event.\n\nI lived in an abusive home and was a very lonely kid. I always figured he sensed that and that I just needed/wanted someone to talk to who actually cared. He became what I still consider to be my best friend at the time. I eventually started to have feelings for him because of this. I still remember telling him how I felt, and him saying something along the lines of \"I'm very flattered, but that's not appropriate\". The conversation dwindled a bit after that, but some time passed and we picked back up our daily conversations.\n\nOne morning, I woke up to see my father on my computer, snooping through my messages with this former teacher. I freaked out and told him this. We ended up exchanging numbers and started texting because of this. \n\nA while went by (a few months, if I remember right), we continued our friendship and daily conversations. Something happened and my parents took my phone (I can't exactly remember why they took it). I went to lunch with a friend one day, and when I got home, both of my parents were there and I knew something was wrong (they divorced and hated each other). They confronted me about my teacher and I's friendship, saying they \"[knew] everything\". My father had texted him through my phone, telling him to cease contact and threatening to report him to the school board if he ever tried talking to me again. I was heartbroken hearing this and knowing I'd never speak to him again. My parents claim he was \"grooming\" me, but I never felt that way. He felt more like a dad or an uncle, and treated me almost as his kid. Plus, as mentioned before, I basically harassed this man into talking to me. I always got the feeling he just kind of felt bad for me, especially looking back on our conversations and this situation as an adult.\n\nI never spoke with him again after that. It was somewhat of a traumatic experience for me, but only because someone I really cared about just suddenly vanished from my life and I felt as though I had nearly ruined his life because I was a lonely kid. The loss I experienced changed me as a person and the way I view all relationships.\n\nI still think of him often. I want to reach out and ask him how he is, and tell him how sorry I am for putting him in such a bad situation. It's just been so long and I don't want to dredge up the past, especially when I'm sure it was also traumatic for him. \n\nI don't know how to move on when it ended so abruptly and so badly. I have dreams of running into him on the street and getting my opportunity to tell him I'm sorry and hear how he dealt with things afterward. ",

She has called multiple ambulance this year and each time they kick her out the hospital because there's nothing wrong with her! The last she went, she called cause she thought she was having a stroke but texted me to bring her tablet to the hospital. When I got to the hospital i told her \"people who are actually sick don't care about having their tablets.\" This caused her to snap at me about not caring about her. \n\nToday, she left her tablet open in my dad's office (they are divorced but live together for now) and I saw her messages with her online boyfriend. He's talking about visiting her and they're saying I love you but she's never met this man! It's always the same damn story too: Military man, has a young child, and they are stationed aboard. Can she be that gullible to keep believing it?? \n\nI get it. She an adult (56) but my mom does not seem mentally sound. She has lost countless bank accounts talking to these online boyfriends! She once gave one $700 to \"invest\" in his business and he ghosted her, all while demanding my dad help her pay for medication. She's constantly \"falling\", which is her throwing herself to the ground. She did it in front of my cousin once and she [my cousin] said she didn't want to come over anymore because my mother was irritating. She is the reason one of my sisters rarely comes around and my other sister is NC with her! \n\nEverything is everyone else's fault! I'm so frustrated because she's not understanding the urgency! My dad is not staying in this apartment and finally moving on with his life while her credit is in the shitter! She's barely at work! She spends most of her money on door dash and shitty shit from Temu!

    "selftext": "My husband wanted a dog, and I had never had one before. I\u2019ve had plenty of pets in the past: cats, rabbits, and fish, and I loved each one of them deeply. So, we decided to get a dog.\n\nHe did the work of finding the exact dog he wanted, and we drove three hours to adopt her. Even though he took on most of the feeding, exercising, playing, and training, she bonded to me. The bond feels like an obsession. When I\u2019m around, my husband doesn\u2019t exist to her. She never wants to be more than three feet away from me, and often, she\u2019s touching me.\n\nWhen I need a break, I go into the bedroom and shut the door. She just sits outside, waiting. I can put her in the office with my fianc\u00e9 on the other side of the house, and then go to the bedroom and shut the door. But she waits at the office door, whining and whimpering. My husband tries to interact with her, but she doesn\u2019t care. She just wants me. And I can\u2019t handle this level of attention. You can take her outside, but if she knows I\u2019m inside, she won\u2019t leave the door. If I leave, she panics. A few minutes later, she calms down and does her own thing. She never bothers my husband this much.\n\nI\u2019ve heard mothers talk about feeling \u201ctouched out\u201d with toddlers, and that\u2019s exactly how I feel with my dog. The difference is, I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever grow past this stage. She\u2019s a dog. We\u2019ve worked with trainers to help her become more independent, but it doesn\u2019t seem to work.\n\nI\u2019m thankful that there\u2019s more nuance in the \u201cadopt, don\u2019t shop\u201d movement. Sometimes, it might actually be better to get a dog from an ethical breeder, as shelter dogs can come with their own set of challenges. My dog has trauma, and that trauma will stay with her for life. It shows up in our relationship, where we\u2019re in a sort of quasi-codependence. It\u2019s frustrating because she\u2019s fine when I\u2019m not around. My husband can take her places, and she\u2019s as happy as can be. If I\u2019m not home, she\u2019s completely relaxed. It\u2019s only when I\u2019m around that she becomes obsessed with me. I don\u2019t get to experience the playful, silly dog everyone else sees because, in my presence, she\u2019s consumed with me.\n\nMy husband takes her to his brother\u2019s farm, and he sends me videos of her. It breaks my heart because I want to see that happy, playful dog too. I want a dog I can sit outside with, playing with toys and rolling in the dirt, without her needing to touch my leg at all times. But I never get that dog. I love her so much, but her constant affection drowns me.\n\nI look forward to when she goes to the farm because I get to be home without her on top of me. I don\u2019t love my job, but I dread going home because, at least at work, I get some alone time.\n\nI love my dog, but I don\u2019t like being around her.",

    "selftext": "I really need to take this off my chest because today I f*cked up multiple times and I feel extremely embarrassed. \n\n\nMaybe I am in my head but I'm definitely somewhere in the wrong. \n\n\nOk so my day started fine with me taking a ride to the airport. The driver, a super nice guy from Pakistan, shared with me that he is fasting and he will only get to have water or something to eat after 6pm. So what do I do? I get all excited about Pakistani food and ask him to tell me what are his favorite dishes from his hometown. Then I proceed to describe in excruciating detail all my favorite dishes from my country. Recipes, mouthwatering ingredients, the whole thing. By the time I realized that he must be starving (it was 4pm after all), I was already rambling for about an hour already. I apologized immediately and he was super nice about it, but this doesn't make me less of an idiot. \n\n\nSo after this great success, fast forward to a few hours later - I am on the plane, seated near  the back, squeezed into the middle seat. We are about to depart, the plane is on the move and I realize that my seatbelt gets loose without me lifting the little lever thingy. I ask for assistance and the flight attendant tells me \"Don't worry, the seatbelt will work later\". So I ask him \"How is this possible...?\", thinking that I really don't do well during flights, that I used to get panic attacks, that I managed to control after a lot of therapy and &lt;&lt;OMG I am about to fly and if something happens I will break my neck crashing on the roof of the plane!!!&gt;&gt;. \n\n\nHe sighs, then tells me he will replace the belt and goes away. Comes back after a minute or so and he says that the plane needs to depart and that there is no time, they will need to move me. There is quickly some commotion, all the flight attendants make some signals to each other and they find me a free row at the front. So I thank them profoundly, I apologize for the last minute chaos that I caused and go to my new princess seat, but the window with extra legroom that I didn't pay for. I sit down, I put the seatbelt on.... and I realize that the new seatbelt ALSO gets loose if I push the metal thing! I test it out a little bit and then it hits me. If I just pull the belt, it stays locked. If I put my finger under the metallic thing and push slightly it gets loose. So that means that I did all this.... for no reason.\n\nI close my eyes and start thinking that it can't be that I'm so inconsiderate today. And how embarrassing. Meanwhile I'm doing my breathing exercises trying to relax. There is turbulence today and my mouth is dry, I can't handle it anymore. I open my eyes and soon as I see the flight attendant handing out chocolates, I ask for some water. She says \"I will check if we still have\", and I'm thinking \"Oh wow, how strange! It can't be that they don't have at least one bottle\". Quickly she comes back, hads me one and finally I drink some water. \"Finally I can try to relax\", I'm thinking. Then I realize must have dropped the chocolate she gave me. I start looking around and then I look to my left and I freeze. On the seat next to me there is yet another water bottle that the flight attendants must have left for me while I was trying to \"breathe iiiiin, hooooold, exhaaale, the plane is safe the plane is safe the plane is safe\".\n\nSo that's it. This is another successful day. I am sitting here patiently, writing this to distract myself and I think I will post as soon as we land. \n\n\nThank you for listening to my rambling dear reader &lt;3",

    "selftext": "The way \"life\" taught me about sex. Not my mom or dad, or a sex ed teacher. But life.\n\nLet's keep in mind that as humans we have an innate instinct to procreate.\n\nMy dad used to babysit me while my mom would go to work. He would put Asian music videos on in the living room and I would sing and dance to the songs all day long. I was 4. I was a sociable outspoken singing daddy's girl and I loved people because they would dote on me. What I'm really trying to say here is, at 4, I could recognize humans and human beings.\n\nMy dad took me over to his buddy's house. His buddy had two sons. One was about 7 and the other son was about 4 as well. While he and his buddies were hanging out downstairs, the older boy (7) showed me a book his dad had of naked people in all sorts of sexual positions, kind of like a Kama Sutra. He proceeded to usher me into a closet and took off all my clothes. My dad found me naked in the closet and helped me put all my clothes back on and we went home.\n\nAt around 5 years old, I woke up one morning and looked around. My little brother was sleeping in a separate bed in the same room as me. As you know and as I have mentioned above, I loved watching TV because of the music videos, and because of Barney and other things I would watch on TV. So this somber morning, I woke up, walked to my parents room and they were sleeping and I didn't want to wake them up. I walked back to my room where my brother was sleeping. We had a TV in our room and laying around on the floor were a VHS tapes. So I picked one up and popped it in. It was a porn tape. I remembered the naked people from the book that one kid had showed me and this porn tape had the same people. Naked and actively doing things. I somehow knew it was bad. So I turned down the volume, and I watched the whole thing instead of taking out the VHS. Let's just say, curiosity killed the cat and I was the very curious kitten.\n\nThen around the same year, at 5 years old, I was molested by my uncle. He was living in the same house as us in the basement. It happened (to my memory) one time and one time only. I knew what had happened to me the moment it happened. I knew something bad had happened to me, and I knew what sex was but I just didn't know the exact words for what everything was.\n\nThat is my 7-layor carrot cake story. Not exactly 7 layers but it just seems that bad things of a sexual nature kept making its way into my very short life and I came out on the other side too knowing, and too knowledgable way too soon. Every day I wish I had had the chance to be innocent and to be trusting of others and of people. I wish I had the chance to be a happy-go-lucky kid unburdened. But I was denied that. I grew up with no friends at all because of the amount of guilt I felt. The fact I understood sex at such a young age, and being molested, it was like an awkward secret I just kept inside. But secrets weight on you. Even if you don't think they do. It's a physical manifestation and I was not the beautiful child I always wished I was. I was dark, and small, and always was a little heavier than other girls. Because of all those reasons, I still have no friends, I have never made a friend. I still have extremely low self-esteem paired with a high body count.\n\nI'm just not normal. It feels this way at all times. I always stick to myself and I never look anyone in the eye. The shame.\n\nI also want to note, to anybody that was raised around too many males. Just don't. It's not safe for any parent with a small female child to be around that many men/males all at once and even if you \"trust\" them I would say you should always have a considerable amount of doubt and remove your child from danger or harm.",

A friend of mine (F35) recently started talking to a 20-year-old she met on a dating app. She insists they\u2019re \u201cjust friends\u201d now, but the fact that it started on a dating app doesn\u2019t sit right with me. She even said she feels like they\u2019re on the \"same wavelength,\" which honestly just makes me uncomfortable.\n\nI know they\u2019re both legal adults, but the life experience gap feels huge. At 20, you\u2019re still figuring out so much, while someone in their mid-30s has a completely different level of maturity and perspective. It\u2019s making me rethink my friendship with her, but at the same time, I\u2019m questioning if I\u2019m overreacting.\n\nI don\u2019t know\u2014maybe it\u2019s my own past experiences influencing how I see this, but it just doesn\u2019t feel right. I needed to get this out somewhere.",

    "selftext": "I(F28) and my former friend G( F30) meet during our first term in university, we both came from the same area and went to the same school at one point. We clicked and became really good friends from there. I was an insecure 19 year old at that time and she was outgoing and active in our version of sorority. I was invited to outings that I actually enjoyed and began to build up some confidence. We both had our share of mental problems understood each other, but after taking diffrent courses we stopped meeting as regularly but she always said that I was one of her closest friends. \n\nIn 2020, I became sick. Really heavy burnout, Crohn dieses and bulimia that made me unable to stay in town. I moved back home and slowly began to rebuild my life and health. Now in 2025, I am still sick, but way better and have control of my mental problems. During the last five years I wrote to G every time I went to the university city, asking to meet up and if I could, I set the dates of my travel after her schedule to make sure we could meet(it\u2019s a 5h drive). Every time she said she would love to, and if she was available we booked a date and time. But almost always something happened or she double booked that she remembered 1 day to 1h before. During these five years, we have meet up twice and I have probably asked her around 10 times since I usually go twice a year.  She never wrote to me when she visited her parents or asked me when I was going down next time, which I realise now was a clear sign that I ignored. I once wrote and asked her if she didn\u2019t want to meet up, it was okey and I would understand, time changes people and friendship does not always last. She denied it and said she very much wanted to meet up and I accepted the answer. Telling me how horrible of a friend she is and how sorry she is.\n\nTwo years ago I had a major breakdown when G cancelled on me again. I had been so excited and when she cancelled I was heartbroken. Walking is my coping strategy, especially with heavy emotions, even after 10km I did not stop crying. I was living with another friend  for that weekend and I fully broke down in the end and told her everything. They had never suspected anything cause I always spoke so well off her. She  apparently told my other friends who all are mad on my behalf. \n\nG sent me a snap in May 2024, with the caption \u201dIn exactly one year we are getting married\u201d with a picture on her fianc\u00e9. I congratulated her, but I had no idea about their engagement before that. I decided to one last try and asked her of a time during the summer we could meet up, with my vacation weeks in mind. She responded and we decided a week  were she was free, for details to be determined later. As it approached I wrote 1 week before and told her the days, no response. When I finally was at the hotell I wrote again and told her how long I was there and times when I was booked. My friends were a bit angry at me for trying again but I said that this will be the last time. \n\nOne day after I came home from the trip she responded with how sorry she was for not answering. I had enough and told her how I felt through the years, I was nice and civile even said I should have brought it up earlier and not just unload it all now, even asked my friends to read before sending. G answered and told me she understood why I felt like that, I ended it with that if she wanted to meet, she would have to text or call me now, cause I was tired of this being so one sided.\n\nGuess what - not heard from her since. Now I see pictures from the wedding preparations like the baccalaureate and dress fitting and I feel so sad. Probably I had a delusion hope deep inside that I would get an invite and that she would text me. This quenching the last hope of ever being friends again and telling me how little I meant and what friends mattered to her. \n\nMy friends supports my feelings even my boyfriend, but I just feel like I never meant anything. If they are real friends they will make time for you, I know, but in my head I go through all those memories and just wonder if I could have done anything different. Been a better friend, written more, called or if I just was the burden I always was scared of being, also wishing I not been so delusional and naive. \n\nSorry for the long post\u2764\ufe0f",

    "selftext": "Hi... this is my first reddit post and I need to get these feelings  off my chest. I just feel so angry and I hate it.\n\nContext -&gt; So around a year and three ish four months ago, my father had died in hospital. All shocking and scary times for me and my mom. I was 16 at the time. So I was quite affected and so was my mom. We mourned for quite some time after his death. And we went through a rough patch for a few months before we recovered.\n\nSo this is where the story starts, my mother began chatting and dating around. To which I was fine with, as I was happy she wasn't mourning over my dad and was healing. \n\nShe dated a one or two guys before she found this guy Bill (not real name) who works as a driver. They started dating and shit. And I was quite okay with it. Despite for a few times I was annoyed and irritated at him.\n\nFor starters, my mom would never tell me if he  was coming over. And normally when I'd wake up in the morning he'd be in the kitchen with my mom drinking coffee. This kinda annoyed me. I didn't like this stranger enter my house where my father once lived. I hated sharing my private personal space with this stranger. I hated and still hate his presence in my house. \n\nHe is quite annoying as a person, his like a kid. Extremely curious and neat picking. He laughs in a weird manner not a proper laugh. He acts childish at times. He's obsessed with my pet budgie named tim (not real name) but he doesn't know how to hold him properly. He constantly stresses my bird out. Which i hate.\n\nAnyways, I always felt like my mother moved on way to quickly from my father. And I quite hate it. I'm aware it's her life and she can do whatever. And that she's healing.. but it's hurts  seeing her do things she never do with my father. My father wasn't physically the most affectionate as in ways of kissing or holding hands. But he loved me and my mom in his own ways. My mom truly loved my dad. \n\nI don't know how to describe the emotions I'm feeling. It's difficult to explan everything. I just don't like him and I hate his presence in my home. I hate him touching things inside my house. I find him irritating at times and annoying. I feel these angry feelings. \n\nI hate the fact I don't have mother daughter time with my mother. As Bill comes over to sleep over like... 3ish to 4 days a week. Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday. I quite missing going out with my mom on Saturday shopping or in town. But now as bill sleeps over in Saturday he spends his day off, Sundays with us. And I hate that.\n\nEvery time I plan something with my mom on Sunday, he always has to crash our daughter mother time. I hate him kissing my mom. Being all lovely dovey. I'm happy for her healing and being happy with someone. \n\nBut it's not the same as it was.  I miss my dad\n\nEdit - forgot to mention, my mom literally babies him. Every time he comes over, she cooks all the time. She never has a second to herself. ",

    "selftext": "Hello guys. I really have to get this off my shoulders so i decided to make this post on here. already appreciate you guys for reading it. \n\nSo, i am M/22 and my gf is the same age, we are together since three years now and everything did go well for the most part. The thing is, i am an absolute introvert and probably suffer from social anxiety. I hate to go to places where a lot of people are, i cannot eat when a lot of people are around me and i just get exhausted and overwhelmed so fast. this makes my life really hard tbh, and its even harder because i cant understand why i feel that way. like i was grown up in a great, lovingly household, have a good job, and i am basically just a normal guy, who should not complain about his life. However my gf knows all those things and we talk about it and all, she also tells me shes there for me and just tries to help me out as much as she can. \n\n  \nAnd then there was this situation yesterday, it was the 20th birthday of her brother (who is also a really close friend of mine) and he was throwing a party with approximately 40 people. and what can i say, i felt like absolute shit the whole week, my anxiety hit rock bottom and i felt like i couldnt handle it. the night before the party i had a fucking panic attack while falling asleep. So i was talking to my gf, talking about how i feel and how i am getting the worst anxiety ever and so on.. she then tried to make me feel less anxious, she told me she is there for me the whole evening, she wont let me be alone and stuff and idk just trying to pick me up. (thats also one thing, like i feel giga weak in those situations, why cant i handle such things, shouldnt i be the one protecting her? however i am also really insecure about myself). \n\n  \nThe party was on saturday 19;00, in a bar. my heart was racing all day. i tried to calm myself down with playing some video games, some csgo and some league, but nothing really helped. So at around 18:30 i left home and was driving to the party. you can imagine how i felt. when i arrived, we were in a group of maybe 5 people (i really didnt know many people there, maybe like 3 or 4). then i went to the wc, to calm down a bit and when i cam back my gf was grouping with her friend, the other people i knew where also with their other friends, and suddenly i find myself standing in this bar, alone, trying to talk to some people i didnt even know, just to make it less akward. it was my personal hell. However, i couldnt just go to my gf and her friends, because i would have felt ultra weird, when being the only guy there coming out of nowhere. i would have appreciated it so much, if she would have came up the me and just would be on my site. but she didnt. she didnt the whole evening. like in 8 hours, she wasnt coming up to me once. one time she was looking at me, she wanted to ask me if everything was okay by signaling it, i was shaking my head and telling her no nothing is ok, and then she turned around and did go somewhere else. like why? i dont understand that. i feel like the biggest loser on this earth, my feelings are ultra hurt and i cant stop thinking about it. i could have never done it like this if roles were switched. maybe i am overreacting, but honestly i dont think so. like why do i even tell her how i felt like shit because of this party. should i have just came up to her and her friends? idk. i still think it would have been easier for her to come pick me up, then for me to go to them. especially when she knows how i felt. \n\n  \nidk, this evening made me just feel like absolute shit, i feel hurt as hell, i could literally start to cry right now. Why do i have to be such an insecure and anti social person, i just dont get it. however, now i am here, sitting at my pc, listening to music and writing this down. idk if anybody will even read this, but if so, sorry if my english is not the yellow from the egg, but i tried my best. \n\n  \nhave a nice sunday evening\n\n  \n",

This meant that I would have to talk to a family member (from my mom's side) to tell her what happened. My mom ended up confessing that she would much rather keep the family in peace and still have a relationship with them, then be with me and support me when I do talk to that aunt.  Since then, I haven't been able to calm my anxiety, I feel like shit every day (I have been in a state of derealization that is driving me crazy). Since my dad left when I was 3 I have always put my mom's needs and feelings before mine, sadly all I have learned during these sessions is that I am not the daughter she wants, that I am always wrong and that she literally can't name 1 good thing about me. It is super confusing because she hasn't stopped helping me pay for uni, she still helps me buy new clothes for my new job, but yet again she won't hesitate to tall me how mean or inconsiderate I am.

    "selftext": "My (m24) now ex(f26) girlfriend started dating in March last year. I had just come out of a toxic situationship where I take part blame. I was a bad communicator, I\u2019m sure I still am but I gained some communication skills. I really liked her, found my now ex, 3 weeks later. I knew it would be a rebound but it helped so much. Especially considering this girl had been my crush since 8 years ago when I had first started working with her. We had so much fun early on, trips, going out, eating out. It started to feel less like a rebound and something of a real relationship. Unfortunately, it came to her moving out of her mom\u2019s house. She needed a place to go, and me with my somewhat trust issues, was scared to let her move in with her friends which were one girl and two guys. She had been known to \u201cget around\u201d but I trusted her more than most people did and had hope. She was very kind, had many mental issues, but nothing I couldn\u2019t stand, I had grown up with childhood trauma and this seemed like nothing. So me with my trust issues, and wanting to move out of my mom\u2019s house as well, took her offer of renting a place together. It seemed fun and I had just started a career job, so it seemed like a good time. Found out very quickly, it would not be. See my ex, we\u2019ll call Fiona, had severe insecurities and drinking issues, not to mention drug addiction. I had known to some extent, but not to this severity. The first week we moved in, I wanted to have a get together party for our first place together. Turns out, Fiona hates having people in her space. She was very quiet the whole night, and near the end, she stormed off to the room, where I\u2019d get yelled at when I head to bed. She scream at me in bed, as I had work the next morning I told her sorry and we\u2019d talk about it tomorrow. She got up and stormed out the room. I was just happy for the quiet, until I hear her screaming my name and yelling help! Help! I storm out, seeing her wrist covered in blood, with it spilling all over the floors. I help her best I can, she didn\u2019t hit an artery so it soon stopped, but left a nasty scar. After this night, most nights, especially when we went out, I would get no rest, being accused of cheating, or just not giving her enough love. Over the next few months, one of our mutual friends decided a surprise birthday party for her. I honestly wasn\u2019t thinking to hard about it, I just thought maybe it\u2019d make her happy, forgetting she didn\u2019t like people in her space. Same thing happened. She was upset the whole night, stayed in the bedrooms and never came out. Through out the night you could hear her screams saying \u201cget out of my house!\u201d In the most embarrassing way possible. Her sister was there, and tried to calm her down the whole night, which did not work. I eventually got everyone out, because the music was barely covering it up. I went to bed again. Same thing, yelling at me. She got up, stormed out. I was worried but thought that it was a one time thing. Nope, I instantly hear my name being screamed. This time, much worse. I come out to see the cut is even deeper, attempt to stop the bleeding but it just won\u2019t. I call 911 while making a makeshift tourniquet to try and stop it. The paramedics get her after the police, which was someone I knew. I told them about how she was saying before that she wanted to die. I didn\u2019t think this was an attempt, but a callout. I took her to the hospital after the medics said she didn\u2019t need the ambulance after patching her up. Stayed up all night at the hospital, dropped her off at home, then went to work. I was miserable. I couldn\u2019t stand this anymore. I didn\u2019t want to break the lease, but at the same time I also still cared for this girl. I felt bad. I needed a way out, that night was my chance, but you just couldn\u2019t leave her alone, she cried and begged me. So we continued our relationship. A few months later, same thing, yelling at me and saying I don\u2019t give her enough affirmations and accusing me of deleting snapchats and sneaking people in when she\u2019s off at work. Which led to a night that she destroyed my tv in the living room, put holes in the walls, and screamed at me in my face. I was done, I left to stay at my friends house. Told her to leave, we\u2019d figure out the situation after. The day after, she said she needed time to move, and wanted to talk. I went over, and we talked the whole night. She promised she\u2019d get therapy, and help. And I felt so terrible, I truly loved this girl, but it was such a toxic relationship. I gave her one last chance. We decided to stick together, agreeing to talk things out more. See, I still have my trust issues, and being accused of things makes me curious why it\u2019s that in particular. I memorized her password months ago, but never really felt the need to look through her phone. I had it just in case. But I was working one night, straight shift. She went out with her friends. Acted very strange to me, and I just felt something was off. I come home at 7am, find her dead asleep. Couldn\u2019t even wake her up to give her a kiss. She had left her phone on my side of the bed. I felt the urge to look through it. Went through it for hours. Finding hidden messages in messenger of her taking to her ex saying how she thinks about him everyday, and that she needs him. Other messages to her OTHER ex on Snapchat, came across it by chance because it had been cleared and muted. It was of last night being very flirty and him leaving hearts and her pictures with her hearting back. Her saying I miss you, and then a phone call about 6 minutes lasting. I called this number, I asked him to be straight up if she\u2019s cheating. He sounded dumbfounded but said she wasn\u2019t and that they were just friends that use to date. But I found pictures dating only right before we started dating that they were kissing and all over eachother. I woke her up, absolutely heated. Ngl this was probably the angriest I\u2019ve ever been. I told her what I had seen. She of course denied it. Eventually admitting that it was cheating but they never had sex. Which I absolutely think is a lie. But I said it was over, and she took it so easily. She nodded and called her mom, got her stuff in the car, then laughing about a joke she made saying she\u2019s tired of constantly moving. All while I sit and wait for her to leave. Also if I didn\u2019t mention, this happened ALL ON MY BIRTHDAY. She leaves not answering any of my questions like why? how could you do this? Since then, I\u2019ve been sitting here, she still left a few things and needs a truck to come pick them up. She just texted me that she\u2019s coming today to pick them up. I still feel like shit, but can hold my emotions together. ",

I'd never be disrespectful like that, but i just wanted to get it off my chest. ",

I am not massive but I have a community that I could never leave behind.\n\nI also have another job - sometimes people assume once I say I'm a content creator that it's my only source of income. I think people overestimate the money content creators make. Even with 50000 subs, your barely be making enough for rent and maybe food. \n\n I'm known for being the woman of my streaming group, which is predominantly men. I get targeted with a lot of female-oriented questions during streams - sometimes sexist jokes but usually stuff like \"Hey, X, you're a girl so is it true women feel X on their period?\" - just as an example. \n\nI started streaming when I was 19. I'm 24 now. In these last five years, I've learned a lot about myself. Including that I have simply never truly felt like a woman. It's always felt like a costume and a role. I've reached more self awareness and understanding of myself and I know for certain, I am not a woman. Mentally, at least.\n\nI don't know what to do. I know the most important thing is \"to thine own self be true.\"\n\nBut I kinda wish I could transition and continue to play the role I've had in my group. Part of me revels in the thought of just being \"one of the dudes,\" but I know it would never be that easy. I know it will be awkward. I know that I will be misgendered and mocked. I know that there will be people in my community who are supportive but I know there will be many who are not.\n\nI am losing my whole identity, as a person and as a member of my group.

    "selftext": "I (25F) was in a relationship (25M) for almost 2 years. It started off very very well, very dreamy and romantic where I told my friends that I had found the guy I had been looking for all this while etc etc. 2 months after our first date, i lost my job and i realised how emotionally unavailable he was, because all he cared about was his job and his work stress - he didnt know how to empathise with me or support me or help me out (for context the city we live and work in is his hometown) but i thought probably my expectations are a bit much because we are so early in the relationship. But i have known since aug 2023 that this isnt right for me. I am going to bulletise the problems:\n\n\u2022 spending time: despite living in the same city, he only saw me once a week, fri-sat, which i initially found weird but adjusted around it. However, because he is an insane workaholic, we didnt do anything special, just stayed in. There were no date nights. When we went out on date nights, i planned all of them, i initiated them, and i convinced him. I wanted to spend more time with him, see him more, but that he told was not possible because it messes with his routines. A lot of his habits and ideas of how we should be were straight up selfish, inconsiderate and disreputable tbh. \n\n\u2022 A twisted definition of ambition, different definitions of meaning of life: He has a well paying, reputable, steady job but he wants to start his own thing so that he is doing something \u201cmeaningful \u201c in life. What that means for us is insane working hours, no downtime, no quality time no matter how much i tried to adjust. When breaking up, he said the kind of relationship i want works for people who have job stability and dont want to do much outside of that - and i disagree so much. All i wanted was someone to spend my weekends with, have that quality time. Isnt that the bare minimum? Also, if he cant do this, how will he ever be in a relationship?\nFor me, i am super ambitious and have built a career in a foreign country from the ground up, but for me ambition means being good at job and liking it enough to login every morning to do a good job. Meaning of life doesnt come from the job as i work for the paycheck, but meaning comes from travel, experiences, relationships and friendships. \n\n\u2022 His routine: he was obsessed with his routines. Wake up at 6, sleep at 10, gym at 7am, work 8-9 kinda guy. Which is ok, routines are good, but what that meant was he only saw me fridays, and called me daily 9:30-10 (he didnt call me initially at all and we foughjt a lot to get here). Anything outside of that was not possible. This didnt emotionally sit right with me because i couldnt trust, depend, rely on him. In fact, when we were breaking up, he told me he calculated (????) the amount of time he spends with me or talking to me, and thats about 12h/week, which is not possible for him right now. What this translated in my head was, i am not worth the 12h/week\n\n\u2022 his spending habits: he lives at home with his parents, earns a LOT more than me, and saves and invests all that he earns to an obsessive degree. He has enough to retire rn, and i respect that. But what that meant for us was, he was extremely stingy and calculative. We split stuff but he just wasnt happy spending - on date nights, dinners, gifts. Heck, he even calculated the transport cost from his home to mine. He even liked to lecture me about how i should spend money, when i already live below my means because i have a loan. He also said that he is saving enough for the both of us, but that never gave me confidence because i saw that as an attack on my independence - i cant live on the money he has earned or saved because it is not mine, he will always reinforce that, and i will have a lesser of a say in how we spend that money. He definitely wanted a prenup if we were to marry which i dont mind, but his general attitude towards money and being too calculative wasnt reassuring\n\n\nBasically, these were long-standing problems which i identified very early on in the relationship and communicated why i find them problematic. However, after each time i communicated he gave me something new to cling my hope on to, and i hoped things would get better because i genuinely wanted this to work. They never got better, we kept on arguing, until yesterday when he asked the question and i agreed - i felt a bit blindsided tbh because he never told me he is thinking about it too. I guess there are 2 lessons for me:\n\n1. To be in a relationship and live in the present and not with the person\u2019s potential and what it could be\n2. To not be so obsessed with the idea of relationships and building a life and the feeling of home with someone that i keep putting up with shit\n\nHaving said all of this, the feeling of loss is immense and i still miss him and have been bawling my eyes out, when it was me who had been considering breaking up for the past year and i know in my heart he is not the one for me.",

And we were fairly physical before, but now the extent of her initiating anything is holding hands or resting her head on my shoulder. \n\nI love even that. Makes me melt. Makes me feel wanted. But then I realize at the end of the day, that I initiated every kiss. We make out once in a couple months when I initiate. \n\nI've asked her about it. Multiple times. Is something bothering her, does she want some support, is this not something she wants in a relationship. \n\nEvery time the answer is that she wants it, and that she'll initiate but then it's like she forgets about it. I remember the time she'd hold me, look me in the eyes and kiss me. I remember the times she'd take the slower, non supervised elevator to kiss me in. I remember when she'd ask me to come over when she was alone to make out. \n\nNothing. For a year, nothing. I don't even ask her anymore, cause at that point it feels like I'm forcing her or making it out to be a major fault. I can't even tell what's wrong. What's changed.

Immediately I put him in my arms and wrapped my blanket around him so he won\u2019t squirm too much and looked in his mouth. At first I didn\u2019t see it then I realized a piece was stuck in his front teeth. It took me a few minutes bc he didn\u2019t like me messing around in his mouth but i eventually got it out and he was fine. We ended up cuddling the rest of the night and I kept a close eye on him. \n\nWhy do cats do this? What is the lore for them to want to do that. I tried getting him a catnip plant but he wasn\u2019t interested at all. \n\n(Also yes I know it\u2019s March and my Christmas tree should already be taken down\ud83d\ude2d I want a family picture of my son who I\u2019m currently pregnant with and my family by the tree so that\u2019s why it\u2019s still up he\u2019s due in less then 3 weeks)",

    "selftext": "For the past 2 years I\u2019ve been smoking weed, almost daily. I recently went through a lot of changes, and in that I quit smoking and started taking supervised urine tests. (Among other things) \nI knew that taking these tests meant I couldn\u2019t take my drivers license for at least a few months, and that was okay with me. What I didn\u2019t know is that it meant I couldn\u2019t drive at all, until these tests were finished - which is 6 months - even tho I am clean. \n\nMy doctor failed to tell me (or I failed to remember) that I can\u2019t use the license for my motorcycle that i already have. \n\nI recently met a guy who made my passion for driving motorcycles light up again. I was so ready to get back on the bike, bring it out of the garage, change out the oil and have it in pristine condition. I was so excited to spent a summer on two wheels while getting my life back on track - and this time with someone to share the joy with. In some ways it was part of my motivation for staying clean, and having it ripped away in the span of a few google searches made it that much harder. \n\nI feel so angry, and stupid. I feel like I should have known, and I feel like it was obvious. Yet I thought in some magical way that I could keep my excisting licence, just not take another drivers test. I was so ready for the freedom of driving to work, and going on road trips. Or just driving to the store without relying on commute or friends, or having to walk for 15 minutes.\n\nI know it really isn\u2019t the end of the world, but the next 5 months is gonna be that much more challenging knowing I could have been on a bike if I hadn\u2019t admitted to my doctor that I smoked weed. Im gonna call the doctors office tomorrow to see if I\u2019m correct in thinking I can\u2019t drive my motorcycle, but I\u2019m scared of getting my hopes up. I\u2019d rather sit with knowing I\u2019ll get told I can\u2019t drive than be let down again tomorrow. \n\nBut on the other side of things, I probably wouldn\u2019t have quit if it wasn\u2019t for having to do this at some point either way. \n\nIt just sucks that I\u2019ll be done with these tests in September, at the very end of the season.

    "selftext": "So when we were in highschool, my dad made us quit any extracurricular activities to make extra money and help pay bills and save for our college, and just put into saving for us. Thats what he told us. But He would take whatever we made and only give us $20 of spending money every pay period. We gave him thousands that went towards the bills and college funds and even built a house back in our home country for when our parents retire. To add to that, we have gotten many scholarships so the majority of our schools were paid for. My sister in question lost her job and has been having a hard time finding another one. My dad used her funds to pay for the first half of her tuition but refused to pay for the second half. The cost is $4k. He said he has no money but yet he JUST bought a new BMW worth 25 to 30k. Keep in mind, we have 3 EXTRA CARS that need about $500 worth if fixing for him to drive just fine! When my mom was trying to talk to him about helping pay for my sister's college tuition, he told her to ask us (the siblings) to help. Since I have money saved, I was able to help pay for her tuition but before I did, I wanted to confirm with him first that he couldn't pay for it. He said he wouldn't answer that question and brushed me away. When I tried to get more from him, he started yelling at me calling me disrespectful. This is an ongoing thing with him. Whenever we try to talk back, he calls us disrespectful. When he is with his friends, he brags about how smart, educated, and respectful his children are, but then in private, he belittles us, sends money to strangers, and constantly puts others first before his own family. I guess we are all sick of it and I want to write this out because I don't know if somebody can see his side of things and tell me what I am missing here. Yes we can move out but the economy is so bad and he knows that so whenever he gets mad, he tells us that we can just leave, knowing that we can't support ourselves. He gets about $1,500 extra in rent from us every month from 3 of us but not from 2 of us cause my sister lost her job and my other sister just started her college as well (she's 17f). She worked very hard and brought about 60k of yearly tuition down to 7k with scholarships and is staying in the dorms. My dad has now refused to pay that even though my sister has worked throughout highschool to make that money. When we argue about money, he stirs the conversation away from the main point and starts going on longggg rants about this certain bill and that certain bill and whenever we cut him off so he can get to the point, he calls us disrespectful and tells us to get out of his room. We know he purposely does this so he can get out of a conversation. And even when he says he never has the money, he is constantly sending money to random people and we feel like he is flexing it. I remember I had to stay at school while my classmates got to go on a fieldtrip cause he didnt want to oay the $5 fee. And then he bought a $20 hat for a funeral he went ONCE! He likes to be constantly looked at and it's so embarrassing when we have to go out. And my mom is constantly arguing with him on our behalf. It's tiring and I feel for my mom who has to deal with his tantrums most of the time. \n",

    "selftext": "\nOk so this is advice for how to survive these places. They are helpful, but in a weird way, but it sucks, and it\u2019s traumatizing. But it\u2019s very isolated and weirdly desensitized, so in there you aren\u2019t effecting anyone you have personal attachments to. So first official tip, just make it to your release date, and you will be just fine. \n\nNext, a lot of people coming in to these places may have drug issues, or self harm. When I was in the ones I went to, I was too. And I was put in a terrible place with people on stimulants and benzos; along with a very odd amount of persistence and survival \u201cmethods\u201d \nYou will likely turn to snorting cheeked meds, drinking hand sanitizer and god knows what else. So go in with at least a little safety net. bring yourself alcohol wipes, an extra sock, and then a condom, if you are afab and haven\u2019t had any surgeries or anything like that then this can work for \u201ctransportation\u201d but the condom has other uses too. Not for sex.\n \nPlease don\u2019t have sex oh my god. Just jerk off or something, everyone there is fighting literal demons. You do not want to end up in bed with them, I know that sounds stupid, but two people going through a mental health mess will have a very weird and toxic dynamic. \n\nI should also say that people are going to be judgmental. They are judging themselves so they are also projecting it. \nSo I just don\u2019t think you should form attachments or like preconceptions. You should talk to them though, it will really help to hear about someone\u2019s life the closest you ever can. It makes you feel less alone. And it\u2019s incredible to know you\u2019ve seen these people be horrible and they the same for you, and you will never see each other again, and they know the most and least about you. \n\n\n\n",
