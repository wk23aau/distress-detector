"t3_1j6femf","I stole from my patients","I used to work in a bougie Care Home several years ago.

This involved feeding elderly patients with dementia. Well, dementia can make feeding quite difficult and a lot of the patients don‚Äôt eat much. We had everything from quiche, steak to the best desserts. Most of the time they would have a few spoons and be done.

Now I know where your mind is going with this ü•≤‚Ä¶.

So I used to feed my patient and enjoy some of the food once they were done. I would take 2 spoons and feed them from one side. Then I would eat from the other side.

The dementia meant they couldn‚Äôt really say anything. And I would sit in a position to make sure I was not in view. I would offer food multiple times even if they declined as well. So I felt I was giving them my best. I was barely 18 and I‚Äôm so ashamed every time I think about it.

My hunger was stronger than my shame at the time. And the fact it was the same plate‚Ä¶like what was I thinking üò≠

But honestly the food was sensational, I still think about that damn chef. It‚Äôs not an excuse and I still have regrets.

I can never share this with anyone. This is truly off my chest.","464","33"
"t3_1j75irl","I have to wait till May to get into therapy- and I'm just trying to stay okay.","for context, the reason I have to wait till may is because my father got laid off of his job so until recently I've had terrible insurance. money is something I stress about so I never thought to spend it when I could just wait till he got a good job again. I never thought I'd need therepy until recently. (I've always needed therapy i just havent wanted to go) I have ADHD and depression +anxiety and have been un medicated.

I want to talk to a professional because I cannot handle going to work. I hate working. I hate how my body aches and I'm forced to think and not be able to do anything acually GOOD to help me get out of it. I have to do tasks wile being trapped by my own mind. I suffer from some sort of gender dysphoria, I hate being a woman when someone reminds me that...I am... a woman. when i forget i am a girl. im okay. but, I have Tokophobia(fear of pregnancy) and it is effecting my day to day life. it hurts to live. I'm surrounded by men at work who can't even confront their own emotions I KNOW they can't handle mine, they have given up right in front of me. I have to stay sheltered and not speak my mind because it isn't about tacos (I work at taco bell) so I'm alone in my suffering

that is until I have my boyfriend or my best friend with me(we work together) my friend helps me by basically forcing me to talk for once(after hours during close) and I'll litteraly be there crying while working and the others look at me like ""wtf I'm staying out of this"". ITS EMBARRASSING but it's so nesssesary to my sanity

I cry every day now. I feel so cursed in this body.

I'm so lucky to have both my BFF and my boyfriend who support me 100. they just want me to be okay, but I can tell I'm not normal the way my thoughts race and crying when I'm alone. I kinda just want to be happy and not worry but my brain likes to attack me.","6","4"
"t3_1j7c2ta","They get to me‚Ä¶ jobs and parents","27M

I was always the top student in everything, perfect GPA in university and great highschool grades that I paid off my university tuition via scholarships alone.

Yet I‚Äôm struggling to find a job and all my parents do is try to crush my spirit and see me as nothing more than an embarrassment and a failure.

I‚Äôve applied for remote jobs and in person jobs with no luck and I‚Äôm continuing to build my portfolio and resume and doing my best to network online. On top of that I always help around the house, cleaning, maintence, etc

At this point only retail jobs are what I‚Äôm going for to help pay the car and knowing them they‚Äôll be happy to see me struggle and live up to their ‚Äúfailure‚Äù expectations of me. If I even once am seem visibly upset I‚Äôm criticized, belittled and shamed with their friends. I have a brother similar in age who‚Äôs doing much better with a job and they only want to talk about him and his accomplishments. Both got similar grades only difference is he has a job related to his degree while I don‚Äôt.

Truthfully, I have no friends either and I hate to say that some days what they think of me is soul crushing‚Ä¶ especially when I‚Äôm living at home with them during this time period.

Am I the only person whose parents curse you when you‚Äôre nothing less than ‚Äúperfect?‚Äù Somedays it drives me nuts! And like the title‚Ä¶ it gets to me and affects my confidence. Yeah sometimes it makes me want to disappear.","2","2"

"t3_1j6wish","I'm done holding on to the scraps of relationship my father and I have left","Very long and emotional story short (or as short as I can get it):

0-13 - I grew up a daddy's girl. I love my father with my whole heart and cherish his presence. I am inherently anxious and suffer from undiagnosed AUDHD, anxiety disorder and depression, but it doesn't affect me as much because my family is loving and kind.

13 - My mother and I caught my father cheating on her. He told us he stopped and that he was sorry.

13-15 - I didn't talk to my father directly, as I felt betrayed and hurt. This was made worse when my mother kept trying to stand up for him. (I later learnt she was trying to stop the mistress from contacting my father so that she and him could work on their relationship)

14 - My mother is diagnosed with cancer, but they cant tell what kind or how far along it is.  My father grows even more distant from us, and the arguments increase.

15-16 - My mother is hospitalized and my father starts talking to this woman on his phone. I start to feel more anxious. My mother advocates for my father, but it just makes me more mad and hurt. They argue more now, and I find myself becoming emotionally distant from my father.

Late 16 - My mother dies and I shut down, as well as shut myself off from my family, friends and peers. I am angry at my father as he does not seem as affected and was also the cause of my mother's stress before she died. My older brother tries to soothe me and we traumabond. My father tries to relate to me, as his mother died a few months before mine, but he doesn't understand that it isn't the same.

My father 'dates', moves in and then marries a woman I have never met in less than 8 months. His friends, my trusted adults, all support him, as well as his family and peers. I am hurt, but I pass it off as him just grieving differently. I was sure it was a phase and that they would break up/divorce soon enough. I later find out, its the same woman he cheated on my mother with, lied to us about, and then continued to talk to while my mother was battling cancer. I confront him about this and he says that he thought I knew who she was (despite us never being formally introduced to her. To this day, I know next to nothing about her. Only her first name, where her mother lives, and the name of one of her children.)

Father's wife is emotionally and verbally abusive towards me and my brother, but I, being the younger and more emotional one, take it harder.

She tells me that I'm killing my father by arguing with him, and that he will end up dead, just like my mother. I yell back at her to defend my father, as I take it very seriously when someone wishes death upon another (even indirectly), but my father takes her side and berates me for defending him.

He does a myriad of other things; threatening to sell off my cats, locking them outside and causing one to die from the cold as punishment for me not agreeing with him, as well as pretending not to hear when his wife flat out threatens to kill me. He was right next to her when she said it, mind you.

Under the advice of my older cousin from my moms side, I report the wife to the CPS but he denies hearing her threaten me to the social workers, which makes me look like an emotional teenage girl. We get placed into family therapy, but the therapist is borderline sexist and just wants us to be a family unit, regardless of the woman's blatant disregard for my safety.

I ask my father why he's choosing his wife's needs over the safety of his biological children, whom he claims to adore, and he simply says that ""the Bible says wife before children"". I'd argue that doesn't apply to 'wife that you cheated on your children's mother with and who threatens you children', but okay, dad.

I sleep with a knife under my pillow, just in case she tries to harm me. My anxiety and depression levels are through the roof.

17 - 19 - I cant remember much from these years, but it mostly involves me trying to bond with my father, as he's the last living parent I have. I go through 3 relationships, and have no one to talk to or seek comfort from when it goes downhill. My father thinks we're getting better because of him, and not because of the gigantic effort and emotional stuffing-down I'm doing as even being near his wife makes me anxious to the point of insomnia.As angry as I was before, I still love my father and want him in my life. I tell him that he can pick any other wife, just not her, and I would be genuinely happy with that. He doesn't care, and only treats me well when she's not there (away on vacation or at her mother's house). When she is around, though, he is more distant, and visibly more tense.

20 - My father announced that he wants to split our house physically (half of it is to go to me and my brother, as it was built when my mother was alive and she paid for and designed it). I tell him that I don't want him to do it, as it will just drive us further apart, but his reasoning revolves around his wife and her comfort. My brother and I have long assumed that his wife is just with him to benefit from his money, she doesn't treat him nicely, but he doesn't seem to notice.

I know its childish and na√Øve, but I didn't want him to distance himself from me, even though he has hurt me so much for so long. I still cry (I've actually just stopped crying as I'm typing this) whenever I think about how far we've already drifted apart.

Our relationship went from one of trust, smiles, secret fast-food lunch breaks and long hugs... to me not even being able to tell him about the girl that broke my heart, and how I would love to have one genuine dad-hug from him so that he can tell me its alright. I would love to have him at my wedding one day, but I don't know if that will ever happen.

I don't want to grow up, not in a world where he dies alone and regretful, but it seems that that's the only way for me to not end up living my entire life clinging to his leg, begging him to look back and maybe love me the way he used to.

So I'm done. I'm done wanting his love and I'm done waiting on him to realise he was wrong, and that I still needed him.

I'm going to be something, and I'm going to love someone and let them love me in return.

I deserve better.

TLDR: My father has hurt me with his actions and his words for too long. I'm going to learn how to live without him, no matter how much it will hurt to let him go.","33","5"
"t3_1j7bpwd","My (20f) dad (54m) refuses to pay for my sister (18f) tuition because he has ""no money""","So when we were in highschool, my dad made us quit any extracurricular activities to make extra money and help pay bills and save for our college, and just put into saving for us. Thats what he told us. But He would take whatever we made and only give us $20 of spending money every pay period. We gave him thousands that went towards the bills and college funds and even built a house back in our home country for when our parents retire. To add to that, we have gotten many scholarships so the majority of our schools were paid for. My sister in question lost her job and has been having a hard time finding another one. My dad used her funds to pay for the first half of her tuition but refused to pay for the second half. The cost is $4k. He said he has no money but yet he JUST bought a new BMW worth 25 to 30k. Keep in mind, we have 3 EXTRA CARS that need about $500 worth if fixing for him to drive just fine! When my mom was trying to talk to him about helping pay for my sister's college tuition, he told her to ask us (the siblings) to help. Since I have money saved, I was able to help pay for her tuition but before I did, I wanted to confirm with him first that he couldn't pay for it. He said he wouldn't answer that question and brushed me away. When I tried to get more from him, he started yelling at me calling me disrespectful. This is an ongoing thing with him. Whenever we try to talk back, he calls us disrespectful. When he is with his friends, he brags about how smart, educated, and respectful his children are, but then in private, he belittles us, sends money to strangers, and constantly puts others first before his own family. I guess we are all sick of it and I want to write this out because I don't know if somebody can see his side of things and tell me what I am missing here. Yes we can move out but the economy is so bad and he knows that so whenever he gets mad, he tells us that we can just leave, knowing that we can't support ourselves. He gets about $1,500 extra in rent from us every month from 3 of us but not from 2 of us cause my sister lost her job and my other sister just started her college as well (she's 17f). She worked very hard and brought about 60k of yearly tuition down to 7k with scholarships and is staying in the dorms. My dad has now refused to pay that even though my sister has worked throughout highschool to make that money. When we argue about money, he stirs the conversation away from the main point and starts going on longggg rants about this certain bill and that certain bill and whenever we cut him off so he can get to the point, he calls us disrespectful and tells us to get out of his room. We know he purposely does this so he can get out of a conversation. And even when he says he never has the money, he is constantly sending money to random people and we feel like he is flexing it. I remember I had to stay at school while my classmates got to go on a fieldtrip cause he didnt want to oay the $5 fee. And then he bought a $20 hat for a funeral he went ONCE! He likes to be constantly looked at and it's so embarrassing when we have to go out. And my mom is constantly arguing with him on our behalf. It's tiring and I feel for my mom who has to deal with his tantrums most of the time.","2","2"
"t3_1j7gtg5","Am I entitled to feel in such a way?","Hi... this is my first reddit post and I need to get these feelings  off my chest. I just feel so angry and I hate it.

Context -> So around a year and three ish four months ago, my father had died in hospital. All shocking and scary times for me and my mom. I was 16 at the time. So I was quite affected and so was my mom. We mourned for quite some time after his death. And we went through a rough patch for a few months before we recovered.

So this is where the story starts, my mother began chatting and dating around. To which I was fine with, as I was happy she wasn't mourning over my dad and was healing.

She dated a one or two guys before she found this guy Bill (not real name) who works as a driver. They started dating and shit. And I was quite okay with it. Despite for a few times I was annoyed and irritated at him.

For starters, my mom would never tell me if he  was coming over. And normally when I'd wake up in the morning he'd be in the kitchen with my mom drinking coffee. This kinda annoyed me. I didn't like this stranger enter my house where my father once lived. I hated sharing my private personal space with this stranger. I hated and still hate his presence in my house.

He is quite annoying as a person, his like a kid. Extremely curious and neat picking. He laughs in a weird manner not a proper laugh. He acts childish at times. He's obsessed with my pet budgie named tim (not real name) but he doesn't know how to hold him properly. He constantly stresses my bird out. Which i hate.

Anyways, I always felt like my mother moved on way to quickly from my father. And I quite hate it. I'm aware it's her life and she can do whatever. And that she's healing.. but it's hurts  seeing her do things she never do with my father. My father wasn't physically the most affectionate as in ways of kissing or holding hands. But he loved me and my mom in his own ways. My mom truly loved my dad.

I don't know how to describe the emotions I'm feeling. It's difficult to explan everything. I just don't like him and I hate his presence in my home. I hate him touching things inside my house. I find him irritating at times and annoying. I feel these angry feelings.

I hate the fact I don't have mother daughter time with my mother. As Bill comes over to sleep over like... 3ish to 4 days a week. Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday. I quite missing going out with my mom on Saturday shopping or in town. But now as bill sleeps over in Saturday he spends his day off, Sundays with us. And I hate that.

Every time I plan something with my mom on Sunday, he always has to crash our daughter mother time. I hate him kissing my mom. Being all lovely dovey. I'm happy for her healing and being happy with someone.

But it's not the same as it was.  I miss my dad

Edit - forgot to mention, my mom literally babies him. Every time he comes over, she cooks all the time. She never has a second to herself.","1","5"

"t3_1j76rw2","He doesn‚Äôt want me as his girlfriend but he wants me to date a guy like him","He doesn‚Äôt want to date me seriously but wants me to date a guy like him?

I‚Äôve been casually seeing this guy for a couple months. He leaves to go to another state soon so feelings aside we‚Äôve known there‚Äôs an ‚Äúexpiry‚Äù from the start.

Well- actually I asked him if he wants to try long distance/take things further. He said I‚Äôm everything he wants in a girl but that he doesn‚Äôt want to have a girlfriend. Okay, fair enough.

However something that bothers me is that he occasionally comments on my dating future. He‚Äôll say things like ‚Äúyou should get back into hiking so you can meet another guy like me‚Äù (it‚Äôs how we met), or teaching me things ‚Äúyou can use to impress the next guy‚Äù, and then after telling me I deserve someone better than him he tells me that ‚Äúwhen you do start seeing someone new, send me his instagram‚Äù so he can check it out??

This really confuses me because he says he does have some feelings towards me, but he‚Äôs very firm on not wanting to take things further. On the other hand for me I don‚Äôt even want to think about who he dates next- it‚Äôll just make me sad and jealous. Why does he bring stuff like this up so much?","4","13"
"t3_1j7g5m0","My job is easy but it is mind numbingly boring and I hate it","I am an instructional aide. My job is more or less patrolling around a class room and maybe some kid will raise his hand and maybe I can help them. Other than that, it's nothing. Its just walking around a classroom. I hate it. And maybe I shouldn't hate it; most people want boring jobs. But I come home everyday feeling drained and exhausted from doing literally nothing all day. It's unfulfilling, I don't particularly like the kids and I feel like I'm just wasting away there.

I want to quit it so damn badly.","1","3"
"t3_1j76jal","I have repeatedly tried to systematically ruin my own life","I (27F) have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, and after that all to puzzle pieces fell into place. All the emotions, the feeling of not fitting in anywhere, the emptiness and distortion of my self image.

I have repeatedly done stuff that I knew would ruin my relationships, or sabotaged my self, thinking I could prove I was unlovable or unworthy. Because my logic was if that can‚Äôt handle me at my worst, they don‚Äôt deserve me at my best. Or that I wasn‚Äôt good enough for them and couldn‚Äôt understand why they cared about me.

A month before my 15th birthday, I tried to end my life, and my boyfriend at the time had an ex that had ended her life a few years earlier. A week before he had told me he didn‚Äôt love me anymore, but wouldn‚Äôt break up with me at the time, bc ‚Äúmaybe the feelings will come back‚Äù. I knew ending my life would make him come to a decision, but that‚Äôs not why I did it. He did not come to visit me at the hospital, but his best friend did. A few days later I kissed a new guy and a week after that I started dating that guy. And so on and so forth. I often ended it with one guy, and started dating a new one a week or two after. This pattern lasted from 13 years old to 17 years old, when I got into a relationship with a guy who was 5 years older than me. In my country you‚Äôre legal at the age of 16.

On my 18th birthday I moved in with him, and within 2 months I was pregnant with my son. We can call this guy Aaron. Arron was a drug addicted, alcoholic and violent POS. He severely beat me, raped me and cut me off from my friends and family. I was a terrified pregnant 18 year old with no one to turn to. I left him almost two years after we moved in together. I called my mom after not talking to her or my dad for almost a year. And I asked if I could come visit. I moved back to their house a week after.

At the beginning of 2018 I moved from my hometown to a little island where I met my now husband (37M) and father to my two younger sons. I admit I tried repeatedly destroying this relationship, he never gave up, just kept on loving me through all of it. Christmas 2023 I had a mental breakdown, planning how to kill myself and writing letters to my family. But making my child cry while he was playing with his new toys, made me get some help. I was in the psych ward for 8 days, didn‚Äôt get to see my children other than FaceTime, and I celebrated new years alone. I was diagnosed with CPTSD, depression, anxiety and borderline personality disorder. I had a ADHD diagnosis from the age of 15.

I started therapy February 2024, and DBT group September 2024. And I have finally started getting back to my feet, learning how to feel emotions again, and not look at myself with resentment and disgust. I have not had a big emotional breakdown or reaction since October 2024, and I am so proud of myself. I started ADHD medication for the first time in 13 years, and it has helped me keep up everything in the house, and following my kids closer. I‚Äôm so grateful that I didn‚Äôt go through with my plan, and I thank my children and husband every day for being ‚Äúmine‚Äù and that I love them more than anything.","4","2"
"t3_1j7fwtg","I feel left out by my girlfriend","Hello guys. I really have to get this off my shoulders so i decided to make this post on here. already appreciate you guys for reading it.

So, i am M/22 and my gf is the same age, we are together since three years now and everything did go well for the most part. The thing is, i am an absolute introvert and probably suffer from social anxiety. I hate to go to places where a lot of people are, i cannot eat when a lot of people are around me and i just get exhausted and overwhelmed so fast. this makes my life really hard tbh, and its even harder because i cant understand why i feel that way. like i was grown up in a great, lovingly household, have a good job, and i am basically just a normal guy, who should not complain about his life. However my gf knows all those things and we talk about it and all, she also tells me shes there for me and just tries to help me out as much as she can.

And then there was this situation yesterday, it was the 20th birthday of her brother (who is also a really close friend of mine) and he was throwing a party with approximately 40 people. and what can i say, i felt like absolute shit the whole week, my anxiety hit rock bottom and i felt like i couldnt handle it. the night before the party i had a fucking panic attack while falling asleep. So i was talking to my gf, talking about how i feel and how i am getting the worst anxiety ever and so on.. she then tried to make me feel less anxious, she told me she is there for me the whole evening, she wont let me be alone and stuff and idk just trying to pick me up. (thats also one thing, like i feel giga weak in those situations, why cant i handle such things, shouldnt i be the one protecting her? however i am also really insecure about myself).

The party was on saturday 19;00, in a bar. my heart was racing all day. i tried to calm myself down with playing some video games, some csgo and some league, but nothing really helped. So at around 18:30 i left home and was driving to the party. you can imagine how i felt. when i arrived, we were in a group of maybe 5 people (i really didnt know many people there, maybe like 3 or 4). then i went to the wc, to calm down a bit and when i cam back my gf was grouping with her friend, the other people i knew where also with their other friends, and suddenly i find myself standing in this bar, alone, trying to talk to some people i didnt even know, just to make it less akward. it was my personal hell. However, i couldnt just go to my gf and her friends, because i would have felt ultra weird, when being the only guy there coming out of nowhere. i would have appreciated it so much, if she would have came up the me and just would be on my site. but she didnt. she didnt the whole evening. like in 8 hours, she wasnt coming up to me once. one time she was looking at me, she wanted to ask me if everything was okay by signaling it, i was shaking my head and telling her no nothing is ok, and then she turned around and did go somewhere else. like why? i dont understand that. i feel like the biggest loser on this earth, my feelings are ultra hurt and i cant stop thinking about it. i could have never done it like this if roles were switched. maybe i am overreacting, but honestly i dont think so. like why do i even tell her how i felt like shit because of this party. should i have just came up to her and her friends? idk. i still think it would have been easier for her to come pick me up, then for me to go to them. especially when she knows how i felt.

idk, this evening made me just feel like absolute shit, i feel hurt as hell, i could literally start to cry right now. Why do i have to be such an insecure and anti social person, i just dont get it. however, now i am here, sitting at my pc, listening to music and writing this down. idk if anybody will even read this, but if so, sorry if my english is not the yellow from the egg, but i tried my best.

have a nice sunday evening","0","1"
"t3_1j6spwd","I got good news but no friends to tell.","It's been a while since I was on here. On Reddit . I had a pretty rough start of the years. Boyfriend cheated Roomate left our place without telling me. Lost my friends Had to cut off some of my family.

So I feel pretty isolated in all this. Anyway I received some good news.

I was approved to follow a work/studies program. Which will allow me to go back to school while still being able to provide for my son and I. He's almost 3 and I just want a better life for us mostly for him. I want to be a special need educator which allows me to work with kids having intellectual deficiencies. It's pretty common in my reservation and I wanna be able to help my community. I'll be graduating in a year And will be off to university by 2026-2027 I'll be the first in my family to graduate university All whole still being a mom.

I was also approved for an apartment closer to school a d my son's daycare. I won't have to wake up at 4 am get my son ready and be out the door at 5:30. And hopefully get to work by 7. I take the bus in the morning sometimes I can't help but be late to work cause a bus is late or cancelled. I'll be able to do everything by walking.The landlord lowered the rent for me so instead of 1800$ I'll be paying around 1300$ per month.

I am going to therapy this summer. My older sister will be caring for my son for a whilee month while I work on myself. I went to therapy before but it wasn't as long and intense as the one I'll be going to.  It's 28 days in nature which I like. Everything will be paid off by the government.

I am 21 years old. I've been on my own since I was 17. I felt like my life was going nowhere till I decided what I wanted to do. I can't wait for this new chapter of my life. One I can be proud of. One where my son and I will live struggle free. I am proud of myself.","51","13"
"t3_1j77ugw","Despite believing I am worthy, I don‚Äôt see any reason why anyone would care about me.","Okay so this might come across as a little sad and bleak, and I doubt that I will get any gentle responses... Might as well be ranting because I have found a haven in Reddit lately.

I often wonder why anyone would like to be friends with me. I struggle a lot with anxiety and maintaining attention, and usually when I offer advice it is not that helpful (usually overly philosophical and impractical). Some people may like to engage in that kind of discussion I guess‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt have any interesting hobbies besides going to a cafe by myself and having a cigarette, browsing and looking for jobs to advance my career. I have a very niche sense of humour that can be overly sarcastic and easily offend. I try to pick up hobbies, but I end up wanting to escape my reality via watching too much TV, cleaning/decluttering and spending time with my partner, which I also don‚Äôt see why he would stay with me after the initial attraction wears off. I am probably extremely depressed as I grew up with a childhood trauma that I tried to address via therapy but it felt like the benefit wasn‚Äôt outweighing the expense and somehow it felt even more depressing as ‚Äúmy only only hope for getting better didn‚Äôt look that hopeful‚Äù. A few therapists seemed to make me feel like my system was in a kind of a deadlock. I find myself lately thinking often about why anyone would like to be friends with me, even though I don‚Äôt think less of myself - I am young (32F), attractive, fit and financially independent. I am well-educated and have a decent-paying job. I rarely lie, gossip and I like to support people by understanding their goals. I like to treat my friends every now and again, but I don‚Äôt like transactional relationships. I used to have creative ambitions but quit them and settled into a boring life when I saw nothing was really materializing.

"t3_1j7fkn2","i‚Äôm nothing but all Ego and i hate myself","I‚Äôm nothing but ego, and I hate myself.

I‚Äôm 22M, and for the last four years, I‚Äôve been miserable. English isn‚Äôt my first language, so excuse any mistakes.

I used to be smart‚Äîvery smart. Athletic, good-looking, and girls had crushes on me. It felt like the world revolved around me. But now? I feel like a total loser. No physical attributes, no social skills, no confidence. Deep down, I blame my mother for it. She kept transferring me from school to school between 4th and 10th grade, always chasing the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù one. I never had the same classmates for more than two years. Now, I‚Äôm in university, completely alone.

But I know blaming her is just a way to avoid blaming myself.

In my freshman year, I thought everyone around me was a loser. I looked down on my classmates just because they submitted assignments on time and put effort into learning. I saw them as slaves to society while thinking I was somehow above it all. Recently, I realized that I was the real loser.

I‚Äôm studying computer science, but my GPA is barely 2.0. My parents trust me and never ask about it. They gave me everything i needed but, I‚Äôve learned almost nothing beyond the basics. I can‚Äôt write a full program from scratch, I rely on AI to generate templates. I always have anxiety at night thinking about the future. Can I get better at my profession? Will I ever be able to find love?

My love life is non-existent. I‚Äôve never been with a girl, and I get attached to anyone who gives me the slightest attention. I used to think all girls were ‚Äúsluts‚Äù just because they enjoyed love and lived their lives. I guess that was just my insecurity talking.

I don‚Äôt want to be like this anymore. I want to change. Be more disciplined. I want to be a better person and live life like a normal guy. As you can see i made it better using AI lol. Gosh i‚Äôm pathetic. It‚Äôs 4AM i don‚Äôt know i‚Äôll be able to go to school.","1","0"
"t3_1j6qs0c","I miss the old internet, pre-Facebook","I was born in the very early 90's so I got to experience the internet from like ~2001 and on. I grew up as a teenager on the internet in the mid 2000-2010 and I fucking miss it.

Jumping on the home computer to go on the internet used to be like a little adventure. You never knew what you'd see. Sites like Newgrounds were full of creative, fun, and dirty content that you had to look over your shoulder to make sure mom wasn't coming up the stairs.

Best of all, people made creative content for fun/community/respect not just for money. Sure clickbait existed back then, but not EVERYTHING was a thinly veiled perverted attempt to extract money or data from you.

Best of all, the internet didn't follow you around everywhere. When you left the computer, you left the internet.

I loved the lawlessness. I loved the freedom. I miss forums, and while they still exist in some niches, they've been annihilated by Facebook groups.","64","8"
"t3_1j7fdqt","My (ex)girlfriend gaslit me while relationship while cheating on me, found out on my birthday","My (m24) now ex(f26) girlfriend started dating in March last year. I had just come out of a toxic situationship where I take part blame. I was a bad communicator, I‚Äôm sure I still am but I gained some communication skills. I really liked her, found my now ex, 3 weeks later. I knew it would be a rebound but it helped so much. Especially considering this girl had been my crush since 8 years ago when I had first started working with her. We had so much fun early on, trips, going out, eating out. It started to feel less like a rebound and something of a real relationship. Unfortunately, it came to her moving out of her mom‚Äôs house. She needed a place to go, and me with my somewhat trust issues, was scared to let her move in with her friends which were one girl and two guys. She had been known to ‚Äúget around‚Äù but I trusted her more than most people did and had hope. She was very kind, had many mental issues, but nothing I couldn‚Äôt stand, I had grown up with childhood trauma and this seemed like nothing. So me with my trust issues, and wanting to move out of my mom‚Äôs house as well, took her offer of renting a place together. It seemed fun and I had just started a career job, so it seemed like a good time. Found out very quickly, it would not be. See my ex, we‚Äôll call Fiona, had severe insecurities and drinking issues, not to mention drug addiction. I had known to some extent, but not to this severity. The first week we moved in, I wanted to have a get together party for our first place together. Turns out, Fiona hates having people in her space. She was very quiet the whole night, and near the end, she stormed off to the room, where I‚Äôd get yelled at when I head to bed. She scream at me in bed, as I had work the next morning I told her sorry and we‚Äôd talk about it tomorrow. She got up and stormed out the room. I was just happy for the quiet, until I hear her screaming my name and yelling help! Help! I storm out, seeing her wrist covered in blood, with it spilling all over the floors. I help her best I can, she didn‚Äôt hit an artery so it soon stopped, but left a nasty scar. After this night, most nights, especially when we went out, I would get no rest, being accused of cheating, or just not giving her enough love. Over the next few months, one of our mutual friends decided a surprise birthday party for her. I honestly wasn‚Äôt thinking to hard about it, I just thought maybe it‚Äôd make her happy, forgetting she didn‚Äôt like people in her space. Same thing happened. She was upset the whole night, stayed in the bedrooms and never came out. Through out the night you could hear her screams saying ‚Äúget out of my house!‚Äù In the most embarrassing way possible. Her sister was there, and tried to calm her down the whole night, which did not work. I eventually got everyone out, because the music was barely covering it up. I went to bed again. Same thing, yelling at me. She got up, stormed out. I was worried but thought that it was a one time thing. Nope, I instantly hear my name being screamed. This time, much worse. I come out to see the cut is even deeper, attempt to stop the bleeding but it just won‚Äôt. I call 911 while making a makeshift tourniquet to try and stop it. The paramedics get her after the police, which was someone I knew. I told them about how she was saying before that she wanted to die. I didn‚Äôt think this was an attempt, but a callout. I took her to the hospital after the medics said she didn‚Äôt need the ambulance after patching her up. Stayed up all night at the hospital, dropped her off at home, then went to work. I was miserable. I couldn‚Äôt stand this anymore. I didn‚Äôt want to break the lease, but at the same time I also still cared for this girl. I felt bad. I needed a way out, that night was my chance, but you just couldn‚Äôt leave her alone, she cried and begged me. So we continued our relationship. A few months later, same thing, yelling at me and saying I don‚Äôt give her enough affirmations and accusing me of deleting snapchats and sneaking people in when she‚Äôs off at work. Which led to a night that she destroyed my tv in the living room, put holes in the walls, and screamed at me in my face. I was done, I left to stay at my friends house. Told her to leave, we‚Äôd figure out the situation after. The day after, she said she needed time to move, and wanted to talk. I went over, and we talked the whole night. She promised she‚Äôd get therapy, and help. And I felt so terrible, I truly loved this girl, but it was such a toxic relationship. I gave her one last chance. We decided to stick together, agreeing to talk things out more. See, I still have my trust issues, and being accused of things makes me curious why it‚Äôs that in particular. I memorized her password months ago, but never really felt the need to look through her phone. I had it just in case. But I was working one night, straight shift. She went out with her friends. Acted very strange to me, and I just felt something was off. I come home at 7am, find her dead asleep. Couldn‚Äôt even wake her up to give her a kiss. She had left her phone on my side of the bed. I felt the urge to look through it. Went through it for hours. Finding hidden messages in messenger of her taking to her ex saying how she thinks about him everyday, and that she needs him. Other messages to her OTHER ex on Snapchat, came across it by chance because it had been cleared and muted. It was of last night being very flirty and him leaving hearts and her pictures with her hearting back. Her saying I miss you, and then a phone call about 6 minutes lasting. I called this number, I asked him to be straight up if she‚Äôs cheating. He sounded dumbfounded but said she wasn‚Äôt and that they were just friends that use to date. But I found pictures dating only right before we started dating that they were kissing and all over eachother. I woke her up, absolutely heated. Ngl this was probably the angriest I‚Äôve ever been. I told her what I had seen. She of course denied it. Eventually admitting that it was cheating but they never had sex. Which I absolutely think is a lie. But I said it was over, and she took it so easily. She nodded and called her mom, got her stuff in the car, then laughing about a joke she made saying she‚Äôs tired of constantly moving. All while I sit and wait for her to leave. Also if I didn‚Äôt mention, this happened ALL ON MY BIRTHDAY. She leaves not answering any of my questions like why? how could you do this? Since then, I‚Äôve been sitting here, she still left a few things and needs a truck to come pick them up. She just texted me that she‚Äôs coming today to pick them up. I still feel like shit, but can hold my emotions together.","0","3"

"t3_1j652ed","My husband had a thing for a dog and now I‚Äôm rethinking him as a person","Three weeks ago me (28f) and my husband (29m) went out to a bar. When we got there, we happened to run into a middle school friend of his. We got to talking and his friend was sharing stories about when they were in middle school together. Like the time his friend walked into the wrong restroom by mistake and was made fun or for a year and when my husband got hard asking out a girl, after a few more embarrassing and funny stories his friend who we'll call Jeff says ""hey remember that dog"". I think you can see where this is going. My husband started breaking down laughing and I was totally confused. So I asked ""what dog"" Jeff explained in sixth grade was/is/whatever the terminology is a ""zoophilia"" he was sexually interested in a dog named ""champion"" he didn't do anything but got a boner after he was playing with this dog. He and his friend shocked about it for a while but he kept taking pictures of this dog. It started to move from joking territory to creepy. Three months later, he attempted to kidnap the dog. Thankfully, Jeff's father (the owner of the dog) caught him.

Is it weird that I'm reconsidering my marriage even though this hasn't been a problem in decades. My whole view of my husband has changed, so am I over reacting to my husband's middle school issues?","2627","421"
"t3_1j7f2kc","Unsure about my trauma","So I just made this account because there is something that has been troubling me for a while now. And I obviously didn't wish to use my original account to post it. In my dating years, I had 3 accidental pregnancies and obviously I couldn't keep them so I went ahead with aborting them. I understood that it was not the ideal decision and a lot of people would have opinions on it, but it was the only right decision for me at that time. Now it has been some years since this has happened and I‚Äôm very happy with my partner today, but there are days when this sadness comes back about those three incidents . This sadness gets triggered by anything randomly. For instance, a friend decides to use birth protection, and I don‚Äôt know why I wake up thinking about that time when I had to do what I did. Another time, I could not go through the series, which was depicting in some detail about a couple dealing with the abortion and the decision making around it . While the abortion itself is a horrible experience to go through, the last one that I had was extremely painful and terrible due to some situations . My partner has been extremely supportive about this throughout the years, but I find it difficult to not feel like a burden when all of a sudden one morning, I am in a bad mood and they don‚Äôt understand exactly how and why I am feeling like that. So I guess I‚Äôm just dumping my feelings here because I‚Äôm not really sure what to do with them. I don‚Äôt want to burden my partner who already has a lot of pressure from work in everywhere else, and I can‚Äôt seem to make this sadness go away.","1","10"

And now she doesn‚Äôt trust me or anything I say anymore which I can admit is fair and have been doing the work to not lie to her anymore because I was terrified of her as a kid. I‚Äôll most likely delete later and just need some sort of insight from other parents or people that have had people like this in their lives. Me and my mom still live under the same roof but I‚Äôm genuinely thinking of getting out of here because I don‚Äôt know how much more I can take.

We had an argument a few days ago because I was trying to explain a situation that happened and she immediately started with saying I always have an answer and an excuse for everything. I tell her that it genuinely hurts she still thinks I‚Äôm lying to her and I‚Äôm trying to reassure her that I‚Äôm not. She resorts to mocking me about how my feelings were hurt. She then accused me of gaslighting her which I literally would never do and I had tears streaming down my face because it was clear she didn‚Äôt want to listen to anything I was saying.

"t3_1j79hp6","I can‚Äôt really take it anymore","Sorry for the long ass post. I would have made it longer but wanted to spare you the novel.

I‚Äôm honestly just really lost and struggling so much right now. I‚Äôm 25, and suffer from a long list of mental and physical disabilities. I‚Äôm not really able to work right now due to my disabilities but am in the middle of a long process of trying to get on disability payments. I still live at home with my mum and brother (dad is deceased), and I just found out last week my mum has stage 4 bone cancer. My partner of 3 years doesn‚Äôt live with me but is soon having to move out of his family home so has been putting pressure on me to move out with him as we‚Äôve been together for a significant amount of time and we should be moving onto the next stage of our relationship. I‚Äôve tried to explain that it‚Äôs difficult for me to move out as I don‚Äôt have a job and the income I do get from the government isn‚Äôt going to be enough to pay for rent let alone my food, medications, my dog‚Äôs food and be expected to save for my doctor and specialist appointments but also to save to eventually buy a house like how he wants us to be able to do before turning 30. He just keeps telling me to apply for work and I only have experience in retail but due to one of my medical conditions I can‚Äôt even stand for more than 5 hours on a good day without being in debilitating pain where I literally struggle to walk. I have no experience in being a receptionist and no matter how many jobs I apply for no luck. He wants me to move out as well as I‚Äôm being treated as a stay at home mother looking after my mum and brother (this is well before the cancer diagnosis). I don‚Äôt think as well that it‚Äôs sitting in for him that I very badly need and rely on being on my mum‚Äôs health insurance considering I‚Äôm chronically ill and it can turn at anytime for me and sadly I‚Äôm having a different surgery at least once a year, sometimes twice a year so idk how I‚Äôd be expected to afford that if I wasn‚Äôt living at home, with no job. He refuses to live with my family until we can save enough to buy a house because he hates my family and well understandably is struggling to even see a future with me like this but I feel like he‚Äôs in between a rock and a hard place with the fact that he does love me and how he doesn‚Äôt want to leave me cause I‚Äôm sick cause it‚Äôd be like leaving someone who‚Äôs got cancer which is an asshole thing to do. And it doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm struggling with my mum‚Äôs new diagnosis. On top of everything else I personally am just really struggling with how beyond god damn emotional I am. Late last year I fell down some stairs causing me to be bed ridden for 2 and a half weeks and in turn has caused me to develop or severely worsen potential already undiagnosed OCD. I‚Äôve never been diagnosed before with OCD because truly I don‚Äôt say out loud my thoughts and whatever I have disclosed or displayed gets pinned to my autism but since the fall I‚Äôve been consumed with anxiety, depression, anger, guilt, agitation and panic with mess, things not being in a particular order (mainly MY way of order). I feel like a shell of who I once was I struggle to hide anything well, I cry almost daily and have just started to learn either cry to myself when no one is around or wait for my therapist. I don‚Äôt ever want to leave my house cause if I stay at my partner‚Äôs house, guarantee I‚Äôll be a sobbing mess when I get back cause my mum and brother always make a mess and they never clean up after themselves which in turn triggers me more. I already am a pretty reserved person when it comes to my feelings cause I think it‚Äôll come off over dramatic to others even though I know they‚Äôre valid but today I got proven why I think that because my partner asked me what was wrong when I got home and I spilt 1/4 of my thoughts and feelings and I got stopped with being told that ‚Äúmaybe you just like to make things more difficult for yourself than it has to be‚Äù. Potentially that‚Äôs true but also I don‚Äôt mean to, my brain just never shuts up which I‚Äôm realising with typing this that yes it most definitely doesn‚Äôt shut up. The sadder thing is there‚Äôs a lot more to my anxieties and why I can‚Äôt take it anymore and maybe I‚Äôll just get a diary and deep clean till I can‚Äôt walk. I just want to be alone and lowkey sedated but I got an appointment in a couple days on an update to some scans and if I‚Äôll need surgery or not which is obviously another anxiety. I frankly just feel a lot of pressure from my boyfriend and I feel pressure to look after and help my mum and if I don‚Äôt well no one will cause my brother and her partner are useless. I feel pressure on myself with my own mental and physical health, getting a job and what kind of job realistically would even be good for me, I feel temptation to go back into eating disorder tendencies or back into my addiction to smoking weed. I feel beyond insecure about my appearance which I know is a vanity and self esteem issues. I truly don‚Äôt know what to do because try and take it day by day but I clearly have some control issues. I‚Äôm frustrated cause I don‚Äôt want to die, but I also don‚Äôt want to be alive or at least conscious.","2","1"

I had a thick canvas work jacket on so the teeth barely broke the skin. I carry a folding knife as a habit since I was a kid in boyscouts. I stabbed the dog with my free hand after trying to punch the dog and it ran off back around the corner of the house. A woman and her teenage daughter came around the corner screaming at me and I told them what happened. Apparently they were neighbors there to take care of the dogs. It all happened on the front porch in front of a ring camera. I then left, called my boss and the cops but decided not to take legal action. I guess I felt bad for doing that to the dog.

They were never referred to as adopted growing up. Flash forward I‚Äôm 19 he‚Äôs 13. He becomes obsessed with me completely out of no where. Starts with cutting the back out of several pairs of jeans attempting to see me exposed. Then one day I noticed while using the restroom there‚Äôs small holes chiseled into the wall. Yep peep holes. Parents patch them. He creates more. Mind you he‚Äôs in extensive therapy they‚Äôre basically begging for help as to why he‚Äôs doing this.

"t3_1j63j0w","UPDATE: My gf beat the shit out of someone who broke into her house","I don‚Äôt know if anyone remembers me but a while ago my girlfriend and I had a home invasion incident that culminated in her beating the shit out of the intruder. I‚Äôm tired of saying my gf so I‚Äôm going to call her Diana.

Turns out the guy was a drug addict from the next town over. He was in his 60s and he had an extensive history in jail and mental hospitals. Unfortunately about two months after my post, he passed away. We didn‚Äôt know anything about why until we got a chance to talk to his sister, who insisted she didn‚Äôt blame Diana and that the doctors even said that he probably didn‚Äôt have much longer anyway. (Diana was visibly distressed during this conversation so I‚Äôm not sure whether or not the sister just said that to comfort her)

After that Diana went on a trip to a national park during a week she knew I couldn‚Äôt take off and forgot her meds. She has seizures that look like mild psychosis/magical thinking and ended up refusing to come home at the end of the trip. She kept saying that she felt like she couldn‚Äôt leave the woods because she was certain there was something she needed to learn there that she hadn‚Äôt yet, and when I asked her how long that might take, she said ‚Äúsome people take a lifetime.‚Äù I asked if she was breaking up with me, and she said something about feeling like she was ‚Äútoo attached‚Äù to me, her house, her pets, etc and that she needed to meditate on that for a while.

I ended up going to her temple to see if anyone was willing to give me some perspective on the situation since she was seeing things through a Buddhist lens. It was the right choice. A monk actually drove the six hours out to her with me to talk to her in person since she wasn‚Äôt picking up calls. I am so, so unbelievably grateful for that monk because Diana started taking her meds again and came home soon after. I‚Äôve never been religious but I started to read the Pali canon afterwards and that shit slaps. Diana was already volunteering her time at the temple so now we both go together when we can.

All things considered, since then, things are back to normal and going well. We‚Äôre both children of divorce so even before all this we were doing prophylactic couples counseling every few months, and for a while after we were going once a week. Diana has started seeing a therapist on her own as well which I am so proud of her for since she‚Äôs always hated the idea of individual therapy.

We also stepped up our home security game. Diana already had plenty of cameras, but now we have door/window alarms and motion sensors. I also convinced Diana to get another dog, so now we have a 75lb puppy‚Ä¶

I know a lot of people were rooting for us to get married, but that‚Äôs not going to happen. Legal marriage isn‚Äôt something that interests us and it never has. But we did buy each other rings, and it‚Äôs been a great comfort to have something physical to remind me of her on my person all the time. We‚Äôre also considering having a small commitment ceremony next fall <3

Thanks again for all the feedback on my previous post. I got a lot of great advice, and some good criticism. I showed it to Diana and she got a kick out of the comments, and we had a little mutual cry over how kind a lot of you guys were. I asked her if she was okay with me posting this update, and she clucked at me and told me to do whatever I want online as long as I‚Äôm being nice (and anonymous lol). So‚Ä¶ hope this qualifies!","2507","57"
"t3_1j789eo","I think I‚Äôm falling out of love","I‚Äôm so lost. I know relationships are never easy, but I‚Äôm just starting to think that maybe we didn‚Äôt meet at the right time in each other‚Äôs lives. I have so many insecurities in regards to being included in outings. Her communication is really lacking and forgoes telling me how she feels about things.

Our most recent disagreement has been in regards to travel - we can‚Äôt come to a compromise and find a balance between her travelling with her (and also my) friends with time for us to spend together. We promised we‚Äôd travel with each other after this year fell through for similar reasons. Instead, I had to leave it at she will go with her friends instead of me. I‚Äôm hurt because it feels like she doesn‚Äôt want to go away with me, but she‚Äôs hurt because I think that.

She‚Äôs promised to do better and apologised so many times for not communicating. I feel like our bad times are more frequent than the good. I want to push through because she is so loving, caring and sweet but I‚Äôve got a massive piece missing rn and if I explain this to her, she breaks down and stops talking entirely. I‚Äôm stuck. I know I am so far from a bastion of perfection in this relationship, but I just can‚Äôt help but be frustrated and saddened by this.

Today, I was sick and quite feverish, so I spent a while thinking back to a past relationship. While I‚Äôm absolutely over that girl, I just couldn‚Äôt help but reminisce about how that short relationship three years ago made me feel. I do hold it in very high regard because I was in the wilderness prior to it - alone and totally confused about my place in the world before she showed me, so I‚Äôm now quite nostalgic about what she was for me, especially now my needs just aren‚Äôt being met. That girl and I met in the wrong time and the wrong circumstances to last, but we ended very amicably. I know it‚Äôs horrible and so unfair for my gf as well as the previous girl to keep thinking like this.

I love spontaneity and random, intimate things (and I have told her this) but never does she ask me to come over for a karaoke drive at midnight with the windows down. Never does she say she wants to spend the night with me somewhere random. I sometimes ask but it‚Äôs usually a no. I feel like I‚Äôm right back to where I was pre-previous relationship and I‚Äôm lost and so sad.

I want to make things better, and I know constantly comparing my last relationship to my current is really poor. I know I‚Äôm focusing on the negative things she does. I know I could be better but I‚Äôm so fucking demotivated bc she just doesn‚Äôt talk and we just don‚Äôt go out to do things. Then a rift forms and I have to be the one to try and pull it back, and then she‚Äôs extremely upset and scared that I might leave her, or she thinks she‚Äôs a bad person. I can‚Äôt say how I really feel because of that. It takes days for our usual fun side to return and then there‚Äôs a couple weeks of good. Rinse and repeat.

Long-term relationships are loads of battles to stay in love. Some are so much harder, but I do love her. Though, is it worth losing parts of who you are when I‚Äôm this age? I‚Äôm emotionally exhausted by the constant confusion and stress of slow and lacking communication as well as my physical needs just not being met. I‚Äôm 23, so I‚Äôm not looking to waste her or my time any longer if this just won‚Äôt work. I like solving things but this feels like it‚Äôs becoming bigger than me.","2","0"

"t3_1j6c8nk","A man tried to get into my house today. I did everything wrong except lock the door","It was just my almost 2 year old son and me in the house. Dogs were outside and I was at the kitchen table doing my makeup getting ready for work as I was supposed to leave in 2hrs. The doorbell rang and I ignored it for a couple minutes. It's not uncommon for solicitors to try and sell shit. I slowly walked up to my front door peephole and looked out. There was a man standing with his back to the door blocking most of my view and then a second man was out at my curb back also facing my door kinda looking around. I started to get nervous and slowly turned the lock on the front doorknob so he wouldn't hear I was on the other side.

Important to note: my mom's transmission went out last week so she's borrowing my car. No cars in the driveway or in front on the street. But the TV was on playing a kid show for my toddler so he wouldn't miss my presence as much while getting ready.

I watched him for a bit and decided he'd probably leave soon and started walking away. That's when I heard my glass door open. I thought I'd hear him knock next but instead I got to watch as my front door knob started jiggling like someone was trying to get in. And then I froze. Instead of getting my husband's gun to protect myself and my child I did nothing. I just froze. He fiddled with the door knob for a bit and then eventually walked away. I peeped out the kitchen window and watched as this dude met up with his buddy and then they started walking away.

I texted my husband instead of calling the police. He's the one that did. He told me to call them because they wanted to ask me questions, and so I did. Then when I tried to call my phone said I had to connect to a wifi or network to make a call. My bill is paid every month on the 2nd and I was connected to wifi. Just another thing that was going wrong. The police had to call me back and ask if I was ok to even talk to them. When the police did show up they said the guys were solicitors and it's illegal in the city to do that. We even have 2 no soliciting signs taped to the glass door. She said her partner found them up the street and was kicking them out of the neighborhood. Since there was no proof they tried to enter the house nothing could be done. The only thing they could do was drive up to the company and tell them that if they walk onto our property again they will have trespassing charges filed and the company will receive a citation.

At the end of it all I'm extremely shaken. I didn't do anything right except lock the door. I didn't tell them to go away. I didn't call 911. I didn't get a weapon. I just locked the door and then watched as they tried to get in, texted my husband, and then did what I was told. I cried for a long time after. I'm still not doing great. If I hadn't locked that door I really don't know what could've happened. If you've read this far thank you, I just really needed to get this off my chest and out.","498","57"
"t3_1j7cir2","18 M & F. For the past year, I've suffered mentally cause my GF wouldn't initiate intimate contact with me.","This is a bit odd, and by intimate, I mean a bit more than just touching.

For a year, I've felt like I've initiated every kiss, every makeout. We're not sexually active yet, but have been dating for almost 3 years now. And we were fairly physical before, but now the extent of her initiating anything is holding hands or resting her head on my shoulder.

I love even that. Makes me melt. Makes me feel wanted. But then I realize at the end of the day, that I initiated every kiss. We make out once in a couple months when I initiate.

I've asked her about it. Multiple times. Is something bothering her, does she want some support, is this not something she wants in a relationship.

Every time the answer is that she wants it, and that she'll initiate but then it's like she forgets about it. I remember the time she'd hold me, look me in the eyes and kiss me. I remember the times she'd take the slower, non supervised elevator to kiss me in. I remember when she'd ask me to come over when she was alone to make out.

Nothing. For a year, nothing. I don't even ask her anymore, cause at that point it feels like I'm forcing her or making it out to be a major fault. I can't even tell what's wrong. What's changed. Every time I ask her it's a different thing. She's not feeling it, she's lost her sex drive (but then a month later, she said that wasn't the issue), there's shit going on in her family.

And it's fucking killing me inside. I've started to cook up an actual fantasy in my head. Fantasies of being intimate with her someday have turned into a fantasy of a girl in the future who actually physically expresses love for me. I have shit in my life too, and a kiss from her makes all that go away.

I just feel broken at this point. For 3 years almost, I've worked with this girl, and I genuinely love every inch of her, but somehow this issue itches at the inside of my head and makes me miserable. And I've tried talking to her, but it makes no difference. We reach an agreement and she changed things for a day and then she just reverts to the way things used to be.","1","8"

"t3_1j7ce4s","Grieving biking season","For the past 2 years I‚Äôve been smoking weed, almost daily. I recently went through a lot of changes, and in that I quit smoking and started taking supervised urine tests. (Among other things) I knew that taking these tests meant I couldn‚Äôt take my drivers license for at least a few months, and that was okay with me. What I didn‚Äôt know is that it meant I couldn‚Äôt drive at all, until these tests were finished - which is 6 months - even tho I am clean.

My doctor failed to tell me (or I failed to remember) that I can‚Äôt use the license for my motorcycle that i already have.

I recently met a guy who made my passion for driving motorcycles light up again. I was so ready to get back on the bike, bring it out of the garage, change out the oil and have it in pristine condition. I was so excited to spent a summer on two wheels while getting my life back on track - and this time with someone to share the joy with. In some ways it was part of my motivation for staying clean, and having it ripped away in the span of a few google searches made it that much harder.

I feel so angry, and stupid. I feel like I should have known, and I feel like it was obvious. Yet I thought in some magical way that I could keep my excisting licence, just not take another drivers test. I was so ready for the freedom of driving to work, and going on road trips. Or just driving to the store without relying on commute or friends, or having to walk for 15 minutes.

I know it really isn‚Äôt the end of the world, but the next 5 months is gonna be that much more challenging knowing I could have been on a bike if I hadn‚Äôt admitted to my doctor that I smoked weed. Im gonna call the doctors office tomorrow to see if I‚Äôm correct in thinking I can‚Äôt drive my motorcycle, but I‚Äôm scared of getting my hopes up. I‚Äôd rather sit with knowing I‚Äôll get told I can‚Äôt drive than be let down again tomorrow.

But on the other side of things, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have quit if it wasn‚Äôt for having to do this at some point either way.

It just sucks that I‚Äôll be done with these tests in September, at the very end of the season.","1","0"

I started dating this guy six months ago‚Äîhe is the most wonderful and attentive boyfriend ever. Our relationship is going strong, but that‚Äôs not the point.

For some context, I‚Äôve been very sheltered throughout my life, which has made me extremely introverted and anxious. I just started college, and I have no friends from school because, about two years ago, my mother decided I should be homeschooled and demanded that I cut off contact with my friends.

When I got into college, I ended up in a group of friends who were super shallow. Being around them gave me terrible face dysmorphia and a spending habit from mirroring them. From the outside, it looked like they had loads of fun together, but I was with them for four months, and it was terrible.

I had a friend in class, but we drifted apart because she became best friends with this one girl who was no better than Regina George. We still talk amicably, but not often.

I‚Äôm friendly with my roommates, but there‚Äôs a language barrier since they share a common mother tongue, so there‚Äôs not much connection there.

I was best friends with one girl, but she would get mad at every little thing. On top of that, she would spread other people‚Äôs secrets to unrelated parties, which was a huge turnoff. We had a final confrontation, and that friendship burned out.

I‚Äôm friends with two other girls, and as nice as they are, they‚Äôre closer to each other. Honestly, they‚Äôre a lot like me, but I‚Äôm so self-conscious around them that I don‚Äôt feel like myself. They‚Äôre super open, and the hesitant vibe I bring to the table just doesn‚Äôt fit well with them.

The only real support I have is my boyfriend. I have online friends and people I talk to occasionally, but no actual close friends. He isn‚Äôt isolating me‚Äîhe actually encourages me to talk to people‚Äîbut I just can‚Äôt. I know I need to put myself out there, stop caring about embarrassing myself, yada yada, but it‚Äôs way harder than it seems. I feel out of place.

I just feel so lonely. I have no one to attend events with, no one to meet up with in the evenings. I pretend it‚Äôs by choice, but honestly, I‚Äôm just fucking lonely.

"t3_1j7bjzh","My life ended when I was 21.","It ended two years ago when I had a traumatic experience after a party. Since then, I‚Äôve had health issues and mental issues. I used to get panic attacks every night and I lived completely alone abroad with no support system and no one to check on me. I went back home, and the psychiatrists made me take 3 different antidepressants which messed up my brain.

Everyday feels like survival mode to me. I used to be such a social person, now I get anxious of social situations and avoid it. I used to love going out, but now I get scared of being outside. Every small task feels scary to me. My intrusive thoughts are also still there despite me quitting drugs a year ago. I have no hope anymore.

And on top of that, I met someone I loved during this shitty year of my life. We ended things because he just couldn‚Äôt deal with so much from me anymore. I feel so guilty every single day for not being able to show him the version of who I used to be before drugs and experiences messing me up.

I‚Äôm 23 now. It‚Äôs been 2 years. I moved back home for a bit, even though I hate it here.

The past month I‚Äôve been feeling very down and thinking of sometimes ending it, even though I would not act on it. I just feel like I can never become the person I wanted to be again. I keep trying to think there is light at the end of the tunnel, but it never comes.","0","0"
"t3_1j7bepy","Advice for res or even inpatient","Ok so this is advice for how to survive these places. They are helpful, but in a weird way, but it sucks, and it‚Äôs traumatizing. But it‚Äôs very isolated and weirdly desensitized, so in there you aren‚Äôt effecting anyone you have personal attachments to. So first official tip, just make it to your release date, and you will be just fine.

Next, a lot of people coming in to these places may have drug issues, or self harm. When I was in the ones I went to, I was too. And I was put in a terrible place with people on stimulants and benzos; along with a very odd amount of persistence and survival ‚Äúmethods‚Äù You will likely turn to snorting cheeked meds, drinking hand sanitizer and god knows what else. So go in with at least a little safety net. bring yourself alcohol wipes, an extra sock, and then a condom, if you are afab and haven‚Äôt had any surgeries or anything like that then this can work for ‚Äútransportation‚Äù but the condom has other uses too. Not for sex.

Please don‚Äôt have sex oh my god. Just jerk off or something, everyone there is fighting literal demons. You do not want to end up in bed with them, I know that sounds stupid, but two people going through a mental health mess will have a very weird and toxic dynamic.

I should also say that people are going to be judgmental. They are judging themselves so they are also projecting it. So I just don‚Äôt think you should form attachments or like preconceptions. You should talk to them though, it will really help to hear about someone‚Äôs life the closest you ever can. It makes you feel less alone.

so we have been talking for about two months now. and while at first everything was consistent, it stopped being so after a couple of weeks. he was telling me at first that he loved my time and my company and then, suddenly, for a few days, he barely texted me. but when i pulled back, started texting less, he came back again? i figured he was just busy.

a few days later, after we became consistent again, he ghosted me on a date. but he was sick. so i forgave him. after this, he picked up with the relationship talk again, started calling me names (babe, sweetheart, etc.) and talking about loving my company again. it was sweet, and made me feel better about what happened. but after a couple weeks of this, it was back to distance again. and once again, when i reciprocated, he came back again.

he was then back through valentine's day and following. and then a couple days ago he started texting less again. this time he isn't distant per se, he's still using the sweet talk...just barely talking to me.

i really like him. he says he likes me. when we do hang and talk, it's a great time. but i'm confused and the times he's distant hurt me. so i'm gonna talk to him and if he doesn't come around this time, im gonna block him. i guess. :(","0","3"
"t3_1j7b4sy","I spent years in love with my grandma","Three years ago, I met a girl online, and we hit it off instantly. We texted every single day, flirted shamelessly, and honestly? It was one of the best connections I've ever had. We never did video calls though, so neither of us knew what the other looked like. We're both introverts, so it never crossed our minds to FaceTime (weird, I know, but that's introvert life for you). Despite that, we developed a crush on each other, but we decided to remain flirty friends who sometimes roleplay sexy things because we're both not relationship people and and long-distance relationships are a hard pass for us. So we just kept texting and gaming together.

Since I didn't know how she looks like, my brain started creating an idealized version of her and I imagined her like this alluring, confident, intense and mysterious femme fatale.

One day this girl disappeared without saying anything. Poof, gone, she deactivated all her gaming socials. She was always quite depressive so my mind started to jump to the worst conclusions, I was very worried. And I endlessly tried looking for her everywhere, but I only knew her name and country so I got nowhere.

I eventually gave up looking for her but she always remained haunting me in the back of my mind  because of the way she had disappeared and the fact that I didn't know what happened to her. So I kept thinking about her throughout the 2 remaining years, replaying our last conversations to look for cues, and all of that led me to dead ends. It was frustrating. And it was like a mystery that I needed to solve. Alexa play ""oh whooo is sheee?""

So one day, I decided that enough is enough. I was going to find her and I was going to get my answers even if I have to become the FBI myself. I believe in manifestation and law of attraction so I spent a whole night visualizing me finding her personal socials (the socials we had each other added were not personal socials, it was gaming socials, so I wanted to find either her Instagram or Facebook).

And it worked! Next day, I went full FBI detective mode. I said the only information I had about her was her name and country, so I used those leads and somehow I managed to stumble upon her real full name! (I think this was the manifestation and law of attraction at play or some kind of witchcraft I dunno). It turned out that the name she had given me was a fake one but that's understandable so I don't hold it against her. Whatever. With her real name in hand, I found out where she went to school, where she went to college, and of course her personal socials.

So I opened up her Facebook and Instagram, filled with anticipation because finally I would be able to put a face to the ghost who'd haunted me for 2 whole years! And when I laid my eyes on her, there she was... THE SHEER REFLECTION OF MY GRANDMA WHEN YOUNG!

No, really. Like not kind of, not a little resemblance, I mean copy-paste, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, a perfect genetic duplicate of my grandma in her youth. ...I had spent years chasing this mystery woman, only for my brain to go, ""Wait a minute‚Ä¶ is that‚Ä¶ grandma?""

I WAS FUCKING IN LOVE WITH MY GRANDMA! FOR YEARS! Years of mystery, longing, idealization GONE IN A SECOND. My attraction to her? Instantly killed. Biggest turn off of my life. All the sexy things she had ever told me were no longer sexy and I just couldn't picture us physically together anymore...

We used to roleplay fear play scenarios AND NOW THE FEAR PLAY TURNED INTO FEAR FOR A DIFFERENT REASON. Like, instead of ""I'm going to hunt you down and devour you"" being hot, now it‚Äôs giving ""Eat your vegetables, sweetheart"" and I'm just sitting there like NOOOOOO, THE MAGIC IS GONE.

This is the kind of thing that would send Freud into overdrive. ""Tell me, how does this make you feel?"" LIKE SCREAMING, FREUD. IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE SCREAMING. My brain had built up this intense, mysterious, alluring figure, and then boom! grandma vibes! And I ended up in some kind of weird family reunion, yay!

This is for real one of the biggest plot twists of my life. I basically turned 3 years of longing into a detective saga with a twist ending, and instead of crying, I'm laughing about it. At this point I'm just happy because I can finally close this chapter but at the same time I feel shallow for losing attraction towards her immediately after seeing her. Oh well, not everyone can be attracted to their grandma.","1","1"
