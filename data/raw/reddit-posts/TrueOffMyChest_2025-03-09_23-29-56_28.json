I didn't talk to him much after that, only at his fathers funeral, and my dads 70th birthday, trying to act normal. No one knows what he did 15 years ago, well I guess my dad knows now.\n\nMy dad called me on friday, letting me know he's not well and my parents and brother will visit him today,  one last time. Asking me if I wanted to join them, I said let me think about it. Yesterday I told my dad no, I will not be there because cousin did something I can't forgive. My dad's the best, I saw his face change but he didn't ask or press for info. He said he understood.\n\nIt did rip open an old wound. Honestly the guy's been dead to me for so long. I buried what happened in the back of my mind. Kind of blamed myself for being dumb enough to get so drunk and trusting someone to not take advantage. Now I realize this wasn't my fault. Today he will figure out I do not forgive him and never will. He will rot in the ground and I will spit on his grave.",

    "title": "I wouldn’t marry my husband of 17 years if given a do-over.",
    "content": "Four years ago, I felt like I had achieved all goals, happiness, and was married to my best friend. For context, I (35f) and my husband (38m) have been married for 17 years. I met him as a teenager, we dated, and married promptly after my 18th birthday. I felt like we had really worked through a lot of issues to build a good marriage and life together. I don’t have a strong support system of people in my life, so it was just him and me against the world. Well, that changed, and I’ve been beating myself up about it for a while, and trying to navigate my feelings, or just ignoring them, idk. I started to have feelings for a co-worker (I know, typical). He has been a friend at work, and is married. There has been nothing romantic between us, and I don’t get any indication from him that he is interested in more. He has just been supportive as my co-worker and a friend, and that friendship doesn’t extend outside of work at all. I have no interest in pursuing a romantic relationship with him either. I don’t want to have infidelity in my marriage or try to convince someone else to be untrue. And breaking marriages for another person just means a worse marriage.\n\nThis has really led me to contemplate my life. Why, when everything was feeling so right, did I start catching feelings for someone else. I looked back at our relationship and started seeing all the negative. I questioned if I was just looking for reasons to justify how I felt. I came to the realization that our dating relationship was abusive (and early years of our marriage). More than just bad, or two stupid kids. He was very controlling, pushed sex on me before I was ready, and even used a sexual act two different times as “punishment” (that was painful). Anytime I’m alone with my thoughts, I think that so much of how I am today in my relationship with him was shaped by the bad times. He isn’t that person any more, he isn’t controlling, and treats me better overall. But, I don’t have friends, am scared to make him mad, scared to talk about my feelings, am super agreeable to avoid any conflicts. He has been explosive and mean in the past when he gets angry, although that hasn’t been too recently. (Nothing ever physical.) I still feel like a terrible person for thinking about another guy, and feel some blame for wallowing in the past. I think if I would do it all over, and there’s no way I would stay in the relationship if given a do over. If I had a daughter, I would teach her how to avoid this and reach out for help.\n\nI feel like my eyes have been opened to the truth of our past. I tried to bring it up with him by asking what he thought about our dating relationship. He said he doesn’t really think about it, and I said that I thought it was bad. I brought up some things, and he didn’t want to talk about it. He said he had apologized and I just hadn’t forgiven him for it. He got mad, and I got upset and cried. I remember him giving an apology several years ago, we both got drunk and he said he felt bad about things and I consoled him, but I’m just now realizing it was abusive. I wanted to get confirmation from him that he agreed it wasn’t a healthy relationship, just for healing. But there was nothing productive about it.\n\nI find myself lately being depressed and bottled up. I work full time and my husband hasn’t had a job for a few years now. I really don’t care if he works, but want him to contribute to our relationship in some way. Instead he spends a lot of time sitting around the house on his phone making a mess and spending excessive amounts of time on hobbies. And no, I don’t think there is any chance he is cheating. I think he is also depressed. My guilt and frustration are overwhelming. I love him and he loves me, but I’m spending too much time in my head not dealing with my feelings, just hoping things find their place and go back, even though I know that’s not likely. I know I could use counseling to work on past trauma and learn to be a better partner myself. So maybe I’ll finally do that.",

    "title": "I touched my dad in his sleep as a child",
    "content": "When I was around 12 I touched my dad in his sleep. It happened like two more times until one time he woke up and I just pretended to sleep. So I knew what I was doing is wrong. For a little bit of background although I don’t want to justify anything my dad is a huge narcissist asshole. Abusive towards my mom and sister he hit them and they were more than often afraid for their lives. He also sexually assaulted my mother when she denied him sex and she was always very tired the next day. He watched openly pornographic content on the tv in the living room. While me and my sister as children were seeing this and when my mother confronted him I still remember him saying that he has to get his arousal somewhere. Also I vaguely remember while till I was 12 I came in the night in my parents bedroom to sleep there when I got scared and almost always he made sexual advances towards my mother and i interrupted him to sleep in between them. I also remember i kept going to sleep with them even when i was 12 and no longer scared to sleep alone just to protect my mother since my dad didn’t let her sleep in peace and continued sexually assaulting here. So I strongly feel all this played a part why i suddenly touched my dad in his sleep. I don’t know but something psychologically happened as a result but to this day i still feel bad about it and disgusted with my self and have a hard time understanding my own sex drive since i only associate it with bad things. I also don’t want to talk about it with my sister or mom since they are both already traumatized enough I don’t want burden them with another thing. So I don’t know maybe some of you guys could help me process this or give some advice. Thanks\n\nEdit: Thanks guys your comments helped me a bit. I‘m starting therapy in two weeks because I noticed my thoughts became too much to bear for myself. My sister is a bit older than me and around my age she started to attempt and it was up to me to stop her but I don’t want the same for me. But I wasn’t sure I could ever bring this topic up in therapy out of fear of judgement from the therapist since I am so disgusted with myself i only found it logical to expect the same from others.",

    "title": "*FINAL UPDATE* I 21F found out my husband 33M has been having an affair with my mother, and I don’t know where to go from here?",
    "content": "Hey so this will be my final update on everything as I believe the situation has finally come to an end and I’m in a really good place.\n\nI left off where I was in a shelter and had made a lot of friends. Well the girl who I was gonna move somewhere with she ended up going back to her Mom and step Dad, and so I was back to being stuck on what to do. That was until I got a message from my grandma that her mom (my great-grandma) needs someone to care for her, she said that her brother would be happy to have me stay with him as long as I care for my great grandma. I decided I have nothing left to lose and decided this would be a good gig till I find out what I wanna do. I arrived in Miami 3 days ago and have been enjoying it greatly so far. I never really knew my dad’s side as he wasn’t that close with his family and after he passed it was hard to keep contact. My great-uncle is very nice and very accommodating and his wife is really nice, they live in quite a nice part of Miami as well near the beach.\n\nI haven’t seen my great-grandma in over 10 years and she was so happy when she saw me. She can’t speak that much English as she only really speaks Spanish. I’m aware I said my dad was white, but that’s was only because I was scared of my identity being revealed and that wasn’t a 100% lie. My father was Cuban and was born and raised in Miami, however, he was most likely a descendant of Spaniards. Anyways, my great grandma has been teaching me Spanish and as well through the help of translating of my great uncle stories about my dad. She told me that he would fall asleep on her lap at family gatherings and how he would make the whole family laugh imitating her accent. It made me tear up seeing all the photos of him as a kid with his whole family. She told me that when he got on drugs and ran away from home, it left everyone in complete distraught. She claimed my grandma would cry everyday.\n\nMy Mom never had a relationship with them, and that was her choice they wanted to meet her actually. They told me that they weren’t shocked what happened to me as my Dad told them later on my mom would cheat on him all the time with other men. This made me furious as my mom always claimed my dad was her “soulmate.”\n\nI have not heard anything from my mom, however, my cousins wedding went ahead yesterday as my aunty posted it on Facebook. My mom was there and she seemed completely fine from the photos. The wedding looked boring anyways, my cousin is marrying his first cousin from Pakistan (in-laws side) and no one is smiling. It made me laugh actually seeing my mom with all these people who are deeply religious and conservative. Seeing my mom next to my grandma and other female relatives who wear scarfs and are deeply religious, compared to my mom who sleeps with anyone that gives her an ounce of attention really cracks me up.\n\nAlso no word from my EX-husband, however, his sister sent me a text apologising on behalf of her and his parents.\n\nSo yeah that’s the end I believe I’m taking care of my great-grandma and will work out what I wanna do in the mean time. This will most likely (hopefully) be the final update as I believe I’m in a really good place.",

    "title": "My (F23) friends think my boyfriend is a predator and want me to break up with him",
    "content": "I (F23) grew up as one of the oldest in my family, so I practically raised my younger siblings. I never really had a childhood I was always the responsible one, making decisions and taking care of everything. I’ve always been independent, maybe even a little on the masculine side. My parents were either working or not really present, so I took on the role of babysitter and homemaker. Between school, work, and looking after my siblings, I never had time to just enjoy life. No boyfriends, no social life just responsibility.\n\nNow that my siblings are older and independent, I finally moved out to focus on myself. That’s when I decided to try Hinge, and I matched with this guy (M32). We hit it off right away and have been dating for almost eight months now. He’s handsome, intelligent, kind, nurturing, and, for the first time in my life, I feel like I have someone I can truly depend on. It’s a feeling I never knew I needed.\n\nBut over the past three months, I’ve noticed some changes. He started calling me his good little girl at first, it caught me off guard. I even cringed a little. But at the same time, I felt this weird, unexpected warmth from it. Like a part of me liked it, even though I didn’t understand why.\n\nHe also started buying me cute, feminine dresses and pretty heels things I would never have picked for myself. I was hesitant at first, but when I tried them on, I actually felt beautiful. Feminine. I was shocked by how much I loved it.\n\nThen there are things like he packs me lunch on his days off and drops it off before I go to work, even though I usually just eat at the cafeteria. No one has ever made me lunch before, and it makes me feel so cared for in a way I didn’t realize I was missing.\n\nHe even brushes my hair. I have really long hair, and he’ll braid it for me sometimes. I thought I would hate it, but now I love it. I crave it. There’s this part of me that never got to experience these kinds of gentle, affectionate moments, and I feel like I’m healing in ways I can’t even explain.\n\nHe pats my head, gives me so much affection, and honestly, I feel like I’m going to explode from happiness.  He’s so patient and gentle with me.\n\nEven our sex life has changed it’s filled with love and praise. I never knew how much I would love being praised. It makes me feel so happy, like I just want to be my best for him.  I do whatever I can to make him happy.\n\nI know this all sounds a little strange. In a way, he feels like a father figure, but obviously not in a weird way. I don’t see him as my dad or anything like that, but I don’t know how else to explain it. I never thought I’d have a daddy (if that makes sense).\n\nI told my two close friends about us and they said how it’s creepy and wrong and I should break up with him before it’s too late, calling him a predator. Also I am too inexperienced to know better.  They said how they don’t know me anymore because I changed a lot.\n\nYes I I have changed, I dress more feminine and I feel pretty.  I’ve always been the yes girl in our friendship but  lately I’ve been creating boundaries and more vocal about what I want sometimes and apparently it’s creating friction in our group. And due to that I’m now self centred they are icing me out unless I listen to them.\n\nThis is the happiest I’ve been in my life and I’m sad they can’t see that. I don’t know what to do.\n\nEdit: I am financially stable with out without him.\n\nTL;DR I’m dating an older guy and my friends think he’s a predator because of our age gap and how he treats me. Now they want me me to break up with him.",

    "title": "I was in an aya cult. I told his wife and she didnt believe me.",
    "content": "After returning home from an ayahuasca ceremony, I got a message from a friend of mine whom I considered a \"spiritual brother\". He wanted to meet up. I was still in that post-ceremony glow—full of energy despite the late hour—and I wanted to socialize.\n\nI live down a long dirt trail, a 15-minute walk from the nearest road. When I got there, he was waiting in his SUV. I was excited to talk with him. Right away, he offered me some hard liquor, saying, “This is what the indigenous people drink here! It’s very good for you.” But I had just returned from drinking ayahuasca, and he knew that. He wasn’t speaking clearly, but he started telling me stories about indigenous cosmology, which fascinated me—until the conversation took a turn.\n\nHe began talking about how husbands take other women and how normal it is. Then he told me he needed someone “spiritually on his level” so they could have a deeper connection than with their actual partners.\n\nI told him flat out I wasn’t interested. But I kept asking questions. Does your wife know about these ‘practices’ you do?\n\n“No, no,” he said, “but it’s better for her. Better for me too. And for our children.”\n\nHe started going on about how we don’t marry the people we are equal to—we marry the ones who are good for having kids. That real spiritual connection is with extramarital lovers. He kept inflating my ego, using spiritual talk to manipulate me. I asked if he had done this before.\n\n“I’ve done it many times,” he admitted. “With many different women.”\n\nThen he put his hand on my leg. I told him I was leaving. But I made the mistake of trying to stay friendly.\n\n“Let me just show you one thing before you go,” he said.\n\nHe stopped me behind the car and hugged me. That’s when I froze. Trauma hit me like a wave. This wasn’t the first time something like this had happened to me, and suddenly, I was simultaneously trapped in his arms and in my past.\n\nHe pulled me tightly against him, ran his hand down my back, onto my hindquarters. At the same time, he started kissing me—lightly, from my ear down to my collarbone. My stomach churned with nausea. I squirmed to get away. He let go. I was in full trauma response, barely able to hold back tears. Then he begged me not to tell his wife. I barely managed a goodbye before I ran back up the hill to my house, praying he wasn’t following me.\n\nA few days later, I saw his wife. Despite my own pain, I felt it was my duty to tell her the truth about her husband. Never mind my trauma—this was her husband. She deserved to know.\n\nAt first, she seemed to believe me. But later that day, I got a message from her. She repeated all his lies. He told her I subconsciously wanted to be with him. That based on our messages, I must have known it was going to be romantic.\n\nBut that couldn’t be further from the truth!!\n\nI was completely blindsided. Now, looking back, I understand things I didn’t back then. At the time, I was in a cult. I believed that everyone in it was a good person, incapable of this kind of thing. If it were me now, I’d know better. I’d understand that if a married man asks a woman to meet him at 2 AM, he’s not looking to talk about life. Full stop.\n\nToday, I saw both of them.\n\nSeeing him again brought everything back- how he lied, how he got away with it, how his wife believed him over me. The anger and pain hit me like a tidal wave. I wanted to punch his stupid mouth, to do something, to make him face the truth of what he did. I even had a thought of role-playing the situation in front of his wife-forcing her to see it so she would understand. But I know deep down, no matter what I do, she probably won't believe me. He has her wrapped in lies. And I'm the one left carrying all of this. I've been crying all day. I feel so much anger, hurt, and grief. I don't know how to process this.",

    "content": "My husband wanted a dog, and I had never had one before. I’ve had plenty of pets in the past: cats, rabbits, and fish, and I loved each one of them deeply. So, we decided to get a dog.\n\nHe did the work of finding the exact dog he wanted, and we drove three hours to adopt her. Even though he took on most of the feeding, exercising, playing, and training, she bonded to me. The bond feels like an obsession. When I’m around, my husband doesn’t exist to her. She never wants to be more than three feet away from me, and often, she’s touching me.\n\nWhen I need a break, I go into the bedroom and shut the door. She just sits outside, waiting. I can put her in the office with my fiancé on the other side of the house, and then go to the bedroom and shut the door. But she waits at the office door, whining and whimpering. My husband tries to interact with her, but she doesn’t care. She just wants me. And I can’t handle this level of attention. You can take her outside, but if she knows I’m inside, she won’t leave the door. If I leave, she panics. A few minutes later, she calms down and does her own thing. She never bothers my husband this much.\n\nI’ve heard mothers talk about feeling “touched out” with toddlers, and that’s exactly how I feel with my dog. The difference is, I don’t think she’ll ever grow past this stage. She’s a dog. We’ve worked with trainers to help her become more independent, but it doesn’t seem to work.\n\nI’m thankful that there’s more nuance in the “adopt, don’t shop” movement. Sometimes, it might actually be better to get a dog from an ethical breeder, as shelter dogs can come with their own set of challenges. My dog has trauma, and that trauma will stay with her for life. It shows up in our relationship, where we’re in a sort of quasi-codependence. It’s frustrating because she’s fine when I’m not around. My husband can take her places, and she’s as happy as can be. If I’m not home, she’s completely relaxed. It’s only when I’m around that she becomes obsessed with me. I don’t get to experience the playful, silly dog everyone else sees because, in my presence, she’s consumed with me.\n\nMy husband takes her to his brother’s farm, and he sends me videos of her. It breaks my heart because I want to see that happy, playful dog too. I want a dog I can sit outside with, playing with toys and rolling in the dirt, without her needing to touch my leg at all times. But I never get that dog. I love her so much, but her constant affection drowns me.\n\nI look forward to when she goes to the farm because I get to be home without her on top of me. I don’t love my job, but I dread going home because, at least at work, I get some alone time.\n\nI love my dog, but I don’t like being around her.",

It’s very fascinating to witness, and simultaneously upsetting because I can’t help but compare it to my own situation.\n\nMy parents have never been the affectionate, loving type but I didn’t realize just how little they cared for me until I moved out of the family home before marriage. Coming from a very conservative Muslim culture this is looked down on, because people assume you are living away from your family as a single woman to do haram (forbidden) activities in the religion. However I just wanted to have my own space and be independent, that’s all. My parents did not take it well, my mother told me I was selfish and deserve everything bad in life for abandoning them.\n\nThis was over a year ago and the relationship is still quite strained. I’ve called a few times since and my mother was super rude and irritated like I was bothering her for calling her. So I stopped, and I haven’t spoken to my family in a few months. I’m not sure how you can claim to love your child and practically disown them for wanting to live their own lives. So I know now I am not loved by them.\n\nIt’s really sad to not receive unconditional love from your parents because you will never get unconditional love anywhere else. Not from friends, not even from your spouse. You will forever feel unloved and worthless. Most relationships are fickle and very conditional. You family is meant to be your rock. But I have none.\n\nSometimes I wonder why I am even in this world.",

    "content": "My boyfriend’s phone broke about a week and a half ago, so we’ve barely been able to talk, and it’s been tough on both of us. A few days ago, I came up with an idea to make things a little easier for him when he finally gets his phone back.\n\nEvery day, I’ve been sending him a message on WhatsApp, telling him about my day—what happened, how I felt, how much I miss him, and anything else that comes to mind. Along with each message, I send a selfie so he can see what I looked like at that moment.\n\nIt’s not the most elaborate surprise, but I think he’ll be really happy when he finally gets his phone back and sees everything. Right now, we can only talk through PlayStation groups, and we can’t even see each other, so I hope this makes him feel a little closer to me.\n\nA part of me is so excited to see his reaction, but another part of me keeps wanting to add more days before he gets his phone back. Either way, I just can’t wait to see and hear him again. Whether he’s tired, pouting, excited, or just being himself, he’s always so cute, and I miss him so much.",

    "content": "I've only told maybe 2 people for my entire life about this, but it's been weighing on me recently. I feel like I need to just shout to the void about it.\n\nI(28M) befriended one of my teachers when I was 14. At the time, he was 35. For more background, I was F at the time (now FtM). He was my middle school teacher and when I switched schools, I added him on Facebook. It wasn't until around my freshman year of high school that we really started to talk.\n\nAt first, I basically harassed him, sending him messages daily, until he started to reply and it became conversational. After about a year, we began messaging each other daily. It was never anything inappropriate; we mainly talked about games, music, art, daily life, etc. (normal friendly type conversation). We never hung out or met up or anything. The only time I saw him after he was my teacher was one time at a school event.\n\nI lived in an abusive home and was a very lonely kid. I always figured he sensed that and that I just needed/wanted someone to talk to who actually cared. He became what I still consider to be my best friend at the time. I eventually started to have feelings for him because of this. I still remember telling him how I felt, and him saying something along the lines of \"I'm very flattered, but that's not appropriate\". The conversation dwindled a bit after that, but some time passed and we picked back up our daily conversations.\n\nOne morning, I woke up to see my father on my computer, snooping through my messages with this former teacher. I freaked out and told him this. We ended up exchanging numbers and started texting because of this.\n\nA while went by (a few months, if I remember right), we continued our friendship and daily conversations. Something happened and my parents took my phone (I can't exactly remember why they took it). I went to lunch with a friend one day, and when I got home, both of my parents were there and I knew something was wrong (they divorced and hated each other). They confronted me about my teacher and I's friendship, saying they \"[knew] everything\". My father had texted him through my phone, telling him to cease contact and threatening to report him to the school board if he ever tried talking to me again. I was heartbroken hearing this and knowing I'd never speak to him again. My parents claim he was \"grooming\" me, but I never felt that way. He felt more like a dad or an uncle, and treated me almost as his kid. Plus, as mentioned before, I basically harassed this man into talking to me. I always got the feeling he just kind of felt bad for me, especially looking back on our conversations and this situation as an adult.\n\nI never spoke with him again after that. It was somewhat of a traumatic experience for me, but only because someone I really cared about just suddenly vanished from my life and I felt as though I had nearly ruined his life because I was a lonely kid. The loss I experienced changed me as a person and the way I view all relationships.\n\nI still think of him often. I want to reach out and ask him how he is, and tell him how sorry I am for putting him in such a bad situation. It's just been so long and I don't want to dredge up the past, especially when I'm sure it was also traumatic for him.\n\nI don't know how to move on when it ended so abruptly and so badly. I have dreams of running into him on the street and getting my opportunity to tell him I'm sorry and hear how he dealt with things afterward.",

I just lay there and took it.\n\nAfter about 5-10 minutes, I decided to \"fake waking up\" very slowly so he would stop. And he did.\n\nI felt disgusting. I wanted to tell my mom, but he's her favorite, and I was terrified she wouldn't believe me. So, I kept quiet and hoped it would never happen again.\n\ni decided not to and hopped he'd stop.

I woke up to someone touching me again Today. So, 40 something minutes ago, i woke up to him touching me again. And just like before, I did nothing.\n\nI wanted to move, to scream, to do something. But my body wouldn’t listen. It was like my brain had shut down, leaving me frozen in place. so I just lay there, pretending to sleep, trying not to make a sound. and he eventually stopped.\n\nWhen he finally rolled over and pretended to sleep, I slowly turned away, pulling my blanket tighter around me. I wanted to cry, but the tears wouldn’t come. I just stared at the wall and stayed there for about 20mins and got up to write this. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know how to make it stop. I just wish I could disappear.\n\nPLEASE give me advice on what to do. im literally crying rn because i couldn't defend myself. I just feel so icky about this",

    "content": "Throwaway account because I don’t want anyone I know to see this. This is something I’ve only ever told one person and I feel deeply uncomfortable to even tell a therapist.\n\nFor context: I have never been a victim of sexual abuse physically, was raised in a super healthy home life, etc. Nothing traumatic has ever happened to me due to another person I personally knew.\n\nWhen I was younger, I purposely would go on a site called KidzChat. I knew that predators would be on that site, and would advertise myself as someone to talk to “F 12”. I was around the ages of 10-14 doing this. Older men would then message me super sexually explicit things. We would sext for a while and eventually trade Skypes to talk or videochat. The biggest instance that I remember was skyping an older man who wanted to show me his jumping jacks. He would jump for a while and then his pants would conveniently fall off.  For some reason that moment is engrained in my mind. I know I’m a victim fully, but I feel weird because I went out looking for it? I guess that’s the cost of unlimited Internet access.\n\nAnother entirely separate thing that bothers me severely, is that one day (aged 11) I had my family dog perform oral on me. The dog didn’t need any coaxing, it liked the smell and went up to it. I remember it feeling awful and I felt so intensely guilty afterward. I never did it again, but I realize that this has deeply affected me as an adult. I absolutely cannot receive oral from a man because it reminds me of what I did with my family dog. This fact genuinely haunts me as I know it was completely wrong and animal.\n\nI don’t even know how to cope with both of these facts as I was a victim and perpetrator. These things still affect me in my sexual life now manifesting as intense fear and guilt to commit certain normal sexual acts with people like being eaten out, sexting my boyfriend, etc. I know I don’t have the guts to tell a therapist either.",

They were abusing my wife for some dumb shit i posted to deal with my anger.  So I told them all the truth.  About how bullshit it was that we were constantly being gaslit into thinking they accept my son for who they are, but even after 7 years they still can't use their preferred name.\n\nOf course, that self righteous anger rarely feels good the next day.  Sure I felt vindicated, but my wife is devastated.  Her family has abused her, her entire life, but to her, they are still family.  I can't stand them, because they are those reformed drug addicts that now think they are better than everyone else.  But she loves them, and she is devastated.\n\nAs much as i can't stand her family, I really regret telling them how I actually thought of them over this issue with my son.

    "content": "I worked for Child Protective Services in a metropolitan area of the US for 12 years. I did both long term case management and later investigations that led to the removals of children. With about a decade of time and reflection, I’ve come to realize the following:\n\nI was a young woman with lots of privilege who did not understand the lives or needs of the people over whose lives I made decisions for.  This now causes me great pain.\n\nTurns out I was dissociating through most of it due to secondary trauma and moral injury. The ability to dissociate (although we just saw it as toughing through back then) was seen as showing that you were a great worker and could “get shit done”.\n\nI wanted to do good in the world and I wanted to help children. And I did. But I also caused harm because I had too many cases, not enough supervision and no real self-awareness.\n\nIt took years of therapy to understand and grieve the harm I had caused and the harm caused to me. I don’t even remember the first few years of my children’s lives because I was so dissociated. I often have to look at a photos to remember events with them.\n\nI still get flashbacks of things I was exposed to and am swapped with pain.\n\nSometimes it all comes back. Just this week, I was contacted by a former colleague and a child who was on my caseload many years ago.\n\nThe colleague reminded me of a child death case we worked on. It was particularly searing because we both had children that were about the same age as the child who died.\n\nShe also reminded me about the death of another colleague (through an aneurism) and the suicide of a couple others. Yes, our work had a death count.\n\nThe girl, now an adult, reached out to me to say she is doing well and to thank me for helping her find an adoptive home.\n\nIt’s a mixed bag. And these memories reinforce in me the idea that nothing in life is guaranteed and I’m just trying to do the best I can each day. I screw up and I repair where I can. I put kindness and compassion into everything I do, but that isn’t always enough.\n\nI don’t really have a purpose for this post. Just wanted to get it off my chest.",

    "content": "I(F28) and my former friend G( F30) meet during our first term in university, we both came from the same area and went to the same school at one point. We clicked and became really good friends from there. I was an insecure 19 year old at that time and she was outgoing and active in our version of sorority. I was invited to outings that I actually enjoyed and began to build up some confidence. We both had our share of mental problems understood each other, but after taking diffrent courses we stopped meeting as regularly but she always said that I was one of her closest friends.\n\nIn 2020, I became sick. Really heavy burnout, Crohn dieses and bulimia that made me unable to stay in town. I moved back home and slowly began to rebuild my life and health. Now in 2025, I am still sick, but way better and have control of my mental problems. During the last five years I wrote to G every time I went to the university city, asking to meet up and if I could, I set the dates of my travel after her schedule to make sure we could meet(it’s a 5h drive). Every time she said she would love to, and if she was available we booked a date and time. But almost always something happened or she double booked that she remembered 1 day to 1h before. During these five years, we have meet up twice and I have probably asked her around 10 times since I usually go twice a year.  She never wrote to me when she visited her parents or asked me when I was going down next time, which I realise now was a clear sign that I ignored. I once wrote and asked her if she didn’t want to meet up, it was okey and I would understand, time changes people and friendship does not always last. She denied it and said she very much wanted to meet up and I accepted the answer. Telling me how horrible of a friend she is and how sorry she is.\n\nTwo years ago I had a major breakdown when G cancelled on me again. I had been so excited and when she cancelled I was heartbroken. Walking is my coping strategy, especially with heavy emotions, even after 10km I did not stop crying. I was living with another friend  for that weekend and I fully broke down in the end and told her everything. They had never suspected anything cause I always spoke so well off her. She  apparently told my other friends who all are mad on my behalf.\n\nG sent me a snap in May 2024, with the caption ”In exactly one year we are getting married” with a picture on her fiancé. I congratulated her, but I had no idea about their engagement before that. I decided to one last try and asked her of a time during the summer we could meet up, with my vacation weeks in mind. She responded and we decided a week  were she was free, for details to be determined later. As it approached I wrote 1 week before and told her the days, no response. When I finally was at the hotell I wrote again and told her how long I was there and times when I was booked. My friends were a bit angry at me for trying again but I said that this will be the last time.\n\nOne day after I came home from the trip she responded with how sorry she was for not answering. I had enough and told her how I felt through the years, I was nice and civile even said I should have brought it up earlier and not just unload it all now, even asked my friends to read before sending. G answered and told me she understood why I felt like that, I ended it with that if she wanted to meet, she would have to text or call me now, cause I was tired of this being so one sided.\n\nGuess what - not heard from her since. Now I see pictures from the wedding preparations like the baccalaureate and dress fitting and I feel so sad. Probably I had a delusion hope deep inside that I would get an invite and that she would text me. This quenching the last hope of ever being friends again and telling me how little I meant and what friends mattered to her.\n\nMy friends supports my feelings even my boyfriend, but I just feel like I never meant anything. If they are real friends they will make time for you, I know, but in my head I go through all those memories and just wonder if I could have done anything different. Been a better friend, written more, called or if I just was the burden I always was scared of being, also wishing I not been so delusional and naive.\n\nSorry for the long post❤️",
