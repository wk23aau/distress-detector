A pint in most pubs is \u00a37.\n\n\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa Coffee was no more than $5 (\u00a32.43) and usually very good quality with properly trained baristas. A pint varied between $10 and $17.\n\n**Public Services**\n\n\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 Council tax is just under \u00a3300 per month. We now have to pay extra if we want green bins collected. The parks and public areas look very run down and it's mainly local volunteers picking up litter and trimming the bushes. There is vandalism and nothing gets repaired. I cannot get seen by a doctor and I have visit the hospital if myself, wife or child is ill to receive antibiotics.\n\n\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa The parks are beautifully maintained with BBQ facilities and there is constant improvements to the infrastructure. You can get a doctor or dentist appointment on the day you call and they actually show compassion. There are Olympic standard running tracks open to the public. I didn't witness any anti social behaviour and felt very safe walking around at any time of the day.\n\n**Housing**\n\n\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 Stamp duty holidays, previously low interest rates and COVID has made the property market go bonkers. The previous owner of my house profited over 50% (they bought just before COVID) and sold less than 3 years later. They did no work to the house. I've spent over \u00a330K on renovations so far.   \nI profited 13% in 5 years (minus renovations, new boiler etc) so more like 10%.\n\nMy neighbour paid under \u00a310K for their house (a second home) in the 1970's and the house is rarely occupied.\n\n\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa Not as familiar with the housing situation in Australia but aware it has obviously also increased substantially although it seems more affordable than London. Although some my friend's monthly payments have gone up thousands with the interest rate rise.\n\n**Tax**\n\n\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 My effective tax rate is 43.0% if you take into account Income Tax, NI, lost personal allowance, lost Child Benefit, and nursery costs. Tax thresholds are frozen until 2028 in the UK but have been frozen since 2021.\n\n\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa Seems taxed at a similar level.

I\u2019ve had 3 retail jobs and have been working in retail since I was 16. I was homeschooled from the age of 7 or 8. The majority of my schooling was at home, and I only did a total of about 3-4 years in public school. Not to pass blame, but my parents did not think very wisely when deciding to educate me at home. My parents did buy me Maths and English books from WHSmiths, but I didn\u2019t have a strict schedule and they weren\u2019t always able to sit down with me and teach, so I ended up doing a lot of learning on my own. Fast forward to high school, I did around 3 months of year 7, then was homeschooled again, then 4 months of year 8, then once again was homeschooled. I was not made to do my GCSEs by my parents, so yeah, that never happened. I decided to enroll in college though when I was 16. I was doing a Health and Social Care course, but it really wasn\u2019t something I enjoyed, so I dropped it and found a job instead. I really do want to get back into education now, but I\u2019m finding it really difficult to figure out where to start. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s hope for me, but I do need a little help getting to where I want to be. My career goal would probably be something involving nursing, although I\u2019m still trying to figure out what it is exactly that I want.\nAll advice is appreciated, and if you read to the end, thank you :)\n\nSidenote: I\u2019m currently in the process of an ADHD diagnosis, which I believe has contributed to my inability to focus on studying.

I collected all appropriate evidence, requested utility receipts, and offered to find some sort of resolution before I had no other recourse but to make a claim against them. \n\nThis is all through email correspondence; I have not engaged  with the individual at all in person. In fact i make it a point to avoid communal areas if i know they are using them. \n\nIn our correspondence, they repeatedly accused me of harassment (harassment in this case being the fact i sent emails requesting receipts for the services i paid for), and asked that i do not engage with them further. I obliged, and only communicated issues like outages due to utilities not being paid.\n\nIve recently organised my correspondence on the matter, calculated a rough estimate of what I am owed, and open med a case in small claims court. \n\nSince then, i have heard from other tenants that she and her father have been making further allegations of harassment. I sort of brushed this off.\n\nHowever over the weekend the police called me oht of the blue, asking to speak to the aforementioned housemate. I informed them that this is my phone, and that the housemate has never used it. When i pressed to ask how on earth they found my number, they become very evasive and eventually said \u201cwe cant tell you\u201d. They then asked for the housemates number, and after confirming they were actual police, i obliged. \n\nNow i am a bit scared, because to me it sounds like the housemate has reported me to the police, and somehow cocked it up by giving them my number instead of their own. \n\nI am a large man, and i am terrified of somehow being the victim of a false allegation. Its clear to me this tenant is desperate, as the deadline for the small claim is approaching, they are resorting to trying to fabricate a \u201cpattern of harassment\u201d. \n\nI really feel scared to leave my room sometimes, because although the other tenants are sympathetic and have promised to vouch for my character, i just have this nightmare that ill be stuck in a he-say-she-say moment where i cant do anything to help myself. \n\nAm i over reacting?

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI used to have health insurance with AXA PPP, but I didn't find it particularly helpful because when it came to making a claim (the referral itself was no issue and it was helpful to have easy access to AXA's virtual GPs), they would require my GP to sign off a personal information form, confirming that I have not been to see them for these symptoms in the past. The NHS GP surgery would then take over a month to return this form. A couple of times, there were problems with the form and I had to send it back to the GP and this took months! AXA would only accept an NHS GP, too. \n\nI would like to be able to see a specialist more quickly, if I develop new symptoms. I've looked into BUPA Global, as well as Vitality. BUPA Global have said that they would not require confirmation from the GP each time, but how easy is this process in practice? I also recall seeing a consultant for something whilst on AXA, and then later getting a bill for some diagnostic tests which were not covered, despite being told that I would be covered. Bupa is quite expensive, but what are your experiences? \n\nThanks! ",

I know we are a nation of sweet tooths, but I am dubious of the sheer amount of sweet sellers on the platform. \n\nI'm curious because surely the margins are so tight? It also seems like you have to put in so many hours to gain traction. I.e. going live for hours on end etc. \n\nMy colleague mentioned that one common type of sweet they are selling is banned for sale from typical retail companies like supermarkets, TkMaxx etc. Because they contain certain additives. He mentioned the blue style ones. And the reason there are so many sellers is that there's money to be made as there's so much of this stock out there selling cheap at wholesale level. \n\nI just find it hard to understand how SO many of these sweet sellers are sustained. When so many of them look like they're selling out of a coverted garage, and some don't bother with any hygiene procedures etc. \n\n",
