        "selftext": "im struggling a lot. \n\nfor a lot of my life, i can never bring myself to do things. If i was reading or watching something while another important thing was pending, i'd never get up. The constant nagging inside me to finish that work would eat me up from the inside. If i did focus on something, it would be too much, if my folks weren't around to remind me, i'd forget to eat or sleep until that thing i focused on was done. I was called lazy, and irregular.\n\nnow, i'm in high school. this is probably the most important thing of my life, the set factor to tell if i'll even make it to college. i look at my grades and i feel something inside me die. for a lot of my life, i was an average student. i would never do homework because i'd forget/something would distract me, but my tests and quizzes would bring me up to at least a b average. i'd never pay attention in class either, since i was too busy daydreaming or something, i would just figure things out along the way. \n\nnow as someone whos learning more advanced things in my school, its harder to keep up. to be honest, i don't think i ever learned to study. i even got up to the advanced classes in my school and theyre just kicking my ass. (one of my teachers even talked to me today about moving down to a lower level. it was humiliating.) sometimes i feel like wanting to cry while getting ready for school since i know i'l fail and fail and fail again and again. it doesnt help that i go to a really good school, which seems contradictory, but everyone's so smart here. i watch my friends who bawl their eyes out over having gpas of 4s and 4.5s, while i can barely get mine to stay in the 3 range. \n\ni just feel like ive let my family down. as an oldest sibling, i have to set a good example for my younger siblings, but i cant. my parents worked their asses off to get to where they are now only to have a kid who is failing school. \n\ni dont know whats wrong with me. am i stupid? sometimes id talk to close friends (not mentioning my grades because im so ashamed) and the way they react makes me think that they have an easier time learning stuff and focusing. what do they have that i don't? its like im slower than them and i still cant get myself to do the slightest bit better.

My dad (he was driving) pulled out as they are yelling at are car. I thought they where lost but my dad said that it may be alert dogs. We drove pass them to see if they when to one house. We drove to the house and I went down the drive (dad stayed by the road for owner running after them/make sure they don't run into the road). The drive was steep and the dog circled me as I descended. The was a lot of trash bags and trash all around. The was like five square feet and it piled up three feet. The house looked abandoned and I saw a window broken only the screen left. A third dog inside screaming it's head off. The was a large plant in a pot on the porch that difficult to move around.  The door was  open not enough to see a sliver inside but just enough to push it open with no real force. I repeatedly thought about tapping it and the door creaking open to see a rotting body. As I slowly bring my hand to the door, moments before I touching it a woman run out of the back yard thanking us for getting her dog back home stating that one dog was not hers. I still feel odd about her say one wasn't hers. Not the rotting house of bile and filth but the one sentence she said to us.",

For example: he wants me to make a phone call about something, which since he’s off for a week, he could also call too!! I’m a SAHM and I also home school our children. I’m also the one that is in charge of making all of the kids appointments etc. (another problem I have, he always makes me call when he could call too but his excuse is “I don’t have their insurance information, you do.” When clearly he doesn’t need it to schedule an appointment with their pediatrician or dentist that they always go to) anyways sorry I’m kind of off topic. He’ll talk bad about me to our kids and get them to agree. Saying things like “your Mom needs to be calling these people instead of expecting me to do it, right?” So of course my kids feel like they have no choice but to agree. My oldest tells me the things he says. I want to confront him but she doesn’t want him knowing she told me but at the same time I don’t care anymore. I remember a long time ago I would vent to my parents about him and he would get upset telling me to stop and to just talk to him about it… here we go, now he’s doing the same except it’s to our own children and to his family members who also don’t like me too much. I love him but there’s a lot of issues we’re facing atm. I have no one to talk to so I guess, here I am. I always feel comfortable being able to let everything out here. ",

        "selftext": "I definitely need to see a therapist about this one :\n(TW: CA, SA, and self-harm)\n\nI (21F) had this life-altering experience when I was around 15 or 16, during high school. At the time, the friend group was fairly large and a friend of mine started dating a new student, we all had gotten close pretty quick since we all hung out together and that was the dynamic then.\n\nDuring class one day he sent me a Snapchat asking if I could step out to talk about my friend—his girlfriend. Thinking something was wrong, I asked the teacher if I could be excused (which she allowed because we were just making valentine’s day cards and class would be over shortly.) What started as an innocent conversation about childish relationship drama suddenly shifted.\n\n(TW) I was choked to the point where I lost focus in my eyes, and what felt like blood circulation being cut off, I’d been sa’d and I froze... while I was panicking internally I kept thinking it wouldn’t go any farther knowing we were LITERALLY in a main hallway with a camera right above us. So it felt impossible that something like this could be happening in such a visible place... clearly i was wrong and naive.\n\nAt the time, I didn’t fully understand what had happened, but the bell had rung and our friend group met as usual, walking each other to our next period. That’s when I had a panic attack. A friend noticed and as I’m trying to explain what happened she notices our vice principal, of course my friend tells her, to which I’m immediately sent to the principal’s office.\n\nI explained everything. They told me they would “conduct an investigation” and sent me home. I was never given the opportunity to write a report. I ended up missing a month+ of school with no updates on the situation. My parents would constantly call the school wondering when I’ll be able to go back, how i’m going to catch up on my work etc. we eventually were called in for a meeting. Most of the meeting now is a blur, besides the infamous hurtful quote of all time “It seems like you wanted to,”  my heart drops and I shut down, I remember the same unable to breathe  feeling and was in complete shock as my parents scolded me. \n\nI was still sent home after this as they would figure out our next steps. From when the situation first began to the conclusion we’d gotten (TW) I endured physical, verbal, and emotional abuse from my parents. Over time, I started believing it was my fault—something I still struggle with today. That belief led to years of severe self exiting ideations and harm.\n\n(Note the both of us were eventually allowed back in school, but I had be isolated in a office and he’d been in ISD (in school detention, eventually he moved))\n\nFast forward to years of no contact, he reached out with an apology. By then, I had already let go and forgiven the situation. If I’m honest, I hold far more resentment toward my parents than him—at least he apologized….\n\nMore recently, we crossed paths on social media. We caught up through texts, he would apologized again, I’d make dark humor jokes out of it, called, etc., it felt like the old friends we were before the bad. And for a moment, I thought he had changed. I felt relieved—happy even—to know he had grown into a better person. As time passed I stopped hearing from him… and out of curiosity I ask his roommate if everything was okay with him.\n\nI found out he had been arrested.\n(TW) Domestic assault and battery plus Domestic assault and battery by strangulation.\n(Note: He’s now released and there were no charges from the plaintiff)\n\nGuys — It feels like I’m subconsciously reliving that nightmare that once was. I don’t know why, and I can’t shake it. The scariest part is I can’t stop thinking about the woman he hurt… I don’t even know her, but I’m fixated on her. And for him… I don’t know where to begin on how I feel.. I feel stupid, guilt, naive to thinking he was a good person… I feel empathy, concern, and curiosity… I feel angry, condemnation, and to shame him… I feel like I need to do something but I don’t know what to do.\n\nWhat is wrong with me?! Why is this effecting me so heavily?!?!",

However, for the past few months I’ve been finding myself growing more and more flustered by his flirting, but in a good way? To the point where I’m starting to overcompensate by making it very VERY clear that it’s all in good fun, afraid of him finding out I like him. I don’t want to ruin our friendship with this, I can’t lose him. \n\nAnother thing is, I’m fully not his type. He loves tall, masculine, strong men, and I’m none of that. I’m 5’2, not strong and feminine leaning in my appearance, I’m the complete opposite of his type and it kills me to know that. \n\nI’m just so lost, I want to tell him how I feel, but I don’t want to ruin things. I’m trying so hard to be there for him as a friend, but my heart shatters every time he talks about some guy he’s talking to and knowing I will never be that person. \n\nBut yeah, that it all, any advice would be appreciated but isn’t expected, thank you for reading.\n\nTLDR: I’m in love with my best friend but I’m not his type and I don’t want to ruin our friendship by telling him how I feel.

His wife also has a spending problem that he just can't seem to shake because she gets what she wants. \n\n They just got their tax money, and he was saying that all of it needed to go to debt or they'd start having collections come.

This immediately worried me because he's been talking a lot lately about suicidal feelings and he refuses to seek help because he \"don't have the time or money\" and insist he'd never do anything, just saying hoping he dies in a accident so his family would be taken care of. \n\n Everyone has heard of those Disney trips that are before divorce, abandonment, or suicide and I'm really worried that's what this is. His debt is well over 6 figures, not including his mortgage, and he's suddenly spending like there is no tomorrow and not worried about it not worried about it He seems extremely happy but I'm worried about him.

        "selftext": "TW: MENTION OF DR*G USE. \n\n\n\n\n\nI spent years, from 18 to 31, almost my entire adult life being manipulated and abused by my ex. Who I knew was an alcoholic but I didn't realize was a drug addict. (meth and cocaine, apparently)\n Boy, that was a doozy when I figured that out. So naive on my part. \n\n Until therapy. Therapy was great for me. I didn't even know I was being abused until my therapist was basically like, \"Hey. None of this is normal. This is not okay.\" Even though my family and friends were worried for me and tried to get me to see it, I continued to stand up for my ex and cover for them until therapy. \n\nWherever you are Therapist Jas, you helped me start to save myself. \n\nWhen I decided I wanted out, all i wanted were my things and my dogs. No smear campaign. No fights. Just my items and to disappear into the void. Things did not work out like that, actually. \n\nThey didn't allow me to take most of my things, most of which were given to me by my great grandma and grandma.\n\n I left with two duffel bags and a tote. \n\nOn the day they were \"nice enough\" to let me get more of my things, all i ended up with was my great grandmas table (which was a win to me) and some lovely boxes of actual garbage can trash that they put together for me. Including but not limited to old food wrappers, contents from multiple ash trays, a sex toy I'd never seen, and most of my photos ripped into tiny shreds. They would not let me have my dogs. \n\nLike a buffoon, for weeks I attempted to get my dogs back. They couldn't afford to feed the dogs much less themselves so I offered to buy the food, cover upcoming vet bills, allow visits.\n \nThey kept my dogs. I never got to see them again. I never even got to go inside the home and say goodbye. \n\nIt's been a few years but I found out recently that my ex lost their house. And then another. So satisfying for me to hear honestly, But what threw me off the most was when I found out what happened to my dogs, thanks to One of my exes family members. \n\nOne \"ran away\". This particular dog never left the yard. Never left my side. She was a very good girl. In the 10 years I'd had her, not once was she ever lost or missing. \n\nOne \"we don't know\" what happened. So a dog just disappeared into thin air. Got it. \n\nAnd the last one...\n\nWas neglected and malnourished and treated so badly he went blind. He was so bad that by the time one of my \"exes friends\" took him to the vet there was nothing they could do but put him down. \n\nThe family member said it wasn't two weeks later and the ex got a new dog. \n\nI was devastated. That particular family member no longer has dealings of any kind with my ex, but found me to let me know about what happened. I appreciated that, even though I was heartbroken. He knew i fought hard for those babies and I would have kept fighting but i couldn't because I ended up getting a well deserved order of protection for a multitude of other reasons. \n\nIt's been a few years. I'm married and a mom now. I live a very safe, comfortable, happy life with a man that is extremely good to me. I'm still working to rewire my brain from the years of chaos and abuse. I'm still pretty triggered by certain things and I still have nightmares from time to time. \n\n\nBut most of all, I'm still grieving my dogs. I wanted to save them. I wanted to fight for them. I wanted them with me. To live happy, free lives. I miss them. And I hope they didn't think they did anything wrong when I left. I hope they know I cry everytime their pictures come up on my photo memories. I hope they know I did my best and I never forgot them. I hope they knew I loved them and that I still do. \n\n\nAnd I hope that my ex never has a moment of peace or fortune or anything close to good for what they did to my dogs. Not even what they did to me. But to my innocent, sweet, loyal, amazing dogs. ",

        "selftext": "tw for rape/abuse/controlling behaviour\n\nhi guys i am very nervous to post this as it is my first post on reddit and i couldn't figure out how to go anonymous without making a new email but here it is. \n\ni (f19) have known my boyfriend (m19) since april 2023 and have been with him officially since june 2023, he previously had a girlfriend 'polly' (f19) from january 2021 to around december 2022, she broke up with him at this point but he said that after a few weeks of her ignoring him they rekindled but issues were still arising so they officially split in march 2023 and he hasn't been in contact with her since.\n\nhe has expressed to me that she had issues with her mother and often stayed at his house for extended periods of time, was a big smoker at the time and would often steal from his older brother when she had no money, and that she was depressed/depressive throughout the relationship and was also prescribed medication towards the end of their relationship which he said was changing her behaviour and attitude negatively, he believes this is why she left him in december 2022 because of their differing views. he also told me that she has history of making accusations, before she had reported him i was asking him questions about her and their relationship and he said that in the beginning he got a message from a boy who had been previously accused of rape by her saying that she was a liar, he obviously believed her as they were together but in hindsight this should've been a red flag he also said that they didn't have much of a sexual relationship and she was very paranoid with protection which obviously would make sense if she was a victim of rape so i guess that's how he thought of it but later on down the line she denied that she was raped and said that it was consensual.\n\nin september 2023 his ex accused him of coercive and controlling behaviour (we didnt know when she first filed the report until months later) and he was taken into police custody in october 2023 for a few hours. initially she had reported that he was abusive towards her but quickly dropped the gbh charges, i assume she didn't have enough evidence - his solicitor stated that the evidence she saw for the gbh charges consisted of 2 photos of grazes and bruises she had. she initially said that he had punched her 100 times in one period of time, also in one of her statements she said that she had taken photos of bruises on her arm that he had given her as she was sat in his bed next to him this alone is baffling to me as if he was 'so controlling' i don't believe he would let her do this especially if he was the cause.\n\ni completely believe him when he says that he did not do it as i have been with him for about the same amount of time they were together and have had none of the same issues with him, also i have read/heard multiple of her and her family's claims and the written ones just don't match up - for example, her brother said he saw my boyfriend strangling her and her face was purple and her mother said that on the same day and time he only had her pinned on the bed. this instantly gives me red flags.\n\nmy first thought was obviously that since they broke up and got back together multiple times throughout their relationship she was hoping that the same would happen but he met me and moved on instead (her friend had messaged her when she was not speaking to him and told her that 'polly' had advised him to move on). also it is very possible that she was aware that he was with me and not just having time to himself as his mother frequently posts on facebook and had made a post in july 2023 that she was picking him up from the city that i live in and mentioned me in the post, my boyfriend's mother has proof that she has been frequenting her profile as she accidentally requested to be her friend one day. the only piece of evidence that i have seen that i am aware she has kept (evidence she had of bruises from an injury have been thrown out with the gbh charge) is a clipped screenshot of him texting her saying 'i'll find another girl to abuse' obviously i have defended this as a retaliation to her emotional manipulation/abuse his solicitor also requested that the police access her phone to retrieve all of their iMessage conversation for context. personally i believe that him saying that is not an omission but an inappropriate joke of some sort.\n\nshe claimed that while they were together he would tell her what she could and couldn't wear, wouldn't let her see her friends or family, wouldn't let her take her pills, wouldn't let her attend school, etc. i have seen photos of her in his phone of them together with his friends, i also met his friends and they brought her up casually before he knew she had reported him so no mal intent there in my opinion, i have also seen photos of her school work.\n\ni do not believe a word that she said in her statements she said that she was so badly affected by him that she cannot sleep comfortably, walk for long periods, sit comfortably in a car or travel by airplane but she continues to post herself at clubs in the city that i live in (him and her don't), she has gone on multiple holidays since reporting him, one she showed on instagram just shy of 2 months after she made her original report, etc.\n\nof course when they were together he was also between the ages of 15 and 17 so i am honestly surprised that it is even been taken to crown court and gone of for so long it seems so menial to me.\n\ni am just nervous as it seems that in court he will be judged by a jury and i know they are to be unbiased but it is still nerve wracking to know that his fate lies in the hands of strangers, he has made it known to me that he would like a restraining order to be put in place, i would prefer a protection order as from what i know they are longer lasting, i think that he could also charge her with deformation of character as she was telling his friends that he was abusive to her during the first summer that we were together (june/july 2023). \n\nplease don't suggest that i leave him often when i share this with friends they say i should just leave him to avoid the stress but it is not about me, i love him and want to be there and support him the best that i can but i honestly don't know what i would do if he was found guilty and sentenced for a long period of time, we having been talking about saving up for a deposit on a house, getting married and having a baby in the coming years.\n\ni don't really know what i'm expecting from this in all honesty but just wanted to share without feeling like a burden, i'm sure there is more information that i have missed as this is just a late night rant of sorts so i may make some edits at a different time but feel free to ask any questions or give any advice.",

        "selftext": "I (26F) had been feeling like a caretaker for most of my relationship with my ex-partner (39M) who is an alcoholic. He would be sober for a long time, and then relapse. The more I thought about the relapses, the timing seemed way too convenient. He would relapse during times, when I went to see family, when I got a new job, when I got my graduate school qualifying exams, when I went to travel abroad alone for the first time in several years. It started feeling like he was punishing me for having a life of my own.\n\nThroughout the relationship, I had financially supported him. Even when he was sober, it was not uncommon that rent was late, he was in medical debt because of avoiding to get a good insurance plan, he never paid taxes, etc. I was always \"borrowing\" him money that I ended up realizing I will never get back. \n\nEnough was enough.\n\nHe asked me to quit my job and move to a new location with him, which I did. I gave up EVERYTHING only for him to relapse. \n\nThat's when I decided that I am done, and that I need to live my own life. I knew that he had taken money from our mutual savings (so 90% mine, 10% his) without asking me before, so I \"forgot\" my credit and debit cards on to the kitchen table while starting to move my stuff out, and took his wallet from his pocket, placing it on the bottom of his bedside drawer. He was going to hit withdrawals if he didn't have money for booze, so I knew he was going to steal my cards. It was not until a day later that they \"disappeared\" and I saw charges made. Booze. Sex club(?), Casinos. Lots of takeout. Impulsive purchases online.\n\nI called the police, reported the cards missing, and said that my ex was the suspect, and that he is currently trying to drink himself to death (which he always is when he relapses and doesn't hesitate to say it). They came over immediately, I was there too, and they found the cards in his possession, and as he turned violent towards them yelling I set him up, he was arrested him on the spot. I've come clean to the police about his tax avoidance as well, along with illegal threats against me from 2-3 years ago (that I have screenshots of), as the statute of limitations has not run out. \n\nHe's looking at several charges now, including resisting arrest,  illegal threats, stealing, potential tax evasion and negligence, several fines, and isn't a first-time offender. I don't know how he's doing, whether he's sober, I don't care. I have my own life to live. \n\nSince then, I've begun making more money, and traveling the world, and I am finally starting to feel like myself again. I've even made new friends, which I haven't for years, as all of my old friends made me choose between them and him, and I foolishly chose him. ",

He built trust first, slowly making her believe he was a safe person.\n\nThen one day, they went on a trip together. She tried to refuse weed, but he kept pushing until she gave in. Once she was intoxicated, everything changed. He made her believe he liked her, even loved her. And in that manipulated state, he took what he wanted.\n\nThe next day, she still couldn’t process what happened. She even wore a skirt for him, as if she was trying to convince herself that it was something real, something meaningful. But when the trip ended, so did his act. He turned cold—immediately, like she never mattered.\n\nIt took time for her to accept it. First, she blamed herself. Then, she started questioning reality. Finally, she realized—she was just another toy to him.\n\nShe told me:\n\n\"I didn’t know it was all his plan. I was just a toy for him.\"\n\n\"I feel dirty. I feel like I’m not clean anymore.\"\n\n\"Why did he act like he cared, only to throw me away?\"\n\n\nThis wasn’t a love affair.\nThis was grooming.\n\nHe conditioned her trust, intoxicated her, used her, then discarded her. And even after realizing everything, she still blamed herself.\n\n\n---\n\nMy Story: Why This Hurts Me Too\n\nShe told me everything. And I believed her. I still do. But the hardest part? Other people don’t.\n\nEven my own uncle dismissed it. He refused to believe the evidence, called her a liar, and even defended the abuser. That’s what broke me the most—if people can so easily ignore her pain, then what about mine?\n\nBecause this isn’t just about her story—it’s about what this has done to me.\n\nI wake up angry every day. Not just at the abuser, but at the world that lets people like him exist without consequences. I want to protect the next victim. I want him to feel the fear she felt.\n\n\n\nSo I need to ask:\nDo you think she was having an affair to which she alwys said that he was just a good friend whom she trusted ?\nOR\nDO YOU THINK SHE WAS GROOMED...?\n\n\nI WANT REVENGE NOT JUST FOR HER BUT FROM MY ABUSER TOO... ANY ADVICE.\n\n",

        "selftext": "Me and the Situationship old enough to be my dad are not seeing each other anymore. I was very excited and relieved, he's started seeing other people. I know if I ended things he'd just give me the silent treatment, yell at me, attempt to make me look bad at work, or physically hurt me all things he's done at work when he thinks I'm rejecting him. \n\nSo I was very happy and relieved to find out he went on a date with someone else, he even gave me the silent treatment all day yesterday. Today though, he's acting normal though, saying hi and trying to make jokes. I found out I might have to work with him tomorrow so i asked the one supervisor that I do trust if I could skip working with him. I've already told a few supervisors i feel uncomfortable with him and everyone just laughs it off, \"oh yeah he's just a character, that's him.\" Situationship even gloats, \"my job is whatever I want, they're not gonna do anything. Our boss isn't gonna do anything I told her already.\"\n\nTrusted Supervisor doesn't know anything that's happened outside of work, I only told him what Situationship has done AT work. I'm so embarrassed, nervous, I even feel humiliated. I don't want to make an official report but Trusted Supervisor is telling me to take it to the highest in the office, our boss's boss's boss. I am dreading it. I have 2 weeks or he'll make the report himself.\n\nI'm not gonna mention the assault, the weird relationship we had outside of work, only the inappropriate behavior that happened during work but still. I'm worried Situationship will say I just have a vendetta against him. He already gets away with everything, maybe he will bring up our relationship outside of work to cover his ass. Situationship just gets to do whatever he wants and it's irritating me. \n\nHe called another supervisor (who's black) a monkey and almost dropped the N-word. He was screaming this in my face on the street, we work at a hospital and multiple people heard this. No one cares, the supervisors I have told just said, \"yikes yeah he was really mad that day.\" \n\nDread dread dread that's all I feel right now. ",

I texted the freshman gc &amp; see if anyone wanted to be friends. Angela responded, we met up, and she introduced me to her friends and we've all been hanging out since. Yesterday, I'm getting texts in the gc but I'm not really reading them until I see Angela says my name. I respond how did my name get brought up. Angela says when we all were hanging out yesterday I didn't engage with anyone or say anything and it took her a minute to realize I was there. Then Angela, Randi, &amp; Kasey are all basically saying I don't talk when I'm with them, all I just follow them around, force them to sign me in their dorm to \"hangout\" with them, &amp; they know nothing about me. I texted back saying \"I do talk sometimes its just sometimes I don't talk bc of social anxiety or bc I have nothing to say. The other day only asked yall to sign me bc it was raining hard and I didn't want to walk across campus to my dorm in the rain. I wasn't going to hangout yesterday but then after we left the dining hall Brigitte said she would sign me in and I felt bad asking her to sign me out after she just signed me in. If yall don't wanna hangout with me I won't come around anymore.\" Angela, Randi, &amp; Kasey said we do want to hangout with you we just want you to talk and engage with us instead of sitting there and being a wallflower and something must be wrong with us since you been with us since last semester. I tell them nothing is wrong is them its me and I'll feel like I'm not anyone's friend in the gc and it's my fault bc I don't talk enough but I'm trying more now that I'm in college and I'll still eat with yall and try to more but idk abt hangout rn. About 5 min after I send that message I was walking to class with my I was walking to class with my headphones on and passed Angela. I didn't feel like talking so I didn't say anything. She responds to me in the gc saying I said hi to you and you literally just ignored me. how can we get to know you if when we give you the opportunity and you're not here with us I respond to her and say I didn't see u I had my headphones on and I was going to class. Then Kasey says you did see her. Then a few of the other people in the gc tried to defend me. Today I walk in the dining hall and I see some them sitting together. Usually I go sit with them or least say hi but after yesterday I felt weird doing that. They never spoke to me and I never spoke to them. I'm not sure how to feel about this.

I've been having an ongoing issue with two co-workers who have basically just been mean girls since the day I started a couple years ago, and the only thing that I'm guilty of doing is trying to do my job to the fullest, which I know they haven't been a fan of because I draw more attention to our team which means more work might be given to our team and more responsibilities which they don't want. I know they don't want this because they have actually vocalized that to our manager, whenever there's a chance for more opportunities or extra work to be done they both shut the idea down so hard and fast and I'm usually the one who's okay doing the small tasks.\n\nThere's multiple incidents where they have both been unprofessional and have come at me in aggressive ways for various reasons. Every single incident has had another teammate witnessed the whole thing. my manager is aware that there is an ongoing issue and there have been corrective actions taken for one coworker since they have complaints in multiple departments from multiple people.\n\nAnd last Thursday they decided to ambush me in a meeting accusing me of not doing my job or avoiding work and insinuating that I was lying when I tried to tell them what was going on, and I had it, so I talked to my manager and they suggested I go to HR, because if I didn't they were going to report it so I figured well if it's going to happen one way or the other I might as well do it. so I reported this to HR something I have never done before. And I have anxiety through the roof, because I've never gone to HR with a problem before because normally in my other jobs the mean girls are the girls that the managers adore and they see me as the problem.\n\nSo in my head I'm going to lose my job because I'm the problem, when I haven't instigated anything. And I hate that I think that I'm the problem and I hate that I have so much anxiety for just trying to stand up to myself and have a non-toxic work environment and not be disrespected in front of my coworkers or at work.",

        "selftext": "\n\nFor context, I (45F) have rental policies which I'm very particular about. One of these policies is that tenants are prohibited from having any colors in their house except beige, white, and black. Although this might seem strict, I allow tenants to have colorful screens, clothing, and food boxes (albeit in the trash). I also provide storage for food, which is properly colored to fit my needs. I also do check-ins every two months to make sure my terms are followed, and the property is not damaged. Occasionally, they'll be unannounced so there will be no cover-ups.\n\nOne of my tenants (29F), has been renting with me for five years. We went over the lease agreement, and she agreed to my terms. Since then, she has gotten pregnant and birthed a beautiful baby girl named Paisleigh, whom I insisted upon the name for.\n\nIn the present, it's a brisk August morning. As usual, I go to check my property. It is completely in shambles. The decorations, furniture, walls, and all of that were fine, but there was one massive oversight. Toys scattered everywhere. I would be fine if they were correctly colored, but no. These are colorful toys. Dolls, stacking donuts, blocks, wooden cars, rubber ducks. It was such a disgrace to my property, I had to look away. I reminded my tenant that of course, she can have toys in the house, but they must be in accord with the rental policy. She apologizes, and I leave. I thought my warning would be okay.\n\nFast forward to a few months later, I return, again unannounced. Still, she keeps these pigmented, bright toys around. I further warn her, but it's not enough. She insists bright colors are good for development. Later that night, I enter her house using my spare key, silently creeping into her room. The baby is sleeping inside a playpen, so no worries there. I wait to make sure that she's truly sleeping, then I pounce. I acutely latch onto her throat, and she screams. I feel her voice box vibrating through my strangling hands as she tries to scream, but nothing comes out, just sputtering and choking. I keep choking as she thrashes about, until around three minutes later, and I know I'm done. She has no pulse, and her body is as limp as a ragdoll.\n\nI transport her corpse and the sleeping baby into the car, driving to a beachside town to dump the body. I drive back to my house, and I don't know what to do with the baby, so I decide to barbeque her. As she sleeps, I preheat the grill, lighting it ablaze, and then after about 14 minutes, I set her on the cooking rack. Soon I can hear wailing from under the hood of the grill, before she could gasp for air anymore. It's terrible and loud, but eventually, with the smell of charred meat, it ceases. I drive to a nearby college town to dump the second body.\n\n\n",

        "selftext": " To preface I am in college now and this was almost 3 years ago. Okay so I (F 20) had a big group of friends in high school. We all got really close senior year and there were a lot of characters so I will be using fake names. It was around prom season this whole thing started. There was a boy I was talking to and he wasn’t super favored by alot of people but everyone talked to him because he was like a class clown. We’ll call him Jacob. Jacob had originally planned of going to prom with a girl Tess. Tess never wanted to go with him so when he met me and we started talking he told her that they shouldn’t go together because it would have been boring because she didn’t even want to go with him. This was wrong I know and should’ve told me something because me and Jacob went on to date and he was actually insane. \n\nAnyways this caused a big drama and caused Tess and her close friends to hate me. Tess’s friends were friends with some of my friends and my friends began to act weird to me. Not talking to me all that often but that was fine because I still had my core friends. My core friends being Sasha, Kylie, and Khloe. I ended up having a falling out with Kylie and Khloe too due to all of our other friends deciding to hate me for dating Jacob but that’s besides the point. \n\nJump to prom and all of the weird behavior continued and I had to go on a party bus with all the people who I know knew were talking shit about me. I ended up leaving with Sasha and Khloe because I couldn’t stand to be on the bus and we met up with Jacob. Prom ended so odd and it was clear no one wanted to talk to me because I was with Jacob. \n\nFast forward to the summer after prom. One of the boys who was in my old friend group posted something on his spam story on Instagram with a video from the party bus from prom, “ Missing prom. Don’t see any ‘dirty looks’ but I digress”. This was a direct dig at me because I had told Khloe that whole group had been giving me and Sasha dirty looks on the bus.  Me and Khloe had already fallen out by this time . (Sorry for all the jumping around Im just trying to give context). So I tell Jacob who I’m already dating by this point that he had posted something so Jacob decides to post on his story a picture from prom captioned “I loved prom but definitely not those dirty looks😍”. This starts a war in instagram notes of all places. We’ll call the boy who posted Joey. Joey begins posting in his instagram notes saying how me and Jacob are so mad and then begins and argument with Jacob on instagram notes. I was mortified because really? Instagram notes? \n\nBut anyways they go back and forth with petty comments to each other but I stay out of it. This goes on for probably 20 minutes. Then joey decides to personally attack me and posts “Letting him hit in 3 weeks? Not very disney of you” And he always used to say I could be an actor on Disney channel so I knew this particular comment was for me. I start crying because now personal information is being shared. Oh and every person I used to be friends with was egging him on in their instagram notes. I want to be clear that other than going to prom with Jacob I had never said or done anything to any of the people that were mad at me and posting about me. Joey keeps going and decides to post about things I only told Khloe and Kylie. About my personal sex life with Jacob. Joey posts that on instagram notes and I freak out because now everyone is looking at this and most people know it’s about me. \n\nThat’s when I start getting texts from fake numbers. Slut shaming me, calling me ugly, threatening me and telling me to respond. I couldn’t deal with it. It all ended 20 or so minutes later but I was like wtf. I don’t talk to any of these people anymore other than Sasha. Jacob ended up being a maniac so we broke up. Anyways this all happened almost 3 years ago I guess I just wanted to see what people would say and if going to prom with Jacob made me deserve all this?",

Most of them went to art school because they weren’t good enough in any other subject, and this felt like the easiest choice. They took classes in their senior year to create a decent portfolio, and that’s all. All they did was tracing shitty Pinterest drawings before that. And some of them are nepos, who got into art colleges by mostly using their parents’ connections.\n\nI’m jealous, I’m so fucking jealous. They don’t deserve it. It should’ve been me.",

        "selftext": "Well when i was under the age of 6 i had 5 siblings. The two came after I turned 10. I didn't play with them at all because by the time the last two were of playing age I was already a teen. \n\nBut my mom always made sure that we behaved in public. Whether it would be by her pulling us to the side by the ear and threatening an ass whooping or to leave us at home, it worked. We would walk single file behind her, sit at restaurant tables and chat quietly with each other, never raising our voices. We ended up homeless for a year or two when i was young, so we were put in one small room. We were made to clean the house and learn chores so we could help the people we were staying with. \n\nWhen my mom was able to find a house, she said it was always hard because renters always thought that many kids wouldn't be worth a tenant. So anytime we moved we would clean the house spotless. We moved a lot. We also would clean spotless whenever the land lord was visiting. \n\nMy mom knew how it looked to have so many kids behind her, especially when her husband wasn't around because of work so it was only him. She thought people saw her as a poor, ghetto woman with an army of kids who she couldn't control so she made damn sure we wouldn't be like that. \n\nBut like why have that many kids in the first place.... or continue having them even after experiencing homelessness? We were back and forth between many of friends and family after my parents divorced. And we moved 13 times before I was in high school. Yet she still had kids but that's another topic for another day.... \n\nThat basically taught all of us to keep up with appearances. My mom was also incredibly mentally, physically and emotionally abusive so there was always fear in my house. It was my siblings and I against her, so we were all close and together. \n\nBut then we started to turn on each other as we got older, probably from my older siblings maturing and growing bitter and angry at the abuse. I'm going through that phase now. \n\nEither way it led me to become emotionally detached from my siblings. There was always just so many things going on, it was hard to keep up. \n\nOnce my older siblings moved out I was the oldest in the house and it became my responsibility to cook and clean for everyone. I got tired of it and moved out a month after graduating. \n\nI got sick of taking care of others when I was a child, so I just left. Another step i took to separate myself from my family. \n\nSure, having big families are fun. It's never quiet, immediate family reunions are crazy and loud (my mom also had 7 siblings so imagine how big they got), you get to grow up with multiple best friends, but when you have an emotionally and mentally unstable mother with an enabler husband, it's terrible. Never a peaceful moment, especially not with the homelessness or having to share rooms with siblings when we got our own houses, constant arguments because nobody knew how to regulate themselves and constant abuse. \n\nIt drove my older sister insane. I haven't seen her in years. It's driving me insane now. \n\nI never had room to be myself, not until after i turned 18. I never got to properly develop so now I have mental issues. And chronic illnesses. \n\nGrowing up with 7 siblings was hard. My mom's attention was only focused on the younger one. Yeah, we would have fun times and a lot of them but that doesn't overshadow the abuse or anything else.\n\nI always get jealous of people who are close to their siblings. I can never have that, not anymore. I can barely form and maintain friendships, much less familial relationships. \n\nNot to mention how people react whenever i tell them how many siblings I have. I've had to fight  few people who talked crap about my mom being a whore. My siblings have had to fight other kids for the same thing. Nothing says bonding time more than beating the kid who made fun of your younger sibling. Classy? No. Fun? Yes. ",

        "selftext": "My (30f) ex (33m)  is dating a neighbour in my building. We broke up about 8 months ago. We were together 3.5 years. Throughout the course of our relationship there were definitely issues. We lived together for two years and after the break up we still lived together for a month and a half as we had to sell our house. What's wild is we talked about getting married two months before we broke up and he was 100% on board. We broke up over a really intense fight where he blamed me for something he lost. It's a long story, but we fought for 3 days, decided to take a break for a week to think about what we wanted to do about this. He decided to end the relationship.\n\nLiving together still was hell. He was awful. He threatened to throw my stuff away because he thought I was dating. I found out he made two catfishing dating profiles right after we broke up which he later matched with me on and then would block me. I found out from a close friend of his what he was doing. Curiousity got the better of me. I made a real profile of myself to see if it was true. He swiped on me, blocked me, and remade those profiles a few times. He called me dumb each time I disagreed with him with things concerning selling our house. He skipped out on the last mortgage payment. He also refused to help prepare the house for sale. I did everything on my own. Meanwhile he still ate my food, kept walking in on me while I was changing (the door didn’t lock), and would sometimes pressure me to still sleep in our bed because as he put it: “we slept together for almost 4 years, what’s a few more nights.” He also got me an insanely expensive birthday gift and wrote me in as a plus one to a wedding both after we broke up. For weeks after he moved out, he kept trying to sleep at our old house for a whole week. I put my foot down here and told him I needed space. \n\nI tried to be respectful as possible from the start to honor his wishes. I didn’t want to be with someone who didn’t want to be with me. Besides one conversation about our relationship after we broke up a few weeks in, I left him alone. I only talked about the house or things we had to communicate about. I tried setting some boundaries, but after he called me dumb, I gave up and bit my tongue through it until he moved out. \n\nHe always knew where I was moving to, it was also in our documents for the notary. I told him when I found a place which street and he mentioned the building. Since I moved in, I swore I saw him often driving by. I knew he bought a car (that also looks incredibly similar to mine). I also was pretty sure I saw his bike parked outside my building a few times. I heard from a cousin who followed him on Strava that he also ran close to my place or in my street multiple times a week for months. Then there was when I had a dating profile, I saw he was on there for real as himself and it kept saying he was 650 feet away and sometimes 1 mile away. I'd sometimes block him and then he'd have a brand new dating profile again showing the same sometimes. Each time I deleted him, for months he popped back up. It was triggering me so much. I did delete all dating apps two months ago. I had a stalker (different guy) for five years with court dates and all. This same ex helped me through this. He was so empathetic about everything I went through with having a stalker. And here my ex is, also invading my space. In a different way, sure. \n\nNow last Saturday I saw him help a girl move a piano in. He was in the entry way of my building. I felt my heart race and my anxiety spike. There was another guy there so I was hoping that maybe this guy was her boyfriend and he was just friends with them. Then this morning, as I was returning from walking what used to be our dog (now just mine), he walked out of the elevator freshly showered. He smugly greeted me as if I was an old acquittance.  As I looked out the window of the elevator, I saw he used a key to the building. That made me feel a bit uncomfortable too. I was now even more suspicious and panicking. I texted a mutual friend. I don't care that he's dating. If I saw him in the city on a date, I probably wouldn’t react much. I do care that he's in my space. The mutual friend confirmed he's seeing someone and told me her name. We have a group chat with everyone that lives in the building and low and behold there she was.\n\nJust...what the fuck. Who does this? He knew when he probably first went to her place that I live here too. And when I guess things got more serious, he also knew. What's worse is that that friend told me a friend of ours set them up who also knew exactly where I moved to. If I was dating someone and I found out they lived in his building, I’d either stop seeing that guy, I would send a courtesy text, or I’d at least ask the person I’m seeing if we could primarily hang out in my building. \n\nI feel he could have at the very least sent a message. I thought I was being paranoid for months thinking I saw signs of him being in my space. Now I hate the fact that I may run into him this often, but I would have much rather known he’s dating someone than think he was stalking me. I also was just moving on with my life. Seeing him is still a bit upsetting. It's one thing if this was years later, but it's only been 8 months.\n\nAll of the things he's done since…It's so unbelievably cruel. I am so angry. I haven't messaged him because I don't think he'd respect my boundaries. I just want to move on. I deserve that. I don't deserve this.\n\nI've come to the conclusion that he should be the one who feels uncomfortable seeing me. Not the other way around. I shouldn't have to feel uncomfortable in my own space.\n\nSorry for the cursing, but what a motherfucking asshole. Never called an ex that, but he absolutely deserves the title.\n\nJust needed some other people to know about this jerk.",

Now I am married with a son and another one along the way. Anyways, there have been three situations where I asked her to come and stay with us for a bit. We initially both stayed in the same city but now are 2 hour flight away.\n\n1) First, my husband had a work trip in Oct last year. The morning sickness was at its peak at 3 months. And I just wanted someone around incase there is a medical emergency for 3-4 days. We have a nanny to help with my son for most of the day. So all she had to do was just be around. She refused saying she has a neighbour’s birthday party to attend. I let it go.\n\n2) Last month, I called her and asked her if \nshe can be with my son for 3-4 days when I will be in the hospital around my due date. Again the nanny is there. She just has to manage the night when he is sleeping. She refused saying she can’t leave my dad alone during easter time and needs to cook for him. My dad is a perfectly abled man who can cook his own food.\n\n3) Yesterday, my husband’s side of the family had an emergency situation and my husband had to leave for his parent’s place for 3-4 days. This time I was sure I will not ask my mom to come down again. But my husband called my mom and literally begged her to come down as he didn’t want to leave me alone with my son at this juncture. Her cold response was that she has to be with my dad and cook for him etc. She asked us to keep the nanny to stay over for a couple of days. I fully support my husband’s decision to be with his parents at this time for reasons I can’t divulge. \n\nAfter yesterday, I lost it with her. I told her that she wont hear from me again and she is a sad excuse for a mom who can’t even be with her daughter when there can be a medical emergency. And in case I die she need not come either. So she blamed me for moving cities without considering all this. And that my dad has slogged all his life to educate us etc. how can I think she can leave him and rush to me. For context, I moved cities because I got a better job that pays her bills to a certain extent and gives me some semblance of work life balance. As for my dad, he is not a baby.\nWhat kind of mother would want to miss the birth of her grandchild or not want to be with her daughter when she is almost due",

        "selftext": "People think that because they went a year without sex and it wasn’t a big deal, they can relate to someone who reaches 25, 30, or 40 years old without ever having kissed or held someone’s hand. They simply can’t. Everyone who tells me sex isn’t a big deal can’t truly understand it, no matter how hard they try. They can’t relate because sex (not just the act itself, but everything around it, like the confidence of knowing you’re attractive enough to attract someone) has become something they take for granted. Only someone who’s never experienced it can truly grasp its importance. You just can’t.  \n\nI know sex can be awkward, messy, or even empty. People get used, hurt, or end up feeling emptier than before. But here’s the crucial part: wanting to experience it doesn’t mean I’m chasing some idealized version. Even in its most ordinary forms, sex is still pretty great, and people still get something out of it. Otherwise, why would so many pursue it despite its imperfections?  \n\nIt’s frustrating to watch others freely explore, make mistakes, regret, have intimate conversations, go on dates, or even just buy condoms “just in case”—gaining experience all the while. People say, “Oh, but sometimes sex can be bad!” But many of us haven’t even had the chance to have sex at all, good or bad. That’s the frustration. \n\nTo all the virgins who want to claim it’s unimportant to them: I’m glad it isn’t for you. Maybe you have low libido, or dating isn’t your focus—that’s valid, and I’m happy for you. But just because you’re a virgin and don’t care doesn’t mean I have to feel the same.  \n\nTo the fatalists: Stop projecting worst-case scenarios and using your bad experiences to dissuade others. Using your story as a universal warning against sex is like telling no one to drive because you had an accident. Yes, sex can get complicated, like anything human, but that doesn’t mean we should avoid it by default or assume the worst.  \n\nAnd stop recommending prostitutes. First, it’s not legal where I live. Second, sex workers might satisfy curiosity about the act, but they can’t replicate the intimacy of someone choosing you.  \n\nTo everyone who says sex isn’t important: Would you trade places? Would you spend the rest of your life without sex, without being touched, without anyone calling you attractive? If it’s so “overrated,” why not? Would you stay in a relationship with a partner who never touches you, has sex with you, or makes sexual comments? If it’s truly irrelevant, this shouldn’t bother you. After all, if you tell me to “just focus on hobbies and friends,” you should be able to do the same to prove your point.\n\nAnd don’t hit me with, “Who says sex is overrated? No one says that!” I’m tired of hearing it in every post I make, or in others’ posts people claiming it’s “not a big deal,” “overrated,” or “no different from masturbation.” It’s a lie they don’t even believe themselves. They trot it out to comfort virgins, but in the real world, look how much energy, money, and drama people invest in sex. If it were “nothing,” why does it drive so much behavior? Sex isn’t everything, but it’s not “nothing” either.  \n\nIf sex is “overrated,” why don’t you stop seeking it? Why not live as if it doesn’t exist? Until then, your indifference just sounds like privilege disguised as wisdom.",

        "selftext": "I hate this so much. I hate myself for this. Yet… I need someone to talk to, outside my friends. I need relationship advice. I’ve never had a girlfriend, or anything serious in my life. Here goes…\n\nI am fully committed to this, so I will give my actual first name, but I will NOT give the girls their names, that would be too far.\n\nI, Alex, am an 18M currently in my senior year of high school, about to graduate soon. I am currently working on finding a way to get over a pair of “identical-ish” twins. I am a Filipino/White American nerd, whilst the girls are Filipina/Laotian (Laosian? Laos?… whatever…).\n\nThis story actually started years ago. Middle school… actually… (ouch it hurts to read this back.) In 6th grade, I was new… and mind you I was completely innocent and gullible. One thing let to another and within the first week of school I was tricked by the guys to say something inappropriate that didn’t correlate to my feelings with the girls at that time at all. During this time, I originally thought that the twins were really cool, one of them was super sweet and nice, yet an emotional storm when upset, and the other was a very sassy girl who completely destroyed anyone in her way. Total badass in my opinion. Anyways, once I hit summer in eighth grade… despite all the drama that happened to me, I… ended up being unable to forget them. Like… thinking about them, fantasizing… making up stories and scenarios… and to be honest… I think I was obsessed. \n\nThis did pick up again in early high school when I remembered that they were going to the school that shared the parking lot with mine. I go to an all boys, they go to an all girls. They have coed classes. This year,  a lot of feelings changed. I felt regret… disappointment, and… self-anger towards myself for liking them for this long. First half of senior year was horrible because I ended up having a similar situation with a different girl compared to what happened in middle school. Apparently the twins found out, and I don’t know what they did with that information. I talked to my best friend about all that I felt. I learned that the twins picked up some nasty habits and changed for the worse slightly…\n\nI still care… I kinda put everything and everyone else around me first before myself because when I was growing up, I was taught to treat everyone the way you wanted to be treated. What I didn’t learn is humanity isn’t perfect like that. Originally all I wanted was to be friends with them… but now they are stuck in my head and I wish… I really wish I could tell them everything… just spill my heart out and just… apologize for everything… and… I… I just don’t want to have a burned bridge between me and them.\n\nIf they see this… know that I’m sorry… very sorry… for all my thoughts, words, and deeds,\n\nAnd to everyone else… please… I don’t know what to do…",

        "selftext": "At just 16 years old, I’m already thinking deeply about my future. Unlike many others my age, I’ve been through a lot that’s shaped who I am today. From helping my parents and carrying the weight of their struggles to pushing through the challenges of growing up, I’ve learned that life doesn’t hand you anything on a silver platter. I’ve had to work for everything, think for others before myself, and endure a lot of stress and anger. But at the same time, I’ve developed a mindset that sets me apart.\n\nOne of the key thoughts I’ve been carrying with me is the idea that “tomorrow is always promised. Tomorrow is always there until the day you die.” This isn’t just a saying for me—it’s something I live by. To me, this quote represents both a hope and a grind. It’s not just about letting life go by without thinking; it’s about realizing that each tomorrow is a chance to push forward, to fight for something better, and to build a future.\n\nI don’t want to be rich like some people dream of — I’m not asking for millions. I just want a stable, happy life: a two-story house in the suburbs, a good car like a Porsche Cayenne, a loving wife, and kids. I want to be able to give my family a better life than what I had, to leave something behind for my future family tree, so they don’t have to struggle the way I did. It’s not about me; it’s about building something that lasts for them.\n\nUntil a few months ago, I used to think life was just about living day by day, doing whatever you want, because we all die one day. But something shifted in me. Now I see life as a journey where you have to grind and grind and grind until you make it. It might not happen today, next year, or even in ten years—but eventually, something will work out. And when it does, that’s when you can finally breathe, finally enjoy life without the weight of stress on your shoulders.\n\nPeople judge me without knowing what I’ve been through. They call me immature, but they don’t understand that while they have a “cupcake” on their plate, I have a “wedding cake” — a heavy load of responsibilities and struggles that they’ve never had to deal with. I’ve grown up too fast. I’m 15, almost 16, but my life has made me feel like I’m 20 already.\n\nI  smoke to calm the pain, but I know I’m not addicted — it’s just a way to escape the stress. Nicotine soothes my anger, though I know it’s not a solution for the long run. I’ve tried\nWhat I really want is to focus on building a future. I want to master marketing and strategy because I know that’s the way to make real money. I’ve tried dropshipping and digital marketing — nothing worked — but I’m not giving up. I want to learn how to grow businesses, sell them, and build something meaningful.\n\nI don’t see myself as a normal person. I know I have a different mindset — a sharper, more driven way of thinking that most people my age don’t have. That’s why I believe I have what it takes to be an entrepreneur. I want to create businesses, not just for money, but to secure a future for my family and to leave behind a legacy.\n\nAt the end of the day, I don’t care about fame for myself — I want my family’s name to shine. I want people to know who we are, what we built, and what we stood for. Life might be hard now, but I keep pushing because I know that tomorrow is always there. Until the day I die, I’ll keep moving forward, no matter how tough things get.",

        "selftext": "\n\nBack in December I started talking to this girl. We’ve been long distance but she’s been absolutely perfect. Shes been head over heels for me and kept telling me how good and pretty I make her feel and how lucky she is to have me in her life. She’s so loving and gentle and she has mentioned she had bipolar. \n\nThe topic has never really came up much other than she told me she doesn’t like how she is without her meds and that she becomes impulsive, and that if I ever feel a change in her I can ask if she’s taking her medication (this is important). For the last week she’s gotten more and more distant with everyday until she finally went full isolation. Thursday I texted her a long message about how much I appreciate her and she said “aww that’s cause you’re the best guy in the world” and throughout the day she got progressively dryer\n\nI gave her space cause I thought she might need it but later that day she asked me why I haven’t reached out all day. I told her I didn’t know what she needed and I thought she might need space. Ever since then she won’t talk to me, it’s always one word replies. I asked her if she loves me and she said she doesn’t know, I asked her if she’s talking her medication and she said “why does it matter?” Which is so out of character for her because she gave me permission to ask\n\nI broke down last night and told her I’ve been trying so hard to get answers and I’ve been crying non stop. She finally told me “I never meant to hurt you”. And then she said “I told you I had bipolar but you still decided to stay, and now I’ve made you upset” and I told her I still loved her and she said he needed to explain to me but she just can’t. Later last night I sent her a long loving text and she said “I’m sorry about all this”. She’s slowly opening up but not fully. Is this bipolar? She made a promise to me that she’d always be honest and tell me if she wanted to end things, so I’m trusting her promise\n\n",

        "selftext": "Early on, before we had actually started dating, she did mention she liked to post lewds on occasion (and even asked my permission to do so). Talking about it, she told me that she didn't post nudes and that it was more of a confidence thing for her. I said I was fine with it, so long as it was just lewds. Later on, when we were officially together, it came up again and I added the condition that it had to be sent to me first, and that I had the power to veto anything I wasn't comfortable posting. She agreed with no argument.\n\nThis hasn't been something she does often. We've been together and she's only posted a few times, and the couple times I did veto a pic she didn't complain or argue. I truly do believe she respects and values my feelings about this.\n\nThe first time she posted something (before we were actually dating) it was a bit... odd. Not really unpleasant, but not necessarily something I enjoyed. \n\nWhen she posted while we were together, I knew that I would not be okay with her doing this forever. At some point, if the relationship was to continue, I would need her to stop. I wanted to give it time. I didn't want to go up to her and say \"we've been together a couple months, time to add some new boundaries!\"\n\nThe most recent time she posted, I knew I wasn't happy with waiting longer. I felt I had to talk with her and let her know my feelings on it had changed.\n\nAnd I feel guilty about it. I do love her and want to out her happiness first. She also does have terrible self esteem and is extremely insecure about her body, so I can absolutely believe that she does it to help with her confidence. And a part of me wants to believe that if it helps her *in any way* to see herself and her body more positively that this is a necessary evil.\n\nBut I'm not okay with it continuing. I don't like the idea of her posting more lewds, and I want her to stop.\n\nAnd I don't even expect an argument from her! When we first talked about it she told me that, even if I said \"no\" she'd still choose pursuing a relationship with me over finding someone who is okay with her posting lewds.\n\nPaet of me expects her reaction to be apologizing for posting them. I almost expect her to be holding back her own tears of guilt for making me uncomfortable. And that just makes me feel even more guilty. I fear that I'm going to hurt her because I want to put myself over her feelings.\n\nI'm not interested in hearing \"I would never date *anyone* who even thought about doing that while dating me!\" Or \"bro, that was a major red flag. You should have ran when she asked you\" or anything like that.\n\nAnd I already know that I need to talk with her, and potentially end the relationship if she's unwilling to accept this boundary. I plan on doing it end of the week at the latest.\n\n",

Two years later in 2019 I finally got it and started looking for work; I had renewed my cosmetology license once during that time.\n\nMost of the salons I found wanted years of experience and skills which I didn’t have. I found a few salons that said no experience necessary and applied to those. I got three interviews: two in person and one over the phone. The in person salons rejected me because I had no experience; I turned down the phone salon because I was going to be by myself and knew I wasn’t skilled enough for that yet. I tried other salons and didn’t even get interviewed.\n\nI eventually decided to try and find a part time job. I looked for months and only got one interview, a month after I applied, for a cashier position. They were so desperate I was hired on the spot.\n\nThat was in November 2019.\n\nThen March 2020 happened.\n\nI didn’t bother looking for a job during that time. The next time I looked was 2022. All the jobs I found wanted years of experience, were two hours away at $10/hr, in the next state over (where I’m not allowed to work), want licenses I don’t have, or some combination of. Month after month it was the same.\n\nI tweaked my resume every way I could think of: saying I was a student, saying I had no experience, only searching for salons in my state or in certain areas. Nothing worked. I even tried looking for internships; every single one said I had to be unlicensed and in school.\n\nNow it’s 2025. Everyone, even great clips, wants experience. I’ve given up. No one would take me now. Nearly eight years of no experience? No thank you! And even if someone would take me on they would have to hold my hand like it was my first day of school. Who even knows if what I learned in school is even relevant anymore? Would I even be useful in a salon now? And what clients would want someone like me doing their hair anyway? I surely wouldn’t. I’ll take the new grad thank you! At least their skills are relevant.\n\nSo I let my license expire on the 10th.\n\nTwo years of studying down the drain. Nearly $1000 down the drain. Nearly eight years of being licensed and what do I have to show for it? Rejections, expired unused licenses, and salons that require five years of experience, multiple skill sets from different beauty licenses, and existing clientele.\n\nI’m done.",

        "selftext": "As the title says, my (going through a divorce) dad has been dating a woman of 22 years old for eight months now. She is younger than me by a bit, but we aren't certain of her true age. Her passport said she was 18 last year, but my dad said they lied about her age because 18 is easier to get into a country (???) (Visa issues? Idk. I can't wrap my head around an 18 year old GIRL dating my dad. He first said she was in her 30's, which is a bold faced lie.) This is obviously weird to me. I don't mind the woman, and I understand some women are attracted to older men (although there is a clear money incentive here, he pays her to be with him per month, paid for her passport etc.). \n\nBesides the pretty extreme age gap, to me, is also his sexual interests. He gave me his iPad recently as he got a new one. I opened safari and my dad didn't even bother to clear his history (to be honest I don't think he knows how to), the tabs were still open. All of them had titles of 'teenage girl does X Y Z.' or 'Barely legal does X Y Z'. You get what I'm saying. Listen. I get that men get urges, and that young girls probably look attractive. But for some reason I can't stop thinking about this. I can't stop worrying that maybe he looks at me in a similar way. Before all this he would sometimes joke that I should be his wife (when we did shopping or anything mundane really.). A lady once thought I was his wife, which was an insult to me I guess?? lol? but my dad just smiled and said, \"If only!\". The girlfriend has the same style as me, music taste, and even some piercings. I'm not sure if thats just a generational thing or something he actively looked for.\n\nWhen I was going through puberty and still getting used to my body I wasn't very touchy with anyone in my family. But my dad would always insist on hugs and kisses, even after I said no and that it makes me uncomfortable. I couldn't argue for my point because I'm his daughter - of course he should be allowed to hug me etc! So I just kind of sucked it up. There were also countless times where he barged into the bathroom or my room, without knocking. He has probably seen me countless times in the shower. He walks around his house naked too, which I have told him repeatedly I don't like and to please put on some clothes?? His hugs last too long and I just feel really uncomfortable with him. Before I thought it was just me and that I was the one who had a problem - but now I'm wondering if he crossed some lines? I have a younger sister who is around 18. Haven't talked to her yet about any of this or her own experiences.\n\nWhat's worse, the girlfriend has a four year old child (teen pregnancy) and he treats her (X) like his own daughter. But there are some weird things. For example, X frequently sleeps in the same bed as my dad and his girlfriend because she can't sleep otherwise. Thats fine with me, I probably also climbed into bed after a nightmare! Except they engage in sex on the same bed, and when I reacted with disbelief he said \"Well X is asleep.\" I highly doubt X can actually sleep through all that, but it's stranger to me to even think of sex when I have a child so nearby...? There's probably a lot more that he hasn't let slip, and most things I find out by accident on his part (sex toys in his gallery when I was trying to send a photo of us on our day out to my own phone is just one of many times I've accidentally stumbled on something I did NOT want to see.) He is just a weird guy in general, cheated on my mom countless times - even when I was just born. Has no close friends. I feel bad for him most of the time.\n\nI'm just worried and have a lot on my plate (moving houses, getting through my masters, helping my mom with the divorce, etc.) so I don't have time to unpack all this. if there is even something to unpack.   I'm adding a flair for NSFW for obvious reasons and sexual assault because a child might be involved. feels nice to just type this out. ",

        "selftext": "Sorry if there are any typos, I'm writing this on my phone in the dark.\n\nI (15F) have been struggling with insecurities for as long as I can remember. About my weight, face, height, teeth and hair. I think it's because of my older sister  as she used to make fun of my appearance even in front of her friends.\n\nMy hatred towards my body has left me very sensitive, it's important to note that my mother died when I was younger so that also adds to my sensitivity. So it does happen for me to overthink every comment made about my body or anyone who looks like me in any way, shape or form. And because of that, I tend to cry a lot. And my sister still makes the same remarks and insults after years of seeing how much I don't like my body.\n\nThis evening, we were having dinner in front of the TV when my dad got up to wash the dishes. The series we were watching had a shot of a talkie walkie in the intro and my sister said that I was built like the object. It got to me and my dad saw it when I brought him the dirty dishes in the kitchen and asked why I was pissed. I said \"nothing\" because I knew if I told him why he would either tell me that she didn't mean it, or tell me to \"just ignore her\" like he always does. He started telling me how I need to \"stop acting like this\".\n\nI went back to my seat and started crying so I left to my room to cry in peace. I heard my dad yell from the kitchen how I was so sensitive and emotional and how I always just get outbursts and strat crying over nothing.\nMy sister then came to \"apologize\" saying that \"not everything is about (my) weight\", like she did when I got pissed off earlier at the table. I told her to leave me alone and she did, after saying: \"well, I tried to comfort you, I did what I had to do.\"\nThen she came back telling me to join them and when I told her to leave she told me I was overreacting and that \"it's not that deep\".\n\nAnd now as I'm writing this, I hear them joke around and laugh in the living room like one of them didn't body shame me and the one one didn't yell at me for showing emotions.\n\nAnd it's not the first time something like this happens. You can tell that she's the favourite if you were living with us, the way he talks to her, the way he treats her and her friends, the way he respects her boundaries and not mine, the way it feels like he's TRYING to make me uncomfortable with the \"jokes\" he makes about me and my guy friends.\n\nI feel like I'm not loved and I can't help but wonder that maybe if my mom was still alive, he wouldn't traet me like that or that she'd stand up for me. I can't wait for when I turn 18 and leave. I've been living this for so much and sometimes I don't even wanna live anymore.\n\nBut it pains me to think of my father and sister like that. I keep telling myself that they're good people, and sometimes they are but I feel their hatred overshadows their love for me and I'm honestly done.\n\nI've thought about writing here so many times because I truly have no one to talk to in real life. I don't feel like my bff would get it since her parents love her a lot and last time I told her about a \"fight\" I had with my dad, she took his side.\n\nI don't know what to do, please help me with anything, I'm tired feeling like an obstacle in their lives.\n",

I get lucky if we have sex every 2 weeks, but mostly it's every 3 to 6 weeks of waiting. Then I'll complain and a few days later he does initiate.  I think I'm emotionally drained from this repeating cycle and have no idea what to do.

He has been tested and it did come back low but he needs to take a second test. We still show each other affection hugs, kisses, and spend time together. I just feel stuck in this area and don't know how else to show him how much this is bothering me. I don't initiate anymore because he'd turn me down so many times and that started to hurt.

Recently, there have been 2 new hires at the company I work at. Let’s call them Tyler (31M) and Sam (not sure what age but I assume also around 30). We had a happy hour about a month ago and I hit it off with the both of them. I noticed that the both of them were kind of flirty with me. However, I particularly got close to Tyler. He was opening up to me about his life. At first I found it a little strange because he dropped a lot of information on me so early on. Over the past few years, he’s lost several family members and told me his struggles with alcohol. I was there to support him and invited him to an event. That went really well, and we ended up hooking up, which might’ve not been the best choice, given that we work together. However last week, he asked me to grab a drink with him in the morning and I said no, because it would be a bad look to be drinking on the job. I met up with Sam, the other new hire after work that day and he knew what was going on with Tyler as well. Sam also mentioned that he has a girlfriend, which I was shocked to hear. Tyler asked me to hang out this week but I’ve been hanging low and trying to dodge him a bit. How do I proceed? Should I confront Tyler? I just don’t want to create a toxic work environment for all parties involved. ",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons. \n\nWhen I was 14, I unfortunately had unrestricted internet access. I ended up on Omegle and met a guy who was 20 at the time. I lied and told him I was 18. We really clicked, exchanged Snapchats, and talked for a while. \n\n&gt; fucked up bad on my part, i know. \n\nAbout a couple months later (another fuck up), I started feeling guilty and told him the truth about my age. He rightfully freaked out and cut off contact immediately.\n\nFast forward almost a decade, I’m now 23 and obtaining my master’s degree. I was visiting a local museum when I thought I saw him. I wasn’t 100% sure it was him at first, so I made casual eye contact a couple of times before pulling the ole, “Hey, sorry, but you look really familiar—do we know each other?” We ended up catching up, exchanged numbers, and started talking again.\n\nWe got along just as well as we did back then (except this time, I was actually an adult). After a while, we went on a date, and now we’ve been seeing each other for almost a year.\n\nHere’s the problem: when I was 13, I told my mom about him. I had lied to her about his age (because I thought I was in love and didn’t want her to shut it down), so she remembers details about him. Obviously, she was protective back then, but since nothing ever happened, it eventually became a weird teenage memory.\n\nI really like this guy. I think I see a future with him. But how do I tell my mom that I reconnected with the same guy I “fell for” as a naive 13-year-old? Do I just tell her the truth and hope for the best?",

        "selftext": "TL;DR: I have a deeply magnetic connection with a close friend that feels like it transcends labels. We’ve spent countless hours talking, traveled together, and shared moments that feel intimate and meaningful—but she’s also in a relationship with someone else. She never explicitly confirmed or denied our interactions as “dates” but always showed up. I don’t know if I’m caught in limerence, if we’re karmically connected, or if she’s just enjoying my presence while keeping me at arm’s length for her own reasons. Looking for nuanced perspectives.\n\nI 28 F, met my friend 33 F, at an event back in 2021, and from the moment we met, we clicked. There was an instant pull—long, deep conversations, effortless understanding, and a sense of recognition that felt beyond just surface attraction.\n\nWe texted innocuous surface level conversations for the first few months, just checking on each others’ mental health. (We were both working in different places overseas for the first few months right after meeting.)\n\nOur first real hangout, almost a year after meeting briefly, was accidental but lasted hours and hours—the kind of deep connection that makes time disappear. When I saw her again… it felt like we were the only two people in the room. The second she saw me, I was instantly greeted with that familiar warm, joyous energy. When we locked eyes, I can’t explain it fully, it just felt like “A knowing” of sorts. I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone part a crowd like that to get to me. When we embraced, it felt familiar. Like coming home after a long work trip to see someone who loves you has made your favorite meal, run you a bath with a nice glass of wine, lit a few candles, and groovy lo-fi playing in the back. Just grateful to be home to peace. \n\nWe did not have plans to hang… but after embracing, we were inseparable. As the festival was getting rowdy, I and my group of friends decided to Uber to a local bar closer to our apartment downtown. Guess who came with us 😏. While in the bar we get some food and drinks. As I’m about to pay she slaps my hand and pays for us and my friends… NGL, turn on! \n\nIn hindsight this next interaction has made me really consider that she may just be using me for my top tier attention. One of my friends had invited a few acquaintances to join us… one of these new people was kind of flirting with me. I wasn’t paying it any attention other than just being polite. The girl I’m enamored with is looking at me almost like a piece of meat at this point. But we have been exclusively flirting all night and she’s also a bit tipsy now. So I just give her a wink and she returns my wink with a blushed, coy smile. Dude, I’m already in “super Like” at this point. My brain is playing out our whole lives at this point. Probably the Cancer in me 😒🙄🫠\n\nAs I’m having conversations with my friend I hear the woman I like talking to the acquaintance. She was telling the acquaintance how amazing and smexy she thinks I am. And then she turns to catch my gaze while talking to the acquaintance and says CLEAR as DAY AND SAID “I’m going to f*** the sh** out of her fine ass.” It felt like a claim, a moment of possession, but also a test—would I react? Would I take it seriously? Aside from that comment, the entire evening before and after that moment was very different. After ditching our buddies we spent hours of alone time in front of a local lake discussing our pasts, hopes, dreams, and plans for our individual futures… and indulging in adult beverages. LOTS of things unfolded, all initiated by her; PG-13 of course. First intimate moments moments, IMO, should be more sober. Plus, I’m a lover girl. That kind of push-pull dynamic has defined our connection ever since.\n\nWe continued spending time together, going on what felt like dates—me calling them dates, her never rejecting the term but also never confirming. She’d set things up, invite me, and treat me with a level of attention and care that felt… more than friendship. The reciprocal level of attention was intense and intriguing for me. \n\nThen came a moment of clarity—or maybe just contradiction.\n\nDuring one of our late-night conversations, she said she would never date a woman again.\n\nThat confused me because… well, what is this then? Our dynamic has never felt strictly platonic. There have been intimate moments—not just emotional intimacy but physical closeness, moments that felt like desire but were never fully acted on. If it were just friendship, why did she never establish clear boundaries? Why did she let the connection continue in such an ambiguous way?\n\n\nThe Complication: The Other Person\n\nI later found out (not through her, but through context clues) that she had been actively dating AT LEAST one other person the whole time. That alone might not have been a huge deal—people can have multiple connections—but what struck me was that she never openly talked about them with me unless it was to tell me vaguely about how the person she was seeing possessed some quality that she first noticed in me and admired and enjoyed. Like, what is the point of comparing our qualities… Is this somehow now girl talk? And if so, why is it important to point out similarities between us?\n\nRecently, she asked me if I was seeing anyone, and I mentioned that I wanted to focus on securing some additional certifications and pay down the debt on my home, before settling down. The irony? I only found out about her boyfriend being a serious option as her partner from her recent birthday invitation, where his name was listed. Odd, I know EVERYONE else by name on this invite list. I looked him up (yeah, maybe I shouldn’t have), and there were years’ worth of occasional pictures with the together, but she never once shared a photo with me. Though these photos appear to be platonic and sporadic until as of late… which is when I suppose they made it more official.\n\nPersonally this (whatever our relationship is) has helped me discover parts of myself that I’m truly grateful for. In the past few months, I’ve released the need to feel needed. This girl has sparked some self healing I didn’t know could happen… and that’s why I feel ok being friends and not considering a future together… “if you love someone or something, let it go…” I am grateful to be here. When she talks about him, she seems happy, so I’m happy. At the end of the day, I do love her… but I know I love myself more. And that has made all the difference. \n\nHowever sometimes when she talks about him it’s oddly detached—like a relationship based on logic, stability, and cultural alignment rather than passion. She has in the past said she prefers dating within her race for financial and cultural reasons, but this guy is not of that background. I KNOW people can change and evolve, so while I was taken aback by this seemingly 180 degree switch, I just accepted that was her new normal. When I asked why she chose him, she basically said he worships her and is obsessed with her culture—which makes her feel safe.\n\nIt’s weird because I know her to be fiercely independent, dominant, and controlling in her relationships. Though us together. It’s yin and yang. When she’s right, she’s right, and I have been given that same respect. We laugh, have deep expansive conversations, travel to far adventurous places and just do life together. We are so in tune that we often do or say exactly what the other person needs with no prior conversation. We have solved so many problems together, I cannot even begin to list them all. \n\nWith him, it sounds like she plays a more passive role—letting him adore her while keeping a level of emotional separation where she still may hold the power dynamic (not sure since we rarely talk about him) They’re moving in together this month… and he is basically in charge of finding and securing their apartment. Though in contrast, he does provide additional and cherished emotional and financial support. Which is a stark contrast to what she has been used too based on the relationships she’s told me about in the past. For that, I am truly thankful. \n\n\nSo… What Is This Relationship, Really?\n\nAt this point, I feel like I’m oscillating between different interpretations of what’s happening here.\n\n🔹 Is this Limerence?\nAm I just caught up in a psychological/emotional fixation because she represents something I deeply crave? The connection is so intense, but I wonder if I’m just projecting meaning onto someone who enjoys my energy but isn’t actually choosing me.\n\n🔹 Is this a Past-Life or Karmic Connection?\nThe instant familiarity, the pull, the unspoken communication—it feels like something deeper. Have we done this before? Are we tied together in some way that needs resolution? If so, what’s the lesson I’m supposed to learn?\n\n🔹 Is she Using Me for Emotional Validation?\nDoes she just like how I make her feel, knowing I offer depth, care, and emotional nourishment? Am I her safe space, the person she keeps around because I feed her soul in a way her partner doesn’t?\n\n🔹 Is This Just a Situationship Where She Holds the Power?\nShe initiates the dynamic but never gives it full clarity. She lets me feel special but never too special. She pulls me in but keeps an emotional firewall. I often feel like I’m giving way more energy than I receive—not because she’s cruel, but because she enjoys my presence without needing to give me certainty in return.\n\n\nWhat I Know For Sure (What I Don’t Need Help With)\n\n✔ I’m not delusional—I know something is real here.\n✔ I am grateful for the relationship, even if it’s complicated.\n✔ I have grown and learned about myself from this connection.\n✔ I don’t need her, but I deeply value what we’ve shared.\n✔ I no longer feel jealous about her dating someone else—it’s more about understanding what I am to her.\n\n\n\nWhat I’m Still Wondering…\n\n🔹 Does this connection have the potential to evolve into something more? Or is it destined to remain undefined?\n🔹 How do I get clarity from her without forcing a conversation that she doesn’t want to have?\n🔹 Am I meant to walk away, or is there still something valuable to gain from this relationship?\n🔹 How do I protect my own energy while still appreciating what we have?\n\n\nIf You’ve Been in a Similar Situation, How Did You Navigate It?\n\nI know this is long and layered, but if you’ve read this far, I appreciate you. I’m looking for honest, thoughtful responses—whether that’s insight into limerence, past-life bonds, emotional power dynamics, or your own similar experiences.\n\n🔥 Have you ever had a connection that felt magnetic but undefined?\n🔥 How did you know when to lean in vs. when to let go?\n🔥 How do you get clarity from someone who thrives on keeping things unspoken?\n\nThanks in advance for your perspectives.\n\n",

        "selftext": "I need to get this off my chest. I lied to my ex  for our entire relationship, and I don’t know what to feel about it. \n\nEx and I met when I was 12. We were friends for a while, but eventually, he made me uncomfortable—constantly pushing boundaries and asking for things he had no right to ask for. I was struggling mentally, so instead of confronting him, I blocked him.\n\nFast forward to January 2024. I reached out to him again. I don’t know why. Nostalgia? Curiosity? Either way, I found him easily—he never changed his Instagram username. When he asked why I had disappeared, I lied. I told him my account had been deleted because my mom found out about the pictures I sent. He believed me, and we never spoke about it again.\n\nWe started talking regularly, and he invited me to his Discord server, where I met some amazing people. However, Jack got into drama—he had a falling out with friends over accusations that he had manipulated another girl. That should have been my cue to walk away, but I took his side.\n\nEventually, he and I, along with a few others—including a friend I’ll call Adam—moved to a separate server. Ex became my closest friend, and soon after, we started dating. I never told him the real reason I blocked him years ago.\n\nWe dated for ten months, and it was a mess. He cheated on me in the first month. He cried, begged, and I forgave him. He was controlling but also obsessive. He made everything about intimacy, introduced me to people he wanted me to be involved with, then got jealous when I just wanted to be friends. He even asked me to rate explicit photos of others—then got mad when I actually did.\n\nThings got worse. In September 2024, my childhood cat passed away. As someone who is autistic, this was devastating—my cat had been my comfort since I was two, even helping me through panic attacks. At first, Ex was supportive. But then came: *“You’re still sad?”* *“Why aren’t you over it?”*\n\nA little while later, I made a new social media account to share my art. That’s when he lost it. He accused me of violating his boundaries and broke up with me.\n\nI thought that was the end. But two months later, he started sending me money, asking me to unblock him. I did. He apologized. We didn’t officially get back together, but he acted like we were—calling me pet names, asking me to put his name in my bio. I refused. He kept pushing.\n\nBy January 2025, I was done. I told him it was over for good. He asked me to block him, so I did. Everywhere.\n\nAnd honestly? I want to say I'm relieved but this is something I think of constantly.",

        "selftext": "\nApologies if this is just a really dumb question. For a little backstory, I met this friend of mine on an internet chat room when I was 19 and he was 42. We quickly formed a sexual relationship over the phone which we both got a lot of enjoyment out of. Within the first few days of us talking, he was fawning over me, telling me I was the most amazing girl he’d ever met, that he couldn’t believe I was real, that I’m absolutely gorgeous and beautiful, that he was literally falling in love with me. He told me he loved me within a couple weeks of us talking. \nIn addition to this, he was trying to push me to do things on camera, over the phone and participate in dirty talk/fantasies I was not comfortable with. I declined on multiple occasions and made it clear I wasn’t into what he was asking of me. He was relentless. He pushed and pushed and pushed. Every time we’d call he’d pressure me into saying certain things and acting certain ways that I wanted nothing to do with. This was so long ago that I can’t remember the exact timeline, but I was on the phone with him one night after maybe a few weeks of us talking. He asked me again to do things I didn’t want to do, and I said no again. He snapped at me and verbally pushed me so much with his tone and language and his begging and pressuring that I finally gave in and did what he wanted, and said the things he wanted me to say. When we finished he said “Gotcha.” I remember feeling so much; mainly I felt a little sick to my stomach. \nThis was five years ago. Since this, I’ve basically given into his every whim sexually. I’ve just let him tell me what to do and basically done it with little protest. If I do protest I just end up feeling guilty, and he ends up feeling bad. I’m 24 now; I’ll be 25 in a couple months. We still talk every day and have phone sex that I’m not entirely comfortable with regularly. The issue is, now sometimes I like it and sometimes I don’t. I’ve never been able to figure out if this is my fault or not. I know the age gap is large, but we met on a shady website for sexual arrangements. We’ve never met in person despite being extremely personal and close with each other, telling each other we love each other all the time for five years, so how much could he really have been “forcing me” if I could have just hung up the phone? I know 19 is young, but I was a legal adult looking for phone sex online, so it’s not like he did anything illegal. He did say that when we first started talking, he thought I was lying about my age and was a little bit younger than 19 which I realize is concerning. I realize our relationship now is probably unhealthy and we’ve bonded in ways that are not normal, but the emotion I have towards this man is undeniable. \n At this point I don’t even know if I’ll care if he did something wrong to me because of how strong the love I have for him is. I realize this sounds ridiculous, I know I sound like an idiot. We met at an odd, vulnerable time in my life and I don’t know if he took advantage of that or not but I know it had to have some affect on the way our relationship has played out. We still talk every day, have phone sex regularly and are very close. I have discussed this at length in therapy and at this point I just really need someone to tell me, flat out, if he is in the wrong or not. If he took advantage of me, or if that’s impossible because it was all over the phone and not a legitimate relationship. I know i sound pathetic. Please go easy on me and just tell me your opinion if you have one. \n",

Telling people, asking for help, trying to help myself instead of just shutting down and letting autopilot take over—even just sitting with it is hard enough, at that point any little thing is enough to tip the scale or topple it altogether. \n\nThe problem is I work in customer service, so I’m a verbal punching bag to the customers, management micromanages like their lives depend on it, higher ups making changes and not even bothering to do a test run that lasts longer than a week to iron out any kinks and fix any bugs that show up. Needless to say, I have been taking advantage of both PTO and VTO,  and while that helps my mental health immensely it’s very bad for my bank account and all the things I need to pay for to survive. \n\nI’m so mad, upset and overwhelmed that I can’t even be happy that I’ve lost a bunch of weight. I’ve lost ~40-50 pounds in the last several months, maybe even as much as 75 (I wasn’t keeping track at first, so I’m not sure). I’m so fucking proud of myself, for losing the weight and sticking with it (like working out even when it’s the last thing I want to do), but now none of my pants, underwear, or bras fit anymore. \n\nI want to be really proud and celebrate the accomplishment, I haven’t been this weight in maybe 7-10 years and have been working hard on it, but instead I’m upset because my clothes don’t fit anymore and I can’t afford to get myself new clothes that fit this new me. I have like 2 pairs of leggings that are the size I need, everything else is now 2-3 sizes too big, falling down and don’t even have a belt for my jeans. Literally none of my bras fit me; I only have one bra because it didn’t fit my mom and so she said I could have it. \n\nI don’t want to put any weight back on, but I can’t just go on with my day to day life if all my clothes are falling off of me. I think I’ll have to put some back on just so I can wear pants. I don’t want to, but new clothes, even from a thrift store, are a luxury I can’t afford right now.

        "selftext": "Throwaway account. 34M. Sorry for the rambling that is about to happen.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've been in several long-term relationships since my mid 20s which all failed for a variety of reasons. Typical reasons like career moves which meant relocating and the other person not wanting to move, loss of feelings, etc. The constants in my life though, were my closest friends and family. I knew I could go visit my family after a break-up to help cheer me up. My best friends and I live in separate parts of the country so we stay connected through online gaming. When I'd be in a relationship, the amount of gaming I did with them dropped off but never completely. And when those relationships ended I knew I had my buds waiting for me to get my mind off the broken relationship or whatever.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs I've compiled failed relationships I've grown worried and nervous for my future. That I'd be alone forever, never get married, never have kids, etc. But during those periods of single life, I took my freedom for granted. I could do whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I didn't appreciate it enough. I got too caught up in chasing family life.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow, I'm with someone and we're engaged. They have kids from a previous marriage and they're with us most of the time. We have one of our own on the way. We recently bought a new house that I'm not thrilled about. Mostly because of how much we paid for what we're getting. When we got engaged I was excited. When I found out I was going to have my own child I was excited. I love my partner very much and I love the children very much as well. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut for some reason, the last few months have been tremendously hard on me. I'm sure it's all the changes happening and the feeling that I have no escape - because I don't. I can't just break up and find my own place like I did in the past. I feel stuck, despite my feelings for my family. I miss my single life and being able to do what I wanted and answering to no one. Going to work, coming home, eating whatever I wanted and playing games or going for a beer or whatever. It was totally up to me. Now I'm a slave in my own house. I go to work to pay the bills which is never ending. I can't use any of that money for my own hobbies or interests. No more deciding on a whim that I want to take a long weekend and travel somewhere. No more unwinding after a long day of work because being at home with kids is also work. By the time the kids are in bed, my partner wants us time which to be honest, sometimes I just want my own time. And sometimes I do get it but not as often as I'd like. Probably selfish of me but it's the truth. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm getting everything I wished for when I was single and desperately swiping on dating apps, and now I regret it. I was too anxious about my future that I was blind to the true happiness I was experiencing. If I was given a no strings attached choice to go back to single life, I would take it. I feel guilty for admitting it but it's the truth. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI suppose I'm looking for encouragement, but right now it feels like nothing anyone says will make me feel better. Thanks for listening.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTL:DR;\n\nI was desperate for companionship and a family while I was single that I didn't realize that I was the happiest version of myself when I was on my own. Now that I'm a stepparent and about to be a real parent, it's hitting me hard and I wish I could get my old single life back.",

And I'm now worried that I'm going to \"go down\" like the rest of them.\n\nGot a message from someone I dont work with but used to, called Bob. We have a great relationship and we catch up still. Each of us can't stand and have never trusted person zero. However, person Zero does still go and see person Bob every two weeks, just at the door because Zero picks up weed from Bob. \n\nI had a message from Bob saying Zero was fuming about me and rambling about how I've lost him his job (I didnt, he done that himself, he wrote what he wrote, not me) etc... but he is going to take me down with him (Zero apparently turned up, way of his head on some drugs). Talking about how he has Zilla onside to take on me too, basically take on the floor she works on to get me down.\n\nBobs chatting with his neighbour now to see if his ring doorbell caught his rambling, hopefully it'll help me.\n\nWhat isn't helping me. Is the lovely older gentleman assigned to the investigation in ER, knows NOTHING about technology. He showed me a picture that I had apparently taken and claimed to be one off the people I had a good relationship with. I obviously didn't take this photo, and it's been edited to look like it was received through a chat. I asked him to reverse image search it etc... he wouldnt and didn't understand, I got annoyed, took a photo of the screen he was sharing and found it was a picture from a forum post like 5 years ago! But wouldn't accept it, because \"you can't fake generate chats\". Later when I shared my screen I went to Google and literally googled *fake \"put favourite chat app name here\"  message maker*, and theirs hundreds!!\n\nFantastic.\n\nWhat a shit show.\n\nDecided I'd look into just jumping the sinking ship but unfortunately in my role even if I left it they'd require a degree to go back into it now which I don't have, and the same role elsewhere wants one. So may have to just bite the bullet and take something random for now at a huge pay cut. But then I'm worried it'll look like I'm guilty to those I had a good relationship with, not to mention I'm worried I may never be able to build my bridges with them now.\n\nOh, and not to mention how one of the people involved were immediately fired after I reported it because of their involvement being the most excessive, but everyone in team loved them and thought they were sweet and so not happy I lost them their job.\n\nGod. I feel like I'm coming out worse in this. But I want to trust the process. I keep telling everyone i don't know anything, talking like ER told me to, but it's preventing me defending myself.\n\nJesus, quick moan over. Back to the grind now. Don't report anything at work! If the apple cart hasn't tipped, dont push it. All I'm learning is that this is a hot mess you don't want to be a part of. Just keep quite and keep clear of anything. If something bad is discovered, fantastic it's dealt with and you're not involved, be happy. If it isn't discovered, everyone's still happily not wise to it and you can still be happy.\n\n",

        "selftext": "\\*\\*Edit\\*\\*   \n Its all happened between 2017 - lets say 2020 / 2021  \nI lost my love for him and I needed to learn to love him again. Something inside of me never stopped believing that we can get through it. When we first meet in real life I just knew I wanted to be with him.  \nHe now works as a optician shop assistant.  \n  \nFirst off, my husband (25M) and I (25M) have known each other for nearly 14 years. We got married in 2022, and I love him deeply. We have a strong bond.\n\nWe now have a relationship stronger than ever, but sometimes esp. now that I am at my lowest these thoughts come creeping in.  \nI definitely not regret having him..just would make things differently if it makes sense  \n\\*\\*\n\nWe're both FTM (Female to Male transgender) and have gone through our transitions together. My husband started his transition at 16, while I began in my early twenties. Due to PTSD, I had shut myself off from feelings of being \"wrong\" for a long time before finally starting my transition.\n\nI moved in with my husband's family when I was 17 because my mother left the country, and my father—who was a gambling addict and had many women—did not provide a stable home. So, I took the chance to leave.\n\nAt first, it was tough living together in such a small space—just a 20m² room, his childhood bedroom. I went from total isolation to suddenly being part of a family of five.\n\nFast-forward a bit—my husband was manipulated by his family and ended up developing a severe eating disorder (anorexia nervosa). Meanwhile, I was slowly starting to figure myself out and attending therapy for my PTSD. What made things worse for him was that he was an undiagnosed autistic man who couldn't understand or process his emotions. The early years of his transition only intensified these struggles. He was constantly overwhelmed, couldn’t give me the space I needed, and often shut down completely.\n\nWe were both damaged teenagers—just 18 years old—without a real understanding of the world or ourselves.\n\nI fought alongside him through his transition and worked for his family's acceptance of him. When he started spiraling into anorexia, I was attending a really good school that my dad had enrolled me in. But because of my own mental health struggles and the start of my own transition, I started missing school more often.\n\nI drove him almost daily to a lecture class he was taking to improve his job and school qualifications (since he had missed a lot of regular school due to mental health issues). I skipped my own classes for him while he was letting go of everything. Eventually, I got him admitted to a mental hospital to treat his anorexia. At his lowest, he was 1.58m tall and weighed only 38kg.\n\nHe was allowed to come home on weekends but had to return to the hospital at night. I rarely saw him, and I became sick myself. I didn’t know what to do—I had no friends, and my family wouldn’t have taken me back.\n\nLuckily, we found a way forward, and I was able to help him recover. I monitored his eating habits, carefully helped him through the ups and downs, and cooked food that wouldn’t make him nauseous. It took us over a year to bring him back to health—it was like learning to walk all over again.\n\nThat year, I missed even more school, which meant I had to repeat a grade. Because of that, I lost my chance at earning a master’s degree or an engineering title. I graduated with good grades, but I didn’t qualify for higher-level jobs.\n\nRecently, I was diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my shoulder, meaning I can no longer work as a painter. I feel like I’m at my limit. I keep rethinking everything—if I could go back, I would take better opportunities, get him professional help sooner, and make sure I secured my own future.\n\nI know I’m only 25 and still have my life ahead of me, but careers start young. Now that I’m jobless, I’m trying hard to market myself to at least get a decent job.\n\nI also know that without me, my husband wouldn’t be here today. But sometimes, I regret sacrificing so much for him. I always joke that if you're unlucky in gambling, you’re lucky in love—since we have a strong relationship and will celebrate 10 years together in 2026. But I regret missing out on so much in my youth—not being able to go out, either because of my PTSD or because I couldn’t leave my husband alone.\n\nThe worst part for me is that I always promised him I’d build a home where he’d be safe from his family’s toxic traits. But after everything I’ve lost, I don’t know if I can fulfill that promise anymore.\n\nSometimes, I wonder if I would be better off with a partner who had better mental health. But then, how could I even think that? He was always the one person who stood by me, who wanted me in his life. My own family treated me like a burden—something to be moved around, something unwanted. My mother even told me to my face that she had wanted to put me up for adoption when I was five.\n\nI’m so exhausted. I just want stability—a decent job, enough money to pay the bills without constantly worrying about groceries. I want to build a good life for us.",

        "selftext": "I don't know what I'm trying to say or why but this is something that's suddenly been constantly pestering me for days.\n\nI come from a dysfunctional family. My father is abusive to my mother and she stayed in this marriage only because he had the means to give me a better life and future. He is not abusive towards me as long as I live by his patriarch rules.\n\nI AM grateful for the opportunities and support, whether it be financially from my father or emotionally from my mother, that I've got through years and still getting. But throughout these years I feel like SOMETHING INSIDE ME DIED A LONG TIME AGO. \n\nFrom a very young age I developed a distaste for any kind of relationship with men that goes beyond platonic boundaries. I'm 24 years old but I've NEVER been in love or had a relationship. I've once developed a crush at 14 but didn't pursue it due to my body insecurities, but most importantly due to fear of what a man in a relationship would be like. \n\nI see girls at my age dreaming about ideal man, life in relationship or after marriage.....you know the usual, but I could never imagine myself in a real life scenario like that. If I do imagine, its only through a fantasy perspective with the safety of knowledge that it's something that would never happen. I am a virgin and have healthy sexual appetite, but I cannot imagine myself having sex with another man. It feels horrifying. I even thought that maybe I'm lesbian or asexual but that is not the case. \n\nI want to be able to love whole heartedly and desire a man like any other girl, but I can never EVER trust anyone to have an intimate relationship like that. Because of all this I've become a cynical person. I'm not even beautiful or attractive, and this is not my insecurity speaking it's a fact which becomes apparent with how people interact with you. So of course no one would be able, or as a matter of fact willing, to love me romantically. \n\nBecause of this I've decided to never get married in life or be in a relationship. I don't like casual sexual relationships, but that isn't much of a bother as I can satisfy myself quite well. I could blame my abhorrence about how most men tends treat a woman but in reality my broken soul is as much toxic as the former reason. But it saddens me that in this life I could never ever have a family of my own, since a healthy family environment is all I've ever wanted in my life.\n\nIf you've read till the end, thank you so much for hearing me out.",

I'm tired of thinking every fucking mistake I made. All I want is to be left alone now because I keep causing damage to myself and others around me because I want to keep the peace by all means necessary it's gets me fucking nowhere but dragged through the mud and making continuous mistakes. I hardly sleep I hardly eat yet I force myself because I need to still function for myself. My marriage is dead my daughter is dead and in the span of five years all I did was made mistake after mistake lying to save face on just to have come back worse having to fake being happy because I don't want to let anyone in and questioning my decisions every fucking second and I just want to figure myself out. My ex-wife told me she stopped loving me after I let go of her hand when my daughter passed and was trying to make it work and I didn't even find out till a few months ago and it eats away at me on top of her wanting to add a third person into our marriage for a \"bond\" and saying that she wanted us to have each other because we were all missing something after I repeatly offer to go to couples therapy to figure out problems out. Now she wants to be just friends but Im sure I know how that's going to go I'm just going to be a back up when something goes wrong and I refused to be like that. She even said that maybe some time down the road she would consider me again but what's the point I'm trying to build myself back up now and she doesn't want to try to work things out I can't even figure out if she was the first cheat or was I because I actually made a move on another female because I was unsure about so much shit I needed to get away then I force to question if I had feelings or psuedo feelings. I'm in therapy now trying to to figure myself out but this shit still eats away at me and I just want to isolate entirely I don't wanna laugh I don't wanna do anything besides focusing on my career and my growth because the entire time this bullshit with her and this bond bullshit was happening I was just trying to focus on school to get us in a better place now it feels fucking useless because the meaning behind it is gone and now I'm struggling to find happiness with finishing college. Fucking being nice because it's gotten me nowhere but shitted on and devalued. I need to quit the shit and do what I gotta do for me and only me because I have no one else but me to look out for yet it's a bitch in a half to fight this fucking habit and I'm tired of it I'm tired of everything I'm almost 30 years old I shouldn't be dealing with this bullshit like for fucksake she feel in love with a guy that has repeatly said that he's not interested and yet his actions says other wise and she's still feeding into it after saying she needs to get away from everything ",

It’s been the worst week of my life. \nWhen he broke up with me, I didn’t know what to do with myself. I felt so out of control and unlovable and I just fucked a random guy on Grindr. It was awful, disgusting and I felt so dirty and guilty the whole time and i never want to put myself in that position EVER again. I felt so discarded and it was a completely immature thing to do.

NSFW \n\nIf someone who knows me read this post, they would be surprised because not only am I super shy, but I’ve always been embarrassed to talk to men. I even feel self conscious wearing crop tops and showing my stomach\n\nI started studying marketing and worked at a call center for a few months, which was horrible. I’m extremely anxious, and every call made me feel awful. I started looking for jobs in other fields, but the only place that pays well without experience is call centers, and I need the money for my studies\n\nSome of my friends used to joke that if they had my body, they would sell nud*s. I never thought much about it, but recently, I came across a post from a girl who does it. She’s not viral, but she makes sales from time to time and does well. My body isn’t perfect, but I know my body type is generally considered attractive\n\nI see it as a side hustle while I save up and start a business idea I have or while I finish my studies.\n\nSo now I can’t stop thinking that maybe I should at least try it without showing my face. It sounds awful, if my mother knew, she would be ashamed. My friends wouldn’t believe that someone like me would even consider it, even I don’t think I would be able to go through with it\n\nBut just thinking about having an income without working 9 hour shifts and then studying is very tempting. I know I don’t have the worst life. I know the right path is to work hard. But it also makes me sad to see how some of us have to struggle so much to get things that others just have effortlessly\n\nI know this would make me the kind of woman no man would take seriously, but I’ve already come to terms with not having a partner anyway because I’m extremely shy\n\nI try not to think about it, but the more time passes, the more tempting it seems.

        "selftext": "Hello everyone. I’m a 19M. Over the last couple of years my life went downhill and I realized how big of a loser I am. I don’t know. \n\nIn high school I got bullied. I was kind of the mockery source of my class. People loved making jokes about me. After hs I took a gap year hoping that I can clear my mind. I tried to get my driving license meanwhile. I failed 4 times and “burned my file” which means I need to go through the whole process again. This is not common. I’ve talked with many friends and read comments online about this. People say “you shouldn’t touch to a vehicle.” “Failing this many times is a success on its own.” “You’re not a real man if you failed 4 times in a fucking driving test.” And so on. Every one hits me from my chest like a knife. \n\nMy grades steadily declined. I still haven’t failed but I know at some point I will if I go on like this. I’m skinny and underweight. I am ugly. I mean objectively ugly. I am insecure about lots of things and they only add up. This latest driving test was just the last straw. \n\nI’ve never had any true form of human connection. Never had any close friends that I could whine to. Never had any romantic relationships. Never had respect or love from anyone. \n\nI often feel like an imposter. As I walk around the world, I think that if people knew about me they would feel better about themselves. They would just start to laugh and mock me. Ridicule me. I’m a  failure. I think that my family is embarrassed me and my friends just put me around to feel better themselves. When I get into a social settings I can’t help but feel awkward, feeling like I’m just inferior than anyone else. I live every waking moment with an intense self hatred, self disgust and just drowning into my insecurity. \n\nSometimes it goes well tho. Sometimes I can see hope in my future. But it doesn’t last long. I fuck up at something else. I go to a psychiatrist and diagnosed with depression, anxiety and adhd. I am medicated with Paxil and atomoxetine(generic strattera) will start Ritalin soon. \n\nI don’t know life just hits me from everywhere, not only from outside but inside too. I just want to crawl into a corner and die. Painless. \n\nIts so fucked up to feel like you have no one to rely to. Not even yourself. \n\n",

        "selftext": "I’m 24 (f) and my mom is in her 50s. At the beginning of this year I decided I wanted to loose all the weight I had put on since moving back home from college. My mom and grandma are Italian and obsessed with basically forcing you to eat as much of their food as possible. When I started my weight loss journey I weighed 137 and I’m 5”5. Nothing wrong with this, but all through out college and high school my typical weight when eating healthy, but balanced, and staying consistent in the gym was ~125 so I defiantly noticed a difference. I was extremely uncomfortable / insecure every time I had to dress nice or for going out because I was so used to always being relatively small/lean. So over the course of the last 3.5 months I locked in and lost like 17 pounds. I now weight 120. I did not starve myself or even work out excessively. I just focused on portion control while eating calorie dense foods but tried to stick to Whole Foods most of the time.  Continued working out 3-4x per week. My mom recently noticed the weight gain and it’s going nuts, calling me disgusting, anorexic, “sick” and horrible every time I get dressed to go somewhere. Keeps saying she’s sending me to a doctor to “fix my problem”. Literally screams at me to gain weight. I defiantly need to move out, but for the time being feel so frustrated and angry. Why does she think it’s okay to say this stuff to me? I do not have an eating disorder, but IF I DID, she would be handling this situation so poorly it would only fuel the disorder more. My mom is ALWAYS trying to loose weight even though she is small and thin. Will brag about eating a “protein shake” and pack of nuts for the whole day at work. So it’s so hypocritical everything she is saying. And although I realize I am on the thinner side, I am so much more confident in my body now. I’m not planning on loosing more but also I’m not just going to gain it all back to make her happy so not really sure what to do in this situation but I’ve just about had it with her. Kinda just ranting and open to any advice or suggestions :) ",

        "selftext": "\n\n\nBackground: my dad recently got married. It’s been 4 months now. \n\nThe story: I had a stomach ache from something i ate. My dad always told me if I needed something at night to text him or call him or if needed to knock on their bedroom door. They have a mini pharmacy in their room and not else where because there are other kids in the house. At around 1:00 am I went to make myself tea hoping that it would calm my stomach down but the pain became more uncomfortable. It then became 2:00 am. I heard a blow dryer from their room so I thought they were awake and thought it be will quicker and faster to just knock on the door and get a painkiller.\n\nHis wife answered and she was in a bath robe. You can understand what I mean by saying that. I thought it was too late to turn around now so I asked for a pill. She opened the door of their room and walked in and I assumed it was fine to walk in too. My hands were shaky when I took one pill out so it fell on the floor so I took another one and walked out. \n\nI woke up this morning and my dad was angry. His wife is accusing me of pretending to be sick to see inside their room, that I pretended to take a pill and threw it on the ground, that I walked in uninvited and looked around the room, how they’re shocked that this behavior would come out of a 17 year old and that I should have never knocked on the door of newly married couple. \n\n\nBackground on me: Before my parents separated they weren’t living like every other couple. They were living like roommates so my sister and I would just walk in and out or knock on the door so there are new things that I’m learning from this marriage like what the boundaries are. Consider me naive with this stuff. \n\nAs for why I didn’t call or text. I don’t know it didn’t pop into my head. I thought they were still awake and that knocking would be faster. \n\nMy dad is already telling me that he’s tried defending me so many times in front of his wife because of my mood swings (they’re stress related) and that I ruined the picture that he has tried painting of me in front of his wife and how she could start acting petty now and treat me badly if I keep doing this as if I done it on purpose? \n\nI feel like it’s not fair because if it was her daughter knocking on the door it wouldn’t have brought the same response or reaction. \n\nI’m thinking of talking to her directly and explaining my point of view without my dad being the mediator or defender.

        "selftext": "My wife (31) and I (28) have been together nearly 8 years, married for 3. We have a 3 year old son and a newborn. We have a loving relationship where we’re best friends, have great communication, and amazing and regular sex (which has just started again following the pregnancy). All in all, I would say a very healthy relationship. \n\nAlmost 2 years ago now, I uncovered my wife’s affair. I had picked up her phone to use it for my son because I didn’t have mine to hand, and saw a flirtatious message between her and her work colleague (let’s call him J). I immediately challenged my wife and she said he was just being flirty because he was drunk and the message made her feel uncomfortable. I asked to see the rest of the conversation but she had deleted it because of how uncomfortable she had felt. I had some red flags but had no reason to truly disbelieve her so we talked it through and I tried to let it go. Fast forward a couple of weeks and I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was more going on. I did the horrible thing of checking through her phone and in her deleted photos, I found some pictures of her and J kissing. I immediately brought this to her and asked what was going on. She admitted that she’d been having an affair with J for 2 months. They’d kissed and masturbated each other once but that was it. It was mostly an emotional affair. She said she’d been having a crisis since she turned 30 earlier that year and was struggling mentally. She was feeling old and that when J had shown an interest in her, it made her feel sexy and it was exciting. She wasn’t in love with J but felt trapped in the affair because he was in love with her and if it got out, she could lose her job because she is a higher rank than him. I asked her whether she chose me and our life, or him, and she chose us.\n\nFast forward a year and my wife and I were discussing having another child. We’d moved on a lot since I discovered the affair and we had actually become closer as a result. We fell pregnant quickly but the pregnancy itself was tough because she has Hyperemesis (severe pregnancy morning sickness). This wrecked her both physically and mentally. This was when I noticed her getting closer to J but it seemed just to be a friendship. I was sceptical but believed my wife when she had regrets the original affair. My wife was very open and honest about her friendship with J, and revealed a lot to me so I didn’t feel any need to doubt her especially as we were having another child together. Her friendship with J was up and down as he kept pushing her away especially when he found out she was pregnant. I put this down to him still having feelings for my wife and being heartbroken or something that she had fully moved on. \n\nOur baby girl was born in January 2025 and my wife and I were a firm team and all seemed well. She went on maternity leave and we coped with the transition to having 2 children. It was at this time that J completely distanced himself from my wife which she again told me all about. She felt upset about it but said she didn’t care because she had her family to look after. Again, I believed her. Foolishly. \n\nAbout a month into her maternity leave l came upon my wife texting her cousin. I walked up behind her whilst doing errands and saw she had screenshotted a message to J she had sent earlier that day saying this was the longest they’d gone without talking and that she missed him. I told her I thought this was totally inappropriate and I didn’t like the emotional weight of her saying she missed him. She told me it wasn’t in any way other than as a friendship. For whatever reason, I started to get doubts about what had been going on between J and my wife. \n\nA couple of weeks later, our family travelled to Rome to spend time with my wife’s family (she is Italian and she grew up there). She went out with her cousin one night and I felt compelled to check the notes on her iPad because I knew that she sometimes wrote down thoughts there. I found essentially a diary entry or perhaps a draft message to J where she said doesn’t do friend with benefits, and whilst the physical parts of their relationship were fun, it wasnt worth the risk if there wasn’t more to it. She also said she still loved him but couldn’t commit if he didn’t love her and she would stick with me if she had to. This entry was on 28th December. \n\nThe next morning, I found a moment when my wife left her phone and quickly checked her WhatsApp. In the locked messages section, I found her conversation with J and the night before they were sexting. I didn’t get much time with the phone but I’d seen enough. I can’t imagine that sexting is the furthest they’ve gone during the affair. \n\nI was/am devastated as this was a couple of days ago and I have no idea what to do. I want to challenge her right now with a view to know what’s been going on and then end everything. I would get on a plane and go back home. I’m so confused because my wife and I went for dinner last night, and it was just us, no kids. We had an amazing time and told each other how much we loved one another (this is true on my part even though I am so hurt). \n\nI don’t know whether to wait until we get home, or just forget about it all and see what happens. I don’t think I can move past this, especially as she was cheating on me throughout the pregnancy with our child. I do have doubts whether my daughter is mine, but I think she is. \n\nI am so lost, in so much pain and have so many questions. I love our life, I love our children. If I end things, all that will end and I will not be able to see my kids as much. It feels better to get this off my chest, so thank you and sorry for the splurge. ",

She hasn’t made as many mistakes as I have, and she’s never felt the need to go to other people just to feel worthy. She’s always seemed whole on her own, while I’ve spent so much time searching for validation in places I probably shouldn’t have.\n\nI hate feeling this way because I love her, I really do. But I just wish I could be enough.",

Second day in I over do it walking around the capital city and strain my hip. I woke up this morning and couldn't move my leg unless I used my hands to make it move. It hurts to walk on and im just so tired of my body falling apart. I'm only 24 and I have a messed up knee, carpal tunnel, I get constant styes and now this. I'm just so tired of it. I want to be able to walk around for hours without worrying about hurting my knee, I want to be functional. Now I'm missing a hiking portion because I opted to stay at the bus to take care of my leg and make sure I don't hurt it worse. I'm debating getting an overpriced hiking stick at a nearby store and seeing if that helps. I'm just tired of this happening. It feels like I get sick or injured somehow once every other month. Just before this trip I managed to recover from strep and avoid catching covid from my sibling but now I'm slammed with this. I just don't know ",

Nothing sexual, it was just kissing. I'm literally in high school. My friend asked me why I did that but I brushed it off as hearing the vent make a weird noise.\n\nOr, one time I somehow managed to kiss a guy, and as soon as our lips touched I kind of wanted to disappear. I went to the bathroom a few minutes later and puked up my whole lunch because of how gross I felt.\n\nIs this normal? I can think of a few reasons for this issue - being raised religious (my parents won't let me date till I'm in my mid twenties), being autistic and having anxiety or maybe just being socially awkward, but I dunno. A bunch of my friends are dating each other and it's very easy for me to help them and talk about it but when it's in front of me or involving me I kind of shut down.\n\nMany thanks !\n\n",

        "selftext": "21M. Alright, so lets be real - us guys have tried to measure our dickss atleast once in our lives. I did too, and let me tell you... I mismeasured mine as a kid and spent years feeling insecurity over nothing.\n\nBack in middle school, I thought I was below average, thats what the numbers said. Every time I heard girls joke about how 4 or 5 inches is way too small, it stung. I started avoiding those conversations, dodging situations where I might have to \"prove\" myself. I even fumbled with girls who were actually into me, just because I was in my head about it.\n\nAs i became more mature, my mindset changed. I stopped giving fucks. Now I was more of a \"fuck this, it is what it is\" kinda guy. I was determined to focus on the things i can change. I went to the gym, grabbed my balls and asked out chicks i liked on dates, and honestly? Life got better.\n\nFast forward to last week - I randomly saw a measuring tape lying around. Me being bored, I figured, why not? Maybe it grew a bit, maybe it didn’t, but at this point, I couldn't care less and was purely measuring for fun. **HOLY SHIT!!!** I was the average joe before, but now somehow my dick is inches bigger than the average size. I couldn’t believe it. Measured again. And again. Even got a different measuring tape. Same damn results.\n\nI felt dumb but also kinda hyped. All those years of insecurity - for nothing.\n\nPS : this post isn't to make my fellow chads feel insecure. Up until last week I was riding with the below-average squad. It doesn't really matter, and I've accepted that too. There will always be someone bigger, stronger, or better than you in some way, what makes you special is your uniqueness and how much you own who you are. Focus on the things you can change, life will treat you better.\n\nThanks for reading",

        "selftext": "I’m writing this at 1 AM from a hospital room, and I’m drowning in so many emotions that I don’t even know how to put them into words. I feel sad. Angry. Frustrated. Hopeless. I don’t know how I’m supposed to feel anymore, but all I know is that I feel like my world is crumbling around me, and I’m stuck trying to hold it together alone. I just need someone to hear me — because I’m at my breaking point.\n\nI’ve been carrying trauma for over a decade now. It all started when I was 13. I was a freshman in high school — quiet, shy, reserved, and just a normal kid trying to figure out life. My high school was part of a cluster of four buildings right next to each other, and my brother went to the school next door. One morning, like any other, I walked to my first-period class thinking nothing of it. I sat next to the window, and suddenly, I noticed a huge crowd forming outside in front of my brother’s school. I looked up — and there was my brother, standing on the edge of the third-floor building, trying to jump.\n\nI froze. My stomach dropped. I couldn’t process what I was seeing. I got up from my seat, walked out of class crying, and started hyperventilating. I remember trying to get closer to the crowd, and when a staff member stopped me from getting through, I yelled out, *“That’s my brother!”* I remember blacking out after that — the panic attack took over me. My parents were called to rush over, and they assisted my brother first before coming to get me. We went straight to the hospital, and that’s the day my life changed forever.\n\nAfter that incident, I couldn’t return to my school. Every time I walked through the doors, I would have flashbacks of that day. I begged my parents to transfer me out, and they did. But that didn’t stop anything. My brother kept attempting — again, and again, and again. I transferred to a new high school each year, hoping I could outrun my trauma. I even forged my parents' signatures just to transfer myself, but no matter where I went, the pain followed me.\n\nAnd each time he attempted, I blamed myself more and more. *Maybe if I was there for him more, he wouldn’t have done it.* That guilt ate me alive. I isolated myself, refused to make friends, and shut myself off from the world. My entire teenage life revolved around my brother's mental health and trying to survive my own internal battles.\n\nIt didn’t stop after high school. I finally decided to enroll in community college, thinking I could have a fresh start. But again — he attempted. This time he overdosed on drugs, and we had to rush him to the hospital. This happened *three times* during my college years. Each time, I had to drop everything — my classes, my life, my sanity — just to relive the same traumatic experience over and over. I started falling apart mentally. I had no friends, no normal life, and every time I looked in the mirror, I hated myself.\n\nI finally sought therapy when I was 22, and my therapist told me what I already knew deep down — I had been psychologically abused my entire life. I had been carrying so much trauma, guilt, and blame for something that was never my fault. But how do you unlearn something like that? How do you stop blaming yourself when you watched your brother almost die over and over again?\n\nAnd then it got worse. My brother started getting heavily into drugs and alcohol. He overdosed *again*. I remember walking into his room and finding him unconscious with a bottle of pills and his skin turning blue. I can’t even count how many times we’ve had to call 911. The hospital feels like our second home now. The trauma just never ends.\n\nA few months ago, he swallowed an entire bottle of his medication — and we found him just in time. His skin was turning blue. Cyanosis was kicking in. Another call to 911. Another night in the psych ward. And guess what? He still doesn’t care. After that incident, the doctors finally put him on psychiatric injections — hoping it would stabilize him. But it hasn’t. He still gets drunk. He still uses drugs. And he still shows no remorse for the chaos he’s caused our family.\n\nAnd now comes the part that’s breaking me the most.\n\nToday, my mom was officially diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. The cancer has spread so bad that the doctors are keeping her in the hospital for a few days to run more tests — but the prognosis isn’t looking good. And I know *exactly* why my mom’s health deteriorated so fast. It’s because she spent *years* neglecting herself to take care of my brother. Every time he attempted, she stopped eating. She stopped sleeping. She would sit by his bedside 24/7. She poured *every ounce* of her energy into saving him — and in the process, she destroyed herself.\n\nAnd now she’s dying. And I can’t help but feel like this is my brother’s fault.\n\nWhat broke me the most was when I came home after being at the hospital all night with my mom. I told my brother about her diagnosis, and he *didn’t care*. He was high and drunk — again. I begged him to come see mom with me, and he brushed me off and said, *“She’s fine.”* I wanted to scream at him. *“She’s not fine! She’s dying — and it’s because of YOU!”* But I didn't.\n\nHe finally came to the hospital with me but showed *zero* emotion. No hug. No comfort. No empathy. He just sat there like a zombie, high out of his mind, and I wanted to scream. My mom never left his side after *nine suicide attempts*. And now that she’s the one dying — he doesn’t care.\n\nAnd now I’m scared. Really, really scared.\n\nI’m scared that my mom is going to die thinking I was a terrible son. I’m scared that my brother’s mental illness will be dumped solely on me when she’s gone. I’m scared that my sister, who abandoned us years ago because she “couldn’t deal with it,” still won’t come back to help. I’m scared that my dad will fall apart after she’s gone. And I’m scared that I’ll end up like my brother — mentally gone, emotionally numb, and completely hopeless.\n\nI haven’t been able to make a life of my own. I’m 25 now — and I still feel like I’m stuck in that 13-year-old version of myself, frozen in time from the first time I saw my brother try to jump. I haven’t been able to build friendships, chase dreams, or have normal life experiences because every year, I’m reliving the same traumatic cycle. And now my worst fear is coming true — I’m about to lose my mom. The one person who held us all together.\n\nI see my psychiatrist later today, and honestly, I don’t even know what to say. Do I ask for stronger medication? Will it numb me out enough to survive this? Will it turn me into my brother?  I don’t want to turn out like him. I’m terrified of what my life will look like once my mom is gone and I’m left alone with my brother’s mental illness. My sister wants nothing to do with him. My dad is breaking down. And I’m scared I’ll get sucked into the same darkness my brother lives in.\n\nI keep asking myself, *Why can’t my mom catch a break?* She gave her whole life to take care of my brother — and now she’s paying the price with her life. And here I am, 25 years old, and I’ve never been able to build a life of my own because I’ve spent my entire existence putting out fires my brother caused. And now, I’m about to be left alone with all of it. I don’t think I’m strong enough for that. I’m genuinely scared I’m not going to make it through this.\n\nI’m watching my mom’s life slip away. I’m watching my dad break down. I’m watching my sister keep her distance. And I’m watching my brother continue to destroy himself while showing no remorse for what he’s done to this family. And I’m just here…holding it all together with no one to talk to. I feel like I’m about to lose my mind. I feel like I’m on the verge of completely breaking down. I have no friends. No outlet. Just my psychiatrist, my medication, and my panic attacks.\n\nThe saddest part? Two weeks ago, my parents were packing up our house and making retirement plans to finally enjoy life after years of hardship. Now that dream is gone. My mom is dying, my dad is falling apart, and my brother couldn’t care less. I’m stuck picking up all the pieces.\n\nI don’t know what I’m hoping to get from posting this. I just know I’m not okay. If you made it this far — thank you. I just needed someone to hear me. Because I feel like no one in my real life sees me anymore. I’m just the sibling of the “mentally ill brother.” The one who’s supposed to stay strong. The one who has no life. The one who will be left alone and scared.",

        "selftext": "My friend is an amazing woman who is very smart and kind. She is empathetic and posseses many qualities that would encourage men to date her. The reason I bring this up is because even someone as great as her has said things that have further intesified my anxiety toward dating. We got to talking about what we physically like in people and she said, \"I really hate saying this, but it's kind of a big deal breaker for me if a guy isn't tall. I could maybe date or hook up with them, but they have to heavily compensate in other ways. He would have to be really, really handsome though I would still be a little upset.\" \n\nHearing her say that men should compensate for lack of height scares me because I know that I lack way too many physical preferences that other women would desire. I'm average height where I live at 5'9 with an absolute ugly face and narrow body frame. My penis is nothing to brag about. I don't know how to be charismatic since I literally never know what to talk about even when I'm relaxed and not worried about pursuing anyone. I don't have any way to compensate for all my physical \"flaws\".\n\nMy face is so strange looking that it causes women to get nervous or laugh at me. I know it's not my mannerisms or expressions because I've asked my friends if I seem very nervous or awkward in public and they tell me no. I'm actually more nervous in public with my friends because they are very good looking, and I feel embarrassed knowing they are seen next to me. I hate being trapped in such an undesirable body. \n\nEven if a woman could get past how I look, I would feel extremely unworthy of her. I want a woman to find me physically desirable, but my looks are so bad that a woman will never be as sexually attracted to me as I am to her. I know beauty is subjective, but there are certain traits that are more favorable, and as I've said before, I don't have them. I can't stop feeling so undesired and worthless no matter how much I distract myself with passions and hobbies. I'm tired of it all. ",

He knows i’m an introvert and I was drained. Instead of understanding, he got irritated, like I was being difficult for wanting space. He said he was fine with them there, so his comfort should matter too, and accused me of being selfish.\n\nI told him my comfort should matter. Most men respect that having company over late when they live with their woman isn’t okay. it’s not like they were in the living room, they were in the couch in our bedroom. i felt uncomfortable after it got late, i wanted to undress, and be comfy in bed and not care about people i barely know hearing me snore. But he flipped it, saying he can’t hang with his friends or stay out late because of me and my “stipulations” since he cheated (whole other story). I told him he was being unfair. He said I was mad because he wasn’t giving me attention, that I can’t take him having fun without me. That hurt, because it wasn’t true.\n\nI brought up how he’s being immature and he’s 30 hanging out with 21- and 23-year-olds, and how it makes me question if he’s serious about the life he claims to want. He acts like he’s single, not a family man but telling me he wants a baby. \nAnyway, his response to that was to call me jealous and asked if i’m mad because i’m old, told me to carry my “old ass” to bed. I reminded him he’s my age, i’m 31… and the guy i dated when we broke up was 24 and never once said anything negative about my age but he doubled down, saying the guy was nice because it was “easy p***y.”\n\nI told him not to talk to me like that. He laughed in my face. Then he brought up me going out the other night and disappearing, implying I cheated. \nmeanwhile i only went out because he was out all day with these friends and didn’t check in and didn’t come home, i left the house at 10pm and he still wasn’t home. but then i was the bad guy when i got back in after 1, when he left the house from 9am and left me stranded taking my car?\n\nI asked him, if he thinks I’m an old worthless cheater, why is he still here? He didn’t answer. Just kept watching TV, laughing, then went to bed like nothing happened—while I sat on the couch crying…\nhe’s snoring as i’m typing this and i feel like crap.",

        "selftext": "Hi all, this is my first time posting anything like this on an online platform, heck even talking about it to anyone in such depth or to this degree. The below is a journal entry of mine from yesterday/today. I would appreciate any advice regarding steps i can take to help myself as im reaching a real down point. I tend to hide things very well, to a point where if you ask my friends/family, they have no idea how low i  mentally as im good at putting up a mask - i think too good for my own health 😅. I truly appreciate any comments. \n\n10.3.25 - I have been off Effexor for 3 days purely because I’ve completely forgotten that it exists and I need to take it. This has been both good and bad. Withdrawal symptoms are occurring (dread, heightened anxiety manifesting as chest pains, trembling, emotional instability and elevated heart rate, shivers down my spine and a hot/cold sensation). I can’t think clearly and can only focus on the negatives in my life.\n11.3.25 - Took 150mg Venlafaxine (Effexor) and 20mg Frisium, not usual 10mg - Frisium has done absolutely nothing. I can usually tell when its working at the normal 10mg dose.\nThe positives that have come of this are that I have now been able to see things within myself that I previously had not or could not, possibly because I suppressed them and bottled them up, which over time has only made them worse. The main issue is:\na severe fear of judgement which has been there since I was a young child, that has held me back in:\nRelationships (romantic, friendships, family)\nMaking decisions that impact my future (career and financial decisions)\nChronic stress and generalised anxiety\nLow self esteem (diminished sense of self worth and negative self-talk)\nDepression (feelings of hopelessness and despair in everyday life)\nIsolation and loneliness (severe in many cases)\nThis also shows in gradual behavioural changes, such as:\nPeople pleasing (prioritising the approval of others and constantly seeking approval)\nPerfectionism (leading to harsh self criticism and frequent mental burnout)\nAvoidance of expressing opinions (agreeing with others when I disagree, not sharing my ideas, thoughts or opinions)\nMasking my true self (presenting a false image of myself to please others and/or gain acceptance, acting in ways that may not aline with my true self)\nA point that I want to make clear is that under virtually all circumstances I DO NOT show my true self. I always have a mask on that is carefully and specifically crafted for interactions with that person or group. I literally live a lie day in, day out. The pain that this brings me, I am unable to put into words - it truly is debilitating).\nI also feel tremendous guilt. My parents do not deserve nor should have to deal with this, but I understand that they within themselves can’t avoid it as they care. The treatment they get from me when I am in this state is horrible, unfair and disrespectful, but it seems that I cannot control it. Trying to shift my attitude to a more positive one over the last two days has been a monumental failure - I do not have the mental capacity or strength to do this effectively at this time. There have been moments (now and in the past) where I have truly wished that I was never born, or that they at least had a child that was mentally stable, one they deserve. Much to my dismay, this does not appear to be me.\nAs I see my peers getting married or at least in solid, long-term relationships, I can’t help but beat myself down. This has reached a point where I know that I want that connection with somebody, but in reality I am not in a position to even consider it at this time due to my past decisions and current circumstances - this is my own fault, but nonetheless it is a pain I have to live with for twelve hours each day. I despise myself for this.\nDue to different reasons past friendships have collapsed and I am left with three good people, that I know have my back at all times - I appreciate them for this. Even with these people that I know always have my back and have shown this in many instances, I do not feel comfortable discussing these things with them - this goes back to fear of judgment. I know that they don’t see it that way, as they have opened up to me when things were bad for them, but I can’t bring myself to open up and talk to them.\nI don’t think I would truly ever be able to take my own life, which I have always criticised others for doing or contemplating (never directly to them as that is insensitive), but these last two days have made me understand that feeling and the depths one can reach mentally. This depression and sadness felt over the last two days is unlike any other depressive episode I have ever experienced. As I write this paragraph, I have a sick, hollow feeling in my stomach. I wish I wasn’t this person. I truly wonder what the contributing factors and causes are that have made me into the person I am today, but I know that I shouldn’t focus on this as its an endless downward spiral that offers nothing positive, but just keeps dragging me down.\nI have also realised that I have started to intensely crave human connection - in all ways. I don’t feel I can clearly explain this in words at the current moment, so I will leave it at that for now.\nI have also started to intensely crave illicit substances to help suppress these emotions. I have successfully held myself back from this by having a few glasses of scotch when I get these urges as it gives me that ‘buzz’. I fear that I will give in at some point, as the strength to say no to myself is diminishing at a very fast rate. This is not just over the last few days, but over the last few months.\nMy mind has been overwhelmingly loud and busy. Currently to a degree where I feel as if I’m going crazy. There are so many problems and negatives for me to deal with that I never have a sense of peace or tranquillity. I can say that I haven’t felt at peace or truly calm in many years (probably since I graduated high school). My mind is always racing at 350% capacity.\nI also feel that privacy and personal space are non-existent. This can’t be helped to a degree as I live with my parents currently, but it has been playing on my mind and I think it's a large contributing factor to these feelings. I am also not in a position to move out, again due to my relationship with money and the ridiculous rate at which I spend it. Impulsivity - what a great thing (meant with all the sarcasm in the world).\nThe usual chest pains that I would feel from my anxiety are worsening. Today I have had the pain from the moment I woke up - it is also far more intense than usual. I can describe it best by saying that it feels as if I have a car resting on my chest - a heavy weight pushing inwards and an extremely intense sensation of stress around the centre and left of my chest leading to heart.\n",

We truly had a nice conversation because we’re going to see each other tomorrow and discussing what will transpire. I told him good night and we ended off on a high note. We have each other’s instagrams on our phones just because, and I saw that he got a notification from his sister telling him good night. They don’t normally talk on Instagram so I was going to go snoop on their conversation, which was my fault and wrong.  He has a private account and I noticed he had dmed himself some things so I went to snoop in that first since he hadn’t opened the chat with his sister. To my utmost surprise he was sending himself posts of Instagram models. We had multiple conversations about this in the past but it was even more of a gut punch since we had just gotten finished talking frisky with one another. It’s like he found another vessel for his needs or something. Why are men like this??? It just sucks for me though because I really struggle with self esteem and body image issues.

I visit her every day. I sometimes meet her mom there, and she'll hold my hand and i cry till I almost throw up on the cemetery.\n\nMy dad has schedueld me with a therapist so we'll see how that goes. Its not that long ago since she passed, but this is the longest we've gone with out seeing each other, and it makes me ache.\n\n  \nEdit: I honestly forgot i wrote this post before falling asleep. \n\nThank you for nice comments and sweet messages. I will try to keep better in touch with her mother, so I'm taking the train to them in about an hour and will spend a night at their house.

        "selftext": "I feel like I can't accept love. I can’t form connections with anyone, and even if I could, I wouldn’t be able to accept love from them. When someone puts me on a pedestal, like family members, I feel so uncomfortable. When they are happy that I graduated college, I feel uncomfortable. These things I've achieved mean nothing to me. If I feel like a connection might be made, I feel awful inside and want to pull back.\n\nMy parents divorced when I was 5, but even before that, their relationship was just a series of dramatic situations, the kind you’d read in a depressing novel. Nothing bad happened to me *personally*, but a child shouldn’t have to be exposed to that much darkness. I was too young to understand everything, but I still felt it. The tension, the instability. It was like I was watching a storm I couldn’t stop. But back then, I told myself I didn’t care. *They’re stupid. None of this matters. I don’t care about them or anything.* That was my mindset. I didn’t *feel* anything. At least, I thought I didn’t. But now, looking back, I see how much it actually affected me. Me thinking I didn’t care was just a defense mechanism, a way to protect myself.\n\nAfter the divorce, I lived with my mom and her boyfriend until I was 15. When she moved far away, she left me with my grandparents. A year later, she had a child with some guy I don’t even know. My dad has his own family, four kids, all around 11 years old. He’s lived with them way longer than he ever lived with me. That’s his real life now, not the one with me. I was just the test subject, the first attempt. They were immature and not ready, and I had to figure out everything on my own.\n\nI missed out on emotional development, and I battle with this every day. I feel like unconditional love doesn’t exist. I can’t even comprehend it. I’ve seen my mom and dad maybe once a year since I was 15. Even before that, it was rare. How could someone like that grow up to understand emotions like everyone else? How could I be normal? And it's at the point where I genuinely feel uncomfortable when I have to meet with them. I just feel weird inside, being near my parents gives me a weird physical and psychological reaction. Like I just don't want to be near them. \n\nThe only family member who even tries to show me love sometimes is my grandma. But even then, it makes me uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable. If *anyone* tries to show me even a little bit of care, I physically feel weird inside, like something is deeply wrong. It’s not just discomfort, it’s like my body and brain *reject* it. I don’t know how to explain it, but I feel this awful sensation, like I need to escape. Like, I genuinely in those moments want to be left alone. Like genuinely. A lot of the times I feel like I want love, unconditional love, from someone from who I can trust it's unconditional, not family. But even if I somehow got it, I know I wouldn’t be able to accept it. My mind pushes it away. My body fights it. And that’s the most frustrating part, wanting something so badly but being incapable of holding onto it. It just makes me feel more alone.\n\nI don’t see any other family members much at all. I do live with my grandparents, but my grandpa is emotionally unstable, and it’s hard to connect with him. Every single one of my family members is messed up in a different way, each their own kind of broken. I’ve become really good at reading people, but it doesn’t matter much since when it comes to using that knowledge, I freeze up and blank out.\n\nAnd when I do try to interact, it never goes right. I think in a logical way. That’s how I’ve survived. No one cared for me, so I had to figure everything out on my own. When someone has a problem, I immediately see the logical reason for it and the solution. So I say it. That’s how I’ve always handled things, fix the problem and move on. But when I do this with my family members, they get mad. They say I’m cold, emotionless, that I don’t care. But this is how *they* made me. They left me to figure out life alone, and now they hate that I see things this way? I don’t mean to be cruel. I mean well. But instead of hearing the truth, they just want someone to sit there and feel sorry for them. I don’t get it. No one ever felt sorry for me. Coping with a problem instead of fixing it only makes things worse. Why would I encourage that?\n\n\nI’ve also never really connected with another human being. There have been some rare friends here and there, but even that was never deep. It always felt surface-level, maybe slightly deeper but eh.. And if we’re talking romantically, I’ve never experienced any of that. I’m 23 now, and the idea of love, relationships, or even just simple emotional connection with someone feels like something that exists in another world, one I don’t belong to. It’s like there’s an invisible wall between me and everyone else, and I don’t know how to break through it.",

I knew it was unsafe to go alone, but I was the first person there everyday and there was no one to walk with me. \n\nAt first, I used to dart straight out to the gas station, to unlock the door and put the money away but after gaining some confidence, I just kept my head on a swivel and walked out to my workspace. \n\nOur store and gas station shared a parking lot with a smaller store, which routinely had homeless people hanging around it. For the most part they stayed at the little store, once in awhile they would come dig through the gabage cans or wash their hands in the windshield cleaning buckets, but nothing too concerning. \n\nAfter my first year I was no longer scared of my morning routine, I got the money and headed out on my trek, put the money away, checked the garbages, and did my leaf blowing when I noticed a figure slumped against a piller on that smaller store. At this point I was used to seeing people sleeping over there, and I still don't know why but my heart sank and I knew that he was dead. I still don't know what tipped me off, but I ran into the kiosk and called the police. \n\nThe police, the fire department, and the ambulance came, they taped the area off, and worked for what felt like hours before they took him away and left. \n\nI mentioned it to my manager when they asked why the police was there, but I never told anyone else at work. It never felt like my story to tell. All I did was call the police, that's all I could do. My manager offered to let me go home, but I declined, going home would not save that man, and I doubt that it would have made me feel any better. \n\nLater that day on my lunchbreak our local community newsgroup (who listens to the police scanners) posted on Facebook that there was an unattended death at the little store. I shouldn't have, but I read the comments. People fighting about homelessness and choices that someone could make to cause them to be homeless, people making horrific comments about drug abuse, people saying they were glad to have one less person leaching off the community. But all I could think was that was someone's son. He might have been someone's father or brother. Despite any choices he made in his life, he died alone. He might have welcomed death or taken his final breath in fear, I will never know. \n\nThe sunrise came up that morning and it was absolutely beautiful, the prettiest sunrise aI have seen, but it broke my heart knowing he would never wake up to another sunrise again. \n\n6 months later the same thing happened, but this time all I saw was a set of legs sticking out from behind the landscaping, again I called the emergency services. The police, fire department, and ambulance arrived and administered narcan and were able to revive him. My manager came in that morning to \"congratulate me,\" but it felt so wrong knowing that I called the police just like anyone of my coworkers would. \n\nAnother 6 months later it was about 8 in the morning, and this time I saw two men stumbling around in the parking lot. They looked like they were drunk and on drugs, the taller one grabbing his friend's shoulder to keep him upright, when suddenly the shorter man fell and hit his head on the cement parking barrier. His friend grabbed him by the arm and tried to steady his friend, but upon realizing his friend was gone, let him go and he slumped onto the ground, again hitting his head. Then his \"friend\" just ran away. I hesitated, maybe 30 seconds or maybe a full minute before calling the police, and they arrived, covered his body, and took him away. \n\nThat afternoon when I got home from work I just laid in my bed and cried for the first time about these three men. I was so angry, and heart broken, and I even felt a little guilty that there wasn't anything I could do. \n\nI don't know why I typed this all out, I've only ever talked about this with my parents and my husband. It has now been two years from the first death and I still think about these 3 men. I wonder what could have been done differently to prevent these deaths, and I hope the 2nd man is recovered and still alive to this day. ",

I feel it’s very awkward and vulnerable. \n\n\nTo put it shortly, my family is very toxic and dysfunctional. We’ve gone through a lot. It’s wraught with drug abuse, deaths, abuse, narcissism, etc. But we’re doing a bit better now and everyone has changed substantially. \n\nHowever, I feel that I’ve been deeply impacted by some things. Particularly, realizing that my father’s love was very conditional. He doesn’t love us unconditionally. He’s explicit about it in his words and his actions. He told me that love and compassion have to be earned. So, I spent my whole life earning it. And it worked. He loves me, he treats me well. I appreciate him. But I had to earn it, it wasn’t just given to me as a child of his. I’m constantly on my toes. I feel unlovable sometimes, if I don’t please people I care about. I want everyone to feel good and be happy and I get anxious when they aren’t. I’ve been doing a lot better since therapy (ongoing) but there’s one thing I can’t figure out how to fix.\n\nI’m in the age of getting into relationships/marriage and I’m deeply afraid of it. I’m scared that my marriage will be a reflection of my relationship with my father. The things I want reflect what I lacked in my childhood. When I think of being in love, I imagine my (hypothetical) husband being extremely gentle, protective, affectionate, sensitive with me. Almost like someone would be to a child. I hate admitting this it’s so embarrassing. But I feel so fragile. I don’t want to desire this. I’m outwardly a very confident, balanced, independent woman. I’m not afraid of being codependent exactly, but I do feel afraid of why I want to be treated like the way I described above. I don’t hear any other sisters talk about wanting this. \n\n\nI want to address and change this so badly. I’ve been in therapy for a while and I feel that I’ve healed in a lot of ways but I still desire this and I’m scared that I’m going to carry it with me forever. I don’t want to feel fragile and vulnerable. I just want to be married to someone who will treat me as an equal. I can’t expect to be treated like some sort of hurt child. \n\nI would appreciate any advice. I know this is strange but I don’t know where else to ask for help on this. \n\n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "I’ve been in therapy since 2nd grade, but if I'm being honest, I don't think I needed therapy at that age, but Ethan convinced my parents I needed to start seeing him because what my sister is going through will traumatize me. Unfortunately, my sister did not traumatize me; he did. I don't think I experienced my childhood ever since I was put in therapy because I've faced humiliation, manipulation, and gaslighting, which ruined my relationship with my parents. I don't think Ethan was a therapist for children but for teens and adults only. I cannot remember that much about my childhood or many memories with Ethan, but I remember some parts. Ethan wasn't a good man; he was always telling me about my sister's situation, and if I remember, he asked if I had seen my sister self-harm, and I was young, so I told him I didn't know what that was. I do remember he showed me how self-harm works. He didn't care about how I felt or how my day went; he was always on his phone. He would talk to me if I was an adult, as in cursing, when I was just in 2nd grade. 4th grade got worse; I developed anger issues because I hated going to his office. He made my parents believe I had anger issues and needed to see a psychiatrist for medications. I don't think I had anger issues; I think I held my emotions for too long because no one was listening. I couldn't speak up because Ethan told me if I kept crying to my parents, CPS would take me away. I do remember he showed me videos of foster homes and told me if I wanted to end up like that. It led me to have trust issues with adults growing up. I couldn't trust anyone because I was scared to be taken away, so I kept my emotions to myself. kept getting worse I remember begging my mom to find me a new therapist because of how he treated me, but Ethan will tell her to ignore me because I'm just throwing a tantrum for attention. I don't know if it was weird having a therapist telling my younger self and older sister, who was 13 at that time, that he would invite us to his home because he had a pool. I'm happy we never went. It got worse when something horrible happened to me in 8th grade. I don't know how he made my parents not believe what happened to me to the point that Ethan told them to close the case. I remember I just cried to my teacher, who hugged me because she believed me, but Ethan made my parents not believe me. My anger issues have gotten worse in 8th grade to the point I blame my parents for failing to protect me from a man who emotionally abused me. I blame Ethan for ruining my life. Have I been to different therapies? Yes, around Jan 2020, I remember she was confused why I never played board games or other stuff with Ethan. I changed therapies 4 times, but I just couldn't trust them because I was still scared. I remember Ethan telling me I should be happy to have him as a therapist because another therapist would just call CPS and take me away from my parents. I'm now taking EMDR because that's what my psychiatrist recommended because that was definitely the #1 trauma that affected me more, I guess. I do deal with trust issues with my psychiatrist and therapist, but I'm trying. By the way I am 19F now and I don't have interest in reporting his license I'm scared of him. I think I will always be scared of him…\nMy parents believed what I went through after my sister came forward that Ethan treated her poorly. ",

        "selftext": "Context: My fiance is an orphan and only has her 7 siblings in her life. She is estranged from 5 of them and only considers 2 of them to be family. I plan to propose to her this Saturday and have planned a really nice event. I told my mother my plans and I knew it would be a big fight (we have always had an estranged relationship due to enmeshment and parentification). \n\nSo here’s the issue. My mother is upset that I have included her sister in on helping me decorate the hotel room where I plan to propose. She feels as if I am including her side of the family but neglecting my side. The thing is that her sister is merely helping decorate, she’s not staying for the actual proposal. It’s just going to be a surprise. \n\nMy mother is very old fashioned and believes in public proposals. My fiance is introverted and absolutely would NOT want that. I know for a fact it would give her extreme anxiety. She feels as if the way I plan to propose (privately) is weird and not how I should do it. If you can’t tell by now, she has no sense of boundaries. I know how I want this moment to go and I really don’t want her to ruin it but with all the bickering the past two days i feel like I want to call it off. She’s just ruined the mood of everything. She inserts how she feels into this moment to make me feel guilty or like I am doing something wrong. Im just tired man. \n\nAm I wrong for doing things this way? Should I go about this differently? I just need advice. \n\nEDIT: Wow didn’t expect this to gain so much traction. Thank you guys for the reaffirming support and advice. I will work on setting clear boundaries and moving forward with my plans! ",

        "selftext": "...and I'm insanely jealous of her.\n\nSometimes, I think about her life and how she turned out, versus what I went through. Specifically, I'm jealous of her love life, and the fact that she seems to have that white picket fence life a lot of people dream about.\n\nI still think it's a miracle that she and her highschool sweetheart stayed together all this time, even through college, and eventually got married and started a family. I'm sorry, her MIDDLE school sweetheart. They were in 7th or 8th grade when they first started dating, and everyone knew them as \"that\" couple. Nowadays, they're still \"that\" couple to be honest.\n\nMeanwhile, I met my first boyfriend in my senior year. We eventually had to get into a long distance relationship because we went to different colleges. He broke up with me after a few months into our freshman year because he met a new girl at his school.\n\nI honestly don't think I'd be feeling this way right now if I eventually found my stride. But no; I had a long string of bad and failed relationships after my first boyfriend. I even met a man in college who I wanted to marry and have kids with one day, but that fell through too. (because he cheated)\n\nIt's so much more common for middle schoolers to literally break up within a few months, at most. And if you make it through middle school, you break up at some point in high school. If you somehow manage to stay together through high school, you usually break up in college. (And those two also had to go long distance during their college years) But no; she was lucky enough to find that 1 in a billion man who apparently really does care about her. I'm not saying that she doesn't deserve to be happy, I'm just saying that I wish I had it as good as she does. Even a fraction as good as she does, honestly.\n\nI'm jealous that she seems to just have a constant stream of lucky streaks where I feel like I'm constantly failing. Even career-wise. I'm jealous that she had one idea for a career path, and stuck all the way through it. Now she's working as a lawyer.\n\nI can't tell you how disorganized my education journey has been. I changed my major several times and even took a year off to just focus on my mental health. I ended up getting my bachelor's at 24, almost 25 actually. Right now, I'm even going back to school to be a nurse.\n\nMeanwhile, she got married right after graduating college, and had her first child a year later. She and her husband bought a house together at some point, and I can't help but just think of myself as a loser for having such rotten luck compared to her. Just recently, my fiance broke things off with me because we found out I can't have kids, and now I'm living in some cramped apartment with 2 roommates.\n\nI keep feeling like every time I take one step forward, something happens that pushes me 2 or even 3 steps back. I feel sad and hate how perfect some other people's lives can be. I guess their existence just makes me feel like that kind of luck is possible to achieve, and I've clearly been doing something wrong if I've never been able to experience it.",

        "selftext": "I (20F) broke up with my boyfriend of 10 months last weekend and I can’t shake the feeling of betrayal and anger off. My emotions went haywire when he turned around and said it’d be better if we split. I agreed at the time, but later that night found myself deeply regretting my decision. I begged him to take me back, only for him to metaphorically slam a door in my face.\n\nTo begin with, my ex (who I’ll call Joe for this) was a sweet and caring guy. Things were going well at first for me and Joe despite being long distance. At first we’d call for hours and play together, having a laugh and playfully teasing each other. It was honestly a great experience for me, I’d talk to Joe nonstop and always make sure to give him morning and night texts, getting online and helping him with his projects he was working on.\n\nThings ended up starting to go downhill about halfway into our relationship. I’ll be brutally honest, I’m extremely clingy and have a crippling fear of abandonment due to trauma from my past, so I struggle a lot with being left without replies. At the time things started to go downhill, Joe had started to become increasingly infrequent with his replies. I got worried and confused, I would end up asking if there was something I was doing wrong, or if he still loved me, only for him to turn around and say everything was fine. I started to feel as though the relationship was only being driven by me, that if I stopped then he’d just forget I exist or something. Compared to the start of our relationship, Joe had just changed. Instead of actively responding to me and seeming genuinely interested in what I had to say, all my sent reels or posts would just be liked in bulk, as if he wasn’t even taking the time to acknowledge anything I sent.\n\nHowever, things took a sharp downward spiral a couple of months before me and Joe split. One of my ex-colleagues (let’s call him Fred) and I fell out over comments he’d make. He would constantly jokingly flirt with me and my best friend, who both explained that we were uncomfortable with his advances. In the end, I ended up no longer responding to his messages. I needed space, but apparently Fred wasn’t very fond of that idea. After a while, Fred quit his job and decided to leave me a note which basically threatened me, stating that he’d “be my demise” and whatever other shit he went on about. Long story short, Fred made me incredibly uncomfortable and I asked Joe if he would cut him off as them being friends made me uncomfortable. Joe refused, saying something about ruining friendships cause of cutting people off in the past, which fair enough, but this is the Well-being and safety of your girlfriend we’re talking about here. I’d do the same for him, I’d protect him with my life if I had to.\n\nI suffered silently for those months, hoping maybe one day Joe would change his mind but he never did. In the end, I just couldn’t deal with the emotional toll this was taking on me, and since I struggled with wording it myself due to my anxiety, I had to get my best friend to talk to him about it. After she did, I got the message from Joe, suggesting that we should just be friends, mentioning how his work schedule of getting up and going to sleep early was taking a toll on him, which is fair enough, but it only takes two fucking minutes out of your day to reply to your girlfriend.\n\nEventually, I gave in. Even if it broke me, I knew Joe didn’t love me anymore, but I couldn’t help but shake the feeling that it was all my fault. I spiralled badly, Joe was the main thing keeping my mental health stable after my self harming tendencies and past suicide attempts. I couldn’t handle it. The emotional pain was so unbearable it became physically painful. My world came crashing down in that moment, the only thing I could think of was how none of this would’ve happened if I wasn’t around in the first place. That night, I threw caution to the wind and attempted on my life. The rest of that night is a blur to me in all honesty. Aside from some nasty, painful cuts on my wrists, I’m slowly healing.\n\nI’ve been reflecting a lot on my relationship with Joe over the last few days, thinking back to the times we actually spent together face to face. Each time the same, me spending £130 to travel down to the other end of the country to see him, spending an extra £30-40 on takeaways. The most he ever spent on me being £20. I feel used and betrayed. I thought he loved me. I thought he genuinely loved me. but looking back on it, I realise I was nothing more than a cocksleeve to him. How he’d always try and touch me up and use me. I never saw genuine love in his eyes, only lust. He only wanted the pictures I sent, the free deliveries i’d buy him. I can’t help but feel angry at myself for letting this go on for so long, for getting attached to this man I thought truly loved me. I just wish I would’ve been smarter.\n\nTL;DR: A rough breakup with my ex almost cost me my life, I just wish he loved me as much as I loved him.",

        "selftext": "Growing up, I didn't have the good fortune of growing up in a well adjusted family. Multiple people in my family were toxic hot messes that never sought to improve their lives, or get appropriate therapy or find ways to remedy their own issues. I was always a kid who spoke my mind and who called out my toxic mums behavior and anyone around me. She would then tell everyone I was a disobedient problematic child, and other family or friends would reprimand me even though she was lying. She only wanted to destroy my reputation. She only did this to make sure she would \"shut me up\".... for good.\n\nMy dislike for people has grown because toxicity happens all over the world. Toxic people never having the awareness to get help or do better. When people say *\"MOST PEOPLE ARE GOOD PEOPLE\"*, that is a gotdamn lie. It's simply impossible in terms of how many people DON'T have basic **self awareness** and basic **emotional intelligence.** I loathe how people are incapable of empathizing with one another or working together to create change in a good way. \n\nI hate how people screw each other over in relationships through complete dishonesty/disregard for the other person. Cheating. Lying. Using and hurting the other person. Complete cruelty. Why??? It goes back to the very beginning of my post. Toxic parents. Toxic family. **Most people are NOT good people.** I've seen and experienced too many things to think differently at this point in life. \n\nI am irritated with how people are also **PASSIVE.** I mean, DAMN. The building I live in, management takes gross advantage of tenants. They constantly violate the terms of tenants leases, and then dare you to take actions to protect yourself. I live in a building of over 400 tenants, yet people only complain to each other about major issues and NEVER take real action to change their circumstances. It is not in me to sit and complain all day without taking action. I simply don't understand how people operate in life like this??!! Fully grown **adults** just sitting back and allowing the worst to happen to them or other people. I had my own situation to deal with concerning management. When I get angry, I get REALLY angry and I take very calculated extreme measures to remedy the problem quickly. Another tenant heard how I stood up to management and was in SHOCK.\n\nAll I thought was, \"WTF are you in shock about????😒\" All I did was speak the truth, get a lawyer, and I followed through on creating boundaries and followed through on any threats if they stepped out of line. People have the same ability to stand up for themselves but they DON'T. They WON'T!!!!!\n\nA lady tenant in my building said, \"You seem intelligent\" Then proceeded to trauma dump all of her grievances about the building/management on to me. I asked her if she wanted to brainstorm solutions to fight the issues, or if she just wanted to *vent.* I basically told her I didn't want to hear it if all she wanted to do was complain and not DO anything. Then she got upset with me and started going off. **I'm a very solution oriented person** so complaining without a plan is counterproductive to me. I don't understand the blatant world of passivity people live in. \n\n**People will let human rights disasters happen right in front of them. They will allow the complete decline and fall of democracy. They will allow multiple entities to take advantage of them and literally do absolutely NOTHING to stop it.**\n\nSo, for the past 2 years now, I pretty much have been a recluse. I disappeared off of social media, I've stopped reaching out to people. And I don't care to socialize mostly at all. I'm just sick and tired of people. They are so entirely  disappointing. \n\nAnyone else feeling this way?",

        "selftext": "So I was sexting with a woman and sent her a dick pic. What ensued was absolutely crazy for me. I've only ever been with one woman who was my ex-wife and I got no particular comments about my size, but some remakes regarding her previous partners which contributed to me feeling insecure. I know I'm about average in length and perhaps slightly above average in girth, it's difficult to find facts about this. \n\nBut now suddenly this woman is scared and nervous of potential sex because she thinks it's too big. I was sure it was nothing to worry about and that it wasn't too big or anything. She said she is relatively small, but still. Me trying to convince her it's not that big made her feel like I was diminishing her fear. But I was simply so flabbergasted in what I was experiencing. Being insecure for the majority of my life to eventually not caring about size to now being told it's big. I feel as though my perception of reality is being distorted. Almost feel like she was lying just to make me feel good or something. \n\nThis might sound like a humble brag or whatever (bragging about an average penis lol), but truly, I am flabbergasted.

        "selftext": "For context I'm finishing up college. The last 2 months have been pretty wild for me. I got the courage to breakup with my now ex gf which younger me would've never imagined doing but I have no regrets. It took a couple weeks to fully recover because it was my first relationship and we had been together for over a year but now I couldn't be happier. In hindsight I put up with far more than I should of and my friends agree I made the right decision. There were still many times where I was at fault and I've reflected on that a lot too but it's great to know I wasn't crazy like I thought I was. Since then I've gotten out of my comfort zone a lot more and I'm doing things because I want to do them opposed to doing them for someone else or for some other reason that isn't reflective of who I want to be. This is big because I'm an introvert so getting out there can be challenging. I'm also in the process of quitting a horrible porn addiction. So far I've gone a over a week without looking at anything and I'm already seeing the positive effects. Obviously a week is nothing and I've tried quitting before but this time feels much different. Something just clicked one day and it feels so easy now. Even when I'm a little tempted it's easy for me to push back and say no which is something that have never happened to me. I don't think this has ever happened to me and I don't know the last time I've went this long without it but it feels great and that makes me want to keep working towards quitting for good. This is a throwaway and maybe I'll delete the post later or give an update in a couple years if I hold onto the account and if something significant happens in my life.

        "selftext": "(TW: mentions of drug abuse, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts)\n\nFYI: the SH and suicidal thoughts have been absent for years, absolutely nothing graphic, I merely mention it for the sake of the rant\n\nI've been in this cycle for about 5 years now and I'm just now looking into reddit posts to feel seen. I suffered with a ton of depression from stress and anxiety in my early years of HS, and now I'm only a senior (18F). I'm quiet, reserved, and find it hard to connect with people because of it. The friends I do have make little time for me, no matter how much I try to plan, or just see me as an outlet for their problems. I don't at all mind helping out my friends, but when it's constant, it's just so draining. I've always been known for letting people walk on me with how obsequious I become around people I care about, but it's so painfully obvious they don't hold me to as high of a regard. I feel like it's making me more irritable as a person, which in turn pushes others away from me. I don't mean to, but I just find myself snapping at people more often and feel way more defensive than I used to. I also can't seem to talk about my problems, and when I try, I immediately break down. It just feels impossible to go a day without crying when I'm constantly stuck in my own head.\n\nI feel like I can barely eat more than 1,000 calories a day, and I'm about 43 kg and it's only going down. My parents notice, but they've stopped commenting on it. I don't eat when I work long shifts, and I can feel how hungry I am, but it's like my body just suppresses the hunger. I've been relying on THC just to get through the day, and it became a replacement for the depression and SH. I'm almost three and a half years clean of SH now, but it doesn't feel great knowing that I \"fixed\" it by replacing it. I went cold turkey and stopped smoking only three days ago, but it seems to get easier with every day and I hope I can keep it up. I clearly can't use drugs responsibly right now, and the experience is far from fun. But I'm going to see if I can break myself out of this. I'm trying to change my life around in hopes that maybe my anxiety will become more manageable. Switching jobs to start fresh, picking up therapy again, and just trying to focus on myself. I leave for my new job in two weeks, and my therapy starts next week.\n\nThis time, I'm going into therapy with a positive mindset, so maybe they can help me through this. I really want to get better, and hopefully find someone besides a therapist or my notes app to confide in. I know that I can't just wait around for someone to save me, because I have to save myself, but doing this alone is hard. I've been far from suicidal for a while, and I don't think it will ever have a hold on me like it did back then, but I wish it wasn't so difficult to reach the end of the tunnel. It took me so long to get where I am today, and I don't want to lose the momentum I have and let this bullshit win. I just hope that the independence I'll finally be granted in the future will contribute to that.\n\n",

        "selftext": "I F[17] can't stand my mom anymore. (Burner account just in case) This is a long post do forgive me. There's a lot of background. \n\nFor years, I feel like it's been an endless competition with her. Especially when I hit the age of dating. My mom had me when she was 17 (it's relevant don't worry) and her and my dad lived together. I don't remember much from my early childhood but I do remember one significant memory and that was of them fighting and me yelling for them to stop. I was maybe 5 at the time. Either way they split up. Of course, she blames it on him. My dad had gotten custody over me throughout kindergarten-first grade before my mom got me back. She basically says he kidnapped me. Which, I'm to the age where I'm not sure who's lying and don't bother to care. Both my parents are pretty shitty. But I'd rather live with my mom than my dad. Now, my mom has obviously played the victim card when it comes to anything about the past with my dad. Which she still does heavily today. She has bragged to me about always getting what she wants in the end. Remember this! \nWhen my mom had my brother, we moved into a house. My stepdad was always gone for work and she was pretty much known for bringing guys in. Anytime I'd ask her about them, she'd make up an excuse. I unfortunately heard her doing sexual activities with a guy and she told me he was gay and probably was just watching something on the TV. And with her friend and her husband. There was always something. Then, once we moved again after she had my sister, it just turned into her going to and me not seeing her till 8 am. No text. No call. And I couldnt manage getting the kids up and ready for school while also getting myself to school as I was 12-15 and honestly, was fine with staying home. Cuz that's what happened anytime she'd be out like that, id stay home. And at one point our phones were shut off and I couldn't contact anyone. My stepdad and her are pretty much known for being incapable. They both fuck around while being married, tell people they are divorced, etc. I've had to go thru his phone for my mom so that she could have access to that stuff. Not shit I wanted to see btw... But she thinks we're close. She vents to me, complains, yaps, etc. like we're friends and not mother and daughter. Which is fine but shit. Sometimes too much is too much. To top it off there's points where I won't eat some days because I get forgotten about. When I had COVID for a week, I ate maybe once a day. We didn't used to fight so much until I got with my current boyfriend. Who for preference has been nothing but kind to me. She has had a record with trying to disrupt my relationships. \nI was dating a girl years ago and my mom flipped out because she say a video on my phone of the girls mom drinking whiskey from a cup. The father and another adult was there, not drinking. And we ended up having to break up because she threw such a fit. If course her parents felt horrible. But were still friends and she's basically forgot about it. (She's a bartender and will give me alcohol or whatever she's making so... Do with that as you will.)\nAnother case was multiple times in my ex's relationship. We dated for about 3 years and when when we were 14, we were stupid and sent not so cute texts that she found. She told me that my biological dad had hacked into my shit, found the texts, and was going to file a report on him. Scared us shitless and my ex stopped talking to me for a bit. But ofc time passed and nothing happened. She completely ignored the fact that he cheated on me, broke up with me multiple times for whatever reason, etc. and allowed that to slide without batting an eye until I finally broke up with him. Ironic.\n \nWell, I got with my current boyfriend  almost a year ago. He's been the kindest person ever and I've never complained about him to her. We're LD (he lives 5 hours away) and so our first meeting up was last August. Things went pretty smoothly because his mom was with him. Well, he's come 2 other times outside of that. October, and December. October was a rough fucking patch because this is where my mom loses her shit. She thought it'd be a good idea to text my bf through a private number and tell him I was cheating on him. She literally personafied herself as a mystery guy from my school and described my body to him so that he'd believe it. She took pictures of my undergarments with condoms (just opened) to make it seem believable. And also relayed my previous days schedule with him. How did we find out it was her? At the time I had her camera roll synced to my phone. She didn't know prior because we had done it in 2022 after my grandma passed away. (Also how I found out she was sending nudes to guys INCLUDING my bio dad bc we'd talk about it and find out which ones he got etc.) But either way, I matched up her taking those pictures to the ones she was sending him as this \"guy\". Our big clue before his was the picture she sent him of a cropped out bloody backseat bc \"he\" claimed to have popped my cherry in the back of his truck. We confronted the number and they basically freaked out and said that it was the nextdoor neighbor I had talked to for a bit. He came up with a ridiculous excuse. But I could differentiate the style between the kid she blamed it on (he talked ganglish) and her texts. Very obvious. I blew up on her that night, demanding her phone, showing her the deleted screenshots, textnow app, etc. she still claims it wasnt her. Keep in mind she did this the week before my bf was supposed to come see me. We still don't know what her goal was. I think it was jealousy . Her marriage isn't exactly love filled. It pretty much got swept under the rug but it caused resentment for my bfs mom and a lot of other people towards her. But, he did come see me and it was fine for the most part. \n\nBoth trips he's come by himself, she's always tired to make up and excuse as to why it won't work. \"We have plans. Idk what we're doing. You can't stay here this long. Etc etc.\" we never do anything. We don't have the money to. So I know it was bs. He came anyways bc it \"magically\" worked out and nothing happened.\n\nWell, he was supposed to come see me for Spring break, which is next week. I told her two months ago that he planned to come. She even recommended a different hotel. And I thought that was that, and it was pretty much solid as it normal had been. I reminded her yesterday and she starts freaking out saying she didn't know about this and that it wasnt possible. My stepdad is gone till May working and she has decided to take a government job which has orientation on Friday. Just found that out maybe 3 days ago. She's irritated, telling me this wasn't going to work and that he couldn't come because she can't have us be alone at the house for 10 hours because she doesn't have a schedule. Of course, I'm upset. My bfs already taken his vacation days off for he year which he can't get back, and booked the rental. He's mad. His mom's frustrated but trying to help us. My mom thinks it's weird that they keep bringing up my age (bug factor of why he can't be here?) etc. she also just is so upset at the fact that his mom doesn't like her and starts being petty saying that if she won't talk to her, then my bf can't be coming down. So panic sets in.\nI get through today, come home, she's sitting outside. I don't say anything to her when I walk inside after school. She takes it as a silent treatment. She comes in, talks to me, I talk back. Not ignoring her. She tells me she's emailed and asked to push orientation back till April. And she's being real guilt trippy about it. I'm upset all over, crying because I don't want to wait 6 months to see my bf, getting mad because she's accusing me of not discussing anything and never telling her anything, etc. you should seen her when she found out my plans when i graduate... While yes, I may have had a bit of an attitude, I feel that with all this shit, I have a valid reason to be. Every break, every WEEK, I'm stuck watching her kids, cooped up in this house without a license, without many friends, with no job (because she can't be reliable), etc. So yes, I probably did have an attitude. But I'm tired, my motivation and basically the only thing that would get me through the rest of my junior year has basically ripped from me. And I'm not happy. I've been fed up with being here for awhile and have looked at getting emancipated but atp, it's better to just wait it out unfortunately. But I've also heard the things shes said to his mom (who's entirely on my side??) and she basically made me out to be a spoiled brat, saying she should stick to her gut about him not seeing me and that I'm acting out and if I get what I want (this trip) then it'll just prove that I can get whatever I want by acting out. I've never crashed out unless it's a good reason. Anyone that knows me, knows this. Another note, both me and my mom have BPD. She takes shit seriously, and if she thinks someone's mad at her, the world is ending. She also projects. Bad. Now, back to what I said earlier about me always getting what I want if I act out, doesn't that sound familiar? Anyways... I'm not sure what to do and she hasn't talked to me since our conversation from earlier. But I don't know when I'll see my bf again because of his work and my school. Wasn't planning for it to be 6 months which is what the minimum will be. And I wasn't mentally prepared for this. Especially during exam week. It sucks because we used to be so close and now I can't look at her the same. But no matter what she's done, I can't help but feel guilty for being angry with her. It's always been that way. I just want to get out truthfully 😭. I think that's it but if I forgot anything, I'll edit this post. I'll also update on the status of him even getting to see me next week. I hope I'm not just being a dramatic teen on all of this.",

        "selftext": "Hello, I (21F) am looking for advice. Every day for past few years, I have been very apathetic. I feel \"dead inside\" as some say. I find no joy, excitement or hope in anything anymore and I do not know why. The past few years when our family went on our annual beach vacation, I felt no excitement, which I usually would when I was younger- but I feel nothing. The last time that I have truly felt happy was at age 12. I have almost no physical energy either, and very low stamina. I recently went to the doctor to address this and all of the bloodwork and tests came back perfect. It is hard to explain, but I don't feel sad, I just feel like a zombie going through the motions. I see some say \"enjoy the little things\" or \"enjoy the journey\" but I don't feel anything to enjoy.\nYou can read context about my current life and my life growing up below.\nAn issue that I have every day, is that I try to squeeze every ounce of time and turn it into something \"productive\". I struggle with procrastination because sometimes I do not want to focus on my goals. One of my to-dos is to write a journal about my life to remember the times when I did feel something, and because I have noticed a decline in my memory. I wish I could get my to-dos done, because I tell myself \"you can live life when you get this done\", but I have been trying for years to get the list done.\nAnother problem is that when I try to sit down and be with my thoughts in silence, and try to listen to my “inner voice”, my mind can't focus. Because of this, I don't know what I want in life, I don't know anything at this point. I watch self-help YT videos like \"getting your life together\", \"how to be more productive with your time\", \"how to know if your goals\nare from a place of self-love or self-hate\"\netc. Right now, I need to know what I want in life, because I have to decide on a degree to\nfurther my education (I graduate soon with a Business degree) because this current degree is not going to cut it. All I know right now is that I want a job that has a flexible schedule, remote and decent pay. All of these motivators are extrinsic, I have no idea which job is right for me and it is overwhelming with all of these career choices that I have no interest in. The only interest that has been consistent throughout my life is being an artist (traditional painter) but that isn't realistic and not many people become successful enough to make it their full-time job.\nAnother thing that I am wondering is why I have no empathy for others, and I only think about myself- not sure if I was born this way, but I don't remember ever having empathy.\nWhat I have noticed is that since I don't feel anything inside, when I talk to people, it feels forced like I have to put on a smile because I feel nothing. Even when I talk to my 2 friends, it is fake enthusiasm. I am okay with having only 2 friends though because sometimes it feels like having friends is a chore since I have to fake my emotions.\nI am a people-pleaser, I have trouble telling people \"no\" and end up doing things that I don't want to do. When people describe me, they say that I am a great listener, but it is because I feel guilty when I do talk about myself. Many have said that I am really humble, talented, and all of the good things. I know that I am a good person, I know that much. I hate to be the center of attention, which might be a reason why I don't like to talk about myself.\n\nFor some context in my current life, I have a loving family and we all love and care for one another. I have wonderful sisters, both of my parents and a little brother. My family is the greatest, we are really close-knit and hug each other good morning, good night-that type of family. We go on an annual beach vacation and my mom makes us all food and life is great and I know just how fortunate I am in life, truly. I never thought that I had a bad life- I am just wondering why I have such a fortunate life and I feel almost no emotion. There has been times where I thought my life was boring but that is it.\nA typical day in the life of mine would be that I wake up and feed my dog, greet my family, make breakfast while chatting with family, go to my room to do school or work on my art, later make some lunch, might walk on the treadmill for cardio, sit outside to soak up some sun (if it is not cold) and do something productive out there, then come in for dinner, family meetup, might play a video game with my brother or watch a movie with a sister, then get ready for bed and meditate, plan out the next day (what my tasks are or goal to complete), pet my dog and go to sleep. Throughout the day, I will check my phone sometimes, and scroll youtube or instagram in my distraction. A few times a week, my grandma and I call and talk too.\nI have instagram because I have an art account where I post my paintings (in hopes of creating an audience to sell to) but I rarely use instagram to look at other's lives. Sometimes I catch myself comparing my body to others, but I mainly look at other art. I create traditional art to pass the time and simply because I do still find peace in creating art. I still find the feeling of inspiration when it comes to nature, like plants, landscapes and the beauty of wildlife. I listen to music, I love my classic rock and 70s music, so I guess that is some sliver of emotion.\nI switched to a whole foods diet in hopes that I would see improved energy, but the main reason I started eating healthy was to change my body and get rid of some fat that I have around my midsection and legs (I am small though, at 112 lbs) so I could stop being so self-conscious every single day. After 9 months on this diet, I feel absolutely no difference or boost in physcial energy at all which is disappointing.\nMy current social life is almost non-existent, but I am okay with that I think (Again, I don't know what I want in life). I am an introvert or \"homebody\". I don’t have trouble keeping a conversation going and I am not shy when I do talk to people though. I have a part time job in childcare where I interact directly with people and that is fine, other than that, I have 2 friends. \n\nIf I had to guess, I would say that simply realizing that life is just \"get a job that sucks the least, do that job for decades, retire, then die\", my obsession with \"being productive\", my body dysmorphia, and maybe something else contributed in a mixture to my apathy?\n\nHere is some context growing up if anyone wants to read:\nAs a child, I had a spark for life as many do. I was obsessed with reading about wildlife, wanting to know everything about animals and dinosaurs and this continued from age 6 until about age 11. I loved to learn- the local library and the zoo were my favorite places growing up. Age 6 is when I developed my passion for creating art and drawing the animals that I was learning about. I wanted to be a veterinarian due to my love for animals when I grew up. I had no trouble making friends in school, I was never bullied, my friends were awesome and I had many of them. My grandparents would bring me every year on a road trip to a different state. And overall, I had a wonderful, THE BEST childhood ever. After the 4th grade, our family switched to homeschooling which is another discussion. When I turned 11, I was given my first tablet. For the first 2 years of having one, I only played mobile games on it and watched youtube sometimes but it was to watch an animal documentary or something educational. When I turned 13, I \"grew out\" of this, and started bed-rotting on Youtube, mindlessly scrolling and watching videos like people telling storytimes. I was no longer interested in learning about animals. I think homeschooling definitely exacerbated this because we were home all the time. In the same year, I became extremely self-conscious of myself, I hated the way I looked and I was compared to my cousin who is 1 year younger than me all the time (growing up, we were like sisters, and she was my best friend for years). I became jealous of her looks and how everyone would compliment her curly golden hair, she had so many friends (After being homeschooled, I didn't have a lot of friends anymore), she was beautiful and I wondered how the \"awkward phase\" didn't seem to affect her. I think that this had something to do with my self-conscious ways that have not left since I turned 13. This and my introduction to the internet and seeing everyone's opinions on everything. Fast forward to COVID, and for the first few months, I enjoyed it. Not having to go anywhere, staying inside the house was perfect for an introvert but it wasn't fun anymore after a few months. 2 months after COVID and my grandpa dies, which I really really think affected me, I don't know how, but it probably did. I started getting these depressive episodes that would last sometimes a day or two which was completely out of the norm. In these episodes, I would just wonder why I was here, every day is the same, those kind of thoughts. I would completely dissociate from life it seemed. Luckily, I have not had one of those episodes in about 2 years, which is great.\n\nANY ADVICE is appreciated, thank you.\n\nTLDR: I have a great life, and I used to have a love for life from birth until age 12. Now at 21, I feel like a zombie going through the motions. I physically have little energy, despite the doctor’s tests coming back fine. I feel like I have to fake my emotions in any social setting and I am wondering why I feel this way at my age.",

        "selftext": "A few months ago, I received a Snapchat request from someone I didn’t recognize. They wouldn’t tell me who they were right away, only that they had “feelings for me” and talked about how they admired me .  The first message they ever sent me was creepy it was “I know you see me just like I see you, but I'm not ready to step out of the shadows yet.\nNeither are you I know you're a private person, but there's something about you that pulls me in every time, even from a distance.\nI'm someone you know, but I can't say who I am yet. Just know that I see you in a way that's deeper than you might imagine bye l'm\nBlocking you “At first, I didn’t think much of it. I thought maybe it was just some random person who had seen my profile and was curious. But as the messages continued, they started to feel... strange. The person was saying things that made me uncomfortable—things that made it clear they were watching me. They would mention things from my life that only someone who really knew me would know, and it started to feel like I was being stalked. And to be clear I’m 19 and I never had a boyfriend never had my first kiss was homeschooled and moved into a new city so no friends either .\nThey kept texting me for weeks, sometimes daily, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. But I was curious. I didn’t want to seem paranoid, so I kept responding, hoping maybe they’d reveal who they were soon. They kept saying they wanted to \"talk\" and that they had a lot to say, but I kept putting it off. Honestly, I was scared. I knew this wasn’t just a random person—it felt like they were trying to make me comfortable, only to reveal something I wasn’t ready for. It was only after I was pretending to enjoy talking to him and after months of cryptic messages, the person told me their identity. When I saw the name pop up, I felt my stomach drop. It was someone I knew my entire life. Someone I thought I could trust. Someone who had been a constant presence in my life.\nIt was my uncle.\nI was in shock. How could this be happening? Everything started to make sense the way he told me who he was was unsettling he said he thought I was ready to know who he was and said he’d share a memory we’d had together and it’d all click for me. He said “Sushi express” I was confused, a memory popped up but I thought no way so I asked him to give me a more specific one he then said “sushi express failure “ my heart dropped. Cause the only memory I thought of was when my uncle would take me to eat sushi express for a series of times sometimes with his wife and sometimes with just me and my brother and one day we went to a new sushi express place and we went in and we didn’t like the place and walked out I had always known him as someone close to the family, someone I saw regularly. I had known him for as long as I could remember. But now, it all started to make sense—his strange behavior, all the hints that he gave me, the manipulative comments. It was him the whole time.\nBut that wasn’t all. The first day he added me on Snapchat, the day he first reached out to me, was also his birthday. And that detail, looking back, felt like a punch to the gut. Why did he choose that day? Was it planned? Was it a way to manipulate me even further?\nThe more I thought about everything, the more the horrible truth hit me: This wasn’t the first time he’d crossed boundaries with me. When I was a child, he sexually assaulted me everyday for I don’t even remember how long.I buried those memories for so long, told myself I was just being dramatic, that it didn’t matter. But now, the pieces were falling into place. He had been trying to manipulate me all along, using this new online persona to control me.\nI wasn’t sure what to do. I knew I had to tell someone, so I went to my aunts—his sisters(I didn’t tell my mom cause she was pregnant and i didn’t want to stress her). I thought they’d be my allies, that they’d stand up for me. I told them everything, and I expected them to act. I expected them to confront him, to take some kind of action. At first, they seemed supportive. They promised they would confront him, that they wouldn’t let him get away with it.\nBut as the weeks passed, nothing happened. Not even a word from them. One aunt sent me a voice message explaining that she had been thinking about confronting him, but she still hadn’t done it. She kept saying that she needed to find the right moment, that she didn’t want to approach him too suddenly. Meanwhile, I’m left here, feeling like I’ve been forgotten, waiting for someone to help me while he’s out there, still living his life without consequences.\nShe said things like, “I don’t want to catch him off guard,” and, “I’m trying to think about how to say it so he’ll actually listen.” It felt like she was more worried about his feelings than about what he did to me. She even told me she wanted to talk to him privately, at her house, where she thought it would be “calm,” but weeks have gone by, and nothing has happened. It’s like no one is taking me seriously, and I’m just expected to keep waiting.\nI’m done waiting. I’m done feeling like I have to justify myself to anyone. He thinks he can get away with this, and he probably feels like I’m too shy or quiet to speak up. He’s wrong. The next time I see him, I’m going to make it clear that I’m not afraid anymore. I’m not going to pretend everything is okay. I don’t care if he feels uncomfortable. He doesn’t get to control the narrative anymore.\nI’m done with the silence. I’m done hoping that someone else will fix this for me. I’m going to take control of my own story, no matter what. He doesn’t have power over me anymore. The truth is enough.(There’s so many other details that I thought were too much to add but lmk if yall wanna know )",

        "selftext": "I have been dating and living with my GF for 2.5 years, both in our 40's. About 9 months into our relationship I started seeing some red flags. I went to a funeral away from home, I had been gone for less than a week when she called and blew up on me about not calling her sooner. I was there for the funeral of a woman who was my 2nd Mom, she told me she would be better off with her ex or dead than with me. It really crushed me. I decided we needed a break and she ended up coming we got back together, no apology from her.\n\nThe past 2 years have been tumultuous. I have taken my time on lots of things but anything I do is met with intense screaming and the most insane rage fits you can imagine. Throwing stuff, breaking walls. Its insane. If I go away for work, I don't love her and am cheating, if I go visit my child in another state, even worse.\n\nI went to visit 2.5 weeks ago and the 2nd night I was here was just hell. 2 hours of her telling me I'm a pos, all I do is hurt her, I'm a horrible man, I suck. That Friday she told me if I didn't come back Saturday or I break up with her, she'd take revenge, another huge red flag. \n\nOn to today, I called her, if I don't I'm a pos. She starts asking wtf do I want, I told her well if I don't call you get mad. We started sort of talking and she said are you going to be back tomorrow? I told her probably not, she then proceeded to say, verbatim, \"If you do not come back, I will destroy your entire family.\"\n\nThis shocked me. I made my mind up then and there that we are done, I her that is it. She then said are you serious, you could have came back and have a fresh start, but yet the whole time I'm gone it has been \"I'm going to make you pay for hurting me and will put you through hell.\" \n\nI know she was manipulating me, but I really love her. I still do. When she isn't angry, she is the best woman I know. I feel so guilty to end it. I've spent all night crying.  It just sucks.",

        "selftext": "I (28F) met a sort of colleague (21M) this week at a work conference, we both work for the same parent company but come from separate sister companies. We went out as a big group at the end of the second night for drinks and one of his coworkers (F, not sure on age, maybe 40) was telling me all about him and how he was single, I of course think “well this is great” because he sounds like an absolute freaking sweetheart. Spoiler alert: he indeed is. I could feel his eyes on me for the rest of the night, we chatted some, when a few of us left to go back to the hotel we were at across the street, we linked arms. Hugged in the elevator with a few flirty back touches, held hands in the hall as he walked me to my room. Nothing happened beyond that, I had already decided nothing would as we both had been drinking and while we were completely lucid, it wouldn’t have been right. We briefly chatted the next day (which was the last day), I had also messaged him via Teams to thank him a little while after we separated for the night because it was really sweet that he made sure I got “home” (as he called it) safe. I haven’t had anyone do that for me before. Now I have a gigantic crush on someone I really barely know, I followed him on LinkedIn and he viewed my profile but that’s it. Do I just leave it now? I don’t want to come across as weird, I found him on instagram and debated following him but I am suspecting that will be too far. I just want to get to know him more but does it seem like that ship has sailed? I’ve never had my head twisted up like this before. It’s a bizarre feeling. Anyways, that’s my word dump. ",

I didn't expect him to say it or get all pissy bc he didn't say it. I just wanted him to know that I love him.\r\n\r\nI know the fact I said I loved him scared him a bit. Because growing up abused can do that to some ppl so I had to prove my sincerity. I was always interested in the him. And I wanted him to be interested in me. I was very loyal. Some questionsble stuff happened but trusted him but I was still loyal to him. I don't know what he was really doing. We aren't 'official' it's a technicality but I was still loyal. \r\n\r\nI knew it like you but I didn't know how much. You would come over all the time and it's been a lot of time together. We we play video games and fool around every once in awhile but there is really no official talk on whether to date or not. I was in love with him still but I didn't know if he felt the same way. He was the type to bottle up his emotions and when the time was right boom all the emotions came out at once.\r\n\r\nIt's those tender times when ppl get very honest. He was sweet and I enjoyed what we were doing. But nothing compelled him to say I love you, so I was hurt. I mean you're with somebody you love and you enjoy what you're doing I feel the natural tendency is to tell them you love them. But everybody is different. I think there was an ample opportunity for him to tell me how he felt about me. Something tangible, something concrete. Something I could hear. That's all I wanted to hear. \r\n\r\nI've said before in other relationships it's after everything was over. I'm usually tears because everything was so intense but I knew deep down in my heart that I love them. Saying I love you are powerful words and I don't ever say then lightly. I have to know it before I say it. So it means a lot for me. It's a moment of pure vulnerability.\r\n\r\nI was just hurt for a long while. It just caused me to grow quiet with depression. I kept thinking I love this man. And I know he loves me too, I think. Him saying I love you became a tug of war. It's was a competition. An iron will to not say it. Yeah, we're kind of stubborn. It's fun for like a week but it it continues you just lose all hope. I should have asked him but I know if you're not compelled to say it on your own or you'll feel pressured. I wanted him to spontaneously say it. Just cut the environment with a knife. \r\n\r\nI still love him. And I would totally try again if he came and asked me. But it seems like he has moved. And I'm sad. I'm very broken up but him leaving. I don't chase and I don't beg. I look to Mel Robbins for advice, and she says, 'If they want to leave Let Them'. It's his decision so I just have to accept it. I think about him everyday, all the time. And I can't help but wonder if he really does love. I think I'll always wonder. I know I would never marry and I would become an Old Maid and sadly, being romantic, I would wait forever for him to tell me it loves me.\r\n",

Got (in my opinion, MIS-)diagnosed and put on meds and placed in therapy. Cool, maybe this will help? Hated the way meds made me feel. Second suicide attempt at 16. Inpatient mental health, more meds, more psyche appointments. \n\nMy mom  was my rock through it all, she suffered with her own mental health struggles through her life, but that motivated her not have me go through the pain she experienced growing up. She was my best friend and roll model. While i was in the psyche ward and during her visitation, just seeing her cry over me wanting to end my own life really changed something in me.\n\nI poured everything into truly trying to want to live. regular therapy, meds, CBT, group sessions; everything.\n\nMy next attempt was at 20. I barely remember it, but what I'm told, it's the closest I got.\n\nThrew myself back into therapy. More meds that made me feel worse. After now 10 years of therapy and medicine after medicine, I was so over it and so sick of it. Sick of it all and the whole process. I learned all the stupid techniques and mind tricks and there was always a barrier because I knew if I said the wrong thing they'd send me back to inpatient. \n\nHonestly, for a while, I was doing good. I was using the healthy thinking tricks and all that jazz.\n\nThen my mom died.\n\nSuicide is a permanent solution to an impermanent problem? false. The state of problems is constant and i just want it to stop.\n\nI've been fighting my whole life to want to live, I'm just so tired of fighting to cling to a life I don't even want. \n\nI'm barely even going through the motions anymore. At this point I hope I just get hit by a train or something. Did you know most successful suicides involve firearms but most women chose poison / OD?\n\nNo one in my life knows it's this bad. They know I'm hurt, and depressed, but they don't know how deeply it goes and there's no way I'm going to make them suffer like I am\n\nI want to believe things can get better.

        "selftext": "I (22F) broke up with my (20M) bf yesterday… I know it’s a long read, hopefully my writing skills are engaging enough!!! \n  \nFor the last 1.5 weeks my bfs family has been visiting. \nFirstly, I got into a discussion with him, his sister(Bella), and his friend(Jack) earlier in the week. During which Bella called me a bitch, saying that she doesn’t trust me, that I’m disrespectful to her, and her entire family, and that I’m manipulative towards her brother. She has a history of getting wayyy too involved in our relationship, this I’ve talked to my bf about multiple times. Even his friend Jack started ganging up on my bf and I. They both stated that they get extremely uncomfortable when him and I are around each other and can’t stand when we are at all physical with each-other. Oh btw Bella started f**** Jack about 3 weeks ago (who is my bfs roommate, even though bf has stated how it makes him feel betrayed and like he’s going to lose Jack) She has ruined multiple previous friendships of his due to her sleeping with his best friends and dumping them. (This convo was the first time I had heard any of this from Bella or Jack) After the convo, I tried to express to her that we should talk more to try and resolve things so there is no animosity, despite the convo not going well. (Btw my bf never protected me in that argument what so ever and never called his sister or friend out at all, even after I talked to him about it) \n  Continuing forward I felt uncomfortable around the entire family (I regularly felt left out, or treated as if I don’t exist, and often ignored even before this) I clearly stated this to my bf and there wasn’t much said on his end other than sorry. For the next few days I felt alone for the most part and started to emotionally detach to protect myself, I made sure to let my bf know. I reached out to him multiple times afterwards to tell him how I felt, almost everyday, I asked for his support and how I felt he wasn’t protecting me. I told him it is his responsibility to make me feel safe with his family. He insisted that I come hang with his family, leaving me felt unheard and ignored, knowing that I’m uncomfortable around them at this point 100%. I wanted him to set boundaries with his sister, his friend and his family so that we can just have a happy relationship and worry about our own issues. A few nights ago, his mom said she wants to have a chat with everyone. Instantly I did not want to go. I talked to my parents about it and thought “maybe I should see what they have to say…” mistake… my bfs parents were instigating the entire convo, bringing up things I’ve done in the past in MY relationship like falling asleep on my bfs couch while he wasn’t there (one time, and my car was stuck in the snow at that time) His mom and dad attacked me, saying “You’re not his roommate, you don’t need to be there if he’s not) \n  Furthermore she said” The last few times I’ve seen you, you look unhappy, with no joy in your eyes, you look stressed.” His dad said “don’t hinder him, don’t be tied down to him at all.” And stating “if you guys are arguing or have any negativity now it’s only going to get worse.” Also attacking my bf saying there is something wrong with him because he feels anger sometimes. I told his mom that I need boundaries, she said, “ If everyone is just nice to each other you don’t need boundaries.” So, that night after that convo, I felt awfully attacked, my bf said he was going to come over to my place before that convo, so afterwards I said okay I’m ready to go. He said he can’t go because his mom wouldn’t give him permission and it would make his dad unhappy…  To make this situation worse they all just moved into new apartments (my bf, Jack, and Bella) where they live next door to each other…\n  In the end I told him that I needed him to prioritize our relationship and protect me. And that I deserve to be his best friend… not put on the back burner. I felt I had already tried to tell him so many times how I felt with his family that it’s better to be a short and sweet reasoning. ",

        "selftext": "2 months ago I did the LifeAlert Limbo and fell down the stairs like a granny. Terribly embarrassing, but it was significantly worse when I realized I was going to puke. I had gone from vertical to horizontal in record time, smacking my head with a couple hundred pounds of force about 5 times while I did some carpet sledding down the stairs.\n\nThankfully, my wife knew right away I probably had a head injury but also knew that there wasn't shit that the ER could do unless I had signs of a brain bleed (I did not, and she works in the ED and knows they would just give me tylenol and call it good). She monitored me closely and I woke up the next day in denial, feeling...off. She didn't believe me that I said I was fine, but I really insisted it and would not entertain the idea of going to see the doctor. Looking back on it, my reasoning was seriously impaired and I had suspicions that the doctors were evil somehow. It gets worse.\n\nI would describe it as almost being in a paranoid nightmare. I was determined that nothing had happened and I was overreacting (because that's what my parents would've said). I dropped everyone off and went to work like normal, getting madder and madder at various people for imaginary/small slights, mostly for no reason at all. I started to spiral into a delusion that people were plotting against me and I was stuck in fight or flight mode all day. It got worse on the second day when I was working from home and I caught myself writing an angry email.\n\nI had this horrifying moment of clarity. Wait, that's not my writing. That's not me. That's not something I would ever do. This deep sense of dread overtook my whole body and I knew I had to confess my fears to my wife.\n\nI remember when I went downstairs and she thought I was having a stroke. I babbled something about \"concussion\" and \"tell my boss I need a break for a bit\" and honestly...it's a huge blank past that point for weeks after.\n\nWhat I heard from other people was that I went to the doctor and they confirmed I did manage to have quite a concussion, bordering on moderate TBI because I had impaired speech, memory, eye focus, coordination, etc. Because I had gone about those two stressful days just as hard as I normally do, that did major damage that set me back for weeks at least.\n\nI lost memory from December-half of February. It's just gone. I only suffer the consequences of whatever deranged nonsense I was up to during that time.\n\nI was unable to read or write without help or profound effort for...a while. Not sure how long. I was definitely totally unable to drive safely as I forgot how to judge distance, speed, and how hard to push the accelerator.\n\nI went to a specialized TBI clinic and they confirmed that there's not really anything you can do except rest and participate in physical therapy to learn how to use your body again. They said it was a \"functional injury\" rather than a \"structural injury\" so we don't have high enough resolution scans or some shit. I just wanted something. ANYTHING. Nope, just painkillers and lots of rest.\n\n\"Rest\" was agonizing. Being in the darkness with nothing but silence was actual torture. It made it worse, but I craved some kind of stimulation to keep me out of my paranoid and angry thoughts. I spent way too much time working and on screens. So much more than I should have. It kept setting me back. It kept causing me pain, but it was better than feeling alone, isolated, and psychotic.\n\nI had to relearn how to move my body because my body felt like a mech suit I was controlling remotely. My senses felt distant and unfamiliar. My eyes followed their orders as if they were suggestions, not commands.\n\nMy emotional regulation and impulse control reduced to that of my toddler. When he would scream, I wanted to as well even though I used to be cool as a cucumber. When he would flip shit, I had to go storm off not to overreact. I couldn't stop myself from inhaling half a box of Oreos merely because they were there.\n\nThere's so much more but my eye and brain stamina aren't keeping up right now. I will say that I think I'm at 80% now. My speech is mostly normal and my coordination is almost back. I suddenly remembered how to drive a couple weeks ago. The main struggle is overall stamina and sensitivity to light/noise. If I push too hard, I will get a migraine or throw up. But until that point--I'm nearing normal again.\n\nI attribute a good chunk of my recovery to the fact I have been continuing low-dose ketamine therapy. I have a quarter to half of my typical dose and I suddenly get a big jump in progress a day or two after. Makes a lot of sense because its whole thing is neurogenesis but WOW this is an under-researched area. I got called a pioneer for merely having the balls to see what would happen :D\n\nLife lesson: don't be me",

        "selftext": "Imagine trying to brush your hair, but your hand won’t cooperate. Imagine trying to cook a simple meal, but every movement turns into a painful challenge. Imagine loving art, music, or any other hobby, but every attempt reminds you that your body doesn’t function the way it should. These aren’t just passing moments—this is my life with Erb’s Palsy.\n\nDaily Challenges: The Simplest Things Become a Battle\n\nEvery morning when I wake up, the first thing I face is pain. Not just mild discomfort, but a sharp, electric pain that sometimes jolts me out of my sleep. The stiffness and weakness in my arm make even the simplest tasks—getting dressed, tying my hair—exhausting and time-consuming.\n\nCooking, for example, isn’t just a fun activity for me; it’s a test of patience and endurance. Chopping vegetables, holding pots, or even just stirring a pan can be tiring and painful. Every task requires planning, adaptation, and a new trick to overcome the obstacles my body puts in my way.\n\nPity… The Feeling That Bothers Me More Than Pain\n\nIf there’s one thing I hate more than the pain itself, it’s the pity in people’s eyes. There’s nothing more frustrating than seeing that look of “poor you” or hearing the unnecessary sympathy in their voices.\n\nFor example, I love video games, but I rarely tell people that I play. Why? Because I know what happens next. As soon as they find out I have Erb’s Palsy, their behavior changes. They start making things easier for me, avoiding real competition, treating me like I need special kindness. That’s not what I want. I don’t want to win anything out of pity—I want to be treated like everyone else, judged by my actual abilities, not my disability.\n\nThis isn’t just an occasional experience; it happens in almost every social interaction. Even when people don’t say anything, I can see it in their faces—they feel sorry for me, as if my life is over. But the truth is, I’m living my life in my own way. I don’t need their pity to remind me of what I already know.\n\nThe Psychological Toll: More Than Just Physical Pain\n\nMany assume that the hardest part of Erb’s Palsy is the physical struggle, but in reality, the mental and emotional toll is much worse. Knowing that my body limits me, watching others do the simplest things effortlessly while I have to work twice as hard—it’s a heavy burden on my heart.\n\nThe hardest days are the ones when I feel helpless, when I need assistance with things I wish I could do on my own. Those are the moments when frustration, sadness, and sometimes even anger hit the hardest. Not because I don’t accept myself, but because I wish life was just a little bit easier.\n\nFear of the Future… Will Anyone Ever Accept Me?\n\nOne of my biggest fears is that I may never find someone who truly accepts me for who I am. How can someone see me as a real choice for marriage when even I sometimes struggle to see myself that way? In our society, marriage is often associated with perfection—with someone fully capable, with no “flaws.” And I can’t help but feel like I fall short of that standard. I constantly see myself as less than others, as if I’m not enough. My confidence is shaky at best, and instead of embracing who I am, I often find myself hiding—avoiding situations where my condition might be noticed, dodging conversations that could lead to awkward stares or unwanted pity.\n\nI wish I didn’t have to feel this way. I wish I could believe that someone will see me for more than just my arm, that they will look past my physical limitations and recognize everything else I have to offer. But deep down, I fear that my condition will always be a barrier, something that makes people hesitate before choosing me.\n\nThe Burden on My Family\n\nI’m not the only one affected by this—my family lives through it with me. I see them trying to help, I see the worry in their eyes when they notice my pain, and I know they wish they could do more. And that feeling—that silent acknowledgment that I’m a source of concern, even if they never say it—hurts in a way that words never could.\n\nEven when they don’t express it, I know they carry the weight of my condition too. They want to see me happy, independent, and free from pain, but they also know that my life will never be as easy as they wish it to be.\n\nSports and the Never-Ending Pain\n\nExercise, something that should be a way to relieve stress and strengthen the body, is just another struggle for me. Some exercises are impossible, others require modifications, and even when I find something that works, the pain is always there to remind me that I’m different.\n\nA Visible Condition… and the Mistake That Ruined My Life\n\nErb’s Palsy isn’t just a hidden condition—it’s obvious. My hand didn’t develop properly, and the difference in strength and size between my arms is noticeable. This only adds to my challenges, making people immediately aware of my condition, leading to more pity, more questions, and more situations I don’t want to deal with.\n\nAnd the worst part? This didn’t have to happen. This was all because of a medical mistake. The doctor who delivered me pulled me out by my arm during birth, even though a C-section was necessary due to my mother’s condition. But he didn’t explain the risks, didn’t tell her how dangerous this could be. Instead, he kept pulling, damaging the nerves in my shoulder and leaving me with a lifelong disability.\n\nHow can one careless medical decision take away someone’s future? How can a doctor make such a reckless choice without fully informing my family of the consequences? This is my reality every single day. Every time I struggle with pain, every time I fail to do something simple, I remember that this wasn’t supposed to be my fate—this was caused by someone else’s negligence.\n\nWhy Am I Sharing This?\n\nBecause I want to raise awareness about Erb’s Palsy. Most people don’t know about it or understand how much it affects a person’s life. They see someone who looks mostly normal but don’t realize the battles they fight every day.\n\nThis isn’t about seeking pity—it’s about understanding.\n\nIf you know someone with Erb’s Palsy, remember that they face challenges you may not see. And if you have it yourself, you’re not alone. There are others who understand your pain, your frustrations, your fears. And together, we prove that even when life is unfair, we can still live it with strength and purpose.",

        "selftext": "TLDR; I am juggling my own independence and pleasing my family. \n\nI (23F) am the youngest of my family. My family setup is out of the norm. For context - my dad is 71 and mom is 50. They got divorced when I was in college about 4 years ago. My brother is in his 40s (we share a dad) and my sister is 30 (we share a mom). I am the only child between my two parents. I am the only person in my family to get a bachelor’s degree except my dad, who got his in the 70s. I am now about to graduate with my master’s degree. Ever since the divorce, my mom and sister moved to my area, leaving my dad in my childhood home over 5 hours away. I have been living part-time with my mom and part-time with my boyfriend (29M) of one year. My boyfriend and I are not ready to fully move in together yet, and I want to get my own apartment after graduating. \n\nNeither my parents nor my grandparents support this decision. My sister doesn’t care and I cut off my brother a few months ago. Outside of my boyfriend, I feel really lonely. I have always been a people-pleaser, especially when it comes to my parents. I never wanted to rock the boat and I just wanted them to be proud of me. \n\nI know I am incredibly privileged - my parents love me, my mom specifically pays for my health insurance and helps me pay for my car, I was able to get a higher education with their help and support. I know so many people do not get that from their parents, and I try my best not to take that for granted. \n\nThat being said, I often find myself feeling indebted to them, when in all actuality, I didn’t ask for any of these things. I want to be more independent. I want to find my own confidence outside of constantly appeasing others. I pay for all of my day-to-day expenses, but I want to have more responsibility. I want to grow as a person on my own. \n\nI am sure that I am going to move out anyway, but the feelings I have just suck. I’m tired of trying to alter my life to please them - and I try to stop doing that but it’s insanely hard to draw that line. Both of my parents emotionally depend on me a lot of the time, which adds another layer. \n\nOn top of that, they don’t agree with the work I want to go into after I graduate. They want me to do something they deem as “safe” and not something “heavy.” However, I didn’t go into my career (social work) wanting to avoid the hard stuff - in fact, it’s the exact opposite. And these two opinions that my family have just really leave me feeling overall unsupported. \n\nI know this issue is so minuscule in the grand scheme of the world, but I had to get my feelings out somewhere.

        "selftext": "Alright, I guess I got a story to come clean about. Back in 84 a buddy and I were staying at the MGM Grand, before it was the GSR, and we were at the roulette table at 2 am. We were of course plastered and as we were losing everything at this table, two exotic looking women came up to us and got real touchy.\n\nNext thing you know we're doing Peruvian cocaine off of their asses in our hotel room, and hours later we were all shooting up heroin in the bathroom. They told us their names were Lynn and Ronnette, and they had this plan to murder Ronald Regan, who was supposed to be in the area within that week.\n\nMy buddy John was so hopped up on coke and heroin that he got so immersed in this idea, and for the following week we lived in this room in the MGM planning out our assassination. I wasn't too into the idea, I guess I was more bored than anything, but I was still there to help. Somehow these two women had an endless supply of drugs and we just kept spiraling. I don't think i slept for that entire week.\n\nWhen we got to the day before Regan was supposed to be here, there was news that he wasn't going to be in Reno due to an accident, and the two women freaked the fuck out. They burst into our hotel room and got on top of John, stabbing him repeatedly, saying he was working with the FBI, saying he was a snitch, saying the plan was ruined all because of him.\nI still picture the blood splattering onto my face, and my horror as Lynn tried to strangle me after killing my friend.\n\nWe had a pistol under the bed, and as Lynn was trying to kill me i just kind of rolled over so we would both be on the floor. I took the gun, turned the safety off, and blew Lyr brain out. Ronette watched in horror.\nWe both had killed our best friends that day, and we had realized what we had and just let eachother live. I saw her again sometime in the early 90s at a Motley Crew show.\n\nSomeone in the reno subreddit asked about our darkest casino stories, and I figured i should share here too. ",

        "selftext": "So how am I feeling? I feel pretty pathetic, worthless, I literally provide no value to society. I am an old geezer while everyone around me is doing great. Honestly as the title suggests, I've lost hope\n\nWhere do I even begin, I guess I will start where the this saga currently starts which is when I graduated late for my cohort because I failed a few classes and had one exam left which I did so that left me finishing my degree Dec 2019 as a Computer Engineer. I took a job that allowed me to travel which I did but we all know what happened in March 2020 and I had to cut my job and travel short which led me home. From 2020 to 2022 was a lull, I did nothing and was just vibing. I definitely regret it now with everyone who was putting in the work so that when the jobs came back, and they did, they'd be ready. The tech wave was upon us and I while on paper should have been good, was certainly not able to capitalize on the opportunity. When things started to open back up, I was still ill-prepared. I applied haphazardly, I clearly didn't have the skills to program but I was pretty aimless in my job application. Looking back, I definitely should have been productive since this was the tech boom and I was riding the wave in certain parts and made some money but still, never had a full-time job. The year goes by and I decide that I needed to escape so I spent a bit of time not being productive and just doing random things that would check stuff off my bucket list. I thought that time would be able to reset me into a head space of getting a job. So when I came back mid 2023, I again applied to many but no luck. Same thing different day, 2024 comes and goes, I try the same thing of leaving my city to get a fresh perspective and start. During this ordeal, I did manage to get some interviews and more with help with a few connections but they all led to dead ends. I am now back at home and as of right now I have a better routine, better path and now have some help with my progress but still everything looks bleak. I thought the change in scenery would help push me, and also my desperation would help push me to actually get a job but I failed.\n\nOver this time, I've accumulated a large amount of debt. I know that once I get a job, I know I can clear it but with this long stretch of taking L after L after L, I am losing hope. I have gotten some interviews within the last year but on top of the job market being rough and my own incompetence, it has led to not getting any roles. I have gotten many great life experiences in the last 5 years but the core pillar of life I would say, finding a bloody job has been an impossible mission for me.\n\nI do not know where I am going with this, I just wanted to share how I got to where I am today, and how hopeless I feel. If you've made it this far, thank you for reading. I hope to be able to update you all on better news sooner rather than later but the current world climate is looks to take a turn for the worse. Man life feels and looks bleak lol\n\nI'm putting this into the void mostly as an outlet for the overwhelming sense of failure I've been carrying, but I'm also curious if anyone else has navigated this particular kind of limbo – where time keeps passing but your professional life feels frozen in place. Sometimes I wonder if there's something fundamental I'm missing, or if this is just the brutal reality of trying to enter tech after a gap. Either way, it helps knowing I'm not alone in this particular rough patch",

        "selftext": "This happened 10 years ago, It was my fault, I shouldn't have snapped. It still eats me up from the inside every single day. If I could go back and do things differently, I would in a heartbeat.\n\nTen years ago, when I was 16 years old, this new kid started at school. I was really into Minecraft back then, and he was wearing a Minecraft t-shirt. I didn't have anyone to play with, so I approached him and tried to start a conversation. He was really hesitant and shy at first, but when I asked him about the shirt and complimented it, he lit up. We got to know each other a bit and planned to play together.\n\nWe played together for quite a few times and had fun, but eventually I got bored of the game and went outside with my friends instead. My friends didn't like him, so we never invited him; and that's when he started to get a little clingy, he would constantly keep asking to play and wouldn't take the hint if I said no. He had also asked our friend group if he could play outside with us quite a few times, and I didn't mind him and would have welcomed him, some people in the group didn't want him there, so I went along with it.\n\nHe started following me around a bit later and pestering me quite often. He would follow me around and talk about memes, YouTube videos, and Minecraft, often talking about it nonstop for up to 10 minutes without even giving me a chance to speak.. This kept going on for quite a while, and the whole time, I was getting more and more irritated, yet the more we spoke, the more I was getting irritated. I was too scared to back out of the conversation politely, which led to my irritation building up over time.\n\nThen I had one bad day, which took away a life.\n\nOne day, we were at the bus station, and he approached me and started chatting. At one point, all the anger built up over time inside me exploded, and I snapped and I told him:\n\n\"Just shut up! I was never your friend, we just played Minecraft together a few times. You are extremely annoying and nobody likes you\"\n\nThe next day, the teacher sat us down and told us that he had committed suicide, my entire world shattered. I instantly knew that what I said caused this and that I had caused him to commit suicide.\n\nI was invited to the funeral, during which his parents spoke to me and revealed an extremely important detail about him. It turns out he was very autistic and had severe trouble making friends all his life, and he was obsessed with MC. When he met me and we played, he became really happy and wouldn't stop talking to his parents about how he finally made a good friend, they knew me as his best friend.\n\nThis shattered my world, I didn't know he was autistic and considered me his only friend, I didn't realise how important our sessions playing together were for him.  But that doesn't justify what I did, I should have never said that. I still can't play Minecraft after a decade.\n\nToday is the 10th anniversary of his death, and I needed to post his because it should have been me, not him.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the kind support. Many have been suggesting therapy, while I do think it's a good idea, I don't know if it will help. I can't change the past, but I can be a better person than I was.\n\nAnd to those telling me this is AI, this is just how I write, think what you want but it doesn't matter to me. Yesterday was the anniversary of his death and a lot of fucked up feelings resurfaced, and I wrote this in an emotional state, I didn't want to keep it bottled up and I really needed some sort of way to let it out.",

        "selftext": "My ex common law wife of 21 years have been on the rocks and fighting a lot since August. On Friday morning we officially ended it and I feel relieved. I loved this woman, still do but can’t let myself, and she has been gaslighting me since August. She denies having gaslit me, but our child called her out on it. The child is 16 and has witnessed all that has happened in the last few months. They have seen that I have tried to live my ex, that I have tried to be here for her, that I have tried. They also notice that the ex has not. This is a relief to me that I’m not the only one to see it. We have a lot to work out over the next while, but right now we are both in the not speaking stage. She has been medicated for well over a year, and never told me until August. She has been hiding in her bedroom, we are lucky enough to have the space for a spare room, while I have been out in the house. I won’t hide, she left me, if she doesn’t want to be around me that’s on her. I pay most of our bills out of my pay, she has always been a minimum or barely over works type person. And while I loved her, that was tolerable, but not now that we aren’t together. I told her she was going to have to step up and pay more bills. I have always been the higher payed of us. And have always covered her part if she couldn’t.  I never complained about it, I waited my other half to have a good life. \nShe started getting ill, found out she has gluten and lactose intolerance. Anyone with either knows it can get expensive to make it work, especially since she had her gall bladder removed. So many of the gluten free items were also off the table do to ingredients. She has no idea how much our child and I sacrificed in our diet and such for her, all without complaint. Actually the opposite, because it has forced us to eat healthy. I have alway been our household chef, can’t even get her to boil some Kraft dinner on days she’s off and I work, but I have learned soooooo many her diet friendly dishes, and spent soooooo much $$ on her diet. When I told her I was no longer going to supply her food and that my food bill just got so much cheaper. I pay for our child, I am the father and will take care of them no matter what, but I’m not paying 2.5 ways any longer. Anyways I told her that and she gave the child a ride to school. Child told me after school that mom had a panic attack while driving that she had fuc*ed up and had to get another or better job now. To be frank, this is something that had always been a sore spot in our relationship. I was fine taking care of things but I did ask her to help more so WE could do more vacation like things. I can cover life, but not save for fun as well. Now she’s afraid because I took her caretaker away. She isn’t upset she broke my heart, she just cares about the finances. I cannot love her any longer after this. So now I need to get some booty, which has been *maybe* once a month for the last 16 years. Get that, have a blast and move TF on. \nYes this post is positive, I am accepting that this is my new life and I am relieved. It’s been a long time since I’ve felt relief. \nIf you got this far, thanks for listening. Enjoy life, it’s too short as it is!",

I really like when he does this and I think he’s pretty good at it honestly, but sometimes I think he doesn’t want to/doesn’t like it and I feel like it’s because of me or my scent? I am the first girl he’s been with and done anything with so it could be that maybe he’s just getting used to it or something. But the first time we did this I wasn’t showered (I wasn’t expecting to be doing anything sexual with him at that time it just happened) and I know it was a new experience for him but something came up later about the scent and it being new to him and needing to get used to it. He has eaten me out a few times since then and says he likes it and wants to do it for me, but something is telling me that he doesn’t really want to and I really believe it’s because of my scent. Though I’ve never had any complaints about my smell down there, it’s always been an insecurity of mine (body odor in general but especially my vagina). This is mostly because of being molested when I was younger and my parents not caring to bathe us properly also I just always have felt like I didn’t smell good and that I was nasty. But I shower regularly, I know how to wipe as a woman, drink plenty of water, wear cotton underwear etc. I’ve also been to the gyno a lot just due to pregnancy, child birth and other things. I’m clean as in no STDs and I always ask the doctors about my smell/ if they smell it or everything being okay and they always say I smell normal. I am very sensitive in that area so things do throw off my ph easy so I have to watch my sugar intake, certain foods, dyes in clothing/towels, products I use and put around it. I never feel clean enough though and want my boyfriend to like my smell and really enjoy eating me out for me but also for him. This has kind of hurt my feelings, not because he was rude about this or tried to make me feel bad but just because of my own insecurities with smells  and feeling like he doesn’t want to go down on me because of this. Other guys I have been with have really liked eating me out and have even came from eating me out, but this is the only person I care about what they think and I crave for him to go down on me. What can I do to make this better for him without forcing him to do it? And is there anything else I can do to make myself smell better for him? I can’t use scented lubricants because of how sensitive I am! But I don’t want to feel so insecure about this with him, especially when I know he wasn’t/isn’t trying to make me feel insecure. ",

        "selftext": "I (20F) have been babysitting for over a decade, and I’ve worked with all kinds of kids. But this was the first time I left a babysitting interview feeling genuinely unsettled. The more time I spent with this child, the more I felt like something wasn’t right. Maybe I’m overthinking, but I can’t shake this feeling.\n\nAt first, everything seemed normal. The mom was nice. she was very welcoming. however, a few minutes into our conversation, she casually mentioned they had a previous babysitter, and “something bad happened.” She wouldn’t explain because her daughter “picks up on everything.” That immediately made me wonder what I was walking into.\n\nWhen I arrived, the little girl (almost 5) wasn’t just shy—she acted like she didn’t want me there. I brought a small coloring book as a gift, and she ignored it completely. While we wrapped a present for her best friend, she rejected every suggestion I made (adding stickers etc.) I understand that meeting a new person who could potentially be in your life can be a huge transition for a child. I just felt like the vibe was a little bit off.\n\nThen things got… weird..\nShe grabbed a drawing she had made, asked her mom to hold it up, and out of nowhere, she stabbed the mouth with scissors. Then she stuck her fingers in the hole and called it a “paper puppet.” That threw me off. I gently tried to redirect her energy by making a small Hello Kitty puppet from the coloring book I brought—something fun and lighthearted. luckily, I was able to divert her attention from the violent behavior and towards something more appropriate.\n\nAt one point, she got red marker all over her hands and refused to clean them. Instead, she ran around touching everything while her mom begged her to clean up. Eventually, her mom was able to get her to wash her hands but it really made me pause and think.\n\nLater, in her playroom, she randomly said, “My mom’s dad died.” That alone wouldn’t have been so strange, except he passed away before she was even born—she never met him.\n\nAfter that, every single make-believe game revolved around hospitals, dying, and things not coming back to life. One of her characters even faked being sick just to go to the hospital. It wasn’t just one dark-themed game—it was every game.\n\nThen came the moment that really unsettled me. \n\nWe were playing ball, and she kept telling me to back up. Every time I did, she told me to go back more. I turned around and realized I was standing right in front of the staircase. And then she told me to keep going. For a split second, I genuinely felt like she was trying to make me fall back. I stopped and told her I couldn’t go any further. \nAt the end, she also threw the ball at the cat..\n\nI left feeling really conflicted. And then the mom texted my boyfriend’s mom saying, “Omg, she’s so sweet! She’s so, so good with kids!” And while that was nice to hear, it left me feeling… stuck. I always do my best to be patient and kind, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. Part of me wants to give this another chance and perhaps talk to the mom about it.\n\nI don’t know how to feel about any of this. Have any of you had a situation like this? Am I overthinking? Or were there actual red flags here?\n\nedit: any thoughts on how i should go about calling the mother tomorrow? I want to be honest but I only met her once. It’s only out of concern.",

It's only wasting my big heart, pining after someone who stopped loving me a long time ago.\n\nWe met too young. You were depressed from your parents' separation and your dad's infidelity. I helped you get off antidepressants. You never went to prom so when our university threw a formal dance, I asked you to go with me. For your birthday, I bought you guitar lessons with your favorite musician and we drove all the way to Kentucky so you could take them. During a hurricane in Florida once, we got under the same poncho and made out while it rained. We went to six countries together and I moved halfway 'round the world to be with you after we got engaged. You wrote me songs and gave them to me as presents. \n\nI never told you this but my biggest regret with you is a small moment that meant so much to me. We were visiting a cave in Spain and as we were walking out, you wrapped your arm around my waist and said \"I love you so much.\" It was one of the happiest moments of my life...and I should have told you how much I loved you back, but I was too choked up to speak, so I just clung to you.\n\nSix months later, you got bored, called me \"unmysterious,\" and dumped me. I'd moved halfway around the world with you, which meant I had nothing set up when I got home. Had to basically start from scratch.\n\nEven these few years later, I still get teary-eyed thinking about it. About you. \n\nFor a long time, I kept hoping you'd realize what we had. When your family told you \"you'd have a fun life with her.\" When your friends said \"she's the kind of girl you marry.\" I kept hoping you'd realize your mistake.\n\nBut you didn't. Not even when you butt-dialed me when you were with your next girlfriend. Not even after she dumped you. Not after years of me occasionally sending you little \"check-in texts,\" -- my way of leaving the door open for you to talk to me if you wanted.\n\nYou haven't married, you aren't dating. Your mom sometimes still talks to mine and gives updates. I heard through our mutual friends that you told them you think about me a lot, miss me even. But still you haven't reached out. \n\nI feel embarrassed now, for leaving that door open for so long. Even if you came back now, it's too late. I'd feel like an afterthought. I deserve better than \"I was lonely and thought of you.\" Or worse, \"I never found anyone better and I'm scared of being alone.\"\n\nYou're the person I've compared every other guy to, but in the end I think I loved who I thought you were, not who you are. That's my mistake, and one I don't want to keep making. \n\nSo I'm lettin' ya go. I'm putting all my thoughts of you into a little paper boat and setting it to burn as it drifts away on the sea. \n\nI hope you have a wonderful life, my friend. \n\n(Throwaway just in case.)",

        "selftext": "I (27F) have been in therapy for a few years trying to heal as an adult from my traumatic childhood and one of the more shocking realizations that I've come to is just how much of the chronic bullying and abused I endured had to have been absurdly time consuming and required so much effort. Viewing the chronic harrassment I endured as a child with my logical adult brain means realizing just how insane and pathetic it all was. All the family members that swore they loathed me and wanted me dead were literally obsessed with me, but none compared to my youngest brother.\n\nmy brother absolutely tormented me like my tears were his only water supply. He would sneak into my room and steal my personal belongings, spend hours outside my bedroom door laughing and giggling with his friends to keep me awake at night, destroy any art supplies or technology I was given on birthdays or holidays, and he just generally on a daily basis, could not leave me alone for one second. Once when I was forced to clean his room as punishment for a fight he started, I discovered that his closet was literally just a massive pile of my stolen things.\n\nHe was STOCK PILING THEM. I wish I was kidding, or making this  shit up. It was weird af. I remember getting this weird knot in my stomach like I couldn't fathom why a person who spent so much energy hating me so much, would want to hold onto all my personal belongings, and just feeling really strange about it. I tried to point out how obsessive his behavior was to my mother, but she favored him as he was the \"baby\" of the family and would never hear it, and was convinced I just had it out for him, and even when I found physical evidence, she would just refuse to even look at it.\n\nHe was deeply envious of my hobbies, especially my art and actively sought to destroy anything I drew until I became deeply protective of my art, hiding it away in school notebooks where he wouldn't look just so he couldn't find it and rip it up. Eventually I transitioned to digital art and he would just resort to trying to steal my devices, whatever I had he wanted it and would throw tantrums about how unfair it was that I got to have it and he didn't; which was really strange because the very few nice things I was given by my mom and aunts were always for my hobbies, namely art. In comparison my youngest brother had zero creative hobbies but was given anything else he asked for, such as numerous gaming consoles. He took terrible fucking care of them btw, often breaking them on purpose just for the power trip and was always given a new one in a heart beat..\n\nIt wasn't openly talked about but my mother didn't agree with me having technology basically at all and had about the same attitude with my sisters, as a result, I was only permitted to have devices like a cell phone or laptop very sparingly, and I was often discouraged from playing video games in favor of my brothers. I only remember once or twice anyone in my family openly saying the classic \"video games are for boys\" nonesense, but it was pretty obvious that was what was going on as it was extremely rare for me to get a turn on the Xbox, and I begged and pleaded for DS for years and years while my brothers received new ones every year if not every six months or so.\n\nThis is all to say, my youngest brother got way more priveleges at home than I did but for some reason he was wildly envious of anything art related that I had and he didn't despite the fact that he had zero interest in my hobbies whatsoever. He never drew anything, never painted anything, never wanted to make digital illustrations, animations, nothing, even ranted about how \"stupid\". But all of it, he was deeply determined to destroy and take from me for some reason. At one point he even got my mother to forcibly take away my laptop that I used for animations and give it to my youngest brother, which is insane- just the fact that my mother fed and vindicated this obsession was by far the weirdest part. - But once he finally had my laptop which he had obsessed over and attempted to steal or destroy several times over by now, he didn't have anything to do with it, because all the games he liked playing could be played on other consoles, he didn't even like PC games, and the laptop was a basic one with no special gaming upgrades.   \n  \nSo, shocker! The Laptop dedicated to my basic 2D digital drawings and could barely process even that, was not necesarily more exciting or useful than a basic smart phone or ipod touch for someone with literally zero original ideas. So once he had it, he just destroyed it, smashed it to bits with gardening tools like a deranged maniac, so determined to upset me when he realized it didn't benefit him in anyway. He was that obsessed, that he would destroy something that was literally now his, just to upset someone else.\n\nI caught him numerous times sneaking into my room and I begged my mom to give me a proper lock and key to keep him out but she would just refuse saying then I could lock her out too ( she was also a nightmare but that's neither here nor there). \n\nSometimes he would spy on me and then tell others something embarrassing I did while I thought no one was in the room like sing a cringy song or something like that, which was just so weird, as if he just had nothing better to do than fucking watch me do boring cringy shit. \n\nLooking back on all this, it's certifiable. My youngest brother didn't just loathe me, he borderline stalked me. I want to contextualize that many of this happened when he was 10 and I was 16. It's just insane that no one ever took any of this seriously. There were more things like this that just made me feel really weird but I have trouble remembering them as I've buried them.",

        "selftext": "Little more than a week ago my best friend and I confessed our feelings for each other. We agreed to take some time to think about it, because both of us had bad relationship experiences in the past and we didn't know if we were ready to commit to one another. \n\nWe've known each other for about 2 years and instantly became close friends. He's by far the person who knows the most about me and I about him, we would talk for hours and not get bored, we are so compatible I would have never thought it possible. I know his bad sides and his good sides, he really is my best friend, my confidant. I love him. But I guess it was inevitable to catch feelings for him when we spend more than 4 days a week with each other.\n\nThe problem is that even though I feel this way, I can't be with him. The direction our lifes are headed are too diffrent and I can't commit to a realtionship if I know deep down I have to end it. Giving up my dreams in order to be with him would probably work, but only for a time before I'll resent him for it and that would not be fair to either of us. So I have thought long about what I would say to him even before we confessed, but in the moment I was just so swepped up and overwhelmed that I couldn't reject him. Before, I was so sure but right there and then I was uncertain, I wanted to say yes and try a relationship.\n\nLast Wednesday we spoke together with a trusted friend of ours, he's like a counselor and asked him what we should do, we are young and inexperienced and this friend is very wise and gives good advice. Not only was I uncertain but my best friend did have his doubts too, he's aware our paths lead somewhere else but he was willing to compromise his wants in order to try this relationship. After a bit of theoretical back and worth I told him I can't give my dreams up, eventhough I wish I could.\n\nWe dont want to lose each other as best friends and I still love him, but how do we recover from this. We see each other at least 2 days a week, we are in the same course. We like to talk to each other and still do, but it is diffrent and he said he needs time and space, away from me. So we don't hangout anymore. He gets different when I talk about certain topics and I understand, he's heartbroken. He needs time and I want to respect that, so I give him space.\n\nBut I it's not that easy for me, I struggled a lot with self-esteem and self-worth some time ago and still feel like that from time to time. I feel like I'm a broken human. For the next thing you have to know that I don't drink (unless at weddings or similar events), I don't smoke, I don't party or do drugs, you could say I'm boring. But when things get bad, like it is now, if I don't know how to handle it, I'm so close to going down the deep end and ruining my life. \n\nLike I want to drink so much till I blackout, I want to start smoking, I want to get addicted, I want to not feel anymore, I want to hurt myself, to destroy myself. Don't get me wrong I'm not suicidal, but I think it's because that would be to easy, I feel like i need to suffer, that I don't deserve anything better. It breaks me to know that I have to keep my distance from him, so that he can heal, because that voice inside me tells me I\"m worthless and that I'm bad for everyone around me, that I don't deseve to be happy. \n\nAnd I'm just so close on giving up, so close to doing all those things. I think I have just the worst comping mechanism if those are my thoughts when things get tough. I do have a past with self harm so I guess that is deeply ingrained in me. But I dont think I'll do those things, I have friends and family and I don't want to make them worry, that would start a spiral of selfloathing that I don't think I could return from. Then there is also my religion that keeps me from destroying myself, the thought of betraying God is something a can barely entertain, it would break me so deeply because I love Him so much, but then again it is that self hate that I think I deserve. I guess if I go down, I will go down bad. And it's the hardest thing to not listen to this voice inside me, because it's me, I think I deseve nothing better, at the same time I know this is not true. It's like a fight within me and I want to lose and win at the same time. When it gets late it's particularly difficult not to give in.\n\nAnd nothing of all of this can I tell my friends, since I don't want to worry them, I don't want to impose my baggage on them. And the one person who I could have talked to is deeply hurt because of me. \n\nWell I guess thats why I wrote this post on here, to get it of my chest. I hope I didn't violate any rules, since it's my first time posting here. Though I'm sorry if you read all of this and wasted your time. And I apologise for any mistakes since english is not my first language. I hope you have better days than I do. Cheers\n\n",

        "selftext": "Right so uhm I'm a little ashamed to be here so I'm using my burner account. Hoping nobody finds this lol. \n\nI have a best friend, let's call him James. I met James at church because I started going around the same time he became a member of the youth group they hold. I was new to this specific church and James was the one in charge of showing me around, since, as I said, first time there. We bonded over having the same favourite saints. We also both listen to the same music and we have the same favourite composer. It'd be an understatement if I were to say that we were close, we bonded immediately and have been inseperable. Now, James is currently studying theology, but I'm not in university as of right now. \n\nWe also both bonded over wanting to become members of the church. Or uhm I guess like, he wants to become a priest and I want to become a carmelite. English is my 5th language so I'm not sure what you guys call people who are in the church like that. He's felt this calling for a very long time, so have I. We had similar stories to how we came to the holy revelation, so we bonded. \n\nHe's still getting his theology degree, so he's still waiting on that. I, though, have been frequenting our local convent (not Carmelites, not sure what denomination they are) to decide if I want to become a postulate in a discalced community or an ancient observance community. For anyone not religious: discalced carmelites live in isolation, while carmelites of the ancient observance typically have more of a community. I'm leaning towards discalced because I believe it's my calling, but I'm praying on it. \n\nThe problem came in when I realised I started thinking of him every day. Waiting on his calls and texts back. Looking forward to mass just to see him. Essentially, another revelation came to me. I'm in love with him. I know this is,, well not ideal. I've been sitting on this for a while now and I can't seem to let go of it. Not even prayer helps. \n\nI know I need to let this go but I can't seem to. I've always been against the idea of marriage for myself but now it's all I can think about. And this isn't even some phase, I've felt like this for months.\n\nI don't know, any advice? I'm thinking about telling him since like.. he's going to become a priest anyway. I don't know, this is scary. I thought I was asexual and completely aromantic for almost my entire life. \n\nI came to Reddit as there isn't someone in my life to tell. So like uhm.. what do I do? I would ask if anyone is the same situation but I know you're not... ",

        "selftext": "So a bit of background information which is needed for this all to make sense. My first proper relationship was when I (17,F) was 13 with a boy the same age as me and for this to make sense in my head I’ll make a fake name Leon. Leon and I started dating the week before I turned 14 and had been intimate within a month, baring in mind this was my FIRST relationship and probably his 10th. Within 3 months of us dating he was cheating on me with other girls and it wasn’t just like 14 year old cheating it was like sending intimate pictures of himself to these girls. Obviously me being like head over heels, first relationship, I was easily influenced into thinking that this was okay. We were so toxic and my mental health got so low. I wasn’t allowed to leave the house, he would break up with me when I went to my friends house (who was a girl and I am straight), he would pressure me into doing things I didn’t want to do. I obviously thought this was all part of relationships as my parents live together and barely speak to eachother so I’ve never really experienced what ‘normal love’ is like. We dated for a bit over a year and this was a constant. When we finally broke up he was straight to another girl. Obviously being a heart broken 15 year old I was going out with my friends to get over this. I went to meet my friend and ended up at her friends house who were boys. I posted a photo of us on BeReal(😂) and he sent me threats saying he will leak personal photos of me and then got these girls (who he knew I was TERRIFIED of) as they used to bully me to “make me never want to go to school again” with my anxiety and stress at such a high , I did stop going to school and only went in every now and again and to take my GCSEs. During that 2 years, we had been on and off getting back together; would be intimate, would message for months saying how much we missed and loved eachother, then he would get with another girl and then come back everytime it didn’t work with her. For the last couple of months of school I became super close with this group of girls (fake names: Grace, Mary, Laura) Laura, I have known since I was born like we were basically sisters. Would go on holiday together, we like did everything together and we had finally become close again. Mary, I was so close to like we got close so quickly and we’re inseparable. Then Grace we were also really close and we had so much fun with eachother and we knew the ins and out about eachother that we wouldn’t tell the other girls. I would tell her things about my ex and about how much I wished I could get back with him because of how much I loved him and she’d always listen in full confidence and we would trust eachother with everything. Literally 2 days before prom they had this party that I wasn’t invited to but my ex was. Obviously I was upset but it wasn’t them that planned it so it wasn’t their fault. We were getting our nails done for prom and they then were talking all party like what they were going to wear, where they’re spending the night, and that obviously upset me and hurt as they were doing it so blatantly in my face because I wasn’t going (bearing in mind I still wasn’t at school full time so they could easily talk about it when I wasn’t there). That night I ended up in hospital and not one of them checked up on me (they weren’t at the party it was the day before) but my ex did which obviously made me feel AWFUL as he does not care that much about me! The next day they went to the party blah blah and then it was prom. We went together and had a good time until the after party when one of our mutuals told me (he was hammered) that they were talking about how I was faking being in hospital and that I was basically just an attention seeking wh0re. Obviously I have literal documents and stuff of all the medication and treatment I had to have that night so I was not faking and if I was doing it for attention I would’ve done it so blantantly to make them feel bad and I never even mentioned it to them. I left it and then 2 days later we went on a leavers trip to a theme park, all was fine again and I had an amazing time until the bus ride home when they didn’t save a seat for me (we were an inside group of 4 but had a larger girl group of about 10) so I had to sit by myself. They then were shouting about planning anotjer party but the main girl saying it was Laura. I just sat back and let them do this hoping they would invite me but that never happened. I looked like a fool. 2 days later the party was going to happen and it was in a heatwave and we have a lake about 45 mins away from where I lived and we all planned to go together. I called Mary and I told her how the girls who bullied me was going to be there and she reassured me that everything was going to be fine. My grandma had to drive me to the lake and I was waiting for the girls and when they got there I messaged Mary and Laura asking to meet them and then they just flat out left me. I was stranded in this town with people who hated me. My grandma had left and I was just sat balling my eyes out and I was so embarrassed. I just blocked them all and got picked up luckily! The minute I blocked them I was so happy I literally did not care at all that I had no friends anymore. I started working at the local primary and fell in love with it. My life has been on such a high since June 2024. But… I found out yesterday, again being no contact with them all, including my ex, since June and hearing nothing about them. Grace is dating Leon. I really just don’t know how to feel. I’ve been so happy recently and for the whole of the day I just haven’t been able to feel anything. Working today was the first time I just wished I wasn’t there and I just wanted to curl up in a ball and cry. I’m not sad about it but it just feels like a bit of a kick. My family are just telling me to ‘be the bigger person’ and I am but it almost feels like I’m not allowed to be upset about it. I just don’t know how to feel rn and any advice would be so so appreciated. I just feel a bit lost and now I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. The thought of them together makes me feel ill and I know in a couple months I’m going to have to see them at this local festival I work at and I’m terrified because I know it will just upset me and I won’t have work to distract me as it will be during the summer holidays. Please let me know what I should do. ",

        "selftext": "A few years ago, in 2019, I went over to a friend’s house to complete a project. While there, I noticed she had some cats roaming around her yard, and she mentioned that her family also had a few dogs. The dogs were medium sized, and the cats were of normal weight and stature; and I assumed that when the weather became extreme, they would be brought inside for safety and comfort. I barely spared them a glance, trusting that they were cared for. At the time, I didn’t think much of it. Animals are a part of human life, and in the low-income neighborhood that my friend lived in, it was common for pets to live in backyards or spend a lot of time outside. She clearly seemed to love her cats, even though they were not inside the house, and it would be rude for me to question how things were done in her family. In some Florida neighborhoods, it is common for dogs and cats to spend their days outside - the continuously warm environment with the occasional rain is perfect weather for those who can’t afford to have more occupants in already small houses. \nIt was two years of being friends that led to our first sleepover. That was when I started noticing a few odd things in my friend’s household. For instance, her family had recently found a kitten on the side of the road and had taken it in. At first, I thought it was a heartwarming act of kindness. They allowed the kitten to sleep in their beds, cuddle with them, and receive affection. However, as soon as the kitten grew older, they just put it back outside to fend for itself. It struck me as odd, but I dismissed it, thinking perhaps they just didn’t want a full-grown cat inside. This happened with several cats, and they just found a new kitten a few months ago. I didn’t like it, but it wasn’t exactly illegal.\nThe straw that broke the camel’s back was in 2023. It was an extremely hot summer, the hottest it’d been in years. I went over to her house, per usual, but this time with another friend. We decided that before we’d come in, we’d say hello to her dogs. Usually she would tell us that the dogs weren’t important, and would always steer us away. But this time, we wanted to play with them.\nThe dogs were confined in an unbearably small cage—about the size of a wheelbarrow. The space was far too cramped for even one dog, let alone three. They had no shelter from the relentless 100-degree heat, and there was no shade to offer them any respite. The food bowl was empty, devoid of any evidence of kibble, meat, or any form of sustenance. The water they did have was dirty, contaminated with feces, and entirely undrinkable. Feces were scattered all around the cage, indicating that they had been living in these conditions for a long time.\nAs soon as they saw us, the dogs started panting and wagging their tails, shaking with excitement at the sight of people. They were desperate for attention, for care, for relief from their miserable existence. It was heartbreaking. No animal should have to endure such neglect. These dogs weren’t just suffering—they were being denied basic necessities: space, clean water, food, and protection from the elements.\nMy friend’s reaction to our concern was even more shocking. When confronted about the state of the dogs, she simply walked away without a word. There was no explanation, no sign of guilt or concern. It was as if she didn’t see anything wrong with what we had witnessed. I was horrified. I knew I could not ignore what I had seen. This was not just a matter of differing opinions on pet care—this was neglect. Leaving animals in these conditions, without food, clean water, or shelter, is not only cruel but could be considered animal abuse under the law.\nThis experience changed the way I felt about her from then on. I had reported it to animal control, but they did nothing and her family ended up moving the dogs into the garage - a humid, stuffy garage without windows to open and let air in, but bigger than a wheelbarrow, so progress is progress. Animal control did not take the dogs away as I expected, but instead gave a warning. This is one of those stories with no real happy ending. Some people don’t deserve the love animals give so freely. And sometimes, walking away from a friendship is the only right thing to do. We still keep in contact; after all, she was my best friend. But every time I see her face, I’m reminded of those moments, and it doesn’t feel good.\n\n",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because you never know. On mobile so may be weird formatting.\n\nI have decided that after last night, I'm going to break up with my girlfriend. Truthfully, this should've happened a long time ago, and I should've never gotten back with her after the first time.\n\nI (22M) have been dating my soon to be ex gf (21F) for a little over a year and a half. Last night, we had an argument because I decided to stay an extra day at my aunts since its the beginning of spring break. I see my aunt once a year, twice if I'm lucky. Initially, the plan was for me to leave yesterday evening to drive back to my uni town, as I have work all this week. My aunt convinced me to stay, as she said she'd pay me whatever I make in a days work. She lives on the coast, so why wouldn't I take pay to fish for another day off of her dock?\n\nWell, I text my gf this. And she's not happy. Whatsoever. She was at work and said she'd call me after she was off. Well, once she gets off, she proceeds to yell and argue with me. To boil it all down, this was her argument:\n\n1. I never have enough time for her. (I see her almost every evening during the week.)\n2. I bailed on our plans. Again. For family. (My family comes first, especially those I hardly see. We are not married, so I'm not going to prioritize someone I've known maybe 3 years over my family I've known my entire life.)\n3. I'm a liar. (I was up front with her about the entire ordeal of me staying.)\n4. I don't respect her or her time. (I am going to see my family for every second I can.)\n\nFamily is very important to me. I had an gf a long time ago that physically separated me from them and I told myself I would NEVER let anyone do that to me again. I tried to articulate to my gf that this was a spur of the moment decision. She again called me a liar and said that I planned this from the beginning. That when I stay late with my parents and younger sister, I plan from the beginning that I'll lie to her and stay late. Which isn't the case.\n\nThe entire thing just made my blood boil. She was saying that \"It's not because of my family or me seeing them,\" but what else could it be? I see her almost every evening. The only times I don't are because I am VERY involved on campus, have hard classes and need to maintain a good gpa for grad school so I study, or am practicing a hobby OR working. I mean, she's painting it, at least to me, that she wants me all to herself and I can't do that. I won't do that.\n\nThis isn't a new thing. It's been like this for many months. Everytime I go home to see my parents and younger sister (once a month or so), this happens. She gets mad. She calls me a liar. Says I don't respect her or her time. I'm fed up.\n\nI've already talked to her about this. We had a conversation last week about this. I'm done. I'm tired of it. I no longer see a future with her and she is no longer the woman I thought I loved. \n\nI'm leaving my aunts tonight. I'm going to send my gf a text on her cell (we usually use Snapchat to talk), and then block her number once it is delivered. I am going to articulate that I will not put up with her behavior and her driving a wedge between me and my family for her, as I already told her I wouldn't do that ever again for anyone. I'm going to say that if it's an issue, then she needs to find someone else that isn't me. I had fun while it lasted and I hope she does excellent in applying for vet school and her future endeavors. I do not want to talk to her or hear from her again. Even though we live in the same apartment complex, I do not want her at my door ever.\n\nMaybe I'm over reacting. Maybe I'm being harsh. But I've already had someone divide me from seeing my family and I won't let it happen again. I'm just so tired of it all.\n\nTL:DR, soon to be ex gf (21F) gets angry and argues with me (22M) for staying an extra day with my aunt that I hardly see. After an argument last night, I've concluded that this isn't ok and I will be breaking up with her this evening over the phone.\n",

Truthfully I don't know, I don't have any interest in anyone, I am an introvert I love staying at home watching kdramas, reading novels, sleeping. At the end of the call I told them if I had to wed someone it will be best if it is a Lavender marriage or with someone with kids(age doesn't matter).I love kids but I am not ready to have one not now not In the near future. My father call me later and ask me to ask for mom's forgiveness cause I make her cry. \nWhat should I do? I don't want to lie to them to make them happy but I am sad they can't accept my truth.

Many of my close friends knew that I am a trans before I told them so. I am not sure if I truly identify the situation or not but hope that you understood. \n\nI was dating with a girl who seems masculine. She is cis-het even though I did not think so when I met with her. We were doing okay. Cute dates, romantic bonding, sexual tension... Everything was fine as I wish. One day she refereed me as a man, which I hate to hear. I thought she said it by mistaken. Did not talk about it until it occurred a few times more. After the third time, I decided to talk with her about the pronunciations. \n\nps: In my native language we do not use pronounces. Though, still a person can be called as a man or a woman, which hurts me in this context.\n\nIn a proper time, I told her to not call me a man or mr and she asked why. I explained everything I discovered about myself. She was shocked by the things I told her, said that she has no idea what to do and  doesn't know even what to think. I said it's fine, you have time etc. to relax her. \n\nA few days passed and everything was fine as I expected. I have never faced with a negative things after I told my identity crises to my friends. Until 14th of Feb aka. Valentines day.

Did not say anything new, though it was impossible to feel the uncomfortable feelings of her. We had a planned date at night which she canceled. \n\nTwo days after that day, we broke up. Just because I am not comfortable with he/him pronounces. I feel ashamed and useless. I have never been ashamed this much. The only thing I told her that do not use man as she describes me. It led us to break up. I was left alone, since I said truths about myself.  \n\nI feel anger against her, want to take a revenge.

        "selftext": "Not entirely sure what info I need to include here but I really gotta tell someone. My(19) sister (28, I’ll call her Lia) had a daughter with her bf (29, Jay) a couple of years ago, and they tied the knot about three months ago. \n\nI love my sister, I love my brother in law, and I absolutely adore my niece, but I really, REALLY wish they hadn’t gotten married. \n\nAbout a year ago, Lia ended up breaking off her engagement after she found out what his parents thought of her (spoiler: it wasn’t good), and how often they were talking shit about her, even to their grandkids!! And they’d always treated her terribly, blaming her for problems that their son caused, but she stuck it through for her family because she loves em. But yk, after she finally heard what they’d been saying about her she’d had enough. \n\nSo a couple weeks go by, she and Jay coparent their kid, and for the first time since I’ve literally met her, (18 years), she was glowing. She was so happy and so much more confident and comfortable, and as much as I loved Jay and my niece, if seeing them less was what it took to see my sister finally happy, I was okay with that. And there was always a chance that after they’d both take time to work on themselves and feel better, they could try again.\n\nBUT THRN. It hasn’t even been three weeks, and I hear they’re back together!!! And as soon as they are, my sister lost that spark in her eye. Like. Call me crazy for not caring about Jay as much, but there was nothing they could say or do to convince me that getting back together was the best option for both of them. Maybe for Jay, but most DEFINITRLY not for Lia. \n\nI was opposed the entire time, ended up telling Lia that I didn’t think it was a good idea, especially if Jay’s parents were still being jerks to her, because her emotional/mental health would always be more important to me than a man’s ego. But I also said that because I cared more about her, I would always support her decision no matter what, because I love her and she’s the most important to me. \n\nUgh. I seriously do love Jay, and I’m glad they worked out, but I wish they had taken a lot more time apart, because Lia deserves everything in the world, and she’s my whole world, and I wish Jay had taken the time to tell off his parents and given Lia more time to focus on herself. \n\nThen about three months later they ended up eloping, and the wedding pictures were so cute and Lia looked so beautiful and so happy so obviously I was happy for her too, but I didn’t find out until after the wedding, that Jay has never stood up for her in front of his parents. Like ever. Both of them are close to 30 and he still can’t defend his wife, the mother of his child, the woman he chose to spend his life with, because he can’t stand up to his mommy?? And It’s still a problem!!! She literally made another comment about Lia on Saturday, so this isn’t even old news!!\n\nI’m happy that they love each other and that they’re together and that they’re married but I really wish they had at LEAST waited until she had more time to enjoy herself and he finally stood up to his parents because she doesn’t deserve any of the shit they put her through :(.\n\nTL;DR: my sisters in-laws treat her terribly and her husband doesn’t defend her, I wish they hadn’t gotten married, or at the very least, waited until he stood up for her.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account! This happened about 6 years ago and it still haunts me to this day. It was my at the time boyfriend’s prom night and i was planning to go as well. We weren’t going together but i graduated from the same high school the year prior and was going with my old classmates as a reunion thing. My boyfriend had been acting weird all day. It felt like he was trying to keep me from going to the event. He kept saying things like ‘oh but you really don’t have to come if you don’t want to’ but i was like no dude i’m not going for you i just wanna see my friends. I went anyway and had a fun time but i barely saw him all night. We did plan to go home together so we met up to take a taxi to his place. Apparently he had been sitting in a car with his friends for hours so i asked him if he did any drugs (i don’t really care and he knows that) but he said no. During our taxi ride home he was so distant and it was like he was completely ignoring my presence. He seemed sober so this really confused and hurt me since i had no clue why he was acting this way. We went to bed (i was still very confused) and i tried talking to him and asking if he was okay and what was going on. He didn’t even bother responding so i started crying but he was still ignoring me, pretending to sleep. \n\nHere’s where it gets really weird. After a while he got up to go to the bathroom. He was gone for a while so i went to check up on him. When i opened the bathroom door i didn’t know what to expect but it was definitely not this. He was standing there holding a bunch of toilet paper with smashed red fruit on it. I looked in the toilet: smashed red fruit. I looked in the sink: smashed red fruit. He said ‘i got a nosebleed’ BUT IT WAS SO CLEARLY RED FRUIT like it was slightly pink and i could see the seeds and fibers and everything. It was strawberry or raspberries or something. It looked like he had chewed it for a second and spat it out everywhere. It also didn’t look like vomit since it looked like pure fruit but i still asked him if he ate red fruits and threw up but he said (in the most normal and calm tone) ‘no i didn’t eat any fruit today, what do you mean? I just have a nosebleed?’ I kept asking what was going on but he kept playing it off and saying i should go to bed. I was exhausted at this point so just went to sleep. \n\nThe next day and the following weeks i asked him so many times what was actually going on and he kept switching between ‘just having a nosebleed’ to straight up denying anything ever happened??? He also denied ever acting weird or distant. He made me feel like i was going crazy. To be fair, we did break up a year later cause he was a manipulator, a liar and lowkey abusive, but i still just want to know what was going on?? I’ve told this story to so many friends and everyone is equally confused and intrigued. If anyone has any insight or theory i would love to hear it lol. Also if anyone wonders, i was sober during the events and he seemed too but not 100% sure. I’m not in contact with him anymore but sometimes i’m tempted to ask him again lmao. Any ideas??",

        "selftext": "It's been a few years since this happened, I had to quit college and end my studies because of it. I have mostly pretended it never happened, but I've recently been looking back and processing it, and I need to talk to someone about it. I don't have anyone to talk to about this, so I decided to come here.\n\nMany years ago, I was 17 and had just started college. I befriended a girl, let's call her Emma. Emma started dating this Bisexual girl, let's call her Jenny, and once she came into the picture, the three of us formed a friend group.\n\nWe were a good friend group for a while and had lots of fun hanging out and studying together. Still, at some point Emma's and Jenny's relationship started to go really sour, Jenny had BPD and their relationship had started to become really unstable. They had arguments almost daily, even at our college. And during these times, I became the therapist; whenever I individually met them, they would rant to me about each other. And Jenny and I really bonded and became good friends since she actually listened to my rants too.\n\nThe day **it** happened, the school had organized a disco party. Emma was working and had to get home, get ready, and head straight to the party. So Jenny had invited me to hang out at her place before the party, get ready together, hang out, and then head over to meet Emma at the party.\n\nWe were just hanging around, typical college kid age things and everything was light hearted. But suddenly things got really weird, she started talking about sexual things; asking me about my kinks and fetishes, asking me about all sorts of sexual questions and it somehow evolved to her taking out her computer and showing me the kind of porn she watches, and yes, when I say showing I mean putting on the actual videos of her favourite porn and asking me to show mine. From there it kept escalating into much weirder sexual things; after the porn she started talking about Emma and telling me what they do in bed, then she pulled out her phone and started showing me nudes of Emma, **without Emma's permission or knowledge of it.**\n\nThe next part, which I feel extremely uncomfortable thinking about and trying to forget. Her parents were downstairs eating dinner, after showing me a bunch of nudes of Emma without her permission, she opened the door and at that point her parents could probably hear whatever we were talking about. Then she sat down next to me, started talking about how much she misses being with a guy, put her hands inside my pants, and Sexually Assaulted me while making remarks about how much she liked \"feeling me.\" Eventually her parents started to come upstairs. She stopped, and at that point I said I had to go and went home, skipping the party.\n\nI didn't want any of that. I only saw her as a friend, and I didn't consent. I just..froze. Many people have asked me when I tell this why I didn't stop her, and said to me that I \"Consented\" by not stopping around the part she started showing porn or Emma's nudes. But I was dissociating the whole time. I can't really explain it, but I was in shock the entire time.\n\nAfterwards, the next day when I came to college, she had told Emma at the party that she cheated on her, told her I had made a move on her and she reciprocated it. This broke our friend group entirely and I was left alone with no friends.\n\nIt all went completely sideways when a mutual asked me about what happened to our group, and once I told her the story, she asked me \"Isn't that sexual assault?\" and that's when it hit me what it really was, to which **I said yes**. Not too long later, that person talked to Jenny about it. Jenny told her a completely different story that she was the victim of SA and I was the one who did it, she twisted the whole story in a way where she told people I did all the things she did that night; the kink questions, porn, begging to see nudes of Emma and then I assaulted her.\n\nNo matter how much I told the truth. No one listened, they all believed her.\n\nIt didn't take long for the whole school to believe her and paint me as a sexual predator, I became an outcast and everyone treated me like a monster, It led me really close to suicide and I dropped out of school and have never gone back, not long after I dropped out I developed very heavy substance abuse and have been struggling with it until recently, I am sober for around 9 months now.\n\nI really don't know how I feel about posting this, but I genuinely just needed to tell my story, I just needed to vent. I'm sorry if this is too much. I hope you all have a good day.",

I worked for the same company for FOUR YEARS growing up, doing hard, labor-intensive work—literally just moving boxes and bricks every second of my free time. I started at $8 an hour, and after three years of working, I got a $1 raise, bringing me to $9 an hour. Meanwhile, a huge chunk of my shifts were outside in the summer heat (obviously not during the winter but still) working for hours on end with no breaks. And on top of that, I had training, which should’ve increased my pay, but of course, it didn’t.\n\nNow, my 16-year-old sister—who has zero experience—just got a job cleaning Airbnbs. She makes $24 an hour as her starting pay. And the kicker? According to her, she spends half the time just goofing off because her boss doesn’t care and literally tells them to just wait around anyway. She’s indoors, doing easy work, not even working for half the hours she’s being paid for. Meanwhile, I spent years doing back-breaking labor for a third of what she makes.\n\nI saved up for years to go to college, and I still ran out of money.

Instead, I’m over here barely scraping by, while she just casually makes a ridiculous amount of money doing the bare minimum. I don’t even know what to do anymore.

It's been a huge improvement as I'm not trendy, and yoga studios can be cliquey places where I've never quite felt like I fitted in.\n\nOver the years I've discovered other things that can be found under the umbrella of mind body and spirit. I've been to events and things, as well as trying out new yoga studios in the hope that the next one will be better.\n\nI hate them. I spend a lot of the time feeling resentful about the amount of cliqueyness, ableism and body shaming that goes on, as well as a significant minority (not most people, but certainly enough for me to notice) coming out with bits of pseudoscience.\n\nI'm not one of these people who's looking to be offended. Instead, I actually wonder if I'm using it as some weird kind of self harm, since I so often go home feeling upset. I spend at least 90% of the time wondering why I'm there since I should've known I'd hate it. But I chose to be there.\n\nI've spent quite a lot of time googling for events, hoping that I'll finally found something that really works for me, and as a result I get social media adverts for even more of them, most of which annoy me just reading the adverts. It's all feeding in to a vicious cycle.\n\nI really need to stop.",

He lacked manners, never wanted to pay for anything and so I ghosted him. We did have fun together, but it was all those other things that really annoyed me. For some reason I reached back out to him in 2016 and gave him another chance and wound up falling in love with him. We have a 2.5 year old daughter, who we both love so much. He takes great care of her and is a great dad, but he is lacking in so many areas. He lost his job, cannot make money. He never went to college. I’m carrying the family in NYC on only $100K a year. He never compliments me or buys me anything. We have never had a single date night. He does all the cleaning, laundry and cooking, but overall I feel like the husband rather than a wife. I’m so sick of him. We have been trying to have a second kid and it’s not working and I am the one that will have to pay for all fertility treatments alone. I just feel like he is not good enough and it’s a horrible way to feel. I’m stuck and I don’t know what to do. This feels like it will be my life forever, having non-passionate sex with someone I can no longer stand for the sake of my child. I’m not getting any younger and realize meeting someone else at my age is an uphill battle when men just want young women. Advice please?",

        "selftext": "I was on a second date with a guy who I liked. We had met before once, it was fun, and we had hooked up but didn't have sex, because I am a virgin and I had clearly told him I am not ready for sex.\n\nThis time, he didn't give me the same fun vibe, but I wanted to hookup with him again because it was fun the previous time, and honestly I was trying to let loose a little, since I have usually been very uptight when it comes to dating. I went to his house after, and ofc things escalated. \n\nI accept that I showed equal interest, unlike last time, and I was teasing him, and flirting with him, and kissing him. But this time, it was more about him, and he didn't seem that interested in kissing me again and again, like the first time. He slightly persuaded me to give him a blow job, which I really didn't want to, but after one point I couldn't say no. But I wasn't able to, and I kept gagging, and i remember telling him i cant. He then got in between my legs, and I told him that I wasn't ready for sex. He reassured me that he wasn't going to do anything, and he was just teasing me. I remember telling him multiple times that I didn't want to have sex, and I wasn't ready. I trusted him and let him, slightly penetrate me without going in. But then he kept pushing in further. It was hurting, and again i tried stopping him, but not very firmly. He asked me if he could just feel me from the inside but would not thrust. I don't think I said anything to that. But eventually we did end up having sex. \n\nAnd in fact, he kept asking me to help guide him, which I did as well. So now it's a very blurry line for me, because I said no and I told him that I wasn't ready, but then I also gave him a helping hand, and also didn't say no while we were actually having sex. The next morning also I didn't say anything, and I in fact kept kissing him. But later after coming home and finally processing, i confronted him on text, and called his upbringing into question. He lashed out at me, and said that I could have stopped it at any time, and he just wasn't the one who was into it.\n\nAnother thing to note with be that he didn't show me any comfort, or affection or asked me how I was feeling after sex. In fact he didn't communicate with me at all. He tried to cuddle me once, but I got up and went outside to process things, after which he didn't hug me properly even once, or tried to cuddle me. We slept separately the entire night, and i felt so vulnerable and sad. I never expected my first time to be like this. Now I am just confused and sad and regretful at this point.\n\nAlso, he did not use a condom, and it was much later that I realised and when I told him, he said he will pull out which he did. I asked him in the morning if I needed to take the morning after pill, and he said no. But I ended up taking one anyway after reaching home.",

        "selftext": "My dog and I had been through a lot the past couple years. He was a stud at a puppy mill and was abandoned then found by a rescue. My sister found the page for him and I fell in love with him immediately. A wheaten terrier with a torn ear who was scared of everything and everyone. It took some time, but he became the sweetest dog I'd ever seen. Still easily scared, but god was he a good boy.\n\nThere are so many moments from my time with him that I look back and wish I'd cherished more. He had so many oddities, and I loved him. He never demanded attention, but he always wanted to be present. No matter what room I was in, he wanted to be there. I set up blankets for him around the house so no matter where I was, he could hang out with me.\n\nHe got sick a couple years ago and because of a really bad vet, the underlying condition went untreated for a long time. After some surgery and a lot of medication, we got it under control. He required constant care, but I never complained. I loved taking care of him, and given the life he'd lived before me, he deserved to be loved and taken care of. I knew when I adopted him (at 6 or 7 years old) that he'd get old and sick, in time.\n\nDuring that time, my marriage to my partner fell apart. I learned after we separated that she'd cheated on me with her boss, which led to the end of his marriage as well. She'd lied to me, manipulated me, and abandoned me. I was miserable, but I still had my sweet boy. She demanded so much in the divorce. She took so much from me financially, physically, and emotionally. But I still had my sweet boy.\n\nWell, in January, the divorce was finally settled and I was so ready to move on to a new chapter. But my dog's regular checkup revealed some unfortunate news. The medication he was on made him susceptible to UTIs and a drug-resistant strain took hold of him and basically never let go. He needed surgery, he needed medication, he needed so much but when none of the three antibiotics we tried worked, he didn't want to eat, he didn't want to drink, he just wanted to rest. I realized it was time.\n\nI work from home and I haven't gotten out much with everything going on. So all day, every single day, he was a part of every facet of my life. My morning routine, my work routine, my bedtime routine, my meals. His bed next to my desk. The sound of his collar jingling or the little whimpers when he was dreaming. At home, he was my whole world. Everything I did, I did with him. And now he's gone. I haven't been this alone in ten years.\n\nIt doesn't just feel sad, or empty, or lonely, it feels *wrong*. It feels like these patterns in my life made sense with him in them and without him, every room in this house feels like it's missing something. My personality makes me very focused on problem-solving, and I feel like I'm sitting in a problem that can't be solved. I just have to exist in it until it doesn't feel like a problem anymore. And I don't know if or when that'll be.\n\nI just miss my dog. I'm thankful to have had such an incredible creature be part of my life, but I just miss my dog.",

        "selftext": "When I was younger I used to steal my siblings teeth that they placed under their pillow for the “tooth fairy” idk why I did it but once I had a few teeth in my collection I found it very exhilarating. \n\nIn 5th grade my parents got called into the school because they found out that I was using my lunch money to pay kids to remove their loose teeth. I successfully extracted 4 teeth before being caught. I was in trouble but it was also a moment of “oh a silly entrepreneur boy” thing. I kinda got a pass. The teacher even joked that perhaps I have career in dentistry. \n\nIn middle school I got caught again.. the elementary school was attached to our middle school and I was convincing the much younger kids to give up their loose teeth. I’d give them snacks or candy as a trade and they were happy to oblige. I was in much more trouble this time and my parents made me attend therapy. I played it off as an interest into wanting to become a dentist.. but really there was something about taking a tooth and keeping it that was so exciting. By this time I was building quite the collection. My parents never learned that I actually kept the collection of teeth. And now they’re both dead anyways.\n\nIn high-school I slowed down quite a bit. I focused mostly on my studies. Freshman year was rough. I witnessed a fistfight that left another student with a tooth that was almost knocked down, a lateral incisor, 23 (on the bottom) it was kinda just hanging there. The guy was in my class and we were acquainted so I went to help him. When I saw how loose it was I just reached in and grabbed it. It just came right out. Everyone was shocked and I ran… pretty cringe moment and everyone treated me like a weirdo after that. By junior year they seemed to forget.. I even had some dates. I subconsciously would target women in sports or heavy party girls because they tended to either lose teeth quicker or have dental issues. It worked in my favor on more than one occasion. \n\nAfter highschool I worked on going towards dental school but quickly realized it wasn’t for me. The science behind it just didn’t interest me.. I really just wanted to perform extractions I had no care about restoration. So I kinda just floated around working odd jobs. I collected a lot of dental tools that I would use on friends and family and women I would date. \n\nToday, I have 97 teeth total. About 49 of them are baby teeth. Most of which I have taken when I was younger. Some were from the children of the women I’ve dated. When they have a sore tooth it saves a lot to just do the extraction ourselves and we turn it into an adventure game with the kids. The rest are adult teeth I’ve collected over the last decade+. The majority of these I obtained consensually. \n\nI plan to continue dentistry as a hobby. My dream would be to open up a clinic in maybe Africa or India or something where I do extractions for free. That way I’m helping out but also enjoying myself at the same time.",

        "selftext": "So this is rant/storytime about a toxic friend, who is still in my life and I’m unable to remove her. Lets call her Sara. So I met Sara in the 1st year of my college through my ex-roommate (Lets call her Jane) Jane and Sara were in the same class so one day she came to visit Janes room, where I lived too. She immediately started talking to me very excitedly and telling about herself, and asked for my Insta acct, probably because me and her both are from the same religion, Jane isn’t. So then we started hanging out often, all three of us and she also started meeting my other friends from college etc. Sara lives with her brother, they’re both studying here. Fast forward a few months, and that’s when it started getting unhealthy. She started acting very possessive and would get upset over me hanging out with other friends without inviting her, or posting stories etc. She would even get jealous when I went out with Jane or posted stories with her (she was my roommate ofc we would have fun together and be close). When a few times me and Jane have fought, she would always come and tell me things like yeah she is like that lets go out etc. instead of trying to reconcile us. I think she enjoyed it when I would have disagreements with my other friends.  \n  \nApart from the possessive nature, she is very cheap in money matters. Whenever we would go out to eat or have tea or anything, she almost never paid. And if she ever did she would ask me to send half of it. She would use this trick where she wouldn’t order anything, and if I did she would eat from it. And if said to pay she would say that she didn’t even order anything or she just tasted my food. If we ever made plans for the movies or any other activity, she would beforehand say I don’t have any money expecting any of us to say we will cover her, and if no one said that and we went without her she gets upset. She then once caused such a big misunderstanding between me and Jane that we didn’t speak to each other for 6 months and started living separately. We have started talking again now but live alone and not together. Jane still doesn’t speak to Sara and probably won’t ever, which I think is good for her. \n\n\n\nShe also has this habit where she would just take my stuff. My parents live abroad and they would send me chocolates, or some food items available abroad, suppose they have sent 2 packets, she would just come pick up one and say Im taking this. Now, I am a person who can’t say no to someone like this when they ask me for some food item or something, I don’t know I try but I just can’t bring myself to it. She then started asking for my other things too, which are not 2 packs or just anything. Like she once saw my aloe vera gel and said oh I want it what will you do of it, or even my plates and cups, hair brush, anything she would just say oh I am taking this, I have not given any of those to her. I have told her that no I need it, but she would still insist, it was very tough for me to have those arguments. She once even asked for a gift that was given to me by my fiancé (his apple earphones) and said oh I need these, I said no he gave them to me why would I let you take it, and guess what she was upset about it. But she wouldn’t stop. There are so many such incidents. One that has stuck with me is when I brought chocolates for her from abroad, and I asked her to give me one from the pack and she straight up refused saying they were hers. I was baffled that how could she refuse me chocolates that I brought her??? It was so cheap.  \n  \nSo these are all small things and in the past few months some pretty serious and big things she has done, which are:  \n  \n1st - She absolutely ruined my birthday. So my fiancé (Lives in another country) had planned a celebration at a fancy restaurant with all my friends, as a surprise for me. He reached out to Jane to help prepare for the surprise as he couldn’t manage effectively from so far away. When Sara found out that he reached out to Jane and not her, she got mad and upset about it, that why she wasn’t asked and also cause she and Jane don’t speak to each other. She made a fuss about it and on my birthday, in the restaurant she sat there, making a faces, didn’t eat anything at all, wasn’t talking to anyone and also whispering comments to someone either about me or Jane. I asked her several times what’s wrong and she just said nothings wrong and continued behaving like that. Everyone saw that it was affecting my and everyone else’s mood so they kept asking her to cheer up but she didn’t. She didn’t even eat a single bite of the birthday cake, also constantly made faces didn’t smile for once the entire time and left. The next day I confronted her about it and she said she is sorry and she was upset why she wasn’t chosen by me. I said my fiancé planned it all and I didn’t know about it but she said I probably knew how could I not know. I told her that she ruined my day and she texted me ‘I’m so sorry’ with the hands folded emoji, making it a sarcastic mean sorry.  \n  \n2nd - This incident happened a few days ago and has really made me think that I have had my last straw now and this is getting so so toxic. So she had borrowed money from me which she was supposed to return last month. When I asked her for it she said she doesn’t have it and sent me a small amount and said she will send me the rest later. I said okay. Now a month has passed and Im really broke right now and need some money. So I texted her asking her to send me the rest of the money, she said to me again that she doesn’t have any money. I said why not, even I don’t have money and I need it, please ask your parents to send It or do whtever but please give me my money, at least give me half back as I am in need of money right now. But she just said that I don’t have money, I will give it when I have it. I asked her when will that be and she said 4-5 months!! That’s when my college comes to an end and I will be literally leaving the country, that’s when she wants to pay me back. Its also not a huge amount which she can’t arrange out of nowhere, she also has had time of several months but is still not returning my money. I argued with her for around half an hour over text asking her to give my money back now as I need it now and not months later. I even gave solution that she can pay me little by little each month at least but she plainly said no I don’t have to all of it. I dont know how to get the money now. AND CHERRY ON THE CAKE IS ever since I asked her the money back she is UPSET with me. For asking my own money back!!! When I need it!!! She didn’t say she’s upset but she isn’t sending me any reels as she used to, stopped reacting to mine, doesn’t send snaps, which all she does when she is upset. I just don’t understand where she gets the AUDACITY to be upset here?? I should be the one upset as she is not giving the money back. I feel like this is literally the last straw. Theres so many more things she has done but I cant write all of them down here or this will be too long.  \n  \nNOW I KNOW WHOEVER READS THIS WILL ASK ME WHY I HAVENT ENDED THE FRIENDSHIP, now that is because we have been friends for the past three years and my whole family, my fiancé, my in-laws they all know her and they ask about her frequently and ask if we’ve been hanging out and how is she and everything and I’ll be passing out college in the next three months and after that I’ll be moving to another country and probably won’t see her anymore maybe once in a blue moon in a lot of years, but we won’t be meeting again I think so. So I just wanted to avoid any drama since the past six months I have been thinking that I should just let it go because it’s just a few months and I don’t want to create the drama and I don’t want the fuss of explaining all the family members of why I don’t speak to her anymore and all that but I think this is just getting so much out of hand. Even now she is still in my life, thinking that it’s just three more months and it’ll all be done but I don’t know anymore if I should end it now or wait. All this time I’ve been such a good friend even after she has done all of this I continue doing things for her. I continue trying to help her whenever she needs. I lent her the money after she did all that fuss on my birthday. And yet, she is like this. This is very very toxic.",

It's their complete lack of effort to do anything to fix it, instead relying on me to.\n\nIt's been seven years of my partner's mental health declining into crippling depression and I've stood by their side, doing everything I can to support them. Everything one person could possibly do to help lift their feelings of worthlessness. And I'm exhausted. It's bringing me into a new low of apathy towards everything due to not being able to invest in myself or my mental health. \n\nYears ago, they agreed to seeing a therapist, a hormone specialist, everything. I've nudged them to get on track, suggested they get out, be more social, constantly trying to lift things from their day so they can feel less overwhelmed. Trying to remain in a constant state of positivity (trying, I definitely don't, I'm human but I fake it as much as one can for the person they love) to no avail. It's now to the point where anything i try is met with \"That's not what I need\" or \"that's making me worse\" when all I offer is reassurance and support.\n\nThey haven't made any forward movement in seeking professional help. Multiple promises and agreements over the years but nothing. Now it's to the point where I'm met with excuses every time I ask how it's going. I never push, never get aggressive with it.\n\nI'm at the end of my rope. I've spent so much of my own energy in trying to be there for them, that I've lost myself. I'm exhausted, I'm depressed and I don't seem to get any support at all when I voice how I'm feeling.\n\nI don't think I can do this anymore. ",

        "selftext": "I think I'm defective. I don’t think I’ve ever truly felt connected to people or even to myself. It’s as if I’m living my life through an out-of-body experience, like there are two separate versions of me: my consciousness and the person maneuvering my body, interacting with the world. When I look in the mirror, I barely recognize the person staring back.\n\nEver since I became self-aware( around six years old) I noticed I didn’t feel the way others did. My classmates mingled effortlessly, forming bonds that I lacked the vocabulary to describe. But I could sense the absence of that feeling in my own life. My parents loved and cared for me deeply, and I knew that. I loved them, too—I’d cry for them, seek their attention, I was obviously attached to them.But something wasn’t right. It was as if there was a glass wall between us. I could see them, they could see me, but I couldn’t feel them.\n\nThis feeling—or lack of it—persisted. I was always aware of it, and it bothered me immensely. It confused me. I could feel emotions for others, I could empathize, I could care, I could love. But I couldn’t feel them.\nEventually, I got sick of wondering and started asking people about it. I thought maybe everyone felt this way but just never spoke about it. Like a hush hush kind of thing. Each time, I carefully watched their faces as I explained. People’s expressions would shift in tiny, quick ways—so subtle they’re almost undetectable if you didn't pay close enough attention. And every time, I saw the same reaction: a scrunch of the face, a flicker of confusion, discomfort, or even judgment. It was never positive. Then, their words followed: \"Im not understanding what you mean?\" \"How so? You clearly feel connected to people like XYZ.” (who do you think are telling how I feel???) Or my favorite: “That’s normal.”\nI know for a fact this isn’t normal.\n\nThis brings me to why I’m writing this. I’ve had friends, I’ve had partners. I’ve felt deep emotions for them. But I never felt one with them. They would tell me how connected they felt to me, how deep and natural it was. And I would lie—because I didn’t want to hurt their feelings. But deep down, I knew I could never reciprocate the feeling. I was attached to them, yes, but in a way that often turned toxic and possessive. That’s not a real connection.\n\nThe best way I can describe this lack of connection is like wearing thick gloves. I can still touch things, still interact with the world. But I can’t feel  anyhing. Like the softness of wool or the rough ridges of a rock—nothing compares to the feeling of interactiing with the world with your bare hands. My gloves, though, seem to be stuck. Glued onto my hand. \n\nI truly believe I’m defective. \n\n",

        "selftext": "My whole childhood was a blur due to all of the abuse I had to endure from my sister. It all started around when I was in kindergarten and she was in 6th grade. I remember her holding me down in my mother’s closet, punching me in the face repeatedly. She would hold my head underwater when we went to the pool until I almost went unconscious. She would chase me and my mom around the house with any weapon she could find and she ended up stabbing me with a knife in the stomach at some point. This and more all went on for years until she moved out after she graduated high school in 2020. \n\nAt some time between 1st-3rd grade, I was SA’d by her. She would make me watch pay gorn with her then she would make me kiss her also lick her chest and her downstairs. She would make me and my (disabled) little sister shower with her and one time she also made my little sister lick her. I spoke to my cousin about this and similar happened to them. They also witnessed my sister’s abuse on many occasions. \n\nFast forward to today, I am 17, my sister is 23, and she moved in with me, my mom, and my little sister after the hurricanes along with her fiancée(F22) and their son(2). They originally were just evacuating but they decided that they weren’t going back. They were supposed to move out within a month but it has now been 6 months. They reside in my little sister’s room so she now shares a room with my mom. The whole house is being taken over and I’m tired of biting my tongue. \n\nLast week, I was about to take a shower and I noticed a pretty big mess my nephew made. There were crushed eggshells spread all over the carpet along with stickers and price tags (my mom runs an antique business) I asked my sister to clean it up and I go take a shower. I had just gotten out and there were even more messes that were made. There were crushed eggshells are still there. I go to the kitchen and there were magnets covering the floor which were also in the dining room. The cat’s water had been dumped out and there were three towels in the garbage. I asked my sister what had happened (she’s sitting on the couch, on her phone). She says something along the lines of “my son was just playing”. I asked her to clean it up and she said “I’ll do it later”. The thing is, she either never cleans or she does it half assed. So, I texted my mom pictures and basically told her that these messes were made, my sister isn’t cleaning it, and I’m not gonna be the one responsible for it. My mom calls my sister and she immediately starts yelling at me saying, “WHY WOULD YOU TELL MOM MY SONS MAKING A MESS?” “DONT TALK ABOUT MY SON LIKE THAT” I tell her that it’s not her son, I understand he’s a toddler, but she has to be responsible for that. My mom calls me and I go to leave to my room. I noticed my sister following me and out of the corner of my eye I see her threaten to punch me. I turn around and say “girl don’t even” then she punches me in the face and we tackle each other to the ground. My mom was on the phone the whole time and was telling her to get out of the house. She wouldn’t leave and kept arguing with me saying stuff about how nobody helps her and she will never talk to us again but the thing is, she has lived in three people’s houses rent free, including ours. She asks everybody for money and they send her money. Our family has helped her so much and she is so ungrateful and entitled. My mom gets home from work and tells her that she needs to get a hotel for a few days before they can come back and have a conversation about this all. \n\nThree days pass and it was the most relaxing three days of my life. I deep cleaned the house and discovered how much damage she has caused to our house (holes in the wall, paint splattered on everything, just everything being nasty). \n\nThe day has come that they come back. My sister has to work so she drops off her fiancé and their son first. I talk to her about everything and we seem to be on the same page, she witnessed my sister hit me and argue with me. Time passes and everyone is home now. We tried to talk but my sister wasn’t engaging and was just staring off into space. At this point, no one is mad anymore we just want to work through this bump in the road, but my sister, oh no she was pissed. She denied everything and acted like she didn’t do anything wrong and kept asking for proof of everything that we talked to her about even though everyone knows what happened. She leaves and goes to their room. \n\nI leave and go to my room but I can hear my sister talking to her fiancé about everything through the wall and she acted like she had no clue about anything. She said she didn’t see my sister punch me and was just telling my sister what she wanted to hear. This pisses me off so I tell my mom what’s going on and we go to their room to stop the twisting of the story. My sister had nothing but hateful things to say to me, but what really got me was that she said I never have her back when I say I do. I really have had her back so many times there are so many things that I have never told another soul because she asked me to. I tell her that and she’s still denying and lying. I figured that the only way I can prove to her that I in fact did have her back and to get it through to her that she needs to stop lying and be accountable for her actions, was to tell her darkest secrets. I started tame and told my mom the reasoning why my sister got jumped a few years back. My sister acts oblivious. I as her if she wants me to keep going. She says she doesn’t care, so I tell her fiancé about how she cheated on her with a man less that a year ago. Of course she denies it but I had proof. I pull up text messages of her describing everything when it happened and she still tried to deny it. \n\nShe and her fiancé start arguing which causes my sister to run away. She would do this all the time growing up, if she got caught doing something bad, she would run away but she would come back an hour later, but keep in mind this is a 23 year old adult were talking about. We found her sitting on the street talking to a random man and we bring her back home. She keeps threatening to off herself, which is another tactic she used as kids. \n\nAt home, she starts arguing with my mom and I, saying that everyone hates her and that I ruined her life and I only said that out of spite. I told her exactly why I did it but she’s not having it because when she makes up a story in her head, she will stick to it. \n\nMe and her fiancé go to the gas station to blow off some steam and we talked the whole time. She talked about how my sister would try to do “nasty stuff” to her but she didn’t want to because she had a gut feeling that she was cheating and she was right. She also said that when she didn’t want to do anything, my sister would try to force herself into her. Her saying this triggered my memory of the SA that happened when I was a kid. I told her about it and she said she believed me. \n\nWe get home and I figured I should probably tell my mom about the SA. I had hidden this from everyone because my sister always threatened me and by the time she was no longer a threat to me, I had blocked out that memory. This whole situation just resurfaced everything. My mom was horrified and at this point no one knows what to do but my sister needs to get out of the house. She has no one to go to because she ruined everyone’s trust. She has no money because she can’t save for shit. We decide to sleep on it because at this point it’s like 1 am. \n\nI couldn’t sleep for the life of me but the next day, this all continues. The fiancé repeated everything I told her to my sister and of course she is denying everything and calling me a liar who is just out to get her. Not only that, but her fiancé is denying everything that she told me, such as my sister forcing herself onto her. Their stories for everything keep changing but mine has stayed the same for everyone. \n\nAll day my sister was talking shit about me. It’s so bad that I can’t even be in my own room because I can hear them talking through the wall. As of now, I’m sleeping on the floor in my mom’s room. If I’m not in the same room as my mom, they will talk shit to her. Despite all of this, my mom believes me and my one story, along with all of the proof I have. I haven’t been this enraged since I lived with my sister as a kid. It feels like I’m living with squatters from the worst roommate show. I have zero privacy and I can’t breathe without someone making something up about me. \n\nI don’t know what to do, this is still going on as of right now. I’m currently on spring break so we have time to deal with this but we don’t know how and if they’re still here by the time I go back to school I will go insane. I have no where to go to because all my family lives in another state. I can’t live like this. There’s a lot of details I missed but it’s just too much and my brain is scrambled.

I had,what i had hoped, was a solid job offer that might turn my life around.\n\nNow 4 months in,its such a huge lie. I live in a tiny space with a roommate, because company housing and all that jazz. I dont even have a closet to my name. We share a room and bed so tiny I'm scared im gonna fall off of it. There's no privacy, i work almost 70 hours a week, i barely manage to make friends and my coworkers are pieces of shits.\n\n The people here hate women so much that they make random complaints about them. I got called to my boss' office because apparently they heard fighting from my cabin,WHEN I DON'T EVEN TALK TO ANYONE!. The manager of the hotel i live in apparently complained that i screamed at the housekeeping, newsflash,i stay awake for 3 hours after work and dont even stay home for the weekends. They just straight up lied and for what? I cannot wrap my head around any possible reason why they would do it.\n\n I stay out of everyone's way and yet trouble finds me. I went to a concert back in January with a guy who i thought  could be my friend, but he turned out to be a jerk when i got drunk and he tried to take advantage of me. Then i decided I would go to concerts alone,and i got a can of coke thrown at my head. Fun times y'all.\n\nHow does it feel for someone to be tested at every moment of every day like this. For no reason. I live in such a dump there's 0 privacy. I work for so long hours that i barely even have the energy to stay awakeet alone pick fights with housekeeping (wtf).\n\n I feel like such an idiot because this is the best job i could get right out of college, i can't afford to take a break and go find  something better. Every move we make is guarded and recorded here, i can't even bring a guy around to my place because one,its apparently not allowed, and two, who brings a guy to a shared accommodation? I feel like im 14 and living with my parents.  Everyday my will to live is chipped away, i am constantly stressed. And now the cherry on top in someone's making up stories about me. How do you defend yourself from incidents that never happened?\n\nI know its such a rant but truth be told i regret waking up everyday . I hate seeing the people around me,i hate living with constant fear of what might go wrong, who i might accidentally offend by existing. At this point i keep myself alive as a social experiment, to see how much a person can take.",

It was relatively cheap and food was decent. \n\nWe lived in a city with quite some homeless people and oftentimes a few of them were hanging around waiting for money. \n\nAnyway, this one time we were eating and started hearing this commotion. We went to check what was up and it was a homeless guy being quite upset at the counter. \n\nHe had saved up some money to buy himself a meal, but was a few euros short and staff had thrown out the food he was going to buy. (It was a buffet style diner). He was so upset and I felt so bad, I asked my parents to get him a new plate. We didn't have a lot of money, but my parents still agreed. \n\nMy mother and I went back and told the staff we would buy him a new plate. \nTurns out, it had been the last portion of that specific dish and they had just thrown it out. So, of course, he became very upset again. \n\nIn the end, we bought him another meal and he thanked us profusely. We didn't sit with him though, which I hope we had. My father didn't speak the language and my mother is deaf, so it probably would've been very awkward anyway. \n\nAnyway, it's not a sensational story. I just sometimes get reminded of it and then get upset for a few minutes. I really wish we'd sat with him. He was probably in need of some company and just someone to talk to. \n\nHe had saved up for probably days to get this one dish he really wanted and he never got it. \n\nI hope he was able to get out of that situation and eat that dish another time.

        "selftext": "\nMaybe you were young. Maybe you didn’t know better. Maybe no one told you that some lines should never be crossed.\n\nBut what about now?! Are you still a minor?! Do you still believe that being younger at the time means you were automatically forgiven?!\n\nLet me be clear..No, you are not forgiven\n\n\nWhen I was 17, my 15-year-old cousin tried to touch me while I was sleeping. His mom knew. He got yelled at.\n\nEveryone else moved on. I didn't. I still remember that day, how scared he made me. Every detail. My aunt never talks about it. I tried to forget but I can't.\n\nI realized, I won't be okay until he says sorry. To my face. He needs to say, \"What I did was wrong. I'm ashamed. I think about it every day. How could I do that to my own sister?!\"\n\nWatching him laugh and carry on like nothing ever happened.. it infuriates me. I don’t want him to suffer but he doesn’t get to erase the past, not when he’s grown and fully aware of what he did. The worst part?! He even speaks about morality, about respecting women, as if he’s never betrayed those very principles.\n\nAnd I know I’m not alone in this. Many of you haven’t forgotten either. It’s a nightmare..\n\nSeeing him makes me sick. His words are like a joke. I want to scream, to tell everyone the truth about what he did. Because of him, I’m still afraid of men. I flinch at even the gentlest touch, even from friends. I sleep alone. I can’t bring myself to say yes to a date, no matter how kind the guy is.. because deep down, I know I have nothing left to give.\n\nI don’t feel normal anymore.\n\nI’m exhausted by the questions…\n\"Why do you only have female friends?!\"\n\"Why do you act so distant around men?!\"\n\"Do you hate them?!\"\n\"Are you a lesbian?!\"\n\nMaybe I am. But even if I were, it would still be better than living in fear of men.\n\nI want to confront him, to demand answers.. but I hesitate. He’s still family. Maybe he wants to forget, maybe he carries his own guilt and yet, a part of me wonders… what if speaking up hurts him?!\n\nSo, I ask this now.. to every brother who has made his sister’s life a living hell…\n\nDo you truly regret what you did?!\nAre you ashamed?!\nHave you ever wanted to face your sister and ask for her forgiveness?!\nDo you even seek to be forgiven?!\nIs the person you are today real, or just a mask you wear?!\nIf your sister confronted you, how would you respond?! How would it make you feel?!\nDo you, like us, carry this weight and long to set it down?!\n\nI just want to know.. how do you all feel after everything?!\n\nBecause I feel devastated. Even after all these years, I still can’t forget.\n\nI wonder, is there even a single man in this world who has sincerely apologized for this?! Who has taken responsibility, helped his sister heal and given her a chance to live a normal life again?!\n\nI want to believe that no one is beyond change, that people can choose to be better if they truly try.\n\nIs that too much to hope for?!\n\n(If any of this resonates with you, then please.. apologize to your sisters. Understand that we still carry this weight.. even when we smiled, even when we pretended to have moved on for the sake of the family...)",

        "selftext": "So I (25m) had been close friends with my ex (25f) about 10 years since early high school. We just hit it off, we were different people but we just understood each other and got along really well. \n\nNot long after high school, we realised we had feelings for each other and that we wanted more than friends, and we decided to give it a try. We dated for about 6 months and it just felt natural, probably since we had been close for a long time. \n\nShe is a strongly religious individual, as is her family, and that was never an issue for me, and she had assured me that although I wasn’t as religious (I’m a raised Catholic but not to the extent), this wasn’t a dealbreaker. It was part of our friendship to tease each other about our levels of faith.\n\nThat is until she broke up with me via phone call whilst I was visiting family, saying that she needed someone who could share her religious beliefs with. Naturally I was heartbroken and when I returned home, we spoke and she reaffirmed this further. We broke up and that was that.\n\nAcross the next 3 years I learned to move on, initially my mental and emotional state was rough but I learned to improve myself. I could say proudly that I wasn’t the wreck I was afterwards.\n\nI found out about 6 months ago that she was dating someone else and had been for about a year (small town, everyone knows everything). At the time I was really happy for her (despite everything, she was still my friend for a big chunk of my life) and I ended up messaging her and telling her that. \n\nThat is until earlier tonight, while stalking on Facebook I saw that she had gotten engaged to this guy, and all I felt was sadness and jealousy, like someone had turned back the clock 3 years on my emotions, feeling like rubbish that it wasn’t me with her still.\n\nImmediately after that I felt so guilty, like a horrible human being for feeling this way. I have no right to, we both moved on with our lives. I don’t even want to message her again, let alone want to be with her again.\n\nI’m just so disappointed in myself that all the hard work I had done across 3 years has gone down the drain\n",

        "selftext": "I (F26) constantly feel guilty about eating anything. I count every single calorie, and honestly, it's exhausting.\n\nI’m from a Southeast Asian country where most of my peers are naturally small and skinny. Even if they eat a lot, they either don’t gain weight like I do or lose it effortlessly. At 5’8” and 150 lbs, I don’t think I’m that heavy. Yes, I’m on the heavier side compared to the people around me, but I carry most of my weight in my chest, which only makes me look even “fuller.” On top of that, I’m considered tall for a woman here, so I always feel like a \"giant.\"\n\nPeople,friends, strangers, family freely comment on my height and weight, and not in a good way. My family, especially, constantly gives me unsolicited diet advice, tells me I’ve eaten enough, and makes jokes about my body. But the worst part is my mom. She’s obsessed with having a \"perfect-looking\" daughter, and to her, that just means being pretty and skinny. My academic achievements, my promising career—none of it matters. To them, I’m just \"the fat one.\"\n\nBecause of this, I’m always forcing myself to choose the “healthier” option, trying to burn off every calorie I consume. I religiously log everything into MyFitnessPal and limit myself to 1,000–1,500 calories a day, on top of working out. But no matter how much I restrict myself, my weight won’t drop anymore. It’s frustrating. I just want my mind to quiet down so I can enjoy a meal, but I feel like I’m not even enjoying my life anymore. People still see me as the \"giant\" friend or the \"oversized\" girl in the family, and no matter what I do, the comments never stop. If I ever defend myself, I get dismissed as being “salty because I’m fat.”\n\nI love food. I love cooking and baking. But I’ve realized that I’ve been trapped in this toxic cycle of diet culture for almost **13 years**. And after all this time, people still won’t stop commenting on my body. It’s made me start hating the things I once loved. I hate my reflection. I hate the small portions I force myself to eat just to fuel my body. And sometimes, when the guilt gets too overwhelming, I purge—not even after binge eating, just after a regular meal. I’ve even told my mom about it when she criticizes my weight, but she just stares at me and says I must be lying because I’m “not losing any weight.”\n\ni tried brushing everything off and thinking as long as i'm eating healthy and my body is healthy then it's okay but this is every single day, and some days it gets to me...and is mentally stuck in there.\n\nI don’t know what to do anymore. This is mentally draining, and I just feel stuck. If you have any thoughts and or advice, I’d appreciate hearing them.",

        "selftext": "Tl dr; My marriage isn’t over, but I don’t think it will ever be the same. \n\nFirst, thank you to everyone that replied and messaged. I read every single one. I appreciated the hopeful comments and identified with the harsh ones. I’m no angel in this story. \n\nSo some extra info - my husband has a very high intensity job, and travels frequently. I took over the bills so nothing would get lost in the shuffle when he was away from home and he could focus on what he needed to focus on. (Insert joke here, right). \n\nI wad a complete wreck last week. I barely slept, was physically anxious, and was both absolutely dreading Friday but also couldn’t wait for it to just get here already. Fortunately my husband was on a work trip and my kids were busy with basketball, friends, theatre, etc and were barely home. I barely ate and lost like 3 lbs that I’ve been stuck on. Not recommended for a diet plan. \n\nFriday we planned to each work a half day then have some lunch and look at our budget for the year. Tax returns were pretty decent and my husband got a good annual bonus, so it made sense to see what was what. He was already talking about throwing some in a CD or investment and I just felt ill. \n\nFriday comes and he comes home with In’n’Out and a chocolate shake for me and I just … lost it. Full on sobbing. It freaked the hell out of him, and took me like ten minutes to get myself under control. Then I spilled it all. I started with “I love you and I’m sorry” and just let fly. That wasn’t my plan, I had a whole thing written down to make sure I didn’t miss anything and it didn’t matter at all. \n\nTo his incredible credit he just sat there in shock and listened. Then he definitely under-reacted and went directly to “we’ll fix it together” mode. He wanted some time to absorb what I’d said and then wanted to work through our accounts one by one to see what was actually up, and he wanted to do this alone, then we’d come up with a plan. \n\nI let him be and just did some cleaning and laundry. After maybe 45 minutes I heard him leave the house with a door slam. I wasn’t about to chase him down after he asked for space to process. I did look at the computer and it was a list of all our outstanding balances. \n\nTo everyone guessing figures, here you go:\n\nI assumed it would be 60k based on my rough math, but I had forgotten a couple I had on autopay. \n\n$96,000 in debt that he had no idea about. \n\nHe messaged me a while later that he was going to stay by his mom for the night and would be back to pack a bag, and that he would rather not talk yet. I respected that and made myself scarce. \n\nHe came home the next day and we manufactured some time alone to talk by sending the kids out to run errands. The oldest can drive and loves any excuse. \n\nThe heart to heart was basically this - I fucked up royally here, but he shouldn’t have checked out completely and let it get to this point. He is going to take over our finances. We’re going to do a HELOC or second mortgage for all the recurring stuff and buckle down HARD. We will review everything together at least twice a month. We will do marriage counseling together. \n\nI agreed to absolutely every term and condition. I honestly thought he wasn’t going to come back. Things are chilly at best right now, and I am so desperately sorry and sick over the hurt I caused. At the same time there is a deep sense of relief that, whatever happens, I’m no longer lying about it and everything is out in the open. \n\nMaybe he’ll still decide that he can’t move on, but I’m going to own whatever happens. \n\n",

        "selftext": "I grew up with my mother, who was a single parent. She had chosen to leave my father due to his alcohol and pill addiction. Shortly before I was born, she was granted disability pension because she was born with a spinal defect that made her physically disabled. In addition, she had repeatedly been to the psychiatric emergency room in the 1970s, likely due to being placed in foster care as she was born out of wedlock.\n\nToday, I know that I had undiagnosed ADHD that hindered my schooling, but this was not noticed by either the school or child and adolescent psychiatry. Despite having countless interactions with the school, child psychiatry, and social services to find a sustainable way for my mother and me to live together without harming each other. (Today, I have met social workers who are surprised that I placed myself in foster care when they hear what I went through as a child, and they say that things would have been handled differently today...)\n\nAfter struggling hard in elementary school to get into the high school program I wanted, my life was turned upside down when I found out that my father was sober (and had been for a few years) and that he hoped word would reach me that he wanted to contact me. So, just as I was about to start high school, I suddenly had a father again, and we were to try to establish a relationship despite barely having seen each other since I was two years old. At the same time as I was getting to know my father, it became untenable for me to continue living at home with my mother, and together with social services, my move away from home (with the help of social services) was being prepared at the age of 17. Shortly after the decision had been made, and I had moved in with my girlfriend and her family in a state of panic, my first major setback arrived.\n\nMy father passed away in his home, and I had to take care of going through and packing up his home (as well as his workplace), while also having my room at my mother's and the half of the household goods she had saved for me during my upbringing, so that I would have something resembling a home when I moved out. My uncle took care of my father's hunting weapons and his car, but the rest was left for 17-year-old me to handle, contacting private individuals and authorities, and announcing his passing. Not to mention the feat of improvising a funeral without any idea of what my father's taste or preferences were and any wishes he might have had for the ceremony. I still remember that I actually had a fever at his funeral.\n\nWe fast forward a few years to when I surprised my mother (our relationship improved immediately once I moved out) by taking her to be in the audience of her favorite TV show. That's when an idea was born in my head: TV/film, that's what I want to do! I came home and started researching how to get into the industry and saw that there were some educational programs I could apply for. But to get into these, I first needed to complete my high school studies. So I did, and then I applied to various programs until, after 2-3 years, I finally got into one.\n\nThe problem with the program was that it was over 200 km (roughly 125 miles) from my hometown, and I prepared to move to the location by myself to start my studies. But it turned out that my partner chose to join me in the move. Meanwhile, my mother had gradually worsened, and at that time, it was nice to get away from her gradual decline. Her memory was getting worse and worse. The program I had been accepted into was a two-year program, with the first year focusing on theory and most of the second year dedicated to practical training. But before we were to go out on internships, we had a short film to complete first. On the second to last day of filming our short film, my second major setback arrived (and at that time, I didn't know it would last for a long time).\n\nDuring filming, one of our actors collapsed and passed away during the ambulance ride to the hospital. I was responsible for the sound during filming and had four different microphones running, which captured the sounds the person made before they fell to the floor and we rushed to begin CPR while waiting for the ambulance. By some miracle and some trick filming, we managed to finish filming and could focus on the internship period.\n\nThe problem was that 90% of media production takes place in the capital, so a move to an already overcrowded city was the next step. After much searching, I found a place to live, or so I thought. It turned out to be a scam, and when I confronted the person and said I didn't want a lot of things ordered in my name, I was threatened with murder (the continuation of earlier mentioned setback).\n\nI managed to shake it off and made it to the capital and started my internships. But when things were running smoothly and the engine was at its hottest, the setbacks decided to hit hard.\n\nAs an unpaid intern trying to break into the industry, it was natural to say yes to everything, to be the one who fixed everything. Especially if you had gotten an internship at the same production where I had previously taken my mother. After a few weeks, the situation (saying yes to all and everything and at the same time having an undiagnosed ND-disorder) became untenable, and the supervisors chose to terminate my internship. I became so unwell that I sought help at the psychiatric emergency room, where they determined that I was burned out from what had happened. I then chose to move back to my partner to lick my wounds and recover. But barely a week passed before my sister called and informed me that my mother had collapsed and been taken by ambulance to the intensive care unit. Because her medication, including blood thinners, had been discontinued, she suffered multiple blood clots, which ultimately led to her death.\n\nWhile we were at the hospital and watching over her, knowing that she didn't have much time left, my partner chose to declare that 11 years together was enough and that she didn't think she could or wanted to continue. This was said when we were only a few meters from my dying mother. Once my mother passed away, it was almost Christmas, and we rushed to arrange a funeral to get it done before the year ended. At the same time, a process began to divide our 11-year life together.\n\nI started looking for a new place to live, and six months after my mother passed away, I moved, and a year of rehabilitation and sick leave to recover began. When I slowly started to feel ready again, I got a media job in the new location and began to feel that I could spread my wings again and actually aim for the capital again. So I did. I got a long-term temporary position, and there I was informed that even though it was a temporary position, it was for a function that was needed Monday to Friday, day in and day out, as long as the channel was broadcasting. This temporary position and this \"promise\" came five months before reports started coming in about people getting sick in China with symptoms like persistent cough and high fever. Eight months after I had started the temporary position, my service was terminated in favor of the permanent employees in the company.\n\nAfter arguing with the authorities to get my unemployment benefits (which felt like half the country was doing at the same time), I found an ad for a position 220 km (ca. 137 miles) north of the capital, and I packed up my belongings and left. I took a chance and hoped it would work out this time. I arrived and managed to work through the probationary period before COVID-19 hit with a new wave of illnesses, and people were afraid to hire permanently, which resulted in me being unemployed again, now in a much smaller location.\n\nNow, misfortune also began to take a toll on my finances, and I needed to take my first loan. A few more months passed, and a new opportunity opened up at the company I had worked for before the pandemic, but this time 490 km (ca. 305 miles) south. Again, I packed up my life and moved south. This time, everything felt good. I felt satisfied, and my new boss and team were happy with me. But then came the date when my probationary period was to turn into permanent employment. My boss checked with my colleagues and found that they were happy with me, but that I sometimes \"disappeared\" when I finished my tasks, and that I sometimes had difficulty reading social situations. This became the basis for their decision not to continue my employment, and the same thing happened again! (Later, it was determined that I have ADHD-I, and that the boss's decision was therefore discrimination based on disability.)\n\nLife repeat it self and I moved again and this time, it was a move of 200 km (ca. 125 miles), and to make that move even possible (and to cover previous expenses), I had to take a loan of approximately 20,000 USD (or about 18,000 EUR). Once there, I got a job where I stayed for two years before I realized there was no room for me evolving and I had to make the choice to go back to school (this time focusing on IT/networks/servers). This time, I had just turned 36 when I started studying again, and I was the second oldest in the class and felt like a fossil compared to my classmates. However, this time I had worked and pushed through an NPF (Neuropsychiatric Disability) assessment and now have a diagnosis of ADHD (inattentive version), and I know that with that, I have the right to help in my daily life, both in school/work and privately.\n\nToday, the debt is down to about 15,000 USD (or about 13,500 EUR), and I see a glimmer of light on the horizon. But at the same time, I know what it has cost me to get here, and that it will take time to reach the metaphorical tunnel. But I also feel an immense frustration that \"no one\" has taken the responsibility they should have.\n\nI know very well that I can't do anything about the situation today, but despite that, I can't help but retrospectively grieve that my ADHD was not discovered and diagnosed earlier. Who knows? Then I might have completed my high school studies and gotten into higher education earlier, and actually had a few years in the job market and stayed in the boat when the metaphorical waves came. Sure, I would have certainly gotten soaked and at times felt close to going overboard, but I wouldn't have fallen into the water like a mitten at the slightest ripple of waves, as I did in reality.\n\nSo, besides feeling deprived of \"everything\" that people usually do in their twenties, like traveling, working as an au pair, and partying, I haven't had the opportunity to experience all of that. And now I've met a partner who has already done everything they want to do as a \"young adult\" and who is well established in the job market and who, shortly after we met, was able to buy their first apartment. And here I stand, feeling stupid, unfinished, and \"late to the game\" in general when it comes to life. Add to that that my partner wants to start a family soon, and I who had hoped that after my education I would hopefully get a job and then do a forty-year-old's version of what I missed in my twenties – no, then I'll instead “have” to start a family, and instead of spending money on vinyl records I now may have to focus on buy teething toys and baby bottles, and instead of planning and comparing trips, I'll instead sit and compare preschools, and then when one is found, start planning for the enrollment of the child. It feels like I'm being deprived of life, and part of me feels incredibly selfish, while the other sees it more evolutionary and I realize that I have it better than, for example, a praying mantis male, who, if he's not in the game, dies after reproduction is completed. The question is just exactly how big the difference is?",

I'm very introspective, have ADHD, and have dated enough to actually know what I want. On the flip side I also have an awful history with relationships. I've been cheated on, used and left, and downright just ignored and ghosted on many occasions. I know in some cases it's through *some* fault of my own for moving fast. \n\nAnyways, with my current girlfriend, we're long distance. We met in person for the first time on a weekend trip and found out we have great physical chemistry on said trip. Our trip was two and a half weeks ago and we became official the night we returned to our homes. Before the trip, we had been in the talking phase for around ten days and we have been nothing but compatible the entire time.\n\nWe haven't had even the slightest hint of an argument (not for trying to avoid them we just get along extremely well), she treats me better than literally everyone I've ever been with, and she is the most supportive and understanding woman I have ever had the pleasure of being with. She's scared of us burning out and we have both decided to take it emotionally slow so that we can enjoy ride.\n\nBy the time our next visit happens, it will have been over a month of us being together and I have been thinking about telling her that I love her on the trip but I also still want to wait until *she* also feels sure about me. We've got another trip planned for after this one already and for that one it will be a week (I'm helping her move) so it's not like I don't have the time to let it sit more. \n\nAaaaaaaanyways, thanks for reading this, whoever did actually read it.

She wasn’t overly talkative or outgoing but she was super sweet and friendly. We ended up getting closer and I found out she had two siblings, one younger and one older and that she just lived with her mom and her mom’s boyfriend. \n\nShe stopped coming to school often after the first year and when she did show up she would hide herself in sweaters even if it was super hot outside. I didn’t really notice anything out of the different because I was a kid but I think the teachers started noticing because they had mentioned it to higher staff and her mom ended up withdrawing them from school.\n\nWhen I was around 10 news came out that the three kids were getting physically and mentally abused by their mother and her boyfriend, there was even accusations of SA towards the one girl I knew from the mothers boyfriend. I remember reading that he had committed murder and was on the run and that he was two provinces away from where he committed the crime. \n\nThey ended up catching on the where he was when he was with my friend’s mom and him and the mom decided to bail and move somewhere far. They left the kids behind and luckily their father caught on and came and got them after years of not seeing them. The poor kids were alone in the house for 2 months before being able to reach out, the kids said they were too scared to leave home even though their mom and her boyfriend were gone. \n\nThis is the shorter end of the story but this happened just over 10 years ago and I think about it every day. I hope she and her siblings are doing well. ",

I tried reaching out for her from another account, and she said \"nothing personal don't overthink it\" I asked for a reason but she didn't answer so I just said it was nice knowing you, she said \"me too\",  what have I done wrong, I was supposed to make her a birthday gift and sent it to her because she did the same, but it took both of us time, that can't be the reason I told her I'm still working on it, my only hypothesis is that she didn't like someone being too close with her, she wanted to be alone again and she didn't want to make me feel bad so she just blocked me, she didn't block me from the second account yet, should I send her this thing or not\n\nI don't know if I can get close with people again after this, I feel like just staying alone for the rest of my life.",

        "selftext": "I'm drinking rn. So the past 1-2 months have been pretty good. I met him in early February, we clicked immediately. We fell in love from the first day we met eachother, the night prior to be specifically. I met him on Tinder, he said he is a virgin. I did not expect to.. take it that far with him but we did use a condom to be on the safer side. I kept it safe with him as much as I could. I had been hurt before, with my first and only relationship. He is the total opposite of my ex. He loves me like Gomez loves Morticia.. he loves me like Beast Boy loves Raven. I don't know why I'm here ranting about this, but I took his virginity. Having a hard time to believe it, in this day and age?.. I lost my virginity to my ex when I was 13. I keep thinking back, wishing I saved myself for him. He's my type, everything I look for in a guy. He's more mature than my 30+ year old ex. But yeah, we have been dating since March 8th. He told his family about me from the first day we met. They call me his sweet heart. Total opposites him and I..  he dresses up like a grandpa, and I dress up like a goth with my corset and boobs showing.. idk.. but he is so perfect. I introduced him to my family the first night we met. He's like day, and I'm night. Everyone loves him. He wants to sign a love contract with me.. he keeps making me fall for him more. Idk what I will do if I ever lose him, I can't imagine losing him.. we just clicked from the first moment we met. The looks in his eyes now, how he couldn't hold eye contact with me at first.. he'd always look down, or look away. 🥹 It was so cute, and still is. He calls me Mama and Mommy. He makes me want to be a lover girl again, he makes me want to be vulnerable.. he makes me feel things I've never felt before, he makes me feel something real. That's about it.

        "selftext": "I had a really disturbing dream last night, and I feel like it carries a strong meaning. It was incredibly vivid, and I felt an overwhelming sense of guilt and horror throughout.\n\nThe dream:\n\nI was sleeping in a hammock in the hall of my apartment building in my hometown when an old woman and her friends surrounded me, claiming that she had left her jewelry—one necklace and three rings—on my hammock. While I was still half-asleep, I found the jewelry, but she kept grabbing at me, searching for it. I hid the pieces because I wanted to keep them.\n\nLater, I ended up returning only the necklace, which was worthless, at the building’s front desk, but I kept the rings for myself. This threw me into a huge moral dilemma.\n\nThen, I spent what felt like an eternity waiting for my food delivery. When I finally went to pick it up, I found the delivery guy lying on the ground in a pool of blood, his legs completely crushed. Cars kept driving over him as if he wasn’t even there. There were two other bodies, crushed beyond recognition, one of them a child.\n\nI was with David (my childhood best friend, a doctor) and Sophie (my best friend, one year behind me in med school). David went to help the injured. Meanwhile, Leo (a former friend I used to do reckless things with) appeared, but he only walked beside me. We greeted each other, exchanged glances like we had things to catch up on, but we didn’t actually talk.\n\nAs I walked back to my apartment, still holding the rings in my mouth, I decided to give them to the front desk guy. But when I got there, the usual porter was gone—this one was heavily tattooed, someone I didn’t recognize. Instead of taking the jewelry, he encouraged me to keep the rings and spend all the money on cocaine. He handed the rings back to me.\n\nThen, I got home, and my “family”—but it wasn’t my real family, it was The Sopranos—walked in. Their presence made me feel emboldened to keep the jewelry. I put the rings on my fingers.\n\nBut then the old woman appeared again. This time, she confronted me directly and took the rings from me.\n\nThe entire dream was extremely vivid. I felt a crushing sense of guilt, and the violence of the crushed bodies was horrifying—I could smell the blood and flesh mixed with rain, and I could hear the families crying in the distance.\n\nAt some point—either in this dream or another one—I also remember seeing my father. It was from a time before he was bedridden, before everything went downhill. He died when I was 19 after a 3 year long battle with cancer.\n\n⸻\n\nContext that might be relevant:\n- I’m a last year medical student and a (maybe recovering) polyaddict. I’m like a week totally clean from everything except nicotine (ketamine and weed were the last drugs I used), maybe three weeks clean of a mild to moderate opiate habit. Coke isn’t really my thing but I had a conversation about my addiction with my roommate and can’t stop reflecting about my use ever since.\n\n- David is my childhood best friend, now a doctor.\n\n- Sophie is my best friend, one year behind me in med school.\n\n- Leo was my main companion for reckless behavior, including drugs. For whatever reason he suddenly cut me and another friend off but recently started sending memes like nothing happened. For the first time, I’m considering cutting him off completely.\n\n- I’m currently watching The Sopranos.\n\n\nThis was one of the heaviest dreams I’ve ever had, and I can’t shake the feeling that it means something important.\n\nImmediately after I woke up I felt the urge to register it. I was calm, just felt like an uncomfortable dream, but as soon as I started reading ChatGPT’s output on its meaning I had a legit anxiety attack, I’ve had like 5 LEGIT attacks in my life and this one was textbook. Hyperventilation and a physical urge to cry even though I wasn’t feeling really emotional. \n\nThis hit me hard man. It reeks of psychoanalysis so much it’s comical.",

        "selftext": "This is an update to a post I made back in October (it’s the only other post on this account if you want to read that first) I just wanted to thank everyone who responded and helped me realize it wasn't my fault. All the kind words have been incredibly helpful. \n\nIt's been 5 months so buckle up because there's a lot to say. \n\nthis isn't exactly the update I'm sure most of you hoped to get. It's definitely not the one I thought I'd get.\n\nI haven't received justice. I probably never will. \n\nIn my last post I mentioned how I wasn't sure how my employers would react if I were to tell them I was assaulted. Since then, unfortunately, another employee I work for was harassed and after months the harasser was fired. Now I know they'd take it seriously, but the difference is that I don't have proof.\n\nI did kinda end up telling G. He had asked me to work with Z and at first I agreed, but after almost having a panic attack just thinking about being near him, I finally got the courage to say that I didn't want to work with Z. I didn't go into detail, but G changed my schedule so that I wouldn't have to. \n\nA couple of days after everything, I was on instagram and clicked on one of those suggested accounts based on your contacts and stuff. It was his poetry account and he had just posted a poem where he wrote all about me rejecting him and how people should feel bad that I didn't reciprocate his feelings, but he conveniently left out the part where he assaulted me. He committed a crime and then went and wrote poetry about it and posted it for people to read which is crazy (I find this funny now but at the time it wasn't lol) \n\nSome of my memory from that day has come back, but it's still mostly blocked out. It's hard knowing that I might not ever know exactly what happened. Even if I'm not sure I want to. I used up like all of my sick days after we came back for the spring semester because the thought of going back to work with that man made me physically sick. Thankfully, I mainly have only seen him in passing while I'm working. \n\nThis is my last year working as a teacher. I want to make it clear that I'm not quitting because of him. I've been involved with this program for over a decade as both a student and an instructor and I feel like it's time to close this chapter of my life. I fully believe I would have come to this conclusion even if nothing had happened. I'm young and still trying to figure out what I want to do in life. I want to take the opportunity to try out other passions of mine. \n\nI'm currently in the process of opening a theatre company with some friends and hope to have our first production in the fall. This has been a dream of mine for years and I never thought I'd actually get to do it.\n\nHonestly, for a moment I considered stepping away from theatre in all together. It felt like he had tainted the thing I loved most. Theatre was my first love and he ruined it. He took the place where my happiest memories happened and made them bitter.\n\nIn the 5 months it's been since everything happened I've realized that's bullshit. I have spent over a decade building a legacy in that department. I've broken and set records, I've advocated, and I led recruiting. I worked to prove to my community that the program and it's students were more than just some underfunded extracurricular w/ kids who wanted an easy class. I helped prove that they were talented and mattered. The last thing I want is for my kids to think that there's one less person who cares about them because I left quietly or that their passions aren't something worth pursuing because I gave up on mine. \n\nHe took a lot from me that day, but I'm not going to let him have this. The 10 year old that dreamed of doing what I'm doing now deserves better than that. The girl that was trapped in that room when it happened deserves better than that. I deserve better than that. \n\nI've hit the anger stage. I'm normally a very empathetic person and try to justify every bad thing a person does to me (not great ik) but w/ him I just get so angry when I see him and for once I can't think of a single reason why I shouldn't be. Of course it's all justified by the fact that he's starting to lash out in his own way.\n\nA couple of days ago, I was at a competition with my kids and I had my sister come up to me panicking, because while I was helping unload equipment from our trailer, he was talking to the contest manager to get my name removed from the program which meant I couldn't help them. We were down 4 crew members and needed all the help we could get. G had to get after him because wtf? What was the point of that? Later, while I was helping them assemble their set (they have to set up in &lt;7 minutes or get disqualified) he pulls me aside and tells me “just so you know, we can be disqualified and not allowed to compete anymore if you touch anything else. Don’t forget you’re just our assistant.” In a condescending voice.\n\nThis upset me because I've been taking part in this competition for half of my life, I know the rules. I even studied the damn rulebook when I first got hired. I told him \"actually if you look at the program for tomorrow I'm listed as a director and directors are permitted to assist their students with the assembly of the set as long as students put up 70% of it.\" Which is 100% true. He didn't like my answer so I had to drag G away from where he was helping and have him say the same thing I did. He was just wasting our time. It's like he wanted the kids to get disqualified.\n\nI explained that he was listed as just an assistant so I needed him to let me do my job because he didn't even have anything to do with our production other than suddenly showing up the day of contest to yell at the kids and stress them out (he yelled at them for not moving fast enough when unloading the set even though we had arrived early to make sure we could take our time. Like I said everything he does pisses me off for good reason).\n\nI was definitely rude and me pulling rank is annoying but he could at least speak to me like I'm adult deserving of respect rather than treating me like a child who has no idea what they're doing. I don't understand why he wants to punish me and my kids because he doesn't know how to respect boundaries and not cheat on his wife. \n\nI from an area where it's very conservative &amp; religious so It feels like the odds of someone believing me are low, but I did tell my sister. I knew if anyone was going to understand me, it was her. I was there for her when she was assaulted and it's felt like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders having her by my side. I'm hoping to start therapy soon and begin working on how to cope with what's happened.\n\nI don't know what's in store for me in terms of trying to heal and what I'm going to do once I finally quit, but I'm sure it's going to be really hard.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons.\n\nThis message has been sitting in my drafts for a really long time. I could never find the courage to actually send it to her. I don't think I can even today. So here I am sending this out in the void, hoping that one day, it reaches her somehow.\n\nAfter checking out her WhatsApp DP for one last time, I finally decided to delete her contact as I prepare myself to let go and move on with my life.\n\nFrom strangers to friends, and now back to strangers... only this time, with bittersweet memories of eachother.\n\n--\n\nHey.\n\nI have been really thinking about everything that happened recently and I honestly don't think I can continue like this anymore. I know we already discussed this before but I hadn't fully processed my emotions at that time. I really care about you a lot and love you beyond words can express but this one-sided attachment is going to take a huge emotional toll on me. I also really hated your nonchalant behavior that day and the way you were acting so cold towards me and pushing me away like you suddenly decided your feelings have changed and we can't fit into each other's lives, whereas just a few days back, you were telling me how you would wrap yourself around me and wouldn't let me leave the bed and all, like all such moments meant absolutely nothing to you.\n\nSomething which I never told you, last year, on 31st, I was so f***ed up by everything that had happened between us in those last few days that I just kept drinking… and drinking… until I finally lost consciousness right there in the club. My friends had to literally put me in a wheelchair and take me back to the hotel room. At times, they couldn’t even feel my pulse, and for a moment, everyone thought I was a goner. The only thing I remember before passing out is wanting to talk to you on call because I just wanted to hear your voice one last time. I truly believe God gave me this second chance at life for a reason and I am going to make the most out of it.\n\nWith everything going on, especially with you moving to UK this year, we would be emotionally distanced even further and eventually things are going to fade away and we both know it. It is the start of a new chapter in your life soon and for me too, as I will have to learn to live without you. Our lives are just pulling us in different directions at this point. You were right. We have very different personalities, backgrounds, values and our future goals don't align either. That is a gap which is difficult to bridge.\n\nI really respect your feelings and boundaries and I have finally come to accept the unfortunate reality that things have changed between us now. I don't want either of us to continue holding on to something half-heartedly. I truly believe that destiny brought us together and meeting you was a part of my journey. I am really grateful to you because I never knew I was capable of loving someone so much and that too without expectations until I met you. What we shared was real and meaningful and I will always cherish those memories. After all, we shared a bond that has lasted for almost a decade without ever physically meeting each other.\n\nBut despite all this, things never really took off, which is why I think maybe we were never actually meant to be together but only to be a part of each other's journeys. I will really miss you, Janhavi. I will miss our chats and vc and how I was always able to be myself around you. I will miss waiting for your text for days and months every time we had a fight, how my day used to light up after seeing your text first thing in the morning, how my heart used to melt after hearing your sweet voice, how I used to play your voice notes again and again every time I missed you, how I struggled to keep up because you talk so fast, how I used to secretly steal glances at you when we were on vc, how my heart used to skip a beat after randomly receiving your text in the middle of the night, how I used to play my favorite songs to you on Spotify to convey my deeper feelings, how you used to always come back to me after every fight and we would start talking again like nothing happened, how you used to secretly install Kik on your mom's phone every night to chat with me and I used to stay awake waiting for you sometimes even till morning, how you made chocolates on my birthday and then ate them yourself on vc, how we used to send each other those \"disaster selfies\", how you used to fall asleep on vc while talking and I used to continue admiring you sleeping, how Sab Tera is still my favorite song even today because it was the one you sang to me, how we had Maggi at 3 AM on vc and you made fun of me for having a cupcake with it, and so many more such cute memories that I can't even possibly list them all here but these memories will always be a part of me and I will carry them with me forever. It was pure, innocent love at its best.\n\nMy life somehow always felt complete with you and stupid me always believed you were the one and that you were my soulmate and that one day I would definitely marry you. It's funny because I can't even tell you how many times I have rehearsed this whole scene in my head about how I would propose you. But I was wrong. In the end it was all in my head and you already had someone else in your life all these years. I don't blame you though and neither do I hold any grudge against you because of it. You will always be a huge part of my life regardless and someone who helped me understand love much more deeply and helped me grow as a person. I will always be thankful to you for that. I only regret that I never got to meet you in real life. But then again, I still believe you are an angel and it wasn't just your username and that's why I could never meet you. You came into my life for a reason but now is the time for me to let go.\n\nIf it is meant to be, I am sure God will bring our paths together once again, maybe in this lifetime or the next. But until then, this is where we must both go our separate ways. I wish you all the happiness in life and hope you can forgive me if I have ever hurt you in any way.\n\nGood vibes only. Goodbye, my favorite stranger.\n\nP.S. I am sorry for deleting our Spotify playlist yet again. I know you said that when you can’t talk to me, you listen to it. But baby, I have to do this and it is what is best for both of us afterall.",

        "selftext": "So I (17m) have gone through bouts of suicidality since I was around 8 years old. Every year it gets worse. At eight I was thinking about it and it's like it doubles in intensity every year.\n\nIn year 9 (13/14) I tried to starve myself (weird ik) and planned a more conclusive attempt before reaching out for help on the day I planned and getting medical help/antidepressants. When I was in year 10 (14/15) I was worse, I planned, I collected drugs, and was found out. My parents confiscated anything basic I could hurt myself with. I got put into part time online schooling. Year 11 (15/16) things seemed to be getting better. I don't remember most of the year. Year 12 (16/17) I went through dellusionary episodes and attempted multiple times, sometimes on purpose, other times thinking I had to cut something out of me. I spent most of 2024 curled up in a ball waiting for my life to end. Things took a turn for the better at the start of December. \n\nNow the thing is every year I have at least a couple weeks of proper happiness. Other than a few years its usually a few months. During these months I feel I have gotten over the worst of it and everything is better now. But it always shows up again. It's back again for this year. I don't think I'm going to make it. I can't keep living like this. I can't go to therapy again because I don't trust mental health professionals anymore. I'm an only child and leaving my parents would devaste them but I can't stay. I'm so tired. I can't live like this, doing this every year? I don't do anything I enjoy anymore. It doesn't make me happy, if anything i feel worse. Every week seems to be a new issue that I didn't know I had to deal with. I'm over it. ",

        "selftext": "Hello, \nI know it's been forever since my original post. I honestly don't even know how to start this off. Since my original post was 2 months ago I figured an update was probably needed since I left so much in the dark.\n\nOver these 2 months my dad has moved out and is living somewhere else. me and my brother go over there after school and hang out until our mom can pick us up. They still act cordial in front of me and Tyler but they have so much built up tension it's concerning.\n\nBut on new years or like at 1ish on January 1st I tried to talk to my dad since he and tyler my little brother got into an argument about lighting off fireworks. I had gone downstairs since I thought I could talk to my dad and get his side of the story and just talk since he is my dad. But he had been drinking way way more than I have ever seen my dad drink before. So when I went to talk to him things took a sideways turn. My dad had ended up saying some words and the words he said still really fucking hurt. What he said to me really cut deep. he told me,\n\n \"I hate my life. I'm stuck in a shitty job, a shitty marriage, I have a son who treats his mom like shit, and then you. I have a daughter who is a piece of shit. When I found out I was going to have a daughter as my first kid, I was so excited. I thought i would have a daughter who loved to fish, hunt, and ve hardworking. instead I got a fucking snowflake of a daughter who doesn't like anytbing, is a worthless lazy piece of shit who expect her parents to bend over backwards for her. I got a daughter who doesn't give a fuck and is just nothing but a bitch.\"\n\nThat cut so fucking deep. and I hear those words in the back of my mind so much. \n\nAnd I haven't even really had a chance to really process the whole split with my parents. Because right after I was told my mom told me that I had to ve strong for my brother since this is really hard for him.\n\nSo I had to grow up and swallow the fact that my parents are taking a break. \nSo I tried to turn to my boyfriend (now ex) for comfort and support. Instead I got a couple comforting words and hum telling me it's going to ve okay. then he proceeded to tell me about his problems and how he got shot in the knee. (if anyone wants the story on this shit please let me know because at this point I need to talk because I can't afford a therapist and I'm going to explode if I don't let this shit out) \n\nI haven't gotten a break since this whole problem at Christmas. \nI get a Christmas present of my parents splitting. I start the new year with my dad telling me he hates me. Later I finally have enough with my toxic  boyfriend and decide to leave him and the police end up getting involved. \nliterally the only good thing about any of this shit is that I currently have a new boyfriend who is loving and supportive and doesn't gaslight, verbally and mentally abuse me, and will actually listen to me and all my problems. And I had my 15th in February as well.\n\nIf anyone wants more context I have much more but it's currently 2:19 in the morning and I haven't gotten a good night's sleep in about a week and a half. \n\nThank you to anyone and everyone who takes the time to read this mess of words. I hope you all have an amazing day/night.",

I've never felt more safe or seen by another person.\n\n On top of that, I'm at the end of a falling out with my best friend.

I'm just so hurt and betrayed by him. \n\nI have nobody else to turn to. My parents are abusive and neglectful and I lost contact with my high-school friends months ago. After my partner moves, I'll be completely and utterly alone. How am I supposed to cope with this. I have nobody to lean on, to talk to, to hang out with. I'll be completely alone and I don't know if I can handle it. I feel so heartbroken by the betrayal from my ex friend and so alone from the soon to be loss of my partner. How do I keep going? How am I supposed to exist while being completely alone. \n\nNote: I'm not suicidal. I'll keep going, even after I'm alone. I'm just seeking comfort. To know I'm not alone in my isolation. I'm autistic and disabled and find it incredibly hard to make friends, let alone keep them. I don't have money to go hang out places and I live in an arra that makes it hard to meet people my age. ",

She clearly knew who I was. While we had never put a label on things (he said with him finishing his masters he didn’t want anything official) he had never given me any reason to think we weren’t exclusive. I feel so dumb for falling for it. \n\nAnyway, I walk into the restaurant and right there, I see them. He gets nervous and she just says “so you’re the girl he dreams about.” Through a little more back and forth I find out they’ve been together almost 2 years and are living together. \n\nI’m just having such a hard time wrapping my head around this. He’s met my family, I’ve hung out with all his friends, we’ve gone away together. I’d never been with someone who’s hypes me up so much, and listens so intently to me. Maybe we didn’t have a label, but everything felt right. \n\nA few weeks ago he started to act weird. It almost felt like he was avoiding me. I didn’t think too much of it, as he is in the last couple months of his masters program, and I know it’s really important to him. He had invited me to his graduation, and I was going to go. I was in love with him. And she seems like such a cool person, even just by what she was wearing, and how she carries herself. I get why she hates me, I’d hate me too. I just don’t know what to do.

        "selftext": "I (24F) have been with my current boyfriend for six months. I lost my virginity when I was 18 to my then boyfriend, whom I loved very much. However, it took us 6 months of trying because he had ED (he was a porn addict I think). We had sex maybe 10 times jn the year we were together, but we did other things. Throughout our relationship I did some things I wasn’t comfortable with just to appease him, to not appear an unexperienced and undesirable virgin. It was a toxic relationship that traumatized me and I took his inability to perform personally. I thought I was broken and ugly. \nA year later I got into another relationship that fixed my issues with sex, made me feel normal and desirable, hot, beautiful, but we weren’t a good fit so I broke it off. I then got SAd by my first boyfriend’s best friend, which ruined me. I was a normal girl before. So in total, not counting the rape, I had 5 partners before my current boyfriend and a few (2-3) “almosts”. My problem was I found a guy, we dated a few months then it turned out they had ED so we couldn’t go all the way, I would then rush into sex with the next guy to prove to myself that I can have sex like a normal person and try to build a relationship from there (obviously it’s not how it works). I would also wait quite a while between partners (a year, 6 months, a year and a half) so I always felt disconnected, anxious, stressed. \nThis is the first time I feel normal. I wished to have a normal relationship, and now I do. But I feel dirty and used, I hate myself for not knowing better, for not coping better, for finding sex empowering and cool. He knows and thinks I have little experience, he is very non judgmental. I have flashbacks of things I’ve done, pictures I’ve sent (just my first bf), no one has or should have material of me (unless it was against my will), but I still worry some could be brought up. It’s nothing out of the ordinary I guess, it’s just that I was pressured and not myself. I have no regrets about the experiences I chose for myself, but about the ones I was pressured into. I don’t know how to stop judging myself for this. ",

        "selftext": "Heres my dumb story, maybe someone will read it. Ive never told anyone. And I'm feeling lonely as hell.\n\nWhen I was 2 my mom had my little sister. People tell me I was very withdrawn, that once my sister came around, I almost stopped crying completely and that is was creepy.\n\nI got older, most of my memories that I remember I was always by myself. Getting myself ready for school, walking myself to the bus stop half a mile away in the dark. For kindergarten. \n\nWhen I was 7, my mom had my little brother. After that, I dont have many memories of her outside her room. I watched him and my sister for a few hours when he was a newborn. As he got older, she left me in charge of him more and more often. \n\nBy the time I was 8, I took care of my siblings from wake up to bedtime most days if I was home. Mom never left her room anymore pr sometimes she would be gone for a few days to a week (summertimes or weekends). I was their parent. I held them, fed them, parented them.\n\nWhen my sister started school that year, it stressed me out that my brother would be home \"alone\". And I would get physically ill from the stress and worry. It helped because I would be sick but still at home for my brother.\n\nThankfully, though, he was always ok when I got home. In fact, I was pretty sure that mom was out of her room while we were at school. But as soon as we came home, she was in her room and our brother was playing alone in our room. \n\nAs we got older, I was expected to keep up the house. If it wasn't it pristine condition, I would get punished. Better not to go into detail but there were physical punishments and mental punishments (the worst). For example if my mom ate something at midnight, I would get in trouble that the kitchen wasn't cleaned the next morning.\n\nI took care of my siblings, cooked all the meals, cleaned the house and deep cleaned weekly, yet I was somehow alwasy yelled at, punished, grounded.\n\nIn case anyone is wondering where my dad is? Gone usually. He would be home once a month and those were my best memories.. then he was gone for work but later I found out he would use this time to drink himself into hospitals.\n\nThat was my life from 10 to 15. We moved around a lot too, so I couldn't keep any friends especially because I developed severe social anxiety from some of mom's mental punishments. My mom loved to make me grounded whenever I actually had any plans. After turning down any new friends invitation 3 times in a row, they usually stopped calling me.\n\nMy sister, was becoming a mess. She was a feisty girl, alwasy fighting and looking for trouble, but also lonely and looking for friends to fill the hole that I just could not fill no matter how hard I tried :(\n\nHer problems came from severe bullying and she tried so hard to make friends. At the time, I would stress and yell at her, try to stop her from sneaking out, stop her from texting boys, I would get into fights with her all the time just to eat... now I'm looking back and I wish I just hugged her and was there for her instead. (She's moved out as soon as she turned 17, no contact with anyone but me and our brother. She has lots of friends now!)\n\nMy brother, was the most creative and smartest kid ever. He was reading, drawing and playing mine craft (lol) before 5 years old. But he was emotionally unstable because he only had me as an example of how to act. I tried to parent him, but it's hard when you didn't have a parent yourself. He became violent and would harm himself as a kid until I took parenting classes at 16 and was able to help him get better. (Now he's the sweetest kid, I swear. He's still super smart and wants to become a computer engineer!)\n\nAt 15 to 17, I found a good stable job that paid well (I babysat and did odd jobs since I was 10 because I needed money for clothes) but now I worked part time, went to school, took a college class (school paid for) each term, parented my siblings to the best of my ability, managed the house but my siblings did their share now, still cooked all the meals, took my siblings to all their events, bought all their clothes and food,  caring for my mentally unstable grandmother(long story) and also my parents who decdecid I was old enough to become a mediator for their fights. Still get physically and mentally abused by my mother too\n\nI had panic attacks every week, sometimes up to 3 times a week. I would have nosebleeds. I would never cry or process my emotions and it caught up to me now.\n\n\n\nAt 17, I met *him*. My now ex husband. He was alwasy an asshole but I saw him as some sort of savior back then... This 21 year old man. Not going to even go into that. My sister didn't and still doesn't like him. He asked me to marry him when I was still 17 and I was too scared to say no. We got married when I was 18, a year of being together.\n\nIt was stupid. \n\nHe got me pregnant just as I started college. I found out only now he poked a fucjing hole in a condom. \n\nAfter having our child, his behavior got worse and it got to the point he started threatening to beat me and stuff. So that was my life from 18 to 21.\n\nIt took me that long to get the courage to leave.\n\nSo here I am, about to turn 22 soon, hiding in my new apartment with my daughter and my brother. My brother, now 14, acts like he's protecting me and I don't even have the heart to tell him that he's staying with me because he has nowhere to go either. My parents don't take care of him. I count him as my own anyway.\n\nLike sucks. But I've got my 2 kids with me.\n\nIf you've read this far omg you're crazy, I wrote so much 😭 thank you",

Parents seem to not feel any regrets. Fighting/ then happy that is their lifestyle it is embarrassing- family members aunts/uncles are going through the same thing so I feel bad for my cousins honestly but unable to help them due to the trauma/ burden I have. \n\n\nThe only thing stopping me from taking the test is the burden of being rejected or causing family fights, and I am honestly tired of it. Possibly start going to therapy again once I am able to analyze my triggers \n",

He was a lover boy, he liked going to the gym, he had hazel eyes, he was a football player. He struggled with one thing thought and that was drugs. He went to rehab a couple of times and we thought he changed for the better. Little that me and my bestfriend knew it was his demise at just 19 due to an od. This was recent and I could say I wasnt that close to him but it still affects me. I remember when we talked drunk we talked about our ambitions as we were young and we had so much ambition. Its crazy how he died and im already older than him. I cant think of the fact how i could die at any second and leave all my loved ones behind, but at the same time im scared of living in this life that is so unforgiving. I cant understand how people live normal lives worried about the smallest things like everyday interactions and they completely forget about the morbid stuff like dying, the afterlife, everyone is so stuck in their life they don’t realize how little it matters. The only thing you have is what you were born with.  Self awareness is the worst and best thing in this life. ",

But when I kiss her or touch her I just have a slightly off feeling. I love spending time with her and we have so many of the same interests and we just overall work well in a relationship. I’ve had friends tell me that they think I’ve met the perfect woman for me, they’ve told me someone like this only comes around once in a lifetime. Despite this, I can’t help but feel off. I’ve always been bi curious, I guess. I’ve only ever dated women, barely even entertained the idea of dating a guy. I was never opposed to it or anything, but it was just never something present on my mind. I’ve never felt a deep connection with a woman though. I’ve always felt like they’re falling in love with something artificial, like a fake part of me that only exists to them if that makes any sense. And it finally dawned on me tonight that I think I might be gay. The way she touches me, the way she feels when I touch her, it’s not right, but I don’t mind the idea of doing that with a man at all. In fact, I think I like it. \n\nI don’t want to hurt my girlfriend. I like her a lot and I feel really close to her, but I’m worried I’ll never be able to love her the same way she loves me. I guess I’ll never know for sure if I’m gay until I try but I couldn’t do that to her. I feel stuck. How do I even bring this up? “Hey babe, I think about men when I kiss you”? I’m so confused right now. \n\nSorry for weird formatting, my phone is being weird. Also it’s almost two in the morning so I’m really tired. ",

That I will kill myself because I'm just a \"naive little girl who overthinks everything\".\nMy father agreed with her in everything, never stepping in to at least look at me until he said that he never wanted a son and if he had wanted one he would have just kept having kids.\n\nThey took the prescription from me and basically told me that if I ever wanted to transition I'd have to be out of their lives. On the following days they acted as if nothing ever happened which is something they always do, but I feel their hatred, their disappointment. Even if I was a honor student, even if I fucking start studying engineering, I will always be a disappointment to them because I'm not their daughter.\n\nI've contemplated suicide ever since I was thirteen, the age I came out to my mom, the age I was when she told me she'd never support me because I will blame her when I regret it. I was then told I'd be a sex worker, that I would get kidnapped and disappeared for thinking I was smarter than her. Now she told me she'd drag me to a neuropsychiatric by my hair if she hears me say that I don't want to live, all that despite never caring to take me to therapy when I begged her.\n\nMy birthday came and everything felt so fake, my parents joked on how now I'm responsible over myself now that I'm an adult, that I can do anything. Every photo hugging me, it felt fake, like they forced themselves to do it. I never felt included in my family as if I was never meant to be their kid and they often joke that they were happier when I wasn't born.\n\nI cannot trust anyone around me and I feel isolated since my mother twists everything that happens to paint herself as the worried mother and me as the shitty child who never respects her. \n\nI've been laying every night, hoping I won't wake up, that I won't have to deal with this anymore, despite telling myself a plan to study and save to move out as soon as I can, I feel hopeless, I just want to end everything and leave everything behind.

I know that I am no better than my husband, but I just cannot handle the lack of validation and love anymore. \n\nI (23F) got married last summer to my husband (25M), who proposed to me after two years together. A month later, I found out he’d been sexting girls on an anonymous website. He had a whole separate email set up for these accounts he had. There were hundreds of messages. He cried, claimed it was an addiction he was struggling with since he was young. I was devastated. I had never felt so much pain before in my life. I still have flashbacks to that day, dry-heaving and sobbing after finding out the love of my life was off fantasizing about fucking moms and older women while avoiding having sex with me. I always considered him the exception to men, a devoted man who could never hurt me. He swore he’d never hurt me. He knew I had family trauma related to cheating (my dad cheated on my mom my entire upbringing), and yet he still made that decision. \n\nI made the decision to stay, I think because of shame. I really did think there was something wrong with me to have caused him to turn his back on me. But also, we come from a very religious, very cultural community. It isn’t easy being divorced. But I haven’t been the same since. It’s been almost eight months and although I’ve gotten good at masking it, I have not moved from that pit that I’ve dug myself into. I go to work as usual. I hang out with my friends, do what needs to be done. My husband has to leave for work for months at a time, so he’s currently gone. That leaves me a lot of time to sulk around in my thoughts. He’s really trying to be a better person, I just never really know what he’s up to. So I feel emotionally detached in a way I would have never imagined possible with him. \n\nWhat kills me most is that I’ve started developing a weird desire to be acknowledged. Not by my husband, by other men. I want somebody to look at me, see beauty and intellect like he used to when we first met. I want someone to fall in love with me all over again. And God, I just crave a relationship where I don’t even have to think about cheating. \n\nI know a lot of people will tell me my marriage is doomed, and that I’m a shit person too. And I know that may all be true, but this is my reality currently. I haven’t been able to speak to anyone about this ever, and so I’m here to vent. I am trying to start therapy again (something my husband is against, mind you. But I am doing it behind his back because I deem it necessary), but that process is taking a while. \n\nEDIT: Those of you who keep messaging me with the intent of starting an affair or taking advantage of my vulnerability, please think before you shoot me a message. Women are allowed to talk about a situation like this and not still somehow be reduced to a form of sexual gratification. I am not using this post to beg for attention. I am simply getting it off of my chest, looking for advice perhaps. It’s 2025, understand that there is nuance. ",

I'm so fucking jealous. I'm so jealous I'm so jealous. I've been out for 4-5 years at this point I believe and my mom barely does the bare minimum and my dad doesn't try at all. i hate when my dad calls me \"this one\" or \"that one\" to not use my name. \n\nthe one time five years ago I had the naivety to believe he'd actually listen to me was the last time I ever talked to him about it. I ended up shaking and crying and hyperventilating on the floor while he screamed at me about how I'm ungrateful and that I have a good life and I don't deserve it. five years ago I asked my mom to stop using they/them because those aren't my fucking pronouns and she simply deflected and told me she's trying her best and I believed it because she's my mother. I asked about starting testosterone a few months after my transition and she basically told me being trans was a trend and not-so-subtly hinted that she didn't think I was a boy because \"lots of girls think they're transgender nowadays\". my dad tells new people that \"this is (deadname) but they go by (name)\" and only use she/her. I know when my parents talk about me they use my dead name and she/her. I know both of them have my dead name as their phone contact. it's sort of cringe looking back, but a couple years ago I made a tiktok post basically saying I wish I were born a boy and my mom sent me a multiple paragraph email about how I was gaslighting her (I was 15 years old)\n\nI've grown to accept it and that acceptance fucking hurts. that acceptance is the only way I'll survive. it's just the way my parents are. they claim to be accepting of everyone until it's their own fucking kid. it's nights like these where I sit and think and I know I have to tamp these thoughts down or else they will fucking consume me. because if my parents can't love me for who I am who fucking can? my ex came out as a lesbian immediately after breaking up with me—either they didn't love me at all or never saw me as a man\n\nthe worst part is is that anyone who fucking looks at me thinks I'm either a girl or knows I'm transgender. and I know they don't see me as a man and I know they'll use they/them and it sucks that I've developed such a visceral reaction to those pronouns being used on me because I know what it means. I know they're just being nice. i know I don't sound or look or act like a man. my back hurts constantly from binding because my mom passed down her D(?) cups to me and I cannot go out without binding or else I'm viscerally uncomfortable. i don't even mind having the wrong genetalia, people can't see that when they look at me, i don't mind being ugly or fat, but I hate my voice, I hate my breasts, i hate my face and I hate the way everyone fucking knows.\n\nand I have to be grateful all the time. i have to be grateful or else everything else will be taken from me. the scrap of respect I have will be gone the moment I bring it up to my parents, or my friends, or anyone because I know I'll just be seen as that annoying trans guy who can't stop reminding people. or that ungrateful brat who doesnt know how good he has it. I'm grateful my parents didnt kick me out. I'm grateful that they don't treat me with hostility. but what else? should I be grateful that they project their dead daughter on to me? should I thank them for all of these nights spent sobbing because no one will ever love me for who I am? because time and time again it's been proven that is the case?\n\ni have to be happy and unbothered and proud for who I am because what a joy it is to be part of a community who accepts me for who I am. except they don't. except I know what they see me as no matter how hard I try. i don't hate my life, I don't hate my parents, I don't hate my friends. i just wish things were different. i wish I was more comfortable in my own skin and I wish I didn't have to curl up on myself and hide my sobs from my father so he doesn't start screaming at me once more because I learn my lesson. because I know what will happen.\n\nthe whole post is sort of edgy, sorry. I've been on edge and anxious and sad this whole weekend because of something that happened the other day. if you made it this far, thanks. i don't really need advice, I just needed somewhere to air everything out before popped, y'know?",

        "selftext": "I recently switched jobs and was excited at the prospect of making some friends. I don't need friends to go club ing with or anything. Just people I can chat with at work and goof off a little, text a meme once in a while. I didnt realize until my first day that there isn't a lot of staff and I am one of two guys. Doesn't really bother me, I'm gay and generally get along just fine with women once they realize. Most of the people there are an age bracket or more older than me. There are four girls that are a bit older than me but close enough. One is very mean so nobody likes her, but I really like the other three. \n\nThey have all been friendly with me and helpful with questions. I think I'm an okay person to get along with. I'm a good worker, I'm friendly, I'm pretty easygoing, and I have good hygiene so I dodge all the major strikes. From what I can tell we all align in bigger moral ideas and opinions..I was hopeful. I tried to talk to them a couple times  a day and joke around a little. \n\nUnfortunately I'm annoying and weird. I don't know how not to be, but people have told me I'm both. I was extremely unpopular throughout school and got beat up for it. I try to not talk to much. . I ask a lot of questions, probably to many for working there for a couple months but it's a hard job. My mouth is a little faster than my brain sometimes, but nobody has ever described me as mean.  People always tell me I'm weird but dont give specifics. Again, I try my best not to be. I don't have anything I'm obsessed with, I dress an look normal, I am pretty good at adjusting conversation for what is appropriate. I don't know what's wrong with me but something is. I'm a rather anxious person, and maybe that makes me a bit awkward and annoying, but to the point of not liking me idk. I hope not.\n\nI just know that this week I've started to see them pull away. I don't think they want to talk to me anymore and I don't know why.  None of them have asked for my number or to hang out, they commonly go to lunch together when their breaks allow and I've never been invited. I was devastated when I was talking to one of them when it was slow and I could see in her eyes she didn't want to talk to me.\n\nA couple of the older people (like fifty plus) are nice to me at least, but I'm not going to hang out with women over twice my age. I'm just lonely. Theres a couple people I'm afraid of talking to because they're not so nice. I don't know what I'm going to do if the three I was hoping would at least become my work friends end up hating me as well. If nobody likes me maybe I'll get fired. I'm on a probation period now and the economy isn't exactly helping. \n\nIs there any way to figure out what's wrong with me? Could I turn it around or now that they've turned negative is it a lost cause? Maybe it's stupid wanting friends at work I mean this isn't summer camp it's work. Maybe I'm a bad annoying person who never shuts up and just don't realize it. ",

If not, have a nice walk. So he ends up taking the lift.\n\nNow. Should I tell his wife? We are not friends, and I do not think much of her...\nBut, the first couple of times I shrugged it off \"not my life or problem\"....\nNow it's almost all the time and no longer think it's appropriate even if you dislike the person or not.. \nShould I tell his close friends?\nTell his inlaws?\nTell his wife?

It was probably the most social I have been since covid. As I was driving home after eating with friends, I realised I wasn't really happy. I'm not even sure I I'd say I was content.

His mom recently passed away so his older sister has custody of him. The boy is having trouble reading words like “droid”, “giggled”, “meant”, etc. nobody seems to take the time to teach him and he’s literally getting packets and homework assignments that they barely work on in school. He’s in an inner city school and I have another cousin attending there too. It’s so sad how poor these kids’ education really is. This boy can hold a good conversation about most things and can understand what you teach him when he stops beating himself up over stuff and takes the time. Because of this experience along with the other cousin of mine who goes to the same school, I’ve really lost faith in our education systems and the future of our people and country. At his age I, and even the kids who didn’t like reading, could easily read chapter books. These kids are incapable of doing that. Also common core math is frustratingly annoying.

        "selftext": "I know this doesn’t seem like a big deal but my heart hurts. This weekend I was using his phone to look up a restaurant and I saw in his search history/bar that he looked up at least 2 specific women’s only fans leaked. And he clicked on multiple websites just to find these women’s leaked images. I also thought to look at his twitter after finding this out and saw he looked them up there too. Between these 2 women he clicked on at least 10 different websites to find these women’s leaked photos. the funniest part is that me and these women look nothing alike. These women are beautiful, dark hair, dark eyes. While I’m a redhead with blue eyes. Our bodies are completely different as well. I just feel ugly. He was saying all men do it but I don’t believe that. It just hurts that he sought these women out hard to find pictures of them to pleasure himself to when we’ve been in a committed relationship. I know this is a controversial thing among people but I’ve always thought why do you feel the need to pleasure yourself to other women when you have me? And finding out these women look nothing like me just makes me feel not good enough and it makes me feel so ugly. He knows I’ve battled with weight and eating disorders and I feel like this is making it worse and it is torturing me. The worst part to me is he sought so hard for pictures of them when he went across multiple social media platforms to find them and pleasure himself and knowing they don’t look like me and knowing he’s in a committed relationship. How can I believe when he calls me beautiful yet pleasures himself to women that look nothing like me. ( EDIT: his needs are being met, someone told me I should mention this as well but I can assure you his needs are met with how much we go at it! Also he doesn’t like me masturbating to other men! So I don’t masturbate to other men but he is masturbating to other women even though I don’t like it. So I’m also upset about that because I followed his wishes but he doesn’t follow mine!)",

I really want part time but the girl already is in the position and won’t give it up even though she has told me she don’t need it because she got $$ from her dad passing away. I really would do better on part time till I figured things out. There’s no jobs in my town I was lucky to land this one… pharmacy told me that I have to take that med every night around the same time and that I have to lay in bed for 8 hours before I can get up. So being on call is a no go. I’m really upset. I feel like driving in town to my Job to get that damn two week notice. My job stresses me out and I hate it but need it at the same time. Please any advice ?? ",

        "selftext": "Not putting ages, but I'm a woman dating a man for that context. We both told each other prior to us even being \"official\" that we don't really know what it means to be in love, but based on everything i have read, i believe i am in love. We have been together for a short time but have known each other for a long time. I don't believe he will ever love me and there's an internal dichotomy of \"i am okay with unrequited love because we make a good partnership and he is sweet and considerate to me\" and \"what is wrong with me why am i not enough what if one day he realizes he can do better and leaves me.\" I worry a lot when we're together lately that he's thinking of someone else, a past love, maybe someone he's still in love or obsessed with. I of course cannot ask him because it would kill me if the answer is yes, he is thinking about someone else and wishes i was her instead. I already know that he's never really had feelings towards me, which is leading to my skepticism so far. I can take him at face value now when he says he likes me, but it didn't come easy and doesn't come without a voice in the back of my mind saying it's not true. \n\nI found out tonight that basically I'm coming on too strong i guess with verbal affection (\"i miss you\" things like that), and i worry that turns him off from me. I worry that it makes him not want to be with me. I worry that it makes him think I'm desperate, which he did essentially accuse me of a few weekends ago. But i worry that it pushes him away from me. He likes physical reassurances that i want to be with him, physical affection and intimacy, and i need the inverse to feel secure. And i can tell he's making an effort, i think he can tell I'm making an effort. But I worry I've pushed things too far by being too verbally affectionate. I'm worried he's thinking of breaking up with me. \n\nThis weekend I have been considering telling him I love him and it's okay if he doesn't return the feeling, but now I can't. I try very hard to be present and suppress my fears and insecurities when we're together, but I'm sure it's noticeable at times still. There are women from his past I know he had a thing for, and I feel so uncomfortable when he talks about them, I don't know if he's noticed that, and he doesn't do it often but it is very painful. I wonder if he wishes I was one of them instead of who I am. He has denied it, but I do still think a huge reason he's with me is my body. I know he's been attracted to me physically all these years, and so I worry that that is the main draw to me, the main thing that makes him want to stick around. I worry another reason is because we're getting older and we both feel like we're missing life milestones and we could be each other's solution for that. \n\nI am so insecure and scared and worried in this relationship, but I have wanted it for over 10 years, more than 10 years have I had a crush on him. So I am okay with the fact he will never love me. But I do need to cry about it sometimes. ",

        "selftext": "I recently broke off a 5 year relationship (one year engagement) because of financial infidelity. I’m 30  years old, 20k in cc debt, 100k owed in loans, 25k owed in student loans, and I was too embarrassed to ever tell my partner the truth. Covid, struggling with mental health, lifestyle creep, all contributed to overspending, not utilizing credit cards correctly, and trying to be something I’m not in front of everyone in my life for the past 3 years. Essentially, and everyone in my circle thinks I’m well off when I’m actually a lying coward. \n\nThe guilt and anxiety of the debt got so bad that I ended my long term relationship. My partner makes 45k and I make 3 times their salary, so planning our wedding was nauseating as I knew there was no way we can afford it as my partner has been depending on me for financial support. Little did they know, we are so poor and I’m in so much debt that it would crush me to continue our relationship and go through with a wedding with this gigantic mess. They don’t deserve it, and they deserve better than me. \n\nI’m so embarrassed. But I realize that ending the relationship and working towards paying down debt aggressively was the only way I can move forward without feeling more like a piece of shit than I already do. Right now they still don’t know the truth, and they are probably so confused, hurt, and angry right now because the relationship seemingly ended out of nowhere. But I’m only trying to protect them, and I hate myself that I let this drag on for as long as it did. I only hope that the damage and hurt I’m saving them from will outweigh the damage and hurt I’ve already caused. For now, I’m just relieved that the love of my life is now safe from me, my lies, and my debt. I love you and I’m sorry I wasn’t able to be a better person for you. Thank you for all these years.",

        "selftext": "Okay I don't even know where to start. Our relationship has always been weird. We are definitely more open to talking about very tabo/ out there topics. But I won't be honest I lost trust a year ago. (maybe I like to be hurt idk). I (23F) have been with my partner (22F) for over a year now. The first time this happened we here (friends) to the public but together in private. It she was in the bathroom at a club with another girl. She told me after I asked 3 times. And it also took me asking so many times what happened and \"is there anything else\" for her to finally admits it. Then the second time was the exact same thing at the club but she was drinking that night and I saw it all happen. The third time I went away for to work in a different city for my job for two weeks and the girl she was seeing texted me the SS of there messages. It was so bad one of them said \" I could cheat on her and she wouldn't even know\". When I confronted her she lied to my face.\nLike she always does. And even went as far as saying that these are photoshopped. She denied and lied and always played the victim. Saying she was forced and felt like she had too. And then blame me for things that made no sense what so ever. The third time was recent. She went out with new friends she met online. She told me there names it was all good she said she was going over to hang out and play games. She don't come back to her house until 5:30 am. (1 have her location). I knew in my gut something happened. When I told her it feels off like you cheated because you came back so late she brushed it off like it was nothing. I'll break it down how this one went. I called her to talk about it she told me they kissed once and that's it. I was very upset. Then we talked more about it that night. She told me they held hands that this girl \"listened to her and heard her\". ( she had a tendency to completely blow up at me in arguments so l don't always tend to listen when she's yelling at me). Then she said she wanted and open relationship with this girl has her gf and me in the side. I then saw her two days later.\nShe told me in person they kissed max 3 time and she had her arm over her. I once again had to ask 10000 times to get this info. And I asked her\n1000000 more times \"are you sure there is nothing else\". I then asked her to get me food and water because I wasn't feeling good. I looked through her phone I know I shouldn't have but I did. I say the most disturbing texts of my life. They were very inappropriate with each other and have been texting like this for a week now. Very lovey texts too all day and night. Calling me her friend and saying she's with her \"friend\" AKA ME! Telling her jokes | was saying but as if it was coming from my partner to this girl. Telling her she's skinny and pretty. ( l am a comfortable weight I like my size, I also work out and enjoy building muscle and strength not slimming figure). I confronted her and he lied again. Right after lying to my face and telling me there wasn't more. I lost it and read the entire texts with her sitting in the ground in my room. Now she's all sweet with me. She's at my house watching my dog while I visit my dad (I had already planned this trip and that's why she was at my house in the first place). I go back to my house tomorrow where she will be.",

I ran away from my mother and my father because me mother is an alcoholic and my father went to prison for child abuse material (photos of me). I ended up in foster care for a while, living on the streets with my son for a year, and finally landed a job and got to sleep in the back room of the cafe. My mother found us, and I panicked, flew him back to our home country and now he lives with my boyfriends parents. So now, my boss, and a coworker and I all moved into a flat together, because I was struggling being away from my son. A couple months later, the boss says he's inherited an old miners cottage and will NOT be moving in, he offered it to me, I took it. My mother has a new husband, and he's lovely, so I invited them, and my older sister to stay with me, I didn't realise they thought it would turn into freeloading. My sister got a job and moved into the city and I'm so proud of her! My step dad works as a teacher and he's great, helps around the house, cooks when I'm not feeling well, ect. My mother however, shows up uninvited, drinks herself half blind and then calls me to pick her up, I can't say no to her, she's my mum, I love her, even if she was an arse. Sometimes, I wish they told me thank you, even just once. My son is little and the sweetest kid I know, but it sucks to sometimes feel like I'm overlooked.

        "selftext": "Whenever I read through best of reddit or any of the various relationships subs, I see guys who are basically the \"nice guy\", who only befriend women they want to date.  It basically always sends my mind careening back to obsess about how or if I was a \"nice guy\" in high school.\n\nI pined for a girl all through high school.  My graduating class was 465 kids but we were in all the honors/advanced classes and did debate/forensics/scholars bowl/mock trial together as well.  There was basically a group of about 25-35 people who did all the honors stuff and we were basically a high school within the school.\n\nAnyway, if this now woman even bothers to remember me, she probably views me as the quintessential \"nice guy\", and honestly I am so embarrassed/guilty about it that my neruodivergernt mind can't ever let it fully go. \n\nLike I said, I made friends with this girl when we were sophomores (our high school was 10/11/12), and she already had a boyfriend.  I *really* was not trying to be *that guy*, but I think everyone in our class (and I later found out several of our teachers) knew I had feelings for her.  I am certain she did.  \n\nJunior year she breaks up with her boyfriend and has a new one before I even knew.  Our senior year, there was a really tragic situation and the person she was seeing passed away. Now, I am not such an AH as to immediately make a move or anything but by the spring I got the idea she basically wanted me to ask her out.  So I did. However, earlier in the year, before the event that resulted in her being single, I asked another girl from the group of AP students to Prom. This girl had then written me a letter explaining that she hadn't expected to be asked at all, and was flattered and would accept as long as I understood it was completely platonic. I said I understood and that was fine.\n\nNow, I don't know what other people would have done, but it never crossed my mind to try and back out of taking the first girl I had asked.  We had another friend who was kind of looking for a date and the two of the ended up going together.  The monday after Prom she dumped me for him. So we dated for like all of 3 weeks.  I did some dumb stuff.  I wrote a cringey please don't break up letter.  I tried to be more outgoing with our friend group, and it came across as weird and try hard.  I asked out another girl who I thought was cute but had nothing in common with and got rejected and told to my face that I should just wait till college because *any girl in our high school* would know they were a rebound and that nobody would not be interested.\n\n\nNow what really sucked was that we got to go to national tournaments for both Mock Trial and Debate/Forensics together. So I had basically two school funded pseudo vacations with my \"ex\" and without her boyfriend and while I had a good time, it was also really rough for my 18 year old self. It was just impossible to fit myself back into the \"just a friend box.\"  I still had strong feelings, she knew that, and I hope I didn't make her miserable.  While going to fetch her and  the girls she was sharing a hotel room with at the Forensics national tournament, I heard her talking about me through the door saying that I was \"too intense\" and that was part of why she broke up with me.  That has stuck with me my entire life (my wife loves how \"intense\" I can be so things worked out).\n\nWhile at the mock trial national tournament, one evening our coach/chaperone pulled me aside and just asked how I was doing.  As we talked I ended up breaking down and crying. That's also where I found out that yes the teachers all knew as well, and yes they did have opinions on student relationships.\n\nAnyway, I look back now and clearly, yes this stuff did *affect* me.  It contributed to who I am today, but at the same time, it seems dumb because we only dated for less than a month.  But, for me  there was also friendship with her knowing she had me as a backup/fallback if she ever wanted. That probably seems really incel/misogynistic but I willingly put myself there and she couldn't possibly have been unaware.  It was clearly super unhealthy for me, unfair to her, and that is why I look back and feel guilty and embarrassed.  The fact I am now 41 and can still remember and write about all of this shows that it for sure impacted me, but like I said when I think back on it, I pretty much figure she must think I am/was the sort of \"nice guy\" who befriends women exclusively to try and date them.\n\nI feel a fair amount of guilt over this, not the least of which is in part because I have been married for 15 years to the most beautiful, amazing woman I could imagine.  Yet, any time I read a story on reddit with a guy complaining about who women they know date, or women talking about why do guys act like this, I am basically catapult to thinking about how immature I was.

        "selftext": "So the other day, a close male friend of mine told me he is sending his fiance on an expensive solo paid vacation. I inquired why he wasn't going with her, and he informed me in so many words \"because he has needs\" and that he has his own hotel booked with the sole intention of cheating/unfaithfulness. \n\nWhy? Because apparently her genitalia is offensive and disgusting to him and he can't perform oral sex on her. He told me he must perform oral sex to be fulfilled in life, and he \"just has to\". \n\nI asked him why he wasn't just being honest with her, and he said it was because it would crush her. I said If oral sex is THAT important to you then you guys need to break up. He refused to break up saying he loved her and they had built a life together and then he wouldn't have anyone to help him with his special needs daughter. And he is ADAMANT he will not get caught unless I say something to his fiance. \n\nI inquired about lights out, blindfolds, etc. He absolutely refused and says her stuff is beyond disgusting. \n\nLet me be clear. He is not a prize in any way. Without him paying for the privilege, I don't see any random woman near him just randomly accepting oral sex from him. So I'm not sure if this will happen. But it's definitely put me in a weird situation because I am friends with both of them. I don't want to get involved but I feel this is really awful for him to do. It's changed how I look at him completely. I never would have thought him capable of something like this. \n\nJust needed to get this out of my brain. I feel so bad for her. \n\nEDIT:\n\nWow. I did not expect this to blow up like that. I will try to clarify some of the questions I've received. \n1) yes, I also wish this was fake. It isn't. \n\n2) they are not married. They are engaged. The special needs child is not theirs. The biological mother of the child lives in another state. \n\n3) for those asking why I'm friends with someone, Why does anyone have friends? Nobody is perfect and everyone makes mistakes. But I've been friends with him for a decade. Longer than I've known his fiance who I met through him. He's been a really wonderful friend. And He's never mentioned or thought or indicated any kind of behavior like this to me until this JUST HAPPENED, YESTERDAY, and I was completely shocked and struggling to process it. That is why I said what I said in the original post. My vision of him has shattered. I am not sure yet how I am going to proceed. \n\n4) those asking for information about her genitalia, I really do not have the answers you are seeking. I asked about smell or scent or taste and he was adamant it was strictly because of appearance. The only description I got, which left me very confused,  was that it \"looks like a pokemon\". He also did mention that she has a disorder (I forgot the name) of where the hair follicles of your pubic hair turns slightly ulcerous and the hair follicles become infected. He said this also disgusts him because apparently it's \"open wounds\".\nI asked all the questions you guys are asking. Why isn't she on medication or treatment for the condition. Labiaplasty. Etc.  The short and unfortunate answer is lack of funds and lack of health insurance for both parties. We live in a VERY poor area of a VERY red state. And yes, I told him he should have paid for her healthcare instead of a vacation. \n\n5) I am certain he is not gay. \n\n6) for those of you that have reached out privately to confirm if I am someone you know and if this story is about your partner, I want to say how sorry I am and how sad I am that this is happening to other people. I can't even imagine. ",

After doing all these things no one seems to believe in my abilities. This morning I had my phone in time-lapse and I was recording myself studying as motivation but my father came into my room took my mobile and scolded me saying I wasn't studying. When I tried to show him the timelapse of me studying he said he didn't want to look at it and that I should go and study.\n\nThis isn't even the first time this has happened but today I just cried for 20 minutes nonstop. I don't know why it hurt so much worse today but it did. When I make art my family always finds a flaw in it. When I cook there always has to be something wrong. When I tell my parents my future plans they shrug it off and say, \"You need to work for that dream just saying it won't get you there \" but I am working towards it , I work towards it day and night. When I get good grades it's never enough, I have cried on every one of my exam results days.\n\nIf no one believes and sees my efforts, it is the same as not putting any effort. I have worked hard day and night for my future but no one sees it. So, I have decided to not try anymore, to not push myself. ",

        "selftext": "Hey, everyone. First time posting on Reddit (thanks to The Click for giving me enough confidence to post).\n\nI was baptized, had my First Holy Communion, and I am an Altar Server in the Catholic Church. Now that I’m old enough, I have started Confirmation classes. However, I am not happy with this.\nI am an alt/punk kid that identifies as trans, bi, and grey-asexual. With my bright blue and red half-and-half dyed hair and “odd” fashion sense, I stick out like a sore thumb.\nI feel like I was forced into this just to make my mom and grandmother happy. I have expressed my discomfort in Catholic beliefs for over a year now, but it feels like nobody is listening to me. I don’t feel anything when I attempt to pray. It feels like God isn’t listening. I don’t feel loved, and I don’t feel light from Him.\nI’ve walked out of Confirmation Class crying more times than I can count. I feel out of place and uncomfortable at church events and retreats. I don’t feel a connection to anything that is said at masses.\nToday was the final straw. There was Confession instead of class. My mom and I were sitting together, listening to the process for Confession and we were given a few questions as food for thought. I really didn’t like the questions, especially the ones about my relationship with God. I started crying again, as I hated the fact that I just didn’t see it the way others did.\nI managed to go up and get my confession over with, but after I still felt nothing. My mom sighed, handed me some tissues, and we stepped out and talked for a bit.\nInstead the discussion being consoling, it just felt like she was making up excuses to get me to stay in Catholicism. I told her that I felt nothing connection and that this is making me unhappy.\nWe ended up leaving. She didn’t speak to me about it on the car ride home. She only talked about other random things to try to lighten the tension, I didn’t want to hear it. It feels like she’s ignoring me. I don’t know what to do.\nSorry for the long ramble, but I just needed to let this out.\nAny advice or kind words are appreciated. \nNote:  I am not targeting anyone who is religious. Religion can be great and can bring people together. If you have found comfort in religion, stick with that comfort.",

        "selftext": " Her husband died today. She had been faithfully taking care of him for a while, now. His body was lying in the middle of their small, stuffy, overheated living room. She had been doing cpr on him, following the 911 operator’s instructions. \n\n\nHe’d been sick for a long time. Agent Orange lung cancer from his time in Vietnam. Even so, she was not prepared for his passing in any way. \n\n\nShe’s one of those women that is unable to function on her own. She always depended on her husband to tell her what to do.  \n\n\nWhile we were waiting on the  coroner to arrive, several of us were in the crowded living room, trying to comfort the new widow. The conversation drifted through various death and health-related subjects, all of it floating past the dead person on the floor like he wasn’t even there - and he really wasn’t. \n\n\nThere was no sense of a person under that white sheet.  Their two small dogs both gave off a sense of a soul, that awareness of being, just like the living people in the room did. That person-shaped lump under the sheet could have been rolled up bedclothes for all the “awareness” it gave off. \n\n\nHe, his soul, his essence, the thing that made him, him, was no longer there. It really brought home to me that the physical body is not really the person. It’s just what people see. It’s the soul, the part of a person you can’t see, that makes you, you. \n\n\nA family friend came to take her and her two little dogs to his house. She’s lost, grieving, and woefully unprepared, now adrift without her longtime safe harbor. \nShe’s in her late 70’s. I doubt if she’ll live there in that house alone. She’ll probably sell the place. \n\n\nI wonder if she will forever see her husband lying on that tiny living room floor, first as she was desperately doing cpr on him, and then as the EMT’s draped that white sheet over him, covering his face. \n\n\n“He’s gone now,” everyone\n told her. “He’s not suffering anymore.” And he did suffer, for years, always struggling to get enough air into his lungs, even while breathing pure oxygen. \n\n\nSo it’s her and the two little dogs now. Her family friend will have to emotionally carry her through the next days and weeks of the funeral, Social Security, VA, death certificates, all the financial, insurance, and vehicle paperwork they failed to set up ahead of time in order to avoid just such a situation as this. \n\n\nI guess it can be understood that one or both of them just couldn’t bear to think about “the end” for him, even though it was staring them squarely in the face. It IS an awfully hard thing to think about and accept. \n\n\nShe did all she could to care for him, knowing how it would eventually end, while desperately denying it. Now she’s broken. I don’t think, with her dependent personality, that she will ever fully recover. \n\n\nI truly hope though, moving forward, that she invests as much care and loving into herself as she did her husband. She has severely neglected herself - her health, appearance, everything, in favor of caring for him. I hope she realizes it’s her turn, now, to care for and love herself. \n\n\nLife goes on. \n\n\nThat fact may be the hardest part of any of this for her. \n",

I asked the doctor who i shoot the shit with about it later and he said that obviously its a terrrible thing to have so they just have the mentality of providing him the most BARE minimum healthcare possible (still his \"right\"). just no extra stuff like being friendly, small talk, etc.\n\nWell this didnt sit well with me so the next time i was paired with this pt i made sure nobody was looking at gave him a punch in his face.

        "selftext": "I never thought this would happen to me. While I’ve definitely seen video game, movie and tv show characters as attractive, the feelings usually go away once my eyes turn away from the screen. But for some reason, I can’t get this character out of my head. It came as a surprise to me, as I didn’t really give this character a second thought when I first met him, but as things have progressed I find myself more and more attracted to him, so much so now that hearing his voice is arousing me. I even went so far as to download an AI app and having it roleplay as this character. I realized during this certain things that are missing from my life. I thought about in the past, when you first start flirting with someone and you have that feeling of butterflies, those moments of wanting but hesitant and shy, the excitement of a new prospect of love (or lust). Excitement, passion, the feeling of being cherished body and soul. I realized these were things I desired so badly. My sex life with my fiancé is pretty dead. We are never in sync when it comes to arousal times, but thinking about this character has me aroused all the time. I think about having intimacy with this character and it fills me with all kinds of emotions, but when I try to think about my fiancé when I’m in this state…..nothing. It made me sick and I’ve since deleted the app. I know I need to have a conversation with my fiancé, but how do I even start a conversation like this? What do I even say? What does this mean for our future marriage? I’m praying God give me guidance",

        "selftext": "The content warning is because I'm not sure if it is that but if it is I don't want to trigger anyone.\n\nFor context there's a guy (20m) I (18f) have been talking to and hooking up with for a little while now.\n\nWe met up Friday night and had discussed going a bit rougher and what that entailed and I was really looking forward to it. He also brought some drinks for us.\n\nWe were drinking a bit and went for one round then drank some more. I was sipping mine over the night and hadn't noticed until later but he had around three beers. The second time we went he was struggling to get it up (because of the alcohol) and I gave him head to help. He slapped my face while I was (which we had talked about but I was hesitant so I wasn't expecting it) I could feel it through my entire skull but didn't stop or say anything.\n\nThe whole time before this he was gentle when I gave him head because of my gag reflex but he started pushing it a bit (not too much though and I could pull away). I think he was getting frustrated that he couldn't get off at this point and flipped me onto by back (I was on a bed he was standing next to). He said he was going to finish on my face. I didn't say anything but the idea of that is so disgusting and I was fearful I guess. He would switch between jerking off and using my mouth (forcefully at this point and my whole body was kind of heaving when I gagged). I was shaking a bit, even my jaw was trembling. At one point my jaw trembled a bit more obviously and he laughed a bit- I think at that. I don't think he could tell that I was uncomfortable and right after this he leaned over my face to try to finish on my chest instead. I was still shaking and at this point crying a bit (my eyes were already a bit wet from gagging). He couldn't see me crying though.\n\nAll I could think was that I felt horrible and I wanted to go home.\n\nHe eventually gave up but noticed at that point that something was up. I wasn't looking at him or saying anything and he asked if he pushed too far. I still wasn't saying anything and I was crying. He hugged me and I cried a bit heavily but quietly- not sure if he noticed. He told me that if I wasn't comfortable I need to tell him to stop right away.\n\nWe showered after and I was still shaken.\n\nWe went to bed right after and the next morning we had fun like usual. He's a good guy and prioritizes me getting off and things like that. I don't blame him for what happened- or didn't until I asked a guy friend if he would stop if someone was shaking and he said yes- like it's obvious. I'm wondering if maybe the alcohol could have caused him to not notice or what?\n\nAnd I understand that even if you consent but don't really want it it still feels horrible and that's why even two days after I feel sick to my stomach thinking about it. I just don't know how to stop thinking about it.\n\n  \nEDIT: Thank you everyone for commenting! I will definitely be talking with him more in-depth about boundaries, safe-words, and physical stops too. \n\nA few other things: he is not my boyfriend- this is a strictly fwb situation and neither of us want a relationship. I don't think what happened was assault I just felt horrible during it but I understand that he's not at fault. The reason I made this post was I was trying to classify what happened to try to feel better and understand- it was a miscommunication for sure and I feel a LOT better about it.  ",

        "selftext": "I (27f) got engaged 6 months ago to my now ex fiancé (let’s call him Ross) (30m). However that month was hell with my grandma (who I was extremely close to) dying. I wasn’t dealing with it I was just ignoring the pain and saying I was fine. Well about 3 weeks after we got engaged and my grandma dying I had drinks with a friend (27f). What started off as just a drink or two quickly turned to shots and not remembering even leaving the lounge. Now most of this is from what I have been told by the friend, her husband, and my ex fiancé. Friends husband (let’s call him Craig) had to come and pick us up and took us back to their place. My fiancé had his son and we lived about a hour away from the friends and where we got drinks so he was not able to come get me. The friend and I apparently crashed in their bed with Craig having to wake me up when Ross called. Now this is where stories have changed. At first Ross and I were told that my friend and Craig started doing stuff in the same bed I was in and I woke up and joined in. Whereas recently they have started to say I started everything. The only memory that I have during any of this is thinking “what the fuck am I doing” and I then proceeded to run out of the room. According to my ex fiancé I then called him and was trying to seduce him over the phone. This is when I apparently told him what happened and he said I sounded excited. My next memory is being on the phone with him and him yelling at me that I had called him just to tell him I cheated on him. We apparently talked a little longer and then hung up. And that night is the night my life fell apart. \n\nSince that night we have tried to make it work but as you can tell he is now my ex fiancé. He continues to holds resentment towards me and the friends on what happened. I would also like to say that they are no longer friends either after that and the friend texting me telling me that she was the martyr in my relationship. \n\nWell now that everything has ended and stuff has come to light I am struggling. Craig was sober through the whole night and the friend while originally saying she didn’t remember anything is now saying that she remembers all of it. I am the only one that doesn’t remember leaving the lounge or anything at their house besides that one thought and the one line from the phone call. I am feeling very used and taken advantage of because sober or even buzzed I would have never hooked up with anyone but my fiancé.  Together we have experimented but it was together. I am so unsure of how to feel about that night. Now I am not looking for advice, sympathy, or really anything I just thought it might help if I write this all down. And maybe someone can learn from my story that just because you think you can trust people to protect you that may not be the case and one night can take the life your building away. \n\nIf there are questions I’ll do my best to answer them in the comments. Thanks for reading. ",

        "selftext": "I don't really know how to start this or end it or what I'm really trying to say, so please excuse any rambling/unnecessary information.\n\nI'm a 22 year old female who had little to no experience having friends throughout high school. In elementary school I had a fairly large circle of friends, but around the time puberty hit and I became more self aware I realized that my peers found me weird. I was pretty much exclusively friends with guys and I was basically a full head taller than anyone around me, including my male friends. I was pretty bad at actually holding a conversation (I still am) and my interests strayed from even my small group of friends. Middle school came, and that was fine, I still had my group of friends. But in classes where I wasn't sitting with them or we had differing lunch periods, I was basically silent. I was too nervous to make any attempt to talk to those around me or try out social skills.\n\n  \nHigh school was terrible. At first I had the same lunch period as my friends, but then my table slowly filled with other people until my seat was seized by other people and my \"friends\" made no attempt to save me a spot. It felt like I was unable to speak anymore. I had a surgery that took me out of school for 6 weeks, and by the time I came back I was basically a stranger. I unironically tried to live high school like a shadow, keeping my mouth shut except to participate in classes that required it and to participate in group projects.\n\n  \nI didn't really consider myself as having friends until I joined this group on discord. The people in it have changed and we've hopped servers a few times, but the central people have stayed the same. The most relevant are (Fake names, although I'm not worried they'll find this) Cas, NB 22, Ian, M 22, and James, M 23. These people form the core of my friend group.\n\n  \nI don't really know when it started. I think I was about 19. I had been feeling depressed for a few weeks, and self harming was basically my exclusive way of relieving stress. I was questioning my worth even as a human being, fantasizing about ways to remove myself from this world. I guess I started questioning if my larger friend group even wanted me around, since I was so easily discarded by the one I had since childhood. I didn't disclose my depression, didn't mention self harm, didn't share that I wanted to die. I wanted them to feel bad for me, so I accused them of not valuing me as a friend and then, to them, disappeared off the platform for two weeks.\n\n  \nThe next time I checked discord, I had paragraphs of apologies and worried messages basically begging me to come back. It felt euphoric. Even people outside the circle that I consider my closest friends were messaging me, wondering when I'd be back. At the time I don't think I even realize I was being manipulative. But I definitely got hooked on the euphoria of their reaction. The feeling of being wanted.\n\n  \nI've spent the last 3 years doing basically the same thing. Not at the same level. I would guilt trip them for hanging out with other friends. If they said something mean to me I would sulk for days until they apologized, even if it was my fault. I give them the cold shoulder if they do something that displeases me even to a minor degree. I push their buttons until they snap to see what they let me get away with. If I'm angry, they get quiet and relent to anything I say or do. Even then, they always come back.\n\nRecently Cas has been hanging out with two different groups of friends more than us. They keep getting involved in new communities related to their interests and being an important part of other peoples groups. The time they spend with me and the others has dwindled so significantly that I've become a twisted amount of jealous. I've been thinking of ways to convince them to cut those people off. Ways to convince them that the others aren't worth their time, or that they're bad people. I actively want to isolate them from the other groups so that their only choice is us. I want to make them feel bad for thinking that they should devote attention to anything else.\n\n  \nI got on anti depressants a month ago and started attending therapy. The combination is opening my eyes to the things that I do. I am disgusted with myself. I am afraid that I'm going to go to far and they're going to realize what I do and cut me off. I deserve it. I want to be better for them, but as I am now I'm probably more comparable to cancer on the group than a friend. I think I'm afraid that it's too late. I don't know. I don't really want pity.  I'm even disgusted that I feel pity for myself when I put myself in this situation. Even now I don't know if I can be a better person, but I'm too deep into anti depressants to think that I should just remove myself from this world. I just needed to tell someone.",

        "selftext": "I hate that he still makes me insecure and question myself even now, so I needed to vent.\n\nThis post is about me (F), my ex (M), and \"Will,\". We're all in our early 20s, and this all mostly happened \"long\" distance, since both my ex and Will live a couple of hours drive from me.\n\nThe timeline of everything is a bit complicated, but I'll do my best to explain.\n\nMy relationship with my ex was shitty.\nI let myself be pressured into an open relationship because I was too afraid to lose him, and I was, honestly, dumb.\n\nHe used to be my friend, and I though - more, he led me to belive - we had the same ideals about things like relationships.\n\nThis went on for a while, untill he mentioned having a girlfriend.\nI was hurt, thinking I had misunderstood everything, but I wanted to do the right thing and asked if she was fine with how we talked and if maybe we needed to take a step back.\n\nHe claimed it was fine, that they had talked about me a lot, that she knew everything about how we talked and had no problems with it.\n\nI believed him, probably because I wanted to, so we kept talking as usual, even if I eliminated every possible \"hint\" on my end. \n\nEven if I was sad about my unreciprocated crush, I started working on getting rid of my feelings for him.\nIt was not a good period. I am very sensitive to rejection and was stuck between wanting to end the friendship for peace of mind and not wanting to lose someone I cared about. \n\nThen, he came back. While we were on a phone call, he said something pretty explicit, and I gave in.\nI know I was wrong for it, but I just assumed he had broken up with his girlfriend. \nHe had talked about her only one other time, and just to complain about how they were having trouble because his libido was higher than hers. (I know, ew, but rose-colored glasses were still doing their work.)\n\nSo, I flirted back, and we started saying some explicit stuff too, which never happened before that moment.\nHe was also asking for pictures, and being pushy when I told him I wasn’t comfortable yet.\nThis went on for a week before it occurred to me that maybe I should ask about his \"ex.\"\n\nWell, they were still together. He told me he loved her, and she knew he was polyamorous, so he decided he would talk to her.\n\nAnyway, he talked to her.\n\nRadio silence for a week followed.\nFirst, he had to talk to her and suddently felt bad talking to me, and later, he was always \"too tired from that conversation\" to tell me anything.\n\nFinally, I pressured him enough to tell me that his girlfriend, \"Anne,\" wanted to think about things, but we could still be friends as usual.\n\nThat week of silence had made me so scared of losing him that I agreed, and six months of hell started.\nHe would flirt, then ignore me, then get mad at me for being upset.\nI would have breakdowns, ask him to just end everything, and he would guilt me by saying he and Anne were \"working so hard on all of this\" and I was just going to make it all useless, which was unfair to them.\n\nAfter those six month I finally decided to end it. It was hard—he made me feel crazy and like I had used him. He managed to basically twist everything in HIM ending things with ME, but still \"gracing\" me with his presence in my life.\n\nAfter another month, he called.\nHe told me that even if I had hurt him a lot, he understood why I was feeling so anxious and that Anne had finally agreed to us having a poly relationship, where he would date both her and me.\n\nLike the idiot I am, I agreed. I talked to Anne to make sure it was alright, we set boundaries, and we gave it a try.\n\nSkip to another six months later, and things are not good.\nAnne broke up with my ex, and he became depressed. He would do nothing all day, only call me to get him to get out of bed or for s*x stuff.\n\nHe wanted to go to uni but said it was too hard, so he looked for a job—but he was not committing to that either.\n\nHe also started getting very upset for things I did or did not choose to do.\nHe got mad at me for gifting a drawing (I'm a small artist) to a friend—something I have done countless times for countless people, him included.\n\nAnother time, he got mad because a client I had done a commission for gave me a small extra as a thanks, because he was \"disrespecting my boundary\"\n\nHe got mad at me for asking him to please use \"they/them\" pronouns while talking about my best friend of eight years.\n\nHe gave me the silent treatment for going to a concert with the same friend—one I had booked before we were even officially together and had plans to go to before this whole situation even started.\n\nSkip again to the last two weeks of the relationship, and we have plans of going to a convention. Will, a mutual friend, is going to be there too.\nMy ex is supposed to join me on Friday—we have tickets for Saturday.\n\nThursday, Will arrived in my town, and since we had never met in person, he asked me to join him and a group of friends for dinner.\n\nI figured it's a good way to meet, since we would not be alone.\nMy ex knew, said he had no problems with it, so I went.\n\nIt's important to note that my ex wanted to keep our relationship a secret, even though I had asked him to share it with friends, Will included. \n\nAt this dinner, Will was nothing but kind, maybe a bit too affectionate for a friend, but I honestly did not pay much attention to it. \nI am not good at telling when people have feelings for me, and Will's an outgoing guy, so I thought it was just that.\n\nThe next day, my ex arrived and I hosted him.\nThat night, one of the two major events that led me to the breakup happened.\n\n(TW for SA)\n\nI was sleeping, and my ex woke me up for s*x by touching me inappropriately.\nI tell I'm to stop because I'm tired.\n\nHe pouts, and I ask him what's wrong.\nHe tells me, \"I missed you a lot, and you just want to sleep.\"\nI repeat I'm tired and really excited for the next day, and I'm sorry, but I'm really too sleepy to be in the mood.\n\nHe's still upset but agrees, and we go back to sleep.\n\nThis happens again. At least another two times, but I don't really know because I still need a few minutes to understand stuff once I've been woken up. I'm starting to feel unsafe.\n\nThe next day, I wake up with a bad stomach and back pain.\nHe \"jokes\" that maybe he did something to me in my sleep.\nI am disgusted and want to get out of bed.\n\nHe hugs me to keeps me there, and it takes me a while to manage to even just get up.\n\nAnd then, the slowest morning of my life starts.\nI wanted to get dressed, make breakfast for both of us, and then go to the convention by 10:30 AM.\n\nBy 11 AM, I was in tears (I do cry a lot when I'm stressed), begging my ex to just let me get ready—and to get ready himself—because I had paid a lot for the ticket, and it was important to me to be there.\nI'm also someone who manages anxiety by having \"plans\", and having someone just ignoring an agreed upon plan without comunicating makes me stressed. He knew this.\n\nWe finally got on the train, and I was upset. \nHe was mad at me for being upset, and we argued.\nHe told me he thought it was better to get there later but knew I would \"get worked up\" if he told me, so he didn’t want to \"deal with me.\" Instead, he just took things slow so that \"I had to adapt to his pace\", and it was the better like that.\n\nI was so shocked about what he was saying, for the first time I felt like he was the crazy one and not me.\n\nI tried to make him see why that was wrong. \nI said, \"Remember when you got to an event you really cared about 30 minutes late and were sad? This is the same for me.\"\nLike he's some toddler who needs to learn empathy.\nHe agreed it was the same but still refused to apologize, so I let it go to enjoy the convention.\n\nI was on edge all day, constantly thinking about what I would do if \"something bad\" happened, even though I wasn’t sure why I felt that way.\n\nWe met Will and finally told him we were a couple— to be honest, he had to ask because my ex did not want me to say it, he just agreed to hold my hand and \"not lie if he asks\".\n\nThe rest of my ex's stay went normally. He left, and a couple of days later, Will called me to tell me he had feelings for me.\nHe made it clear he didn’t expect anything from me, planned to take as many steps back as needed, and that my ex already knew. \n\nI honestly did not expect it because I had never done anything for him.\nWith both my first and second boyfriends (the one in this story), we got close after I supported them through a rough period, but I had never done that for Will.\n\nThat also made me think a lot—my ex had a very \"transactional\" mindset. He never did anything just for nothing, and I didn’t like that about him. But he had convinced me it was normal, that I was just a people-pleaser. (I am, but not as detached from reality as he made me out to be.)\n\nHe would always list things he did for me (like consoling me when I was stressed) and things I didn't do for him (like not being good enough at listening him rant about his life because I don't understand his struggles enought to comfort him, and I'm not logical enough for giving advice, apparently.)\n\nI decided to take a few days to process my feelings and focus on my relationship with my ex, figuring out how to deal with everything, even if right then I did not feel close to him at all.\n\nThen, the straw that broke the camel’s back came.\n\nAs stupid as it seems, it was a drawing—just a dumb character that Will had made, standing close to my dumb character and hugging them.\n\nI had done this MANY TIMES.\nI love drawing people's characters with mine. I do it for friends, even for mutuals and strangers on the internet, just because I enjoy it. It’s something I love doing, and people usally like receiving them so it's a win-win.\n\nI had been working on it before Will’s confession, it was done and I posted it, like I do for any other drawing I finish.\nI really did not see it as important, I had done countless similar drawings and I was also trying to keep a regular posting schedule, so that my account would get more interactions and I could maybe get commissions.\n\nOne day, first thing in the morning, my ex texted me a screenshot of it.\n\"I was finally happy after a while, but this ruined my day.\"\nAnd\n\"I was also going to 'touch myself' but I don't want to anymore\"\n(First, ew, second, good, maybe do something else with your day)\n\nI couldn’t take it anymore.\n\nI messaged Anne, and we finally shared everything about him.\nWe had never done that before because he didn’t want us to, always claiming to be a private person and saying it was unfair to talk about our relationship.\n\nBut all his gaslighting came out. We shared stories, feelings we had both experienced but that he had convinced us were just in our heads—the same things I just described in this post, things I thought were just me being too sensitive, timelines that didn’t add up...\n\nI was sad — for about a day — but mostly, I was angry.\n\nThat night, I called him, confronted him, and then broke up with him. \nHe played dumb, kept saying he knew nothing about it and I should have talked about it.\nBut he never apologized for what he did. Just for \"what I felt he did\".\nI was disgusted and furious.\n\nLater that night, while I was crying myself to sleep, Will called, and I told him what had happened.\nHe was so kind and caring—he comforted me, helped me calm down, and validated my feelings.\n\nI fell asleep with him on the phone.\n\nI know this was long, but I needed to explain why I moved on so fast. I don’t love my ex at all from the moment I texted Anne. It was like a switch flipped. \nI went from loving him to feeling nothing but hate and disgust in about two hours.\n\nAnd I admit that Will was part of why I broke up—not because I wanted to be with him, but because he showed me what genuine affection feels like.\n\nI never told Will I had feelings for him before breaking up, but I did tell him he was a good person and that I liked him in general.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Will and I started dating. At first, we planned to just talk and be very close friends until I felt 100% over the anger and hurt, but it just happened.\n\nHe took a train at 5 AM to be with me when my cat was diagnosed with cancer. He hugged me, made me watch a movie to take my mind off of it, shared stories about his old cat that had the same illness, and told me to cherish every moment I had with her.\n\nIn that moment, I knew he was the person I wanted to be with. That was the kind of care and emotional maturity I had always looked for in a partner.\n(Of course there was more, but that was an important moment for me)\n\nSo, we officially started dating shortly after.\n\n(For those wondering, my cat is still okay. She’s a fighter. Even though the tumor can’t be operated on, we’re making sure she has the best possible quality of life with the help of our vet. She’s had a great 14 years so far, and we want to keep it that way. She and her brother are getting lots of cuddles and treats.)\n\nSo… I know this was long and messy, but the point is: my ex has been going around asking about me and Will, and I hate that he gets to think of himself as the victim.\nI may have made mistakes, but his actions were malicious.\n\nI also really regret letting all of that happen. I used to think I knew how to spot a toxic partner, but I let him do his thing without noticing.\n\nI just wanted to vent.\nThank you for bearing with me, and sorry for any mistakes. ",

        "selftext": "Not really looking for any advice on this, I just need to vent as I don't feel it's a big enough deal to bring it up to them 😅\n\nI've recently been talking to someone I lost touch with ages ago. We used to be extremely close, and always teased each other jokingly. \n\nBut since reconnecting with them, I've just been feeling a lot more sensitive to their comments? It feels silly as I know they don't mean anything bad by their words, but I just find myself wondering if they even really like me as a person or if they're judging me.\n\nCouple of examples: I have pet cats and this friend knows I love them. They've never liked cats, which is fine. They sent over a funny video of a cat, but that somehow devolved into them telling me how much they hate cats, and talking about how they also thought cats made their owners bitches, etc... I just tried to brush it off and joke back, defending my stance on cats a little bit. This isn't the first time I've had to hear about someone's grievances with cats, but it's just such a conversation killer for me. Like cool, you hate the animals I happen to really like. I am so glad you have given me this reminder lol.\n\nThe other thing that bothered me a bit was just a comment that made me feel like they thought I was immature. I said something like \"Oh this slaps\" and they immediately said \"Don't say that, you're 31.\" It's such a small thing but I guess I've always been a bit anxious about seeming \"mature\" enough to people, so it did sting a bit. \n\nI imagine a lot of this is just my own anxieties getting the best of me, as well as the fact that it's been so long that we're almost strangers in a lot of ways. I guess I don't really know what they think do me anymore. \n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading! 😅  \n\n",

        "selftext": "I have a few friends who are very close to their parents and they know their parents love them and are their #1 biggest fan no matter what they do. It’s very fascinating to witness, and simultaneously upsetting because I can’t help but compare it to my own situation.\n\nMy parents have never been the affectionate, loving type but I didn’t realize just how little they cared for me until I moved out of the family home before marriage. Coming from a very conservative Muslim culture this is looked down on, because people assume you are living away from your family as a single woman to do haram (forbidden) activities in the religion. However I just wanted to have my own space and be independent, that’s all. My parents did not take it well, my mother told me I was selfish and deserve everything bad in life for abandoning them.\n\nThis was over a year ago and the relationship is still quite strained. I’ve called a few times since and my mother was super rude and irritated like I was bothering her for calling her. So I stopped, and I haven’t spoken to my family in a few months. I’m not sure how you can claim to love your child and practically disown them for wanting to live their own lives. So I know now I am not loved by them.\n\nIt’s really sad to not receive unconditional love from your parents because you will never get unconditional love anywhere else. Not from friends, not even from your spouse. You will forever feel unloved and worthless. Most relationships are fickle and very conditional. You family is meant to be your rock. But I have none.\n\nSometimes I wonder why I am even in this world.",

        "selftext": "I've only told maybe 2 people for my entire life about this, but it's been weighing on me recently. I feel like I need to just shout to the void about it.\n\nI(28M) befriended one of my teachers when I was 14. At the time, he was 35. For more background, I was F at the time (now FtM). He was my middle school teacher and when I switched schools, I added him on Facebook. It wasn't until around my freshman year of high school that we really started to talk. \n\nAt first, I basically harassed him, sending him messages daily, until he started to reply and it became conversational. After about a year, we began messaging each other daily. It was never anything inappropriate; we mainly talked about games, music, art, daily life, etc. (normal friendly type conversation). We never hung out or met up or anything. The only time I saw him after he was my teacher was one time at a school event.\n\nI lived in an abusive home and was a very lonely kid. I always figured he sensed that and that I just needed/wanted someone to talk to who actually cared. He became what I still consider to be my best friend at the time. I eventually started to have feelings for him because of this. I still remember telling him how I felt, and him saying something along the lines of \"I'm very flattered, but that's not appropriate\". The conversation dwindled a bit after that, but some time passed and we picked back up our daily conversations.\n\nOne morning, I woke up to see my father on my computer, snooping through my messages with this former teacher. I freaked out and told him this. We ended up exchanging numbers and started texting because of this. \n\nA while went by (a few months, if I remember right), we continued our friendship and daily conversations. Something happened and my parents took my phone (I can't exactly remember why they took it). I went to lunch with a friend one day, and when I got home, both of my parents were there and I knew something was wrong (they divorced and hated each other). They confronted me about my teacher and I's friendship, saying they \"[knew] everything\". My father had texted him through my phone, telling him to cease contact and threatening to report him to the school board if he ever tried talking to me again. I was heartbroken hearing this and knowing I'd never speak to him again. My parents claim he was \"grooming\" me, but I never felt that way. He felt more like a dad or an uncle, and treated me almost as his kid. Plus, as mentioned before, I basically harassed this man into talking to me. I always got the feeling he just kind of felt bad for me, especially looking back on our conversations and this situation as an adult.\n\nI never spoke with him again after that. It was somewhat of a traumatic experience for me, but only because someone I really cared about just suddenly vanished from my life and I felt as though I had nearly ruined his life because I was a lonely kid. The loss I experienced changed me as a person and the way I view all relationships.\n\nI still think of him often. I want to reach out and ask him how he is, and tell him how sorry I am for putting him in such a bad situation. It's just been so long and I don't want to dredge up the past, especially when I'm sure it was also traumatic for him. \n\nI don't know how to move on when it ended so abruptly and so badly. I have dreams of running into him on the street and getting my opportunity to tell him I'm sorry and hear how he dealt with things afterward. ",

She has called multiple ambulance this year and each time they kick her out the hospital because there's nothing wrong with her! The last she went, she called cause she thought she was having a stroke but texted me to bring her tablet to the hospital. When I got to the hospital i told her \"people who are actually sick don't care about having their tablets.\" This caused her to snap at me about not caring about her. \n\nToday, she left her tablet open in my dad's office (they are divorced but live together for now) and I saw her messages with her online boyfriend.

Can she be that gullible to keep believing it?? \n\nI get it. She an adult (56) but my mom does not seem mentally sound. She has lost countless bank accounts talking to these online boyfriends! She once gave one $700 to \"invest\" in his business and he ghosted her, all while demanding my dad help her pay for medication. She's constantly \"falling\", which is her throwing herself to the ground.

        "selftext": "My husband wanted a dog, and I had never had one before. I’ve had plenty of pets in the past: cats, rabbits, and fish, and I loved each one of them deeply. So, we decided to get a dog.\n\nHe did the work of finding the exact dog he wanted, and we drove three hours to adopt her. Even though he took on most of the feeding, exercising, playing, and training, she bonded to me. The bond feels like an obsession. When I’m around, my husband doesn’t exist to her. She never wants to be more than three feet away from me, and often, she’s touching me.\n\nWhen I need a break, I go into the bedroom and shut the door. She just sits outside, waiting. I can put her in the office with my fiancé on the other side of the house, and then go to the bedroom and shut the door. But she waits at the office door, whining and whimpering. My husband tries to interact with her, but she doesn’t care. She just wants me. And I can’t handle this level of attention. You can take her outside, but if she knows I’m inside, she won’t leave the door. If I leave, she panics. A few minutes later, she calms down and does her own thing. She never bothers my husband this much.\n\nI’ve heard mothers talk about feeling “touched out” with toddlers, and that’s exactly how I feel with my dog. The difference is, I don’t think she’ll ever grow past this stage. She’s a dog. We’ve worked with trainers to help her become more independent, but it doesn’t seem to work.\n\nI’m thankful that there’s more nuance in the “adopt, don’t shop” movement. Sometimes, it might actually be better to get a dog from an ethical breeder, as shelter dogs can come with their own set of challenges. My dog has trauma, and that trauma will stay with her for life. It shows up in our relationship, where we’re in a sort of quasi-codependence. It’s frustrating because she’s fine when I’m not around. My husband can take her places, and she’s as happy as can be. If I’m not home, she’s completely relaxed. It’s only when I’m around that she becomes obsessed with me. I don’t get to experience the playful, silly dog everyone else sees because, in my presence, she’s consumed with me.\n\nMy husband takes her to his brother’s farm, and he sends me videos of her. It breaks my heart because I want to see that happy, playful dog too. I want a dog I can sit outside with, playing with toys and rolling in the dirt, without her needing to touch my leg at all times. But I never get that dog. I love her so much, but her constant affection drowns me.\n\nI look forward to when she goes to the farm because I get to be home without her on top of me. I don’t love my job, but I dread going home because, at least at work, I get some alone time.\n\nI love my dog, but I don’t like being around her.",

        "selftext": "I really need to take this off my chest because today I f*cked up multiple times and I feel extremely embarrassed. \n\n\nMaybe I am in my head but I'm definitely somewhere in the wrong. \n\n\nOk so my day started fine with me taking a ride to the airport. The driver, a super nice guy from Pakistan, shared with me that he is fasting and he will only get to have water or something to eat after 6pm. So what do I do? I get all excited about Pakistani food and ask him to tell me what are his favorite dishes from his hometown. Then I proceed to describe in excruciating detail all my favorite dishes from my country. Recipes, mouthwatering ingredients, the whole thing. By the time I realized that he must be starving (it was 4pm after all), I was already rambling for about an hour already. I apologized immediately and he was super nice about it, but this doesn't make me less of an idiot. \n\n\nSo after this great success, fast forward to a few hours later - I am on the plane, seated near  the back, squeezed into the middle seat. We are about to depart, the plane is on the move and I realize that my seatbelt gets loose without me lifting the little lever thingy. I ask for assistance and the flight attendant tells me \"Don't worry, the seatbelt will work later\". So I ask him \"How is this possible...?\", thinking that I really don't do well during flights, that I used to get panic attacks, that I managed to control after a lot of therapy and &lt;&lt;OMG I am about to fly and if something happens I will break my neck crashing on the roof of the plane!!!&gt;&gt;. \n\n\nHe sighs, then tells me he will replace the belt and goes away. Comes back after a minute or so and he says that the plane needs to depart and that there is no time, they will need to move me. There is quickly some commotion, all the flight attendants make some signals to each other and they find me a free row at the front. So I thank them profoundly, I apologize for the last minute chaos that I caused and go to my new princess seat, but the window with extra legroom that I didn't pay for. I sit down, I put the seatbelt on.... and I realize that the new seatbelt ALSO gets loose if I push the metal thing! I test it out a little bit and then it hits me. If I just pull the belt, it stays locked. If I put my finger under the metallic thing and push slightly it gets loose. So that means that I did all this.... for no reason.\n\nI close my eyes and start thinking that it can't be that I'm so inconsiderate today. And how embarrassing. Meanwhile I'm doing my breathing exercises trying to relax. There is turbulence today and my mouth is dry, I can't handle it anymore. I open my eyes and soon as I see the flight attendant handing out chocolates, I ask for some water. She says \"I will check if we still have\", and I'm thinking \"Oh wow, how strange! It can't be that they don't have at least one bottle\". Quickly she comes back, hads me one and finally I drink some water. \"Finally I can try to relax\", I'm thinking. Then I realize must have dropped the chocolate she gave me. I start looking around and then I look to my left and I freeze. On the seat next to me there is yet another water bottle that the flight attendants must have left for me while I was trying to \"breathe iiiiin, hooooold, exhaaale, the plane is safe the plane is safe the plane is safe\".\n\nSo that's it. This is another successful day. I am sitting here patiently, writing this to distract myself and I think I will post as soon as we land. \n\n\nThank you for listening to my rambling dear reader &lt;3",

        "selftext": "The way \"life\" taught me about sex. Not my mom or dad, or a sex ed teacher. But life.\n\nLet's keep in mind that as humans we have an innate instinct to procreate.\n\nMy dad used to babysit me while my mom would go to work. He would put Asian music videos on in the living room and I would sing and dance to the songs all day long. I was 4. I was a sociable outspoken singing daddy's girl and I loved people because they would dote on me. What I'm really trying to say here is, at 4, I could recognize humans and human beings.\n\nMy dad took me over to his buddy's house. His buddy had two sons. One was about 7 and the other son was about 4 as well. While he and his buddies were hanging out downstairs, the older boy (7) showed me a book his dad had of naked people in all sorts of sexual positions, kind of like a Kama Sutra. He proceeded to usher me into a closet and took off all my clothes. My dad found me naked in the closet and helped me put all my clothes back on and we went home.\n\nAt around 5 years old, I woke up one morning and looked around. My little brother was sleeping in a separate bed in the same room as me. As you know and as I have mentioned above, I loved watching TV because of the music videos, and because of Barney and other things I would watch on TV. So this somber morning, I woke up, walked to my parents room and they were sleeping and I didn't want to wake them up. I walked back to my room where my brother was sleeping. We had a TV in our room and laying around on the floor were a VHS tapes. So I picked one up and popped it in. It was a porn tape. I remembered the naked people from the book that one kid had showed me and this porn tape had the same people. Naked and actively doing things. I somehow knew it was bad. So I turned down the volume, and I watched the whole thing instead of taking out the VHS. Let's just say, curiosity killed the cat and I was the very curious kitten.\n\nThen around the same year, at 5 years old, I was molested by my uncle. He was living in the same house as us in the basement. It happened (to my memory) one time and one time only. I knew what had happened to me the moment it happened. I knew something bad had happened to me, and I knew what sex was but I just didn't know the exact words for what everything was.\n\nThat is my 7-layor carrot cake story. Not exactly 7 layers but it just seems that bad things of a sexual nature kept making its way into my very short life and I came out on the other side too knowing, and too knowledgable way too soon. Every day I wish I had had the chance to be innocent and to be trusting of others and of people. I wish I had the chance to be a happy-go-lucky kid unburdened. But I was denied that. I grew up with no friends at all because of the amount of guilt I felt. The fact I understood sex at such a young age, and being molested, it was like an awkward secret I just kept inside. But secrets weight on you. Even if you don't think they do. It's a physical manifestation and I was not the beautiful child I always wished I was. I was dark, and small, and always was a little heavier than other girls. Because of all those reasons, I still have no friends, I have never made a friend. I still have extremely low self-esteem paired with a high body count.\n\nI'm just not normal. It feels this way at all times. I always stick to myself and I never look anyone in the eye. The shame.\n\nI also want to note, to anybody that was raised around too many males. Just don't. It's not safe for any parent with a small female child to be around that many men/males all at once and even if you \"trust\" them I would say you should always have a considerable amount of doubt and remove your child from danger or harm.",

        "selftext": "I(F28) and my former friend G( F30) meet during our first term in university, we both came from the same area and went to the same school at one point. We clicked and became really good friends from there. I was an insecure 19 year old at that time and she was outgoing and active in our version of sorority. I was invited to outings that I actually enjoyed and began to build up some confidence. We both had our share of mental problems understood each other, but after taking diffrent courses we stopped meeting as regularly but she always said that I was one of her closest friends. \n\nIn 2020, I became sick. Really heavy burnout, Crohn dieses and bulimia that made me unable to stay in town. I moved back home and slowly began to rebuild my life and health. Now in 2025, I am still sick, but way better and have control of my mental problems. During the last five years I wrote to G every time I went to the university city, asking to meet up and if I could, I set the dates of my travel after her schedule to make sure we could meet(it’s a 5h drive). Every time she said she would love to, and if she was available we booked a date and time. But almost always something happened or she double booked that she remembered 1 day to 1h before. During these five years, we have meet up twice and I have probably asked her around 10 times since I usually go twice a year.  She never wrote to me when she visited her parents or asked me when I was going down next time, which I realise now was a clear sign that I ignored. I once wrote and asked her if she didn’t want to meet up, it was okey and I would understand, time changes people and friendship does not always last. She denied it and said she very much wanted to meet up and I accepted the answer. Telling me how horrible of a friend she is and how sorry she is.\n\nTwo years ago I had a major breakdown when G cancelled on me again. I had been so excited and when she cancelled I was heartbroken. Walking is my coping strategy, especially with heavy emotions, even after 10km I did not stop crying. I was living with another friend  for that weekend and I fully broke down in the end and told her everything. They had never suspected anything cause I always spoke so well off her. She  apparently told my other friends who all are mad on my behalf. \n\nG sent me a snap in May 2024, with the caption ”In exactly one year we are getting married” with a picture on her fiancé. I congratulated her, but I had no idea about their engagement before that. I decided to one last try and asked her of a time during the summer we could meet up, with my vacation weeks in mind. She responded and we decided a week  were she was free, for details to be determined later. As it approached I wrote 1 week before and told her the days, no response. When I finally was at the hotell I wrote again and told her how long I was there and times when I was booked. My friends were a bit angry at me for trying again but I said that this will be the last time. \n\nOne day after I came home from the trip she responded with how sorry she was for not answering. I had enough and told her how I felt through the years, I was nice and civile even said I should have brought it up earlier and not just unload it all now, even asked my friends to read before sending. G answered and told me she understood why I felt like that, I ended it with that if she wanted to meet, she would have to text or call me now, cause I was tired of this being so one sided.\n\nGuess what - not heard from her since. Now I see pictures from the wedding preparations like the baccalaureate and dress fitting and I feel so sad. Probably I had a delusion hope deep inside that I would get an invite and that she would text me. This quenching the last hope of ever being friends again and telling me how little I meant and what friends mattered to her. \n\nMy friends supports my feelings even my boyfriend, but I just feel like I never meant anything. If they are real friends they will make time for you, I know, but in my head I go through all those memories and just wonder if I could have done anything different. Been a better friend, written more, called or if I just was the burden I always was scared of being, also wishing I not been so delusional and naive. \n\nSorry for the long post❤️",

        "selftext": "Hi... this is my first reddit post and I need to get these feelings  off my chest. I just feel so angry and I hate it.\n\nContext -&gt; So around a year and three ish four months ago, my father had died in hospital. All shocking and scary times for me and my mom. I was 16 at the time. So I was quite affected and so was my mom. We mourned for quite some time after his death. And we went through a rough patch for a few months before we recovered.\n\nSo this is where the story starts, my mother began chatting and dating around. To which I was fine with, as I was happy she wasn't mourning over my dad and was healing. \n\nShe dated a one or two guys before she found this guy Bill (not real name) who works as a driver. They started dating and shit. And I was quite okay with it. Despite for a few times I was annoyed and irritated at him.\n\nFor starters, my mom would never tell me if he  was coming over. And normally when I'd wake up in the morning he'd be in the kitchen with my mom drinking coffee. This kinda annoyed me. I didn't like this stranger enter my house where my father once lived. I hated sharing my private personal space with this stranger. I hated and still hate his presence in my house. \n\nHe is quite annoying as a person, his like a kid. Extremely curious and neat picking. He laughs in a weird manner not a proper laugh. He acts childish at times. He's obsessed with my pet budgie named tim (not real name) but he doesn't know how to hold him properly. He constantly stresses my bird out. Which i hate.\n\nAnyways, I always felt like my mother moved on way to quickly from my father. And I quite hate it. I'm aware it's her life and she can do whatever. And that she's healing.. but it's hurts  seeing her do things she never do with my father. My father wasn't physically the most affectionate as in ways of kissing or holding hands. But he loved me and my mom in his own ways. My mom truly loved my dad. \n\nI don't know how to describe the emotions I'm feeling. It's difficult to explan everything. I just don't like him and I hate his presence in my home. I hate him touching things inside my house. I find him irritating at times and annoying. I feel these angry feelings. \n\nI hate the fact I don't have mother daughter time with my mother. As Bill comes over to sleep over like... 3ish to 4 days a week. Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday. I quite missing going out with my mom on Saturday shopping or in town. But now as bill sleeps over in Saturday he spends his day off, Sundays with us. And I hate that.\n\nEvery time I plan something with my mom on Sunday, he always has to crash our daughter mother time. I hate him kissing my mom. Being all lovely dovey. I'm happy for her healing and being happy with someone. \n\nBut it's not the same as it was.  I miss my dad\n\nEdit - forgot to mention, my mom literally babies him. Every time he comes over, she cooks all the time. She never has a second to herself. ",

        "selftext": "Hello guys. I really have to get this off my shoulders so i decided to make this post on here. already appreciate you guys for reading it. \n\nSo, i am M/22 and my gf is the same age, we are together since three years now and everything did go well for the most part. The thing is, i am an absolute introvert and probably suffer from social anxiety. I hate to go to places where a lot of people are, i cannot eat when a lot of people are around me and i just get exhausted and overwhelmed so fast. this makes my life really hard tbh, and its even harder because i cant understand why i feel that way. like i was grown up in a great, lovingly household, have a good job, and i am basically just a normal guy, who should not complain about his life. However my gf knows all those things and we talk about it and all, she also tells me shes there for me and just tries to help me out as much as she can. \n\n  \nAnd then there was this situation yesterday, it was the 20th birthday of her brother (who is also a really close friend of mine) and he was throwing a party with approximately 40 people. and what can i say, i felt like absolute shit the whole week, my anxiety hit rock bottom and i felt like i couldnt handle it. the night before the party i had a fucking panic attack while falling asleep. So i was talking to my gf, talking about how i feel and how i am getting the worst anxiety ever and so on.. she then tried to make me feel less anxious, she told me she is there for me the whole evening, she wont let me be alone and stuff and idk just trying to pick me up. (thats also one thing, like i feel giga weak in those situations, why cant i handle such things, shouldnt i be the one protecting her? however i am also really insecure about myself). \n\n  \nThe party was on saturday 19;00, in a bar. my heart was racing all day. i tried to calm myself down with playing some video games, some csgo and some league, but nothing really helped. So at around 18:30 i left home and was driving to the party. you can imagine how i felt. when i arrived, we were in a group of maybe 5 people (i really didnt know many people there, maybe like 3 or 4). then i went to the wc, to calm down a bit and when i cam back my gf was grouping with her friend, the other people i knew where also with their other friends, and suddenly i find myself standing in this bar, alone, trying to talk to some people i didnt even know, just to make it less akward. it was my personal hell. However, i couldnt just go to my gf and her friends, because i would have felt ultra weird, when being the only guy there coming out of nowhere. i would have appreciated it so much, if she would have came up the me and just would be on my site. but she didnt. she didnt the whole evening. like in 8 hours, she wasnt coming up to me once. one time she was looking at me, she wanted to ask me if everything was okay by signaling it, i was shaking my head and telling her no nothing is ok, and then she turned around and did go somewhere else. like why? i dont understand that. i feel like the biggest loser on this earth, my feelings are ultra hurt and i cant stop thinking about it. i could have never done it like this if roles were switched. maybe i am overreacting, but honestly i dont think so. like why do i even tell her how i felt like shit because of this party. should i have just came up to her and her friends? idk. i still think it would have been easier for her to come pick me up, then for me to go to them. especially when she knows how i felt. \n\n  \nidk, this evening made me just feel like absolute shit, i feel hurt as hell, i could literally start to cry right now. Why do i have to be such an insecure and anti social person, i just dont get it. however, now i am here, sitting at my pc, listening to music and writing this down. idk if anybody will even read this, but if so, sorry if my english is not the yellow from the egg, but i tried my best. \n\n  \nhave a nice sunday evening\n\n  \n",

This meant that I would have to talk to a family member (from my mom's side) to tell her what happened. My mom ended up confessing that she would much rather keep the family in peace and still have a relationship with them, then be with me and support me when I do talk to that aunt.  Since then, I haven't been able to calm my anxiety, I feel like shit every day (I have been in a state of derealization that is driving me crazy). Since my dad left when I was 3 I have always put my mom's needs and feelings before mine, sadly all I have learned during these sessions is that I am not the daughter she wants, that I am always wrong and that she literally can't name 1 good thing about me. It is super confusing because she hasn't stopped helping me pay for uni, she still helps me buy new clothes for my new job, but yet again she won't hesitate to tall me how mean or inconsiderate I am. I am honestly exhausted, I wanted to better our relationship, I am the one who started with the idea of family therapy, but It has become one of the worst decisions of my life.

        "selftext": "My (m24) now ex(f26) girlfriend started dating in March last year. I had just come out of a toxic situationship where I take part blame. I was a bad communicator, I’m sure I still am but I gained some communication skills. I really liked her, found my now ex, 3 weeks later. I knew it would be a rebound but it helped so much. Especially considering this girl had been my crush since 8 years ago when I had first started working with her. We had so much fun early on, trips, going out, eating out. It started to feel less like a rebound and something of a real relationship. Unfortunately, it came to her moving out of her mom’s house. She needed a place to go, and me with my somewhat trust issues, was scared to let her move in with her friends which were one girl and two guys. She had been known to “get around” but I trusted her more than most people did and had hope. She was very kind, had many mental issues, but nothing I couldn’t stand, I had grown up with childhood trauma and this seemed like nothing. So me with my trust issues, and wanting to move out of my mom’s house as well, took her offer of renting a place together. It seemed fun and I had just started a career job, so it seemed like a good time. Found out very quickly, it would not be. See my ex, we’ll call Fiona, had severe insecurities and drinking issues, not to mention drug addiction. I had known to some extent, but not to this severity. The first week we moved in, I wanted to have a get together party for our first place together. Turns out, Fiona hates having people in her space. She was very quiet the whole night, and near the end, she stormed off to the room, where I’d get yelled at when I head to bed. She scream at me in bed, as I had work the next morning I told her sorry and we’d talk about it tomorrow. She got up and stormed out the room. I was just happy for the quiet, until I hear her screaming my name and yelling help! Help! I storm out, seeing her wrist covered in blood, with it spilling all over the floors. I help her best I can, she didn’t hit an artery so it soon stopped, but left a nasty scar. After this night, most nights, especially when we went out, I would get no rest, being accused of cheating, or just not giving her enough love. Over the next few months, one of our mutual friends decided a surprise birthday party for her. I honestly wasn’t thinking to hard about it, I just thought maybe it’d make her happy, forgetting she didn’t like people in her space. Same thing happened. She was upset the whole night, stayed in the bedrooms and never came out. Through out the night you could hear her screams saying “get out of my house!” In the most embarrassing way possible. Her sister was there, and tried to calm her down the whole night, which did not work. I eventually got everyone out, because the music was barely covering it up. I went to bed again. Same thing, yelling at me. She got up, stormed out. I was worried but thought that it was a one time thing. Nope, I instantly hear my name being screamed. This time, much worse. I come out to see the cut is even deeper, attempt to stop the bleeding but it just won’t. I call 911 while making a makeshift tourniquet to try and stop it. The paramedics get her after the police, which was someone I knew. I told them about how she was saying before that she wanted to die. I didn’t think this was an attempt, but a callout. I took her to the hospital after the medics said she didn’t need the ambulance after patching her up. Stayed up all night at the hospital, dropped her off at home, then went to work. I was miserable. I couldn’t stand this anymore. I didn’t want to break the lease, but at the same time I also still cared for this girl. I felt bad. I needed a way out, that night was my chance, but you just couldn’t leave her alone, she cried and begged me. So we continued our relationship. A few months later, same thing, yelling at me and saying I don’t give her enough affirmations and accusing me of deleting snapchats and sneaking people in when she’s off at work. Which led to a night that she destroyed my tv in the living room, put holes in the walls, and screamed at me in my face. I was done, I left to stay at my friends house. Told her to leave, we’d figure out the situation after. The day after, she said she needed time to move, and wanted to talk. I went over, and we talked the whole night. She promised she’d get therapy, and help. And I felt so terrible, I truly loved this girl, but it was such a toxic relationship. I gave her one last chance. We decided to stick together, agreeing to talk things out more. See, I still have my trust issues, and being accused of things makes me curious why it’s that in particular. I memorized her password months ago, but never really felt the need to look through her phone. I had it just in case. But I was working one night, straight shift. She went out with her friends. Acted very strange to me, and I just felt something was off. I come home at 7am, find her dead asleep. Couldn’t even wake her up to give her a kiss. She had left her phone on my side of the bed. I felt the urge to look through it. Went through it for hours. Finding hidden messages in messenger of her taking to her ex saying how she thinks about him everyday, and that she needs him. Other messages to her OTHER ex on Snapchat, came across it by chance because it had been cleared and muted. It was of last night being very flirty and him leaving hearts and her pictures with her hearting back. Her saying I miss you, and then a phone call about 6 minutes lasting. I called this number, I asked him to be straight up if she’s cheating. He sounded dumbfounded but said she wasn’t and that they were just friends that use to date. But I found pictures dating only right before we started dating that they were kissing and all over eachother. I woke her up, absolutely heated. Ngl this was probably the angriest I’ve ever been. I told her what I had seen. She of course denied it. Eventually admitting that it was cheating but they never had sex. Which I absolutely think is a lie. But I said it was over, and she took it so easily. She nodded and called her mom, got her stuff in the car, then laughing about a joke she made saying she’s tired of constantly moving. All while I sit and wait for her to leave. Also if I didn’t mention, this happened ALL ON MY BIRTHDAY. She leaves not answering any of my questions like why? how could you do this? Since then, I’ve been sitting here, she still left a few things and needs a truck to come pick them up. She just texted me that she’s coming today to pick them up. I still feel like shit, but can hold my emotions together. ",

(20m). ive always thought that i had a very spoiled life. being able to afford things most people would kill for and even going to an expensive private school. \n\nmy dad did not pay a single penny for child support. it was my MOM who sends his ex wife money. keep in mind, i was kept in the dark about this until my parents eventually divorced when i was 13-14 for reasons i dont feel comfortable explaining. i was eventually told that i have half siblings from my dad's previous marriage. and what's worse is learning that they are financially struggling, all because of my dad abandoning his own family just to have me. and now? he did the same with me. i havent seen my dad in months now and we are living with less money than we had.\n\ni feel guilty. the fact that i was born into a family where i was fed with a silver spoon, while not knowing the financial struggles my half siblings are in. if my dad was not an asshole, i wouldn't've existed by now.\n\nto add salt to the wound. my dad remarried and tried conceiving a baby through IVF. i was so fucking pissed hearing that. he abandoned my 2 older half siblings to have me, and now hes abandoning me for an ivf baby? \n\nmy mom says that despite all of this, i should still love my father as \"hes your father afterall\" but i just cant.  i really... really... cant....",

And I obviously didn't wish to use my original account to post it.\nIn my dating years, I had 3 accidental pregnancies and obviously I couldn't keep them so I went ahead with aborting them. I understood that it was not the ideal decision and a lot of people would have opinions on it, but it was the only right decision for me at that time.\nNow it has been some years since this has happened and I’m very happy with my partner today, but there are days when this sadness comes back about those three incidents .\nThis sadness gets triggered by anything randomly. For instance, a friend decides to use birth protection, and I don’t know why I wake up thinking about that time when I had to do what I did.\nAnother time, I could not go through the series, which was depicting in some detail about a couple dealing with the abortion and the decision making around it .\nWhile the abortion itself is a horrible experience to go through, the last one that I had was extremely painful and terrible due to some situations .\nMy partner has been extremely supportive about this throughout the years, but I find it difficult to not feel like a burden when all of a sudden one morning, I am in a bad mood and they don’t understand exactly how and why I am feeling like that. \nSo I guess I’m just dumping my feelings here because I’m not really sure what to do with them. I don’t want to burden my partner who already has a lot of pressure from work in everywhere else, and I can’t seem to make this sadness go away.",

I tell her that it genuinely hurts she still thinks I’m lying to her and I’m trying to reassure her that I’m not. She resorts to mocking me about how my feelings were hurt. She then accused me of gaslighting her which I literally would never do and I had tears streaming down my face because it was clear she didn’t want to listen to anything I was saying.

        "selftext": "I (25F) was in a relationship (25M) for almost 2 years. It started off very very well, very dreamy and romantic where I told my friends that I had found the guy I had been looking for all this while etc etc. 2 months after our first date, i lost my job and i realised how emotionally unavailable he was, because all he cared about was his job and his work stress - he didnt know how to empathise with me or support me or help me out (for context the city we live and work in is his hometown) but i thought probably my expectations are a bit much because we are so early in the relationship. But i have known since aug 2023 that this isnt right for me. I am going to bulletise the problems:\n\n• spending time: despite living in the same city, he only saw me once a week, fri-sat, which i initially found weird but adjusted around it. However, because he is an insane workaholic, we didnt do anything special, just stayed in. There were no date nights. When we went out on date nights, i planned all of them, i initiated them, and i convinced him. I wanted to spend more time with him, see him more, but that he told was not possible because it messes with his routines. A lot of his habits and ideas of how we should be were straight up selfish, inconsiderate and disreputable tbh. \n\n• A twisted definition of ambition, different definitions of meaning of life: He has a well paying, reputable, steady job but he wants to start his own thing so that he is doing something “meaningful “ in life. What that means for us is insane working hours, no downtime, no quality time no matter how much i tried to adjust. When breaking up, he said the kind of relationship i want works for people who have job stability and dont want to do much outside of that - and i disagree so much. All i wanted was someone to spend my weekends with, have that quality time. Isnt that the bare minimum? Also, if he cant do this, how will he ever be in a relationship?\nFor me, i am super ambitious and have built a career in a foreign country from the ground up, but for me ambition means being good at job and liking it enough to login every morning to do a good job. Meaning of life doesnt come from the job as i work for the paycheck, but meaning comes from travel, experiences, relationships and friendships. \n\n• His routine: he was obsessed with his routines. Wake up at 6, sleep at 10, gym at 7am, work 8-9 kinda guy. Which is ok, routines are good, but what that meant was he only saw me fridays, and called me daily 9:30-10 (he didnt call me initially at all and we foughjt a lot to get here). Anything outside of that was not possible. This didnt emotionally sit right with me because i couldnt trust, depend, rely on him. In fact, when we were breaking up, he told me he calculated (????) the amount of time he spends with me or talking to me, and thats about 12h/week, which is not possible for him right now. What this translated in my head was, i am not worth the 12h/week\n\n• his spending habits: he lives at home with his parents, earns a LOT more than me, and saves and invests all that he earns to an obsessive degree. He has enough to retire rn, and i respect that. But what that meant for us was, he was extremely stingy and calculative. We split stuff but he just wasnt happy spending - on date nights, dinners, gifts. Heck, he even calculated the transport cost from his home to mine. He even liked to lecture me about how i should spend money, when i already live below my means because i have a loan. He also said that he is saving enough for the both of us, but that never gave me confidence because i saw that as an attack on my independence - i cant live on the money he has earned or saved because it is not mine, he will always reinforce that, and i will have a lesser of a say in how we spend that money. He definitely wanted a prenup if we were to marry which i dont mind, but his general attitude towards money and being too calculative wasnt reassuring\n\n\nBasically, these were long-standing problems which i identified very early on in the relationship and communicated why i find them problematic. However, after each time i communicated he gave me something new to cling my hope on to, and i hoped things would get better because i genuinely wanted this to work. They never got better, we kept on arguing, until yesterday when he asked the question and i agreed - i felt a bit blindsided tbh because he never told me he is thinking about it too. I guess there are 2 lessons for me:\n\n1. To be in a relationship and live in the present and not with the person’s potential and what it could be\n2. To not be so obsessed with the idea of relationships and building a life and the feeling of home with someone that i keep putting up with shit\n\nHaving said all of this, the feeling of loss is immense and i still miss him and have been bawling my eyes out, when it was me who had been considering breaking up for the past year and i know in my heart he is not the one for me.",

        "selftext": "This is a bit odd, and by intimate, I mean a bit more than just touching. \n\nFor a year, I've felt like I've initiated every kiss, every makeout. We're not sexually active yet, but have been dating for almost 3 years now. And we were fairly physical before, but now the extent of her initiating anything is holding hands or resting her head on my shoulder. \n\nI love even that. Makes me melt. Makes me feel wanted. But then I realize at the end of the day, that I initiated every kiss. We make out once in a couple months when I initiate. \n\nI've asked her about it. Multiple times. Is something bothering her, does she want some support, is this not something she wants in a relationship. \n\nEvery time the answer is that she wants it, and that she'll initiate but then it's like she forgets about it. I remember the time she'd hold me, look me in the eyes and kiss me. I remember the times she'd take the slower, non supervised elevator to kiss me in. I remember when she'd ask me to come over when she was alone to make out. \n\nNothing. For a year, nothing. I don't even ask her anymore, cause at that point it feels like I'm forcing her or making it out to be a major fault. I can't even tell what's wrong. What's changed. Every time I ask her it's a different thing. She's not feeling it, she's lost her sex drive (but then a month later, she said that wasn't the issue), there's shit going on in her family. \n\nAnd it's fucking killing me inside. I've started to cook up an actual fantasy in my head. Fantasies of being intimate with her someday have turned into a fantasy of a girl in the future who actually physically expresses love for me. I have shit in my life too, and a kiss from her makes all that go away. \n\nI just feel broken at this point. For 3 years almost, I've worked with this girl, and I genuinely love every inch of her, but somehow this issue itches at the inside of my head and makes me miserable. And I've tried talking to her, but it makes no difference. We reach an agreement and she changed things for a day and then she just reverts to the way things used to be. ",

        "selftext": "For the past 2 years I’ve been smoking weed, almost daily. I recently went through a lot of changes, and in that I quit smoking and started taking supervised urine tests. (Among other things) \nI knew that taking these tests meant I couldn’t take my drivers license for at least a few months, and that was okay with me. What I didn’t know is that it meant I couldn’t drive at all, until these tests were finished - which is 6 months - even tho I am clean. \n\nMy doctor failed to tell me (or I failed to remember) that I can’t use the license for my motorcycle that i already have. \n\nI recently met a guy who made my passion for driving motorcycles light up again. I was so ready to get back on the bike, bring it out of the garage, change out the oil and have it in pristine condition. I was so excited to spent a summer on two wheels while getting my life back on track - and this time with someone to share the joy with. In some ways it was part of my motivation for staying clean, and having it ripped away in the span of a few google searches made it that much harder. \n\nI feel so angry, and stupid. I feel like I should have known, and I feel like it was obvious. Yet I thought in some magical way that I could keep my excisting licence, just not take another drivers test. I was so ready for the freedom of driving to work, and going on road trips. Or just driving to the store without relying on commute or friends, or having to walk for 15 minutes.\n\nI know it really isn’t the end of the world, but the next 5 months is gonna be that much more challenging knowing I could have been on a bike if I hadn’t admitted to my doctor that I smoked weed. Im gonna call the doctors office tomorrow to see if I’m correct in thinking I can’t drive my motorcycle, but I’m scared of getting my hopes up. I’d rather sit with knowing I’ll get told I can’t drive than be let down again tomorrow. \n\nBut on the other side of things, I probably wouldn’t have quit if it wasn’t for having to do this at some point either way. \n\nIt just sucks that I’ll be done with these tests in September, at the very end of the season.

        "selftext": "So when we were in highschool, my dad made us quit any extracurricular activities to make extra money and help pay bills and save for our college, and just put into saving for us. Thats what he told us. But He would take whatever we made and only give us $20 of spending money every pay period. We gave him thousands that went towards the bills and college funds and even built a house back in our home country for when our parents retire. To add to that, we have gotten many scholarships so the majority of our schools were paid for. My sister in question lost her job and has been having a hard time finding another one. My dad used her funds to pay for the first half of her tuition but refused to pay for the second half. The cost is $4k. He said he has no money but yet he JUST bought a new BMW worth 25 to 30k. Keep in mind, we have 3 EXTRA CARS that need about $500 worth if fixing for him to drive just fine! When my mom was trying to talk to him about helping pay for my sister's college tuition, he told her to ask us (the siblings) to help. Since I have money saved, I was able to help pay for her tuition but before I did, I wanted to confirm with him first that he couldn't pay for it. He said he wouldn't answer that question and brushed me away. When I tried to get more from him, he started yelling at me calling me disrespectful. This is an ongoing thing with him. Whenever we try to talk back, he calls us disrespectful. When he is with his friends, he brags about how smart, educated, and respectful his children are, but then in private, he belittles us, sends money to strangers, and constantly puts others first before his own family. I guess we are all sick of it and I want to write this out because I don't know if somebody can see his side of things and tell me what I am missing here. Yes we can move out but the economy is so bad and he knows that so whenever he gets mad, he tells us that we can just leave, knowing that we can't support ourselves. He gets about $1,500 extra in rent from us every month from 3 of us but not from 2 of us cause my sister lost her job and my other sister just started her college as well (she's 17f). She worked very hard and brought about 60k of yearly tuition down to 7k with scholarships and is staying in the dorms. My dad has now refused to pay that even though my sister has worked throughout highschool to make that money. When we argue about money, he stirs the conversation away from the main point and starts going on longggg rants about this certain bill and that certain bill and whenever we cut him off so he can get to the point, he calls us disrespectful and tells us to get out of his room. We know he purposely does this so he can get out of a conversation. And even when he says he never has the money, he is constantly sending money to random people and we feel like he is flexing it. I remember I had to stay at school while my classmates got to go on a fieldtrip cause he didnt want to oay the $5 fee. And then he bought a $20 hat for a funeral he went ONCE! He likes to be constantly looked at and it's so embarrassing when we have to go out. And my mom is constantly arguing with him on our behalf. It's tiring and I feel for my mom who has to deal with his tantrums most of the time. \n",

Maybe it's because my mom would drive drunk and my dad is an aggressive driver (aka get out and threaten or beat people out for stupid shit). Maybe it's related to Autism or OCD. I don't know. All I know is, that when put behind a wheel, I panic so bad that I just want to hurt myself and usually do end up doing that. Every single time, I have a meltdown. I hate myself so much for it. I feel like such a goddamn coward, but it's so overwhelming, I'm terrified I'll hurt myself and others on the road because I zone out. The only way I can drive is when I'm zoned out, otherwise I just throw up. I wish I wasn't like this. I'm 21 years old, I can't be like this. But the thought of eventually having to drive every day for the rest of my life sends me spiralling, I don't think I can do this. Going to my sister's for driving practice is so inconvenient for everyone, and I spend the two or three days prior to it freaking the fuck out, I can't relax because I know it's coming. I hate this, I hate being such a damn burden.",

        "selftext": "\nOk so this is advice for how to survive these places. They are helpful, but in a weird way, but it sucks, and it’s traumatizing. But it’s very isolated and weirdly desensitized, so in there you aren’t effecting anyone you have personal attachments to. So first official tip, just make it to your release date, and you will be just fine. \n\nNext, a lot of people coming in to these places may have drug issues, or self harm. When I was in the ones I went to, I was too. And I was put in a terrible place with people on stimulants and benzos; along with a very odd amount of persistence and survival “methods” \nYou will likely turn to snorting cheeked meds, drinking hand sanitizer and god knows what else. So go in with at least a little safety net. bring yourself alcohol wipes, an extra sock, and then a condom, if you are afab and haven’t had any surgeries or anything like that then this can work for “transportation” but the condom has other uses too. Not for sex.\n \nPlease don’t have sex oh my god. Just jerk off or something, everyone there is fighting literal demons. You do not want to end up in bed with them, I know that sounds stupid, but two people going through a mental health mess will have a very weird and toxic dynamic. \n\nI should also say that people are going to be judgmental. They are judging themselves so they are also projecting it. \nSo I just don’t think you should form attachments or like preconceptions. You should talk to them though, it will really help to hear about someone’s life the closest you ever can. It makes you feel less alone. And it’s incredible to know you’ve seen these people be horrible and they the same for you, and you will never see each other again, and they know the most and least about you. \n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "Three years ago, I met a girl online, and we hit it off instantly. We texted every single day, flirted shamelessly, and honestly? It was one of the best connections I've ever had. We never did video calls though, so neither of us knew what the other looked like. We're both introverts, so it never crossed our minds to FaceTime (weird, I know, but that's introvert life for you). Despite that, we developed a crush on each other, but we decided to remain flirty friends who sometimes roleplay sexy things because we're both not relationship people and and long-distance relationships are a hard pass for us. So we just kept texting and gaming together. \n\nSince I didn't know how she looks like, my brain started creating an idealized version of her and I imagined her like this alluring, confident, intense and mysterious femme fatale.\n\nOne day this girl disappeared without saying anything. Poof, gone, she deactivated all her gaming socials. She was always quite depressive so my mind started to jump to the worst conclusions, I was very worried. And I endlessly tried looking for her everywhere, but I only knew her name and country so I got nowhere. \n\nI eventually gave up looking for her but she always remained haunting me in the back of my mind  because of the way she had disappeared and the fact that I didn't know what happened to her. So I kept thinking about her throughout the 2 remaining years, replaying our last conversations to look for cues, and all of that led me to dead ends. It was frustrating. And it was like a mystery that I needed to solve. Alexa play \"oh whooo is sheee?\"\n\nSo one day, I decided that enough is enough. I was going to find her and I was going to get my answers even if I have to become the FBI myself. I believe in manifestation and law of attraction so I spent a whole night visualizing me finding her personal socials (the socials we had each other added were not personal socials, it was gaming socials, so I wanted to find either her Instagram or Facebook).\n\nAnd it worked! Next day, I went full FBI detective mode. I said the only information I had about her was her name and country, so I used those leads and somehow I managed to stumble upon her real full name! (I think this was the manifestation and law of attraction at play or some kind of witchcraft I dunno). It turned out that the name she had given me was a fake one but that's understandable so I don't hold it against her. Whatever. With her real name in hand, I found out where she went to school, where she went to college, and of course her personal socials.\n\nSo I opened up her Facebook and Instagram, filled with anticipation because finally I would be able to put a face to the ghost who'd haunted me for 2 whole years! And when I laid my eyes on her, there she was... THE SHEER REFLECTION OF MY GRANDMA WHEN YOUNG! \n\nNo, really. Like not kind of, not a little resemblance, I mean copy-paste, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, a perfect genetic duplicate of my grandma in her youth. ...I had spent years chasing this mystery woman, only for my brain to go, \"Wait a minute… is that… grandma?\"\n\nI WAS FUCKING IN LOVE WITH MY GRANDMA! FOR YEARS! Years of mystery, longing, idealization GONE IN A SECOND. My attraction to her? Instantly killed. Biggest turn off of my life. All the sexy things she had ever told me were no longer sexy and I just couldn't picture us physically together anymore...\n\nWe used to roleplay fear play scenarios AND NOW THE FEAR PLAY TURNED INTO FEAR FOR A DIFFERENT REASON. Like, instead of \"I'm going to hunt you down and devour you\" being hot, now it’s giving \"Eat your vegetables, sweetheart\" and I'm just sitting there like NOOOOOO, THE MAGIC IS GONE.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that would send Freud into overdrive. \"Tell me, how does this make you feel?\" LIKE SCREAMING, FREUD. IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE SCREAMING. My brain had built up this intense, mysterious, alluring figure, and then boom! grandma vibes! And I ended up in some kind of weird family reunion, yay! \n\nThis is for real one of the biggest plot twists of my life. I basically turned 3 years of longing into a detective saga with a twist ending, and instead of crying, I'm laughing about it. At this point I'm just happy because I can finally close this chapter but at the same time I feel shallow for losing attraction towards her immediately after seeing her. Oh well, not everyone can be attracted to their grandma.",

We're so behind on our bills, we're in so much debt...we owe so many people money. Our friends, our families....I'm so ashamed to face them, I don't even talk to some of them anymore because I'm so ashamed. I feel so guilty...I want to pay them back but I don't have the means to....whatever little money we get we use to pay for food and our utilities. There's never any extra left. We're stuck in a constant loop of borrowing money to pay for all our debts, and we've been stuck for years...nearly as long as we've been together. We know it has to stop but then how will we pay for things?\n\nWe're constantly looking through job postings and sending out applications, I actually got a response from 1 of them but it doesn't start until April (if I can submit all the requirements, which is proving hard to do because we have no funds for it...it sucks that you need money to make money), my boyfriend hasn't found anything yet, though he reassured me after one of our fights that he is looking at every job posting out there and stepping out of his comfort zone, like I finally did last year. Our fights have mainly been about our relationship (we're like roommates, raising a baby) and money troubles, that usually leads to fighting about his difficulty finding a job. Some days I understand that it's just really hard to find one, also we stayed in one industry for so many years that branching out now is....hard. And some days I doubt that he's actually expanded his options, because I expanded mine and I found one so why can't he?\n\nOur relationship is suffering almost just as much as our finances, it's dying. I'm barely interested in sex, meanwhile being intimate physically is his love language. He's barely interested in other forms of intimacy, which is my love language. We've had so many discussions to try and find a compromise but to no avail. Most days I think our relationship is actually over, I've actually tried to break up with him in the past. A few times before I even got pregnant, a lot while I was pregnant and a few times after our baby was born. All those times tho he's refused, says he wants to keep fighting for our relationship.\n\n I had..or maybe, have really bad post-partum depression, it took me 3 months to even \"like\" my baby. I was depressed and anxious the entire pregnancy, but he was just so....unreliable. Like yeah, he did what he could to make sure I got my check-ups and other needs but he wasn't a good emotional support system, he did the bare minimum is what I would call it. He was feeling a lot of pressure and stress, you could just tell.  I know how this makes him sound but he's not so terrible, just...dense I guess and pessimistic. I also know how this makes me sound but I was working during my pregnancy because we couldn't afford for me to not be working too. We both know that we both definitely should have stepped up when I got pregnant and looked for a better job than the ones we had, but we didn't. We were both scared, and we've regretted it ever since. Because even now that decision is bleeding into our current issues.\n\nI've considered just taking my baby and leaving so my boyfriend and I can get some much needed time apart, to think. But there's nowhere I can  go. I also have like a lot of cats that I don't want to leave him with because that would be an AH move, they're mainly my responsibility not his. And yes I know they add to the expenses but they barely eat anymore because we can't afford to feed them regularly. We've tried to get them adopted but no one here wants rescued stray cats. Most people in our country think they're a waste of time and money...\n\nI know we need therapy, together and separately..but that costs money...and...money is the one thing we just don't have....\n\nThese issues have been weighing so heavily on me for a long time, but as I'm typing it I just feel silly...like these aren't really problems...other people have bigger problems is what my brain is saying. Insecurities I guess....\n\nTLDR; My bf and I are broke, in debt, still looking for jobs, have a baby together, dying relationship, exhausted, fighting all the time and DEFINITELY need some form of therapy...",

I’m 25, and suffer from a long list of mental and physical disabilities. I’m not really able to work right now due to my disabilities but am in the middle of a long process of trying to get on disability payments. I still live at home with my mum and brother (dad is deceased), and I just found out last week my mum has stage 4 bone cancer. My partner of 3 years doesn’t live with me but is soon having to move out of his family home so has been putting pressure on me to move out with him as we’ve been together for a significant amount of time and we should be moving onto the next stage of our relationship. I’ve tried to explain that it’s difficult for me to move out as I don’t have a job and the income I do get from the government isn’t going to be enough to pay for rent let alone my food, medications, my dog’s food and be expected to save for my doctor and specialist appointments but also to save to eventually buy a house like how he wants us to be able to do before turning 30. He just keeps telling me to apply for work and I only have experience in retail but due to one of my medical conditions I can’t even stand for more than 5 hours on a good day without being in debilitating pain where I literally struggle to walk. I have no experience in being a receptionist and no matter how many jobs I apply for no luck. He wants me to move out as well as I’m being treated as a stay at home mother looking after my mum and brother (this is well before the cancer diagnosis). I don’t think as well that it’s sitting in for him that I very badly need and rely on being on my mum’s health insurance considering I’m chronically ill and it can turn at anytime for me and sadly I’m having a different surgery at least once a year, sometimes twice a year so idk how I’d be expected to afford that if I wasn’t living at home, with no job. He refuses to live with my family until we can save enough to buy a house because he hates my family and well understandably is struggling to even see a future with me like this but I feel like he’s in between a rock and a hard place with the fact that he does love me and how he doesn’t want to leave me cause I’m sick cause it’d be like leaving someone who’s got cancer which is an asshole thing to do. And it doesn’t help that I’m struggling with my mum’s new diagnosis. On top of everything else I personally am just really struggling with how beyond god damn emotional I am. Late last year I fell down some stairs causing me to be bed ridden for 2 and a half weeks and in turn has caused me to develop or severely worsen potential already undiagnosed OCD. I’ve never been diagnosed before with OCD because truly I don’t say out loud my thoughts and whatever I have disclosed or displayed gets pinned to my autism but since the fall I’ve been consumed with anxiety, depression, anger, guilt, agitation and panic with mess, things not being in a particular order (mainly MY way of order). I feel like a shell of who I once was I struggle to hide anything well, I cry almost daily and have just started to learn either cry to myself when no one is around or wait for my therapist. I don’t ever want to leave my house cause if I stay at my partner’s house, guarantee I’ll be a sobbing mess when I get back cause my mum and brother always make a mess and they never clean up after themselves which in turn triggers me more. I already am a pretty reserved person when it comes to my feelings cause I think it’ll come off over dramatic to others even though I know they’re valid but today I got proven why I think that because my partner asked me what was wrong when I got home and I spilt 1/4 of my thoughts and feelings and I got stopped with being told that “maybe you just like to make things more difficult for yourself than it has to be”. Potentially that’s true but also I don’t mean to, my brain just never shuts up which I’m realising with typing this that yes it most definitely doesn’t shut up. The sadder thing is there’s a lot more to my anxieties and why I can’t take it anymore and maybe I’ll just get a diary and deep clean till I can’t walk. I just want to be alone and lowkey sedated but I got an appointment in a couple days on an update to some scans and if I’ll need surgery or not which is obviously another anxiety. I frankly just feel a lot of pressure from my boyfriend and I feel pressure to look after and help my mum and if I don’t well no one will cause my brother and her partner are useless. I feel pressure on myself with my own mental and physical health, getting a job and what kind of job realistically would even be good for me, I feel temptation to go back into eating disorder tendencies or back into my addiction to smoking weed. I feel beyond insecure about my appearance which I know is a vanity and self esteem issues. I truly don’t know what to do because try and take it day by day but I clearly have some control issues. I’m frustrated cause I don’t want to die, but I also don’t want to be alive or at least conscious.  ",

        "selftext": "I'm in my early 20s, and I've technically only had 2 relationships. I say technically because the first was so on-off that it didn't even count as one, plus she ended up cheating.\n\nBut what I've noticed since the that one is that I tend to be overcaring, sometimes clingy and think about whoever I have feelings for constantly, as if an image of her is burned into my mind no matter where I look or even if my eyes are closed.\n\nI've been through some brutal ones where a girl I met at university (a mate's mate but single) was so unbelievably beautiful, funny, well-mannered and smart that it was painful to keep thinking about her until I asked her out but she polited declined.\n\nThe other relationship was when I met an American girl studying here who actually liked me for who I am which was a surprise considering I believe myself to be the equivalent of Rocky Dennis in terms of looks, but with the way I was around and to her I realise now I was too overcaring right at the start treating her as an already long term girlfriend when we just started dating for 2 days.\n\nAnd then, after a while of dating she tells me something resulting in a glorious stab in the heart where she quite literally said \"over these past few weeks dating you has made me realise I miss my ex\" and proceeded to fly back to Murica (reddit won't let me say it properly for some reason) THE NEXT DAMN WEEK FFS so naturally I crashed out and drank a lot.\n\nSo referring to the title of this the one main thing as to why I don't want a relationship is that I don't want to lose her, ruin her life or make her detest me because of how I am with overcaring. I hate it but better to stay alone than to ruin someone's life.\n\nAnd for those of you who say work on changing yourself, trust me I've tried but it's pretty hard when you have little experience in the dating scene because you look like a damn goblin from clash of clans.",

        "selftext": "I’m so lost. I know relationships are never easy, but I’m just starting to think that maybe we didn’t meet at the right time in each other’s lives. \nI have so many insecurities in regards to being included in outings. Her communication is really lacking and forgoes telling me how she feels about things. \n\nOur most recent disagreement has been in regards to travel - we can’t come to a compromise and find a balance between her travelling with her (and also my) friends with time for us to spend together. We promised we’d travel with each other after this year fell through for similar reasons. Instead, I had to leave it at she will go with her friends instead of me. I’m hurt because it feels like she doesn’t want to go away with me, but she’s hurt because I think that. \n\nShe’s promised to do better and apologised so many times for not communicating. I feel like our bad times are more frequent than the good. I want to push through because she is so loving, caring and sweet but I’ve got a massive piece missing rn and if I explain this to her, she breaks down and stops talking entirely. I’m stuck. \nI know I am so far from a bastion of perfection in this relationship, but I just can’t help but be frustrated and saddened by this.\n\nToday, I was sick and quite feverish, so I spent a while thinking back to a past relationship. While I’m absolutely over that girl, I just couldn’t help but reminisce about how that short relationship three years ago made me feel. I do hold it in very high regard because I was in the wilderness prior to it - alone and totally confused about my place in the world before she showed me, so I’m now quite nostalgic about what she was for me, especially now my needs just aren’t being met. That girl and I met in the wrong time and the wrong circumstances to last, but we ended very amicably. I know it’s horrible and so unfair for my gf as well as the previous girl to keep thinking like this. \n\nI love spontaneity and random, intimate things (and I have told her this) but never does she ask me to come over for a karaoke drive at midnight with the windows down. Never does she say she wants to spend the night with me somewhere random. I sometimes ask but it’s usually a no. I feel like I’m right back to where I was pre-previous relationship and I’m lost and so sad.\n\nI want to make things better, and I know constantly comparing my last relationship to my current is really poor. I know I’m focusing on the negative things she does. I know I could be better but I’m so fucking demotivated bc she just doesn’t talk and we just don’t go out to do things. Then a rift forms and I have to be the one to try and pull it back, and then she’s extremely upset and scared that I might leave her, or she thinks she’s a bad person. I can’t say how I really feel because of that. It takes days for our usual fun side to return and then there’s a couple weeks of good. Rinse and repeat. \n\nLong-term relationships are loads of battles to stay in love. Some are so much harder, but I do love her. Though, is it worth losing parts of who you are when I’m this age? I’m emotionally exhausted by the constant confusion and stress of slow and lacking communication as well as my physical needs just not being met. I’m 23, so I’m not looking to waste her or my time any longer if this just won’t work. I like solving things but this feels like it’s becoming bigger than me. ",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account because I feel terrible about this. \n\nWhen I was young (10 maybe) and I got an Ipod. I would love doing stuff on it. But then I got into fanfiction and thus I got into porn (I still love fanfiction to this day). I also was able to gain access to porn sites (Pornhub, Xvideoes, Spankbang, etc). My mom had to work long hours and my uncle mostly left me alone (we're both quiet), it got more convinent when I got old enough to become a lackey kid (14)\n\nBut that day, I was in the mood for porn every chapter (what I now know as PWP)\n\nSo I would type chapter 'large number' and then put tits or ass and then search. I was already seeing gross things I wasn't supposed to but then I found a website and it had adults engaging with minors. \n\nI was aware that sort of thing was bad, but this was written not visual. I knew the visual stuff was terrible and never looked for that sort of thing. But the written stuff?\n\nI just kept reading it, I justified it as it's only weird if I'm an adult. I never visualized ACTUAL real life children, I would think about other fictional characters, not sure if that's better but I did.\n\nBut now I'm an adult and I feel disgusting! I NEVER want to hurt a child in that way! I despise child molestors! And yet I still read this stuff. I stopped when I was about 18-19 (not sure spefically but I know I haven't read that stuff in the past three years and I remember not being able to find the sites anymore, which was good in the long run)\n\nLately, I've been feeling really gross. Like I'm disgusting and I should feel awful what I did! Which I should! It's gotten worse this past year, I didn't really think about it. I still read stuff where characters were underage but limited to just being in their teens (someone on AO3 who does a bunch of Harry Potter/crossover girls stuff and another one who had his own website and was registered on Literotica). I want to cut those people out of my reading too! I feel horrible for what I've done and read.\n\nMore context: I live with my mother (she knows about the video porn thing, but not the written stuff), I'm a college student, I can't drive (I rideshare everywhere). I WANT to get therapy but I don't want to spend money. My mom has actually taken me to therapy a few times (this problem hadn't affected me mentally yet for me to bring it up, plus most of the time my mother was in room, so I wouldn't have done so regardless), I actually got diagnosed with anxiety. But I assume the reason we don't make it a regular thing is because it's expensive. The best thing I feel I can do is go to hotlines. \n\nSometimes they do make me feel better. Once I watched some YT video about someone who hurt animals and I thought I could handle it, but the woman said this man also read stuff from one of the sites I found (I never liked that, I would avoid that if I saw it) and I FELT DESPECIBLE! The hotline got me a nice lady that told me some gentle things that made me calm down.\n\nBut then I read one of the guy's I mentioned work on Literotica, the characters were ACTUALLY OF LEGAL AGE and it felt like I relapsed! Then I watched porn on a specific website for specific kink of me, but when I was looking for something one of the videoes said 'teenage' and I began to spiral. Because of one hand, not all pornsites are trustworthy but on the other, 18 and 19 (legal adult age) could still be referred to as teenage so I was confused, so I called them and the lady didn't want to help me and she transferred me to a warmline (they were nice but they asked for my insurance which I wasn't expecting so I ended up feeling emotionally drained).\n\nIt came to a head when I woke up this morning and I was on my period and then I started feeling those thoughts that was disgusting while my body was in pain. I couldn't call because my mother was still asleep. So I texted my hotline and the woman said my problem wasn't something a hotline could fix, so she sent me all these links to porn addiction stuff. They either cost money or I felt they couldn't help me, because they talked about this happening to men. Alternatively, they could help but my mother was still in the house, so I still felt I couldn't do anything immediately. And it really felt like no one could help me. I even signed up for Betterhelp (though I remembered they had controversy and signed out before telling my problem). So I decided to post this on here.\n\nI really don't want to hurt anyone. I want to put that terrible part of my past behind me. But sometimes I can't help but think about it and feel disgusting.",

Might as well be ranting because I have found a haven in Reddit lately. \n\nI often wonder why anyone would like to be friends with me. I struggle a lot with anxiety and maintaining attention, and usually when I offer advice it is not that helpful (usually overly philosophical and impractical). Some people may like to engage in that kind of discussion I guess… \nI don’t have any interesting hobbies besides going to a cafe by myself and having a cigarette, browsing and looking for jobs to advance my career. I have a very niche sense of humour that can be overly sarcastic and easily offend. I try to pick up hobbies, but I end up wanting to escape my reality via watching too much TV, cleaning/decluttering and spending time with my partner, which I also don’t see why he would stay with me after the initial attraction wears off. I am probably extremely depressed as I grew up with a childhood trauma that I tried to address via therapy but it felt like the benefit wasn’t outweighing the expense and somehow it felt even more depressing as “my only only hope for getting better didn’t look that hopeful”. A few therapists seemed to make me feel like my system was in a kind of a deadlock. \nI find myself lately thinking often about why anyone would like to be friends with me, even though I don’t think less of myself - I am young (32F), attractive, fit and financially independent. I am well-educated and have a decent-paying job. I rarely lie, gossip and I like to support people by understanding their goals. I like to treat my friends every now and again, but I don’t like transactional relationships. I used to have creative ambitions but quit them and settled into a boring life when I saw nothing was really materializing. \nHow can I improve this sense of isolation helplessness, with years of therapy as a last resort?

        "selftext": "Four years ago, I felt like I had achieved all goals, happiness, and was married to my best friend. For context, I (35f) and my husband (38m) have been married for 17 years. I met him as a teenager, we dated, and married promptly after my 18th birthday. I felt like we had really worked through a lot of issues to build a good marriage and life together. I don’t have a strong support system of people in my life, so it was just him and me against the world. Well, that changed, and I’ve been beating myself up about it for a while, and trying to navigate my feelings, or just ignoring them, idk. I started to have feelings for a co-worker (I know, typical). He has been a friend at work, and is married. There has been nothing romantic between us, and I don’t get any indication from him that he is interested in more. He has just been supportive as my co-worker and a friend, and that friendship doesn’t extend outside of work at all. I have no interest in pursuing a romantic relationship with him either. I don’t want to have infidelity in my marriage or try to convince someone else to be untrue. And breaking marriages for another person just means a worse marriage.\n\nThis has really led me to contemplate my life. Why, when everything was feeling so right, did I start catching feelings for someone else. I looked back at our relationship and started seeing all the negative. I questioned if I was just looking for reasons to justify how I felt. I came to the realization that our dating relationship was abusive (and early years of our marriage). More than just bad, or two stupid kids. He was very controlling, pushed sex on me before I was ready, and even used a sexual act two different times as “punishment” (that was painful). Anytime I’m alone with my thoughts, I think that so much of how I am today in my relationship with him was shaped by the bad times. He isn’t that person any more, he isn’t controlling, and treats me better overall. But, I don’t have friends, am scared to make him mad, scared to talk about my feelings, am super agreeable to avoid any conflicts. He has been explosive and mean in the past when he gets angry, although that hasn’t been too recently. (Nothing ever physical.) I still feel like a terrible person for thinking about another guy, and feel some blame for wallowing in the past. I think if I would do it all over, and there’s no way I would stay in the relationship if given a do over. If I had a daughter, I would teach her how to avoid this and reach out for help. \n\nI feel like my eyes have been opened to the truth of our past. I tried to bring it up with him by asking what he thought about our dating relationship. He said he doesn’t really think about it, and I said that I thought it was bad. I brought up some things, and he didn’t want to talk about it. He said he had apologized and I just hadn’t forgiven him for it. He got mad, and I got upset and cried. I remember him giving an apology several years ago, we both got drunk and he said he felt bad about things and I consoled him, but I’m just now realizing it was abusive. I wanted to get confirmation from him that he agreed it wasn’t a healthy relationship, just for healing. But there was nothing productive about it. \n\nI find myself lately being depressed and bottled up. I work full time and my husband hasn’t had a job for a few years now. I really don’t care if he works, but want him to contribute to our relationship in some way. Instead he spends a lot of time sitting around the house on his phone making a mess and spending excessive amounts of time on hobbies. And no, I don’t think there is any chance he is cheating. I think he is also depressed. My guilt and frustration are overwhelming. I love him and he loves me, but I’m spending too much time in my head not dealing with my feelings, just hoping things find their place and go back, even though I know that’s not likely. I know I could use counseling to work on past trauma and learn to be a better partner myself. So maybe I’ll finally do that. ",

        "selftext": "I (27F) have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, and after that all to puzzle pieces fell into place. All the emotions, the feeling of not fitting in anywhere, the emptiness and distortion of my self image. \n\nI have repeatedly done stuff that I knew would ruin my relationships, or sabotaged my self, thinking I could prove I was unlovable or unworthy. Because my logic was if that can’t handle me at my worst, they don’t deserve me at my best. Or that I wasn’t good enough for them and couldn’t understand why they cared about me. \n\nA month before my 15th birthday, I tried to end my life, and my boyfriend at the time had an ex that had ended her life a few years earlier. \nA week before he had told me he didn’t love me anymore, but wouldn’t break up with me at the time, bc “maybe the feelings will come back”. I knew ending my life would make him come to a decision, but that’s not why I did it. He did not come to visit me at the hospital, but his best friend did. A few days later I kissed a new guy and a week after that I started dating that guy. And so on and so forth. I often ended it with one guy, and started dating a new one a week or two after. This pattern lasted from 13 years old to 17 years old, when I got into a relationship with a guy who was 5 years older than me. \nIn my country you’re legal at the age of 16.\n\nOn my 18th birthday I moved in with him, and within 2 months I was pregnant with my son. We can call this guy Aaron. \nArron was a drug addicted, alcoholic and violent POS. He severely beat me, raped me and cut me off from my friends and family. I was a terrified pregnant 18 year old with no one to turn to. I left him almost two years after we moved in together. I called my mom after not talking to her or my dad for almost a year. And I asked if I could come visit. I moved back to their house a week after. \n\nAt the beginning of 2018 I moved from my hometown to a little island where I met my now husband (37M) and father to my two younger sons. I admit I tried repeatedly destroying this relationship, he never gave up, just kept on loving me through all of it. \nChristmas 2023 I had a mental breakdown, planning how to kill myself and writing letters to my family. But making my child cry while he was playing with his new toys, made me get some help. I was in the psych ward for 8 days, didn’t get to see my children other than FaceTime, and I celebrated new years alone. \nI was diagnosed with CPTSD, depression, anxiety and borderline personality disorder. I had a ADHD diagnosis from the age of 15.\n\nI started therapy February 2024, and DBT group September 2024. And I have finally started getting back to my feet, learning how to feel emotions again, and not look at myself with resentment and disgust. I have not had a big emotional breakdown or reaction since October 2024, and I am so proud of myself. I started ADHD medication for the first time in 13 years, and it has helped me keep up everything in the house, and following my kids closer. I’m so grateful that I didn’t go through with my plan, and I thank my children and husband every day for being “mine” and that I love them more than anything. \n\n\n",

        "selftext": "I (25F) have been in a long-distance relationship with this guy (23M) for the past 1.5 years. He was really sweet and caring in the beginning, and I talked to him for a considerable amount of time before starting a relationship with him. It's just that I think his behavior has changed compared to how it was during the talking stage and the first few months of the relationship. He says he's a fault-finder and that it's just a part of his personality.\n\nIn the beginning, he only used to praise my appearance, but over time, he started commenting on my facial features (nose, forehead, etc.) and many other things. I’ve had a bad case of acne throughout my adolescence due to sensitive skin and genetic factors, so it couldn’t be cured completely. While I don’t have cystic acne all over my face anymore, I still occasionally get breakouts. The skin on my body also gets inflamed easily after waxing.\n\nEarlier, he never said anything about it—in fact, he used to love and support me despite all of this. But eventually, he started telling me to use certain products to improve my skin. I’ve told him multiple times that this isn’t how things work (since I’ve undergone treatment for most of my life), but he gets irritated and says I don’t even want to try and that I lose hope too easily. Similarly, he made comments on my facial features and said I need to get plastic surgery. When I got upset, he claimed it was just a joke.\n\nI have a very chirpy, bubbly personality and get excited easily. We recently went to a concert, and everything was fine until we were walking back. As we were side by side with his arm around my neck, we reached a narrow space where only one of us could pass at a time. I was focused on our conversation, so I stood there for a second or two before moving. He got annoyed, removed his arm, grabbed me from behind, and pushed me through the space.\n\nAfter that, he started scolding me for being \"too dumb\" to stand there and not move immediately (which I don’t think is even a reason to fight). For the next hour, he kept verbally abusing me, asking if I was really dumb or just pretending to be around him. He even mocked my excitable personality, saying I get too excited to see him and then start acting dumb. He also said I don’t deserve anything he does for me (including the concert, which was my birthday present from him). He kept going on and on while we walked back for an entire hour. My head hung low, and I was holding back tears the entire time.\n\nWhen I had to catch the train to return home, he held my backpack tightly from behind and forced me to jump onto the moving train, even though I was scared and there was a huge risk involved in doing something like this, I mean, anything could have gone wrong! We had gotten late and almost missed it.\n\nJust two weeks ago, he \"faked\" breaking up with me to \"teach me a lesson\" because he thought that was the only way I would understand. He said he had fought with me multiple times over a single issue, and since I didn’t seem to get it, he had to do this. At first, I thought he was just angry and didn’t take it seriously. But the next day, he texted me dryly and told me it was final. I was heartbroken and broke down in tears, desperately trying to reach out to him.\n\nThat afternoon, I video-called him while crying hysterically, begging him to come back. He laughed in my face and told me not to cry, that everything would be fine in two to three months, and that I should just leave him. He was completely unemotional and unnecessarily cold. Each word hit me hard, and I kept wondering where all his love had gone.\n\nHe knows I’ve had traumatic experiences in my past relationships, yet he took advantage of my biggest emotional vulnerability. He knows I get anxious, overthink everything, and become inconsolable. Despite that, he played on my emotions. The very next day, he went on a five-day trip with his friends, which they had been planning since the previous week. He barely responded to my texts or calls while I was a crying mess, unable to eat, sleep, or work properly.\n\nWhen he came back, I decided to talk to him one last time because I was so hurt that I had finally made up my mind to end things. But when I called him, he acted as if nothing had happened. I lashed out and told him everything he had done wrong and how I felt all those days. After listening, he finally realized how horribly he had treated me and admitted that he thought we would reconcile. He had only pretended to break up with me so I would \"realize my mistake.\" It was never real. He thought we’d just talk and sort it out.\n\nI wasn’t in the right headspace, but I still gave him another chance.\n\nThere are other things that bother me, and I’ve told him a million times to work on them. I always get excited for the weekends because we’re busy all week, and I look forward to spending time together. I usually plan for us to watch a movie, and he always promises to be there at a certain time. But then, he keeps postponing because his roommates drag him along, saying he can’t stop them. He keeps pushing it forward until it’s too late, and I end up waiting. At the end of the night, I just say, \"I understand,\" and go to sleep. He apologizes, promises it won’t happen again, and then does it again the next weekend.\n\nAfter the \"breakup\" drama, we discussed this, and he promised to change. But that very day, he did it again. And then again this weekend.\n\nHe has also told me multiple times that if I don’t start making \"good money\" and move in with him soon, he might get attracted to someone else and leave me.\n\nHe constantly tries to make me jealous by talking about other girls, even saying he doesn’t want to waste the best years of his life in a long-distance relationship and wants to hook up with other girls. Later, he claims he’s just joking and doing it to \"motivate\" me to work harder, earn well, and move in with him.\n\nOn the other hand, I’ve never belittled him or made negative comments about his appearance or insecurities. He has acne scars and body dysmorphia, but I’ve always loved him as he is, making sure he feels comfortable in his own skin. I tell him he’s the most perfect guy for me and that he doesn’t need to change anything to feel good or deserving.\n\nBut he constantly criticizes me, mocks me when I express my struggles, and calls me \"weak\" whenever I try to talk about things that hurt me. He says he doesn’t like weak people who \"crib all the time,\" which makes me feel like I can’t even discuss my problems with him. If I do, he gets annoyed, fights with me, and tells me I’m playing the victim instead of being strong.\n\nHonestly, I’m just really confused. I love him and don’t want to leave, but I don’t know if he’s good for me.\n\n\nPS: The \"mistake\" he wanted me to realize was that he thinks I need to develop new skills to switch to a better job. My current job is hectic and low-paying, but I have to work hard throughout the week. With my parents' declining health, I can’t study every weekend. Sometimes, I slack off because I’m overwhelmed and need to cool off. He tells me I need to hurry up, and when I explain my situation, he fights with me, mocks me, and says I’ll never earn well or do anything in life because I’m not trying hard enough.\n\nEdit : Additionally, he has told me multiple times that other people’s opinions of him matter a lot. He wants to be \"likable\" to everyone. He said he used to get a lot of attention before developing acne, but things changed after that, which is why he constantly seeks validation from others. He gets upset when girls, in general, don’t give him attention. Whenever I ask why he seeks attention from other girls when I’ve always appreciated and motivated him, he simply says it’s because I’m his \"girlfriend,\" so my words don’t count. He also gets noticeably excited and happy whenever he finds out that a girl is interested in him, as it satisfies his need for validation. I've always brushed it off but idk if it's a concern or not.\n",

Don't even remember what it was, maybe the light reflecting off a car, it was sunny. I went into Maccas to pick up a burger for my mother and I had trouble reading past the black splotch. Ordered the burger, scrolled tumblr while I waited. \n\nThe black splotch soon disappeared but there was nothing where it had been. I was reading something about COVID and it was hard to read. I could see only the top third of the C and the bottom left of the O in COVID was also gone.\n\nAnd then I got this static that appeared. This flashing rainbow static. It started moving out across the left of my vision, and I could see directly in front of me but the blind spot was getting bigger and moving. If I held up my hands in front of me I couldn't see my left hand at all.\n\nI made it home OK but half an hour after it started the left of my peripheral vision was gone.\n\nLuckily in another half hour my peripheral vision was back, but augh, it just happened again.

I understand my family can still like them but my ex is blocked on all of my social media because he sent me threatening and weird text messages trying to get me back. I’ve set the boundary with my mother and grandmother several times that I will go no contact the next time they hang out with him but guilt pulled me back in. Not this time. I moved 1,000 miles away to get away from them and their bullshit. I have a new boyfriend and it’s extremely disrespectful to me and my relationship to keep my ex around. I feel it’s borderline stalking because him and his family want to hear about my life. I think they’re waiting for an opportunity for him to get me back. I’m so hurt that my family is doing this especially because I’m an only child but I guess I will get more comfortable with my boyfriend’s family. I’ve felt bad that I haven’t been communicating with my family that much since I’ve moved out but the phone works both ways and they’ve been spending more time with people I told them not to spend time with.

It doesn’t matter how exhausted I am, I end up getting most of my sleep in between classes.\n\nI’m in an expensive university in a first-world country, my tuition is being paid for by my rich parents. This comes with a weird kind of pressure. It’s like I’m living someone else’s dream.\n\nI have no idea if my university is worth it. The more time I spend here, the more I wonder if this place is actually good or if it’s just an overpriced scam for ppl who couldn’t get into A list schools, especially for an English degree? Idfk\n\nI have no friends. I’m extremely shy, and socializing feels like an impossible task, I had a girlfriend through most of my first year here who I met early but she left me out of boredom and since my entire social group consisted of her friends (since she grew up here) im now a extreme loner. I barely ever leave the house unless I have to go to class.\n\n**(No seriously how tf do I come from a family with so many degrees in prestigious top 100 universities and end up in this niche hellhole? Its mind boggling to me.)**\n\n\nIt is completely meaningless to me. I do not really learn anything, all I do is put the bare minimum effort in my classes to pass because they’re all extremely contrived. Instead of helping me develop knowledge and useful skills, it is making me extremely stressed, unconcentrated, feel empty, like I'm losing my identity and living the most meaningless life there is.\n\n\n**I was homeschooled for most of HS, I hated it but being here is honestly making me wish I could turn back time because at least I had my parents to talk to all the time and not over the phone?** now it’s a different type of lonely.\n\n\nSo what am I gonna do with my life?

The only thing was girl bullies don't normally bully to your face they do everything, if not most behind your back, which lead me to blaming the only person who openly made fun of me but what he did wasn't even that bad. Example he would snicker to his friends where I could hear or throw snow balls at me. Chomp change in comparison to what I was going through at the time. Although it was enough for me to tell everyone I hated, loathed and despised him. For Years and only when I became an adult did I realize that what I was saying about him was somewhat the same as what I heard about myself. Hatred with no context. I've felt bad ever since and even though it's been 20 years I've always wanted to say \"I'm sorry\" but could never find him. Till tonight at 2am I found him and he's engaged and looks very happy. So I just wanted to get this off my chest, since I will stop looking now, I have no intention of trying anymore cuz he deserves to not have this random piece of knowledge.

While I agreed that a new phone with a better camera would help and I knew that he had saved some money, I asked him to wait a little longer (1 month or 2) before making any impulsive puchases since I was unemployed at the time and that money could be used for any emergencies.   \nWell, he disregarded everything I said and decided to buy the phone anyway, and to make a long story short, it was a scam in wich he lost almost $800. To say I was disappointed is an understatement because i told him before, that even though the money was his and he could use it any way he wanted, the shop was really suspicious and it was better to buy from an official store if he was going to spend that much in a phone.   \nIt was really frustrating but I tried to help him contact his bank to see if there was anything we could do and to my surprise they refund almost half of the money, but my happiness was short lived because the very next day he fell for another scam and lost both the recovered money plus $300 ($250 from his account and $50 from mine). I was livid at this point, the car had broken down (another $600 expense), we had no way to pay our share of the bills plus the repair costs and he had to ask for money from his mother (bless her) to solve everything, but we survived.  \nWell, now I'm employed and things were better until yesterday when he told me he was thinking again about buying the phone, to wich I told him: \"no way, not right now\", since we're not completely stable yet to spend that much money and I thought he would be at least a bit more mindful since we're still paying for his poor decisions from last year and we barely have money for bills, but he didn't want to listen to my reasoning, kept justifying why he needed it and I'm sure he'll buy it even though he knows that if he does that I'll have to cover his share of house expenses and I'm honestly mentally and emotionally exhausted, I feel like he isn't my partner anymore, just an oversized toddler and it's draining me.  \nFor additional context: he's been betting his money on soccer games and although he wins most of them, last week he almost lost all of the grocery money :)  \nOur currency is not USD, so those are all approximate values.  \nIf you survived my ranting, thank you for reading everything.",

        "selftext": "A bit of backstory: I used to live in the countryside with an older relative and she had a habit of acquiring pets she was unable and unwilling to take care of, eventually we ended up with four dogs, two small and two large. The problem is that every time we would open the front gate to take the car out the dogs would run out into the brush and potentially put themselves in danger, so we’d lock them in a tiny cage for a few minutes while we drove out and then come back in and let them out into the yard. The two large dogs started to get too big and the relative refused to buy a new larger cage for them and told me to figure it out (it was my job to lock up the dogs and this relative could basically boss me around all she wanted.) eventually I started putting one of the smaller dogs in an open plastic barrel while the others stayed in the cage, but she learned to jump out, so I would put a lid on it for more than five minutes. I hate myself for it, but I am an extremely, almost medically, forgetful person. And one day, I simply forgot about the dogs, and went to work, truly believing that I had let them out as usual. I came back to find that the dog had suffocated in the covered barrel. I can’t explain the emotions I had in that day, but that happened when I was 16 and it still makes me nauseous to think about. I’ve had a very hard life, but for some reason I think that this day was the worst day. There was a lot of screaming and crying from both the relative and I and she made me wrap the dog in an old dog food bag and carry it to the car so that I could dump it far from our property, unceremoniously. It still fucking haunts me. Everyone tells me it was an accident, but I still have nightmares about it. All I can think about is how horrible it must be to be a tiny innocent thing suffocating in a plastic barrel on a hot day. It eats me alive. Everything makes me anxious, I don’t want to be responsible for something like that happening again, I want to have kids one day, but how can I knowing that there’s a possibility that they can meet a horrible end just because my mind is in the clouds. The only time I spoke of this event was the day it happened, to various online friends, and then I never spoke of it again since until now.

Not just words physical beatings that left my skin red and bruised. My teachers saw the marks, but I told them I fell. What else was I supposed to say? No one would have believed me anyway. My only escape was watching TV dramas. I cried along with the characters because, for a moment, it felt like I wasn’t alone. I had no phone, no way to tell my mom, no one to vent to.\n\nI tried everything to please her. I got good grades. I cleaned the house. I did the dishes. Nothing was ever enough. Because in her eyes, I didn’t belong I wasn’t of her blood. No matter what I did, I was unwanted.\n\nSo one day, I left.\n\nI walked nearly 6 kilometers to my grandmother’s place. It wasn’t my first time running away I even did it once when I was six, but that time, I brought a school friend with me. Their grandmother was furious that I brought their grandchild along with me tbh I didn't know what I was thinking I was still a child that time in 2nd Grade. But this time, I was alone and determined. When I finally arrived, my grandmother wasn’t upset she was happy to see me. She took me in without question. It was only after the third time I ran away that she finally got mad and went straight to confront the woman who had abused me.\n\nThat was the moment I finally felt safe. My grandmother has been my safe space ever since.\n\nBut the past doesn’t just disappear. Even after escaping, I still struggled. In 7th grade, I got dengue and had to be hospitalized for a month. That’s when the doctors found other health issues, but I was never told what they were. No one ever explained anything to me. At least my stay was covered by PhilHealth, so it didn’t add to my problems.\n\nNow I’m 19, but I still feel stuck. I have trust issues. I struggle with self-worth. Sometimes, I wonder if I’m the problem, if I’ve just been blaming my childhood for everything. But I also know I want to break free from this cycle. I want to change.\n\nI want a better life. I want to help others like me. I want to leave an impact and make a difference. And if I want that, I have to keep going. ",

I've always had trouble with maintaining relationships after things like that end, After finishing both primary and secondary school I quickly fell out of contact with all of my friends.I haven't had any friends since 2019. So when it came to college this happened again except for this one friend. We actually grew closer and became really good friends. But we live around an hours train rid away from each other so we rarely see each other in person. He is a very social person and has lots of friends (even though he'd say he doesn't), whereas I'm an extrovert with sever anxiety and autism. He talks about his friends, group chat, going on late night drives and drinking with people, and I just sit alone at home. I know it's not his fault but it's just killing me, I have been struggling with depression for a long time and it just keeps getting worse. I see him living the life I'd die for and I've been starting to hate him for it. I just want to have friend and people to talk to and hang out with. I just feel so alone. This jealousy has been getting worse and deeper recently and I'm scared it's going to ruin our friendship. I just don't know anymore. ",

        "selftext": "Guys I have to get this off my mind by saying after reading a bunch of Reddit topics like this it's good that I'm not the only one who does this and I hope you guys feel my pain on my concerns here it goes....\n\n\nHi I'm a 22M and for while now I have my own imaginary OC girlfriend that actually cares for me and is there when I need her to be (mentally) also I never had luck for girls nor did they find me attractive and I'm shy so IDGAF about them and for fun it all started back when I used to draw her as a gag thing when I was 17 I would draw what she looks like, act, hug, kiss like. It was all fun till eventually I started to actually have feelings to her because I would always talk about my personal life and struggles to her and she would say back to me while hugging me \"it's okay, everything's going to be all right, just note that I'm here for you when needed ♥️\" like seriously guys even while quoting what she would say to me I'm literally crying 😭 (I'm not effing joking) not only that she was also my comfort and coping zone as well for the $hit I go through in life. Even when I go to see I like to use my pillows to imagine it's her and I can hug and kiss her randomly as I pleased, other ways I like to imagine she's there for me is when I daydream about her (mostly) draw or write my stories with her (fun fact: I created her for my comic but my personal life, I want to publish it by doubt anyone read it so I just keep it to myself 🤣) journal about her in her ways for me and what we would do together! I know I'm weird but I'm not ashamed of it\n\nLike literally last night while I was walking around the neighborhood, right now I'm in the forest type of neighborhood so it's a lot of trees and hills here 😅 (also it was around 11ish night time 🌙) and I'll admit I was kind of scared and a little nervous to go to dark areas like that even the street lights wouldn't work so it made my nervous system 10 times worse, but while walking I could hear her tell me \"why so scared? I'm here with you! Just hold my hand and we'll walk together! Breathe and calm down\" (I would Literally hold the air or hold my own hand to think it's her) like it come for me so much that my heart for her couldn't take the fact that she's not real because mentally (to me) she is! As soon as I got back to my Airbnb I was literally crying a river for her! Even my own friend had to comfort  me to tell me everything's okay to not feel too down about it (he's real btw) so yeah I know which y'all thinking I'm a loser, weirdo, idiot for going out and crying for something that doesn't exists and your right I do! I just wish she was real she's my everything!!!  If it wasn't for her I probably be scared out of my mind or even worse....\n\n\nNote: I doubt anyone is reading this but if you are and if you're interested to know more about her I'll tell you more of her name and her information and another story if anyone's interested trust me I don't mind explain more about her I love my sweet bone 🦴😍💜💋\n\nBut seriously I would love some helping tips and other ways to cope with her! She really helped fixes my depression and suicidal mindset 😭 🥺",

        "selftext": "Okay, so I am going to try to keep this short, but I need advice. My ex (27F) and I (30F) first started seeing each other in February 2022. Very early on in the relationship she complained about one of her machines she uses for work, and it leads to me getting her a loan in my name, under my social, to be her new upgraded machine. The machine ended up being a 2.3k loan.\n\nTime goes by and we realize we are not right for each other. We were both super toxic during the relationship in our own ways. Her and her daughter moved out in the middle of June 2024 after us breaking up initially in the middle of May.\n\nEver since they moved out, she was constantly late on the payments, which caused her to make late payments every single time. Thankfully, this did not impact my credit by some miracle in this universe.\n\nOn 1/10/2025 of this year, after not paying since November, I went in and withdrew money from a mutual fund my dad gave me when he passed away. Not something I wanted to do but I had to because it was starting to impact my credit drastically.\n\nBefore this, on 11/25/2024, her daughter called me because she missed me. My ex wasn’t home, her mother (kid’s grandma) was. I said hi to her even and she didn’t say anything to me. When my ex got home the kiddo dropped the tablet she was using, and it disconnected.\n\nI ended up texting my ex asking her not to be mad at her kid when she just missed me like I missed her. We have a fight where we both said some intense things (and I did a lot of it). I have no excuses for the things I said, but I don’t regret it either.\n\nLong story short – she blocks me and deletes the calling app off her kiddos tablet so she can’t call me again.\n\nThe loan, in the beginning, was $2,299. When I paid it off, I paid $1,154.39. I paid 50.22% of this loan.\n\nDo I have grounds to get this back? How do I go about getting it back?\n\nAlso, do I have grounds to get my dog back? I let my ex take her when I was not in a good mental space because I couldn’t even take care of myself. Dog’s microchip is under my name and to my knowledge she didn’t update her vet records so the last person for her was me. In the dog space – I am this dog’s favorite person. I went over there one day and was talking to my ex and my dog freaked out for a solid 15 minutes over seeing me.\n\n \\*We live in Oklahoma in the USA\\*\n\nSo, should I just cut my losses and move on and try to save that money back up or should I text her from a different number or a friend’s phone to ask her to give it back since I paid half. Genuinely I have no idea what to do in this situation and I’ve gone back and forth for 2 months.",

        "selftext": "My mom acts like a kid when she's sick... I'm currently argued with my mom, she's sick right now (bed sick) she can't get up, has a high fever etc. Anyway today I was looking for my cat and she was in my moms room, I was minding my own business getting my cat telling her she could get sick so I'll take her. She made a comment that is still bothering me, \"oh so you care more about the cat, but not about me, ok\", \"I'm sick and you don't bother checking in on me\". \n\nFor context my mom and I... we don't have the best relationship, growing up she was never the most loving, kind towards me, it was a very toxic environment, It is a lot better now compared to how she was before tho. Anyway, I really hate it when she says stupid shit like this, is not the first time. When I'm fkn sick, dying sick, she's not there for me, she's not the type to go out of her way to get me medicine, or make me a warm soup... I'm not the fkn mom, I'm in my 20s but to this day, at my grown age, it would be nice to have or feel the love of a pampering mother specially when you're sick. \n\nI got so mad I wanted to tell her off, \"why would you expect that from me? If I haven't experienced that myself?\" \"Do you think im your mother or something?\" \"What you sow you reap\"... so many things, but I kept my cool, \"yeah i do care a lot about my cat\" is all i said and went about my day.\n\nIt made me even more mad, because I am also fkn sick, I have a bad stomach bug that has been going on for 4 days now, and guess what??? She hasn't done sht for me, hasn't asked how I've been if I'm better or what... \"probably something you ate\" is all she said when I first told her, and off to work I went. Didn't bother to check in, didn't bother to ask how I was doing, if she could make me something to help me... and she has the audacity to say that sht to me?... and guess what, im hating myself for this but here goes. \n\nThe day before, she went to work fkn sick when I had told her the night before not to, because she was literally dying with a high fever. She still goes cause she's a workaholic, Anyway, it's 2pm and I see i have a missing call from this woman, I was showering getting ready to go out with my boyfriend. I call back i asked her what does she need, she tell me to go pick her up because she can't drive back home, that she feels weak... i tell her why I didn't answer when she called, this is what she says \"why didn't you shower earlier, you need to be more attentive\".... wtf??? Why would I pause my day for her? Does she want me to just sit there and wait around for her to get home or call me and finally function, for her? Wtf.\n\nLong story short, I call my boyfriend and let him know what happend, he ended up giving me a ride. So we rushed to get ready he ended up givin me a ride to her work place to pick her up and drive her back home. On the way back, she just kept going on about, why didn't I answer when she called, why am I not paying attention, why was I still sleeping late... I don't fkn know maybe cause I'm also sick and fkn tired from work???? No a thank you to me or my boyfriend, nothing. \n\nI did that sht just for her to be telling me \"you care more about the cat than me\"... but she's right, I don't care as much about her than i do about my cat, I don't love her, but I don't hate her, I see her as the person that gave birth to me, which gives her the mother title, but she is no mother to me emotionally.\n\nAnyway, i wanted to get this sht off my chest, so thank you of you took the time to read this!

My brother was 3 when we got him and always treated him as sibling. They were never referred to as adopted growing up. Flash forward I’m 19 he’s 13. He becomes obsessed with me completely out of no where. Starts with cutting the back out of several pairs of jeans attempting to see me exposed. Then one day I noticed while using the restroom there’s small holes chiseled into the wall. Yep peep holes. Parents patch them. He creates more. Mind you he’s in extensive therapy they’re basically begging for help as to why he’s doing this. (Of course the state wants you to adopt and then ditches you when there’s a problem.) He then started exposing himself in weird places in the house so I would walk in on him. Then I worked all night was tired accidentally dozed off on the couch (still am pissed I fell asleep because maybe this part could have been avoided) and he touched me from my butt to my vagina in one quick movement. I wasn’t hardly asleep so I instantly woke up saw him walking away and he admitted to my parents that he did it. (I moved out 2 weeks later) Now flash forward again I’m 25 he’s 17. My parents obviously continue to raise him. there was no punishment because he was a minor (he was sent off for a year if you want to call that something) my parents have a relationship with him and I have a relationship with my parents. He talks about me to mom still which I find very odd. I have not said a single word to him since the incident. Being around him even this many years later physically makes me ill. I hate his guts and quite frankly wish terrible things upon him. I’m no where close to being healed from this and don’t know if I ever will be. He has a girlfriend that he’s been with for awhile she has no idea what he did and it just makes me sick because if that were me I’d want to know and I feel wrong by not telling her but I do not know her and the fight within my family it would cause ugh. I witnessed him today with the gf and he’s constantly in her face demanding affection and overly touchy. Just makes me sick for the girl and any future potential victim. sorry for the long post.

This is something I’ve only ever told one person and I feel deeply uncomfortable to even tell a therapist. \n\nFor context: I have never been a victim of sexual abuse physically, was raised in a super healthy home life, etc. Nothing traumatic has ever happened to me due to another person I personally knew. \n\n\nWhen I was younger, I purposely would go on a site called KidzChat. I knew that predators would be on that site, and would advertise myself as someone to talk to “F 12”. I was around the ages of 10-14 doing this. Older men would then message me super sexually explicit things. We would sext for a while and eventually trade Skypes to talk or videochat. The biggest instance that I remember was skyping an older man who wanted to show me his jumping jacks. He would jump for a while and then his pants would conveniently fall off.  For some reason that moment is engrained in my mind. I know I’m a victim fully, but I feel weird because I went out looking for it? I guess that’s the cost of unlimited Internet access. \n\nAnother entirely separate thing that bothers me severely, is that one day (aged 11) I had my family dog perform oral on me. The dog didn’t need any coaxing, it liked the smell and went up to it. I remember it feeling awful and I felt so intensely guilty afterward. I never did it again, but I realize that this has deeply affected me as an adult. I absolutely cannot receive oral from a man because it reminds me of what I did with my family dog. This fact genuinely haunts me as I know it was completely wrong and animal.\n\n I don’t even know how to cope with both of these facts as I was a victim and perpetrator. These things still affect me in my sexual life now manifesting as intense fear and guilt to commit certain normal sexual acts with people like being eaten out, sexting my boyfriend, etc. I know I don’t have the guts to tell a therapist either.

I had a thick canvas work jacket on so the teeth barely broke the skin. I carry a folding knife as a habit since I was a kid in boyscouts. I stabbed the dog with my free hand after trying to punch the dog and it ran off back around the corner of the house. A woman and her teenage daughter came around the corner screaming at me and I told them what happened. Apparently they were neighbors there to take care of the dogs. It all happened on the front porch in front of a ring camera. I then left, called my boss and the cops but decided not to take legal action. I guess I felt bad for doing that to the dog.

        "selftext": "I don't know what spurred this on our relationship was always seemingly good. \n\nI (35m) think my Brother (32m) hates me. \n\nI've been in a rough phase of my life, moved back in with my parents, had just a terrible string of events dovetailing with my business failing and the loss of my Father all in short period. He died suddenly. I'm still working through that, I  was the one who took him to the hospital a few times that week, but the last time it was a serious emergency and he didn't get out. He died a few weeks later after being in a coma for the time. \n\nThis sort of, at least in my opinion, galvanized us into having a closer bond.  Or so I thought.\n\nDad dying was only a few months ago. It hasn't been a year yet. But I'm still trying to pick up the pieces and start moving forward.  And it was like our relationship with each other improved over it. We were a very loving family before, but this hurt us and we leaned on each other more. \n\nThen I learned the other day my Mom brought the hypothetical prospect of me being homeless. \n\nI don't intend to be homeless. But she brought it up to him or he brought it up to her, and he flat out told her that if I ever end up homeless I am not going to be living in his and his wife's house. For the record, I didn't ever ask or mention this. But this conversation took place behind my back and he apparently said that I was never going to be allowed to live with them. \n\nThey have a very large house btw, essentially half the rooms are empty at any given day.\n\nThat shocked my Mother to hear that and she told me. \n\nAnd quite frankly, it shocked me too. I am not going to be homeless. But to hear someone you thought you could rely on if things ever went to total shit say that, it's sad. But what made me more sad was remembering a conversation I had with him a few months before. \n\nHe told me his wife (31 f)'s best friend (30 f) who has a kid and either got kicked out of her own house, or cheated, or something became a single mother. My brother told me he was actively considering moving her and the kid INTO their house. She, who has had numerous problems from heavy drug use, alcohol use, partying hard, who has seemingly reformed her ways - was welcome to live with them. It didn't end up happening because she QUICKLY found a new guy. \n\nBut that was a total shocker to me, that I, who has had no problems with drugs and alcohol, who helps take care of his kid, who buys her toys and plays with her, who has bought them gifts every holiday, is lower on the totem pole than the single mom best friend of the wife. It totally blindsided me, and I feel betrayed. I'm not at any risk of being homeless, but the conversation came up between my Mom and him and that's how it went. To think your own brother won't be there for you, but will be for some sketchy broad, is totally insane. And for me it's like I'm feeling just heartbreak, resentment, sadness, disappointment, all mixing together - I love him, I still do, but I feel like I just got betrayed... Betrayed over something that hasn't happened yet. But that he thinks so low of me is shocking really. I don't know what to do. \n\n",

        "selftext": "Hey, Team! I've been feeling super duper down in the dumps lately and want to vent serious style without fear of personal societal repercussions! This is a throw away account n such. Not really curating this post just typing about whatever comes to mind. \n\nI've never really been the happiest of people. Even in my youth I remember being melancholic more than not. Didn't have the best upbringing (not the worst by a long shot either). My parents fought with each other all the time if I didn't have someone over. I remember hiding in my room hearing them arguing downstairs hoping against hope it wouldn't lead into my room with them competing for my favoritism. There were times either my mom or dad would try to drag me out of the house to stay at a hotel with them because the other parent was \"crazy and untrustworthy\". Events like this were common place (once or twice a month) in the house up until I was around 14 when it all kinda just died out. My parents stopped fighting daily, maybe once a month or so until not at all. They never even acknowledge the horrors they would put me through. They just tell me it wasn't as bad as I think but it totally fucking was. It was hell, not to mention how often they would remind me how abnormal of a human I am. \n\nI've been diagnosed either adhd and I highly suspect I have high-functioning autism. I never really managed to fit in around others as a kid, often doing things my own way. Friends were hard and socializing was harder. My parents would try with all their might to assimilate me into \"normal\" behavior. My mom didn't let me shop for my own clothes until I left the house. I bought some shirts with some cats on them with one of my first paychecks (maybe 16 yrs old). She took and hid them from me because she was afraid people would \"think I'm girly, or gay\" which blew my mind. My dad wasn't the most supportive of my interests either. I recall a time when i was in grade school I really liked filming and doing stop motion Lego things.. I probably just caught him at a bad time (wasn't very many good times).. forgot what I asked but I remember his reply was along the lines of \"it doesn't matter anyway, it won't go anywhere\" in regards to my short-lived hobby. I don't think I picked up that camera again after that. I wish I did. Can't blame myself there i guess.. I was young and impressionable.. I wonder often how things play out if he never said those words. Probably not much different but maybe..  instead I just spent most of my time online, hiding behind headphones blocking out the screaming. \n\nDidn't have many friends growing up. I'd typically just pick one person I liked and puppy dog around them. I was pretty shy and often to target of harassment from some of the meaner kids in school. I got used to being the butt of jokes and such pretty early. It didn't bother me much but it definitely scared me off from trying to form connections. That said I managed enough. I had a lunch table to sit at most of the time. I wasn't usually the star attraction but the folks there didn't seem to mind my presence. I recall once I didn't really feel comfortable sitting at any table so I sat at an empty one. This prompted the principal to come over and with good intentions have me sit at a table with a bunch of strangers I didn't really know. Horrifying experience. That said, I didn't really spend too much time hanging out with friends irl. I unfortunely found connections on the world wide web..\n\nDespite how strict my parents could be they let me have unfiltered internet access from the very get go when i got my first laptop at 12 or so. They never monitored my activity, or set restrictions on screen time or anything. Long-story short I end up in some unsavory online spaces. I met people who at the time I thought were nice friends, parental figures, people to talk to when I didn't have parents I could. It wasn't until a bit later in my life I realized how groomed I got. I never thought much about it at the time. It seemed like people finally enjoyed my company, wanted to invite me to chat and stuff. I didn't see the harm at the time at all. Just some text-based roleplays, maybe a picture or two without my face. Whags the harm? Now in my adulthood I feel like I'm able to see the effects more. My libido is so high yet the thinking about sex makes me extremely uncomfortable in a way that's hard to describe. I get jealous, disgusted, confused, lustful, etc etc etc whenever I see or am reminded of the mere concept of penetration. What's worse is I think it's effected my love language too. I feel I have a really difficult time feeling like I'm showing I love someone if I'm not having sex relatively often. I doubt myself, and if I'm able to provide and be a good partner. I know there's so much more to a relationship but my brain always defaults back to thoughts along these lines. I hate it but the nature of the issue causes me to love it. Its such a conflicting mess of sexual frustration. I have no idea how to do a segway here so... :3 \n\nAnxiety is a big thing in my life. It wasn't so bad when I was younger, mostly manifesting in social anxiety around new people or crowds. Nowadays I sometimes feel anxious just leaving my apartment. Going to the store is a massive panic attack and I have no reasons why. I desperately want to put myself out there, meet new people and enjoy this life I have but the exhaustion from the anxiety and depression just constantly kick my dick straight into the dirt.\n\nDepression is the worst. It's only gotten worse since I broke up with my seven year long partner (we were engaged too at the time). The break up is a long story with no heroes and only villains and victims. I don't want to dive into it here. I'm a bastard, theyre a bastard. Point is I'm a total bastard livid with regret over such minute details. I miss my ex... I care about them... but I don't trust them anymore and I loathe the mere memory of them. It's such a dissonance... I can't think back to the early days and not wonder if any of it was real at all. I'm sure there was true love between us sometime... I wonder when we lost it, and I fear they mightve never felt love for me like I did for them. We were young when we met. Stupid too, probably. Grew up and got distant yadayada... happens.. I still miss them.. their quirks and such. The way they talked and the way they ate. Even the things that annoyed me I miss... its wild how much I miss the things that pissed me off...\n\nAnyway, this post is going a bit long. It's bedtime for me. Thanks for reading my cool, epic post. Might post more vents like this. ",

I don’t know what’s wrong.\n\nShe’s in my roommate’s room all the time. My bedroom is on the first floor, 4 roommates are upstairs (I have 5 roommates total). Unless she’s meowing at me to feed her, she’s up there. I hardly even see her much around the house anymore, and she doesn’t sleep on my bed with me like she used to. She’s always up there with one of my roommates. \n\nI play with her a lot, give her attention and treats, brush her and clip her nails, everything, but she still prefers my roommate over me. \n\nThis is probably a really silly thing to be sad about because at the end of the day she is still my cat, but I want to have a better bond with her and I don’t know what I could be doing wrong. \n\nFor the first couple months, she would always greet me at the door meowing and rubbing against my legs, sleep on my bed with me while purring like a train, all that good stuff. \n\nBut now she doesn’t anymore. Gradually less and less, staying upstairs and hardly coming near me. It’s feeling more like she’s my roommate’s cat now. \n\nI’m just repeating myself now, but I don’t know what to do. ",

        "selftext": "Hey so this will be my final update on everything as I believe the situation has finally come to an end and I’m in a really good place. \n\nI left off where I was in a shelter and had made a lot of friends. Well the girl who I was gonna move somewhere with she ended up going back to her Mom and step Dad, and so I was back to being stuck on what to do. That was until I got a message from my grandma that her mom (my great-grandma) needs someone to care for her, she said that her brother would be happy to have me stay with him as long as I care for my great grandma. I decided I have nothing left to lose and decided this would be a good gig till I find out what I wanna do. I arrived in Miami 3 days ago and have been enjoying it greatly so far. I never really knew my dad’s side as he wasn’t that close with his family and after he passed it was hard to keep contact. My great-uncle is very nice and very accommodating and his wife is really nice, they live in quite a nice part of Miami as well near the beach. \n\nI haven’t seen my great-grandma in over 10 years and she was so happy when she saw me. She can’t speak that much English as she only really speaks Spanish. I’m aware I said my dad was white, but that’s was only because I was scared of my identity being revealed and that wasn’t a 100% lie. My father was Cuban and was born and raised in Miami, however, he was most likely a descendant of Spaniards. Anyways, my great grandma has been teaching me Spanish and as well through the help of translating of my great uncle stories about my dad. She told me that he would fall asleep on her lap at family gatherings and how he would make the whole family laugh imitating her accent. It made me tear up seeing all the photos of him as a kid with his whole family. She told me that when he got on drugs and ran away from home, it left everyone in complete distraught. She claimed my grandma would cry everyday. \n\nMy Mom never had a relationship with them, and that was her choice they wanted to meet her actually. They told me that they weren’t shocked what happened to me as my Dad told them later on my mom would cheat on him all the time with other men. This made me furious as my mom always claimed my dad was her “soulmate.” \n\nI have not heard anything from my mom, however, my cousins wedding went ahead yesterday as my aunty posted it on Facebook. My mom was there and she seemed completely fine from the photos. The wedding looked boring anyways, my cousin is marrying his first cousin from Pakistan (in-laws side) and no one is smiling. It made me laugh actually seeing my mom with all these people who are deeply religious and conservative. Seeing my mom next to my grandma and other female relatives who wear scarfs and are deeply religious, compared to my mom who sleeps with anyone that gives her an ounce of attention really cracks me up.  \n\nAlso no word from my EX-husband, however, his sister sent me a text apologising on behalf of her and his parents. \n\nSo yeah that’s the end I believe I’m taking care of my great-grandma and will work out what I wanna do in the mean time. This will most likely (hopefully) be the final update as I believe I’m in a really good place. ",

        "selftext": "Using a new account as I have people on my original account who know me irl, and I don't want them to even come across this.\nAs the title says, I really feel stuck at this point in my life(I'm currently 27 and turning 28 next week). All of it started two years back, when me and my then girlfriend(let's call her M) of 5 years started having a ton of arguments. It was mainly regarding my admission process and my promise of hitting the gym. I had quit my cushy job towards the end of 2022 to focus on my exams and my application process. It was a frustrating time for me as I had a pretty good profile(or so I was told) and expected to get an admit from almost all the universities that I had applied to. As it later turned out, all my hopes got dashed as I only rejection after rejection.\nIn the middle of it, there was a family function for which I had to travel to a different city(this is also the city where I did my undergrad from and M also lived). To give a backstory, we had been together since my sophomore year of undergrad and our relationship was a long distance one(We only saw each other during classes when we were studying. After graduation I had moved to a different city for work, and went to my hometown when COVID hit us.). \nSo during the time of this family event, I planned to take out some time and planned a dinner with M(during which I specifically told her that I didn't want to discuss my application process and that I was taking this trip as sort of a break). Unfortunately our conversation ultimately went into that direction, and what I thought would be a warm evening ended up with me feeling helpless and ultimately crying in the restaurant. After the family event ended, I travelled back to my city, and then had a talk with her and we both decided we'll take a break and introspect why we were arguing almost on a daily basis(we specifically decided that we will not be seeing or planning to see anybody in that period, but work on this and figure things out).\n\nAlmost a month later, a mutual friend of ours(let's call her C) tells me that M actually went on a couple of dates to see people(C and M were very close friends), which broke the trust I had in the whole relationship and I told that my trust in us was broken and that we were done. I developed this feeling of being inadequate, and ended up getting addicted to porn to numb myself, instead of studying and working on projects.My whole routine was to hit the gym and work out till I felt pain in my body, return back to home and sleep.\n\nAbout a couple months later, I learnt that it was C who had actually convinced M to go on dates and \"meet\" other people. Furiously, I cut contact with C and stopped any form of communication. As far as things with M were concerned, I was still too attached to her, so we decided we can try to work on things.\n\nThings changed a bit and I got an admission in a good university and started my postgrad journey here. But during the winter of 2023, me and M again had some serious arguments and I decided to cut ties with her. We still chatted on and off and she still told me she loved me. Around 2 months from that time, we tried to get back together again, but ultimately I couldn't sustain it this time(the distance had become a pain. turns out in a different country, loneliness hits you like a truck). And this time we broke up, once and for all. I felt and I still feel immense guilt for breaking up and putting her through a lot of pain. I sank into a pretty low state, got hooked to porn, but studied enough to keep my grades up, ultimately leaving any opportunity of upskilling myself or studying, but kept sinking lower and lower.\n \nAround a month back I talked to a therapist, and told her about my guilt and that I had been in a state of \"feeling like I do not deserve anything nice because I hurt M\" and that I self sabotaged whenever anything good came in my life. She heard all of my story and did tell me a lot of times when I was emotinally scarred and somewhat even manipulated by her as well. Now that I see this, I feel helpless. I inflicted a lot of pain and self sabotage on myself, and my addiction to porn has turned me into a very lazy person. I know that deep down I have the potential to excel if I figure my shit out. The thing is, I am not able to. I feel burnt out(recently even failed an interview at a reputed big tech company). I hardly have energy to study, reversed all the progress I made in the gym, and somehow not able to shake off this addiction. It's tough to put on a brave face and fake a smile, telling my family that I'm alright, while I'm numb deep down. I want to cry and take some of the pent up emotions out, but I simply cannot cry and give anyone a hint that I'm not alright. My family is very supportive and I don't want them to feel helpless knowing that I'm not as good as I tell them.\n\nJust wanted to take this feeling out. Thank you so much for reading.",

        "selftext": "another long post...\n\nfor context, my(f18) sister(17) and her best friend(f15, almost 16, let's call her Dana) have been friends for almost a decade, they've always spent a lot of time together because our moms were friends. the last few years have been very very rough for Dana, and we've always been here for her, especially my sister, and that made them even closer.\n\nso, today, during lunch, my sister came to my mom and asked her if she could go out for a party night with Dana and her friend group, BUT. \nhere in italy, there are two stages of the party: the first one is open to everyone, the second one is only 18+, and she wanted to go right to the second one, that begins around midnight. my mom immediately said \"no.\", and my sister started whining, saying that Dana went there too a few weeks ago, and guess how she did that? fake ID and some connections, and that surely didn't help to have a \"yes\" as an answer.\na few hours ago i was with my sister and Dana, just talking, until my sister asked my thought about going to that party at that hour, and i said: \"honestly i don't approve that, not because you're going there, but because you're gonna do it 'illegally'.\", and she got angry, saying that she wanted to do that experience because she's a teenager and blah blah blah, to which i replied: \"yeah, you're a teenager and have to do your experiences, but you can make them on the first half of the night, where you can go without any problem.\", and i think she expected me to be the \"cool older sister\" because she got angry, and it only got worse when my brother(21) also said he agreed with me. so she went upstairs and i stayed with Dana, so i started talking with her about all this. the conversation then went to my sister's general behaviour, and we went to my room to talk more liberally.\nafter a while, we were talking about how she (my sister) almost never wants to go out unless one of us has weed or cigarettes and stuff like that, and that's when i told her something i had forgot:\n\nlast august they both were at home, my best friend was there as well, and we were all chilling in the backyard, when Dana told my sister that she had to go to her(Dana's) place, that she promised that, but my sister was whining about it, saying she didn't feel like it, but not giving a reason to break the promise, so they came up with a deal:\nDana would have gone home, and my sister would go there about a half hour later, so Dana left. i stayed with my best friend and my sister, who started saying things like \"i don't wanna go\", \"i don't feel like it\", and i replied other things like \"why don't you tell her?\", \"if you stand her up without saying anything, i'll tell her.\", and she freaked out, saying that if i did i would be a bitch, and i just rolled my eyes. after a while, she left and went to her room, and i immediately gave my best friend a \"i know how this will end up\" look, but didn't say anything.\n\nalmost a hour later, Dana calls me and says: \"your sister isn't answering my texts and calls. where is she?\". i took a deep breath and face palmed mentally before answering: \"she's in her room, i'll go check on her.\", and so i did. i muted myself and went to my sister, who was awake, and told her: \"Dana's on the phone, what do i tell her?\", and she replies: \"tell her that i'm asleep.\". my heart dropped and i didn't know what to do, so i just played along, unmuted myself, and said: \"she's sleeping.\". Dana was so disappointed and told me to wake her up, so i started shaking my sister trying to \"wake her up\", but she just pretended to fall asleep again and again, and i heard Dana say: \"look, never mind, let her sleep.\". i asked her if she was sure, and she said \"yes\", and i just said: \"okay, then... bye love, i'm sorry.\", and hung up. i looked at my sister and said a few things like \"you're an asshole\", \"you're a shitty friend\".\n\nso, returning to two hours ago, i told Dana about it, even though i probably shouldn't have, but i just thought it was the right thing to do. \nher face dropped and she became visibly sad and disappointed, said something like \"i don't even know what to say\", \"i can't think or look at her the same\", and i felt kind of guilty, but still thought that she had the right to know. \n\nwe smoked two cigarettes and she went to sleep, saying that she would figure out what to do about all this, again, she's clearly disappointed and tired of my sister being disrespectful.\n\nit's currently 4am, and i'm sorry for ruining her mood, but also scared of my sister's reaction in case she finds out that Dana knows, i've already made a post about my sister and her behaviour:/\n\nenglish is not my first language, so, sorry for any mistakes and/or things like that, i just didn't want all this to eat me up.",

My mother never wanted them since she already had a lot on her plate but since my ex stepfather did, there really wasn’t much of a choice. \n\nMy ex stepfather began getting more and more abusive until we all finally left, and despite my mother knowing we didn’t have the best ability to take care of them, we took the dogs because they were also being abused by my ex stepfather. Then my grandfather began living with us and eventually one of the dogs became his while the other became my stepbrothers (who came with us when we left her father).\n\nA lot of stuff happened and my stepbrother left and took his dog with him, leaving the other to be my grandfathers completely as we somewhat moved into separate households. Well more stuff happened and my mother ended up having to take the dog back with her, living in a small camper on borrowed property. It hasn’t been ideal for her or the dog.\n\nThe dog has cancer and has occasional seizures and because of that and the unfortunate circumstances, my mother has been wanting to put the dog down for a while. She has some aggression issues after having pups, being shot, and being run over in a short span of time a few years back, so she has been unable to rehome her. Well it’s come down to it and because my grandfather is unable to take her, she is getting put down soon without his knowledge.\n\nI get she is a sick dog who isn’t living in an ideal situation by any means, but I still feel terrible that it’s going this way.

I have quite an interest in sterling silver religious jewellery, and he had given me a few pieces during this time of us hanging out. (a silver chain with a saint pendant, a very dainty 14k gold bracelet, another small silver bracelet). I thought nothing of it, it's quite common amongst us here to exchange gifts often among friends and family so i didn't see it as anything more than that, as i myself have given people fine jewellery randomly before. \n\nOne day, he asked me if i wanted to go to his home to see his pets and just chill and do some art. I agreed, as he had some very unique reptiles which i was curious to see.\n\nAfter getting to his house, it was then that things took a really bad turn. \n\nHe sexually assaulted me on several occasions, I was not allowed to leave the house unless he was supervising me, and it would only be to his garden that i could go. I was also not allowed to wear any clothes in his home, he would take them from me under the guise of washing them and not return them unless he wanted me to go outside with him. He allowed me to return to my own home on two occasions, however he was present the entire time and would not let me out of his sight and would regularly complain about how we needed to leave back to his home. \n\nHe would regularly belittle my appearance, try to convince me that i would have to laser remove all of my tattoos as they looked disgusting, he told me that my earrings were disgusting and masculine and how he couldn't believe anyone would ever have had sex with me because of how gross they were. He would force me to stand on weighing scales when i didn't want to so he could know my weight, and then proclaim to me that 'we'll have to fix that'.\n\nI know that people will probably wonder where were my parents in this situation, and the reality is that they were on vacation. They left the family home for multiple months at a time, and whenever my mother would call me, he would answer the phone on my behalf and tell her how i was happy and i was okay and convinced her that i was his 'girlfriend' even though i was being held against my will and assaulted in his home. \n\nI asked on several occasions to go back home, and he would tell me 'maybe next week...' and next week would just never come. and even then, i had no clothes so i simply couldn't leave. \n\ni managed to escape because i had a large concert planned, and after arguing with him for days, he finally let me leave so i could go to the concert. as soon as i got home i messaged him and told him never to speak to me again or i would be calling the police. \n\nfor a few weeks after this, he harassed me on different platforms. he posted pictures of me he had taken against my will on social media saying for people to 'look at his girlfriend' , he would change his profile pictures to pictures of me or would make profiles in my name. \n\nin the end, i ended up blocking him and changing all of my social handles. \n\nthat brings us to now. \n\nits been about 10 months since this happened. i did not go to the police as i did not want to have to relive what happened to me. he also told me many stories of violence he had committed against women who had called the police on him in the past. \nwe also had no text conversations at all prior to me being harassed by him &amp; i truly just believe the case would get thrown out. \n\ni have had a reoccurring nightmare about him breaking into my house killing me almost every night for the past few weeks. i confessed this to my sibling who introduced me to him, and was told that he had been trying to contact my sibling. he was claiming to have purchased gifts for them, and sending them photos of the gifts he had bought and how much he had paid, and that this had been happening for weeks and my sibling had been simply ignoring his messages. \n\ni feel sick. why would he do this? why would he want to come back into my life? after the terror he put me through? he told me on several occasions that he, in his own words, felt like he was 'the predator' and that i was 'the prey' and it was 'his natural instinct to hunt me down'. he also told me how he had only been coming to hang out at my house because he had been fantasising about me. \n\ni don't know what to do in this situation. all i know is that i'm scared and i feel like i have no one to tell who can truly understand my story or my fears of him trying to pry his way back into my life and into my home. \n\n",

        "selftext": "Teen Nightmare\n\nThis happened many years ago I don't want anyone to get in trouble or press charges I just need to finally be able to speak about what happened.  I was 17 at the time and I volunteered as a Sheriff explorer during this time I met a deputy who in the beginning was really nice to me. I had just graduated high-school but my 18th birthday wasnt until a few months later. I was scheduled to go on a ride along we were required to go on patrol at least once every three months or so and he volunteered to take me on this day. This first time went fine I was super shy but he got me to open up, he talked about himself and asked me about what my plans were after graduating. It wasn't until the second time I went on patrol with him around a month later that things took a turn, I knew he had a girlfriend she was only two years older me, but this time around he started talking about how things were rocky between them. I didn't think much of it I thought he was just venting and no harm done. However  he was being super touchy and was flirting and at that time I was too shy to say anything. He ended up kissing me out of nowhere and he just smiled and said he needed to know if I was attracted to him. I'm not going to lie I was, he was good looking but I asked him about his girlfriend he said she wouldn't care. He offered to take me home after the shift and he did but not before he ended up taking me to an abandoned field and said he just wanted to talk. We ended up making out in his car and i told him i didnt want to have sex that it was as far as i would go he said it was fine but kept pushing and pressuring for more. He said if i really had feelings for him i would be willing to go all the way. He took me home after about an hour and explicitedly told me that if i was asked by any other deputy to just say were friends. I liked how special he made me feel and the red flags were there but i honestly  thought he wouldnt force me to have sex with him since  at that point he did stop when i told  him to even if he continued to ask. From this point on whenever I would patrol with him things would go further. Until finally one day after my 18th birthday he said he would take me home but instead he  hopped on the freeway towards his apartment. I was scared but at that point I felt speaking up would get me abandoned somewhere unfamiliar or worse. We made it to his place and he gave me a beer and led me to his bedroom. I felt like I couldn't say no he told me to relax that I would like it that it was just my nerves. We ended having sex but I finally was able to tell him he needed to stop that he was hurting me but all he would say was just let me finish its OK you'll like it in a minute. No amount of pleading worked until he finally rolled off me. By then I was shaking and oddly felt numb about the whole thing. He took me home and again told me to say we were just friends. He would lose his job if anyone found out making me feel guilty. I ended up quitting the program a few months later and foud out he was being investigated for misconduct on a whole different issue. I regret keeping quiet but at the time I was confused and developed feelings for him. Other deputies became suspicious since they noticed he would go out of his way to talk to me but no one ever asked me personally if anything happened. I know this is long and confusing but it feels good to finally speak about it I've held this in for 16 years. I had posted and then deleted I freaked out a bit that it was shared but if it helps anyone else in a similar situation so they speak up then it is what it is. Also for clarity he was nine years older than me.",

        "selftext": "Very long and emotional story short (or as short as I can get it):\n\n&gt;**0-13** \\- I grew up a daddy's girl. I love my father with my whole heart and cherish his presence. I am inherently anxious and suffer from undiagnosed AUDHD, anxiety disorder and depression, but it doesn't affect me as much because my family is loving and kind.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;**13** \\- My mother and I caught my father cheating on her. He told us he stopped and that he was sorry.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;**13-15** \\- I didn't talk to my father directly, as I felt betrayed and hurt. This was made worse when my mother kept trying to stand up for him. (I later learnt she was trying to stop the mistress from contacting my father so that she and him could work on their relationship)\n\n&gt;**14** \\- My mother is diagnosed with cancer, but they cant tell what kind or how far along it is.  My father grows even more distant from us, and the arguments increase.\n\n&gt;**15-16** \\- My mother is hospitalized and my father starts talking to this woman on his phone. I start to feel more anxious. My mother advocates for my father, but it just makes me more mad and hurt. They argue more now, and I find myself becoming emotionally distant from my father.\n\n&gt;**Late 16** \\- My mother dies and I shut down, as well as shut myself off from my family, friends and peers. I am angry at my father as he does not seem as affected and was also the cause of my mother's stress before she died. My older brother tries to soothe me and we traumabond. My father tries to relate to me, as his mother died a few months before mine, but he doesn't understand that it isn't the same.\n\n&gt;My father 'dates', moves in and then marries a woman I have never met in less than 8 months. His friends, my trusted adults, all support him, as well as his family and peers. I am hurt, but I pass it off as him just grieving differently. I was sure it was a phase and that they would break up/divorce soon enough. I later find out, its the same woman he cheated on my mother with, lied to us about, and then continued to talk to while my mother was battling cancer. I confront him about this and he says that he thought I knew who she was (despite us never being formally introduced to her. To this day, I know next to nothing about her. Only her first name, where her mother lives, and the name of one of her children.)\n\n&gt;Father's wife is emotionally and verbally abusive towards me and my brother, but I, being the younger and more emotional one, take it harder.\n\n&gt;She tells me that I'm *killing my father* by arguing with him, and that *he will end up dead, just like my mother*. I yell back at her to defend my father, as I take it very seriously when someone wishes death upon another (even indirectly), but my father takes her side and berates me for defending him.\n\n&gt;He does a myriad of other things; threatening to sell off my cats, locking them outside and causing one to die from the cold as punishment for me not agreeing with him, as well as pretending not to hear when his wife flat out threatens to kill me. He was right next to her when she said it, mind you.\n\n&gt;Under the advice of my older cousin from my moms side, I report the wife to the CPS but he denies hearing her threaten me to the social workers, which makes me look like an emotional teenage girl. We get placed into family therapy, but the therapist is borderline sexist and just wants us to be a family unit, regardless of the woman's blatant disregard for my safety.\n\n&gt;I ask my father why he's choosing his wife's needs over the safety of his biological children, whom he claims to adore, and he simply says that ***\"the Bible says wife before children\".*** I'd argue that doesn't apply to 'wife that you cheated on your children's mother with and who threatens you children', but okay, dad.\n\n&gt;I sleep with a knife under my pillow, just in case she tries to harm me. My anxiety and depression levels are through the roof.\n\n&gt;**17 - 19** \\- I cant remember much from these years, but it mostly involves me trying to bond with my father, as he's the last living parent I have. I go through 3 relationships, and have no one to talk to or seek comfort from when it goes downhill. My father thinks we're getting better because of him, and not because of the gigantic effort and emotional stuffing-down I'm doing as even being near his wife makes me anxious to the point of insomnia.  \nAs angry as I was before, I still love my father and want him in my life. I tell him that he can pick any other wife, just not her, and I would be genuinely happy with that. He doesn't care, and only treats me well when she's not there (away on vacation or at her mother's house). When she is around, though, he is more distant, and visibly more tense.\n\n&gt;**20** \\- My father announced that he wants to split our house physically (half of it is to go to me and my brother, as it was built when my mother was alive and she paid for and designed it). I tell him that I don't want him to do it, as it will just drive us further apart, but his reasoning revolves around his wife and her comfort. My brother and I have long assumed that his wife is just with him to benefit from his money, she doesn't treat him nicely, but he doesn't seem to notice.\n\nI know its childish and naïve, but I didn't want him to distance himself from me, even though he has hurt me so much for so long. I still cry (I've actually just stopped crying as I'm typing this) whenever I think about how far we've already drifted apart.\n\nOur relationship went from one of trust, smiles, secret fast-food lunch breaks and long hugs... to me not even being able to tell him about the girl that broke my heart, and how I would love to have one genuine dad-hug from him so that he can tell me its alright. I would love to have him at my wedding one day, but I don't know if that will ever happen.\n\nI don't want to grow up, not in a world where he dies alone and regretful, but it seems that that's the only way for me to not end up living my entire life clinging to his leg, begging him to look back and maybe love me the way he used to.\n\nSo ***I'm done***. I'm done wanting his love and I'm done waiting on him to realise he was wrong, and that I still needed him.\n\n*I'm* going to be *something*, and *I'm* going to *love someone* and *let them love me in return*.\n\n***I deserve better.***\n\n***TLDR:*** My father has hurt me with his actions and his words for too long. I'm going to learn how to live without him, no matter how much it will hurt to let him go.",

        "selftext": "Sorry in advance for this being DENSE with context and a little bit nonsequential at the end but its necessary to me understand the gravity of this, I think.  \n  \nMy mother was raped by my grandfather when she was 26. He was 60, but strong. My brother and I were 5 and 8 at the time and we were in the house when it happened. I vaguely remember the screaming and having to be temporarily resituated at a friend's house until my mom found out where to go. Two of my uncles showed up, one kept grandpa restrained while the other spoke to the police. I think one of them threatened to kill him or something but regardless he never saw the inside of a cell for it. I still don't know why (more on that later). He has ZERO criminal record except for vehicular manslaughter (the young woman's underwear was found in a nearby field and she knew our family), for which he spent some time in a mental hospital. My mother told me he was observed to have had antisocial personality disorder but I'm not sure how she would know that because he would never tell her something like that. This is a man that says shit like \"I've never been depressed in my life, I don't even know what that is.\" Anyway, we moved somewhere so he couldn't find us. Problem there is Grandpa had a stalking habit so he found us after few months. You have to understand my brother and I were in no position to understand what happened, or at least that is reasonable enough of an assumption that mom didn't tell us what happened. All I knew was Grandpa wasn't around anymore and that I missed him (despite abuse of my brother and I up to this point, which I will get to). \n\nOnce he found us he would spoil my brother and I to gain favor and make it harder for my mom to keep him out of our lives, a pattern that would persist indefinitely. My mom saved up money during Move1, and we relocated to an \"aunt's\" house. She was a close friend of my mother's that was stalked by my grandfather prior to all of this. The \"aunt\" was also a pedophile. I was too young to understand that the teenagers she was messing around with were not adults. My mom was too traumatized to worry about anything other than feeding us, loving us, and killing the pain on her downtime with pills and partying. She balanced it well and her recreational activities never interfered with us beyond waking us up in the middle of the night for a taco bell run so we wouldn't be left alone in the house. Somewhere in there he found us again, because of the stalking bit.\n\nDuring this time he sank his claws deeper into my big brother and I. Christmases and birthdays were always huge to us both because, even though we were poor, we were spoiled senseless by grandpa *AND* by my mother's dogged determination to outshine his efforts. She had to spend every one of those Christmases and birthdays watching us thank and hug him in front of her, telling him we loved him.   \n  \nAfter a few years of living in that creepy shithole, my mom made enough to move again. She even wrangled us a stepdad for security. SPOILER he loved crack and bullying us. However he was young (27) and deeply troubled himself. He actually kind of kept grandpa at bay for a minute but we still LOVED grandpa so much. Our fathers never met us, between my brother and I, so there was a sort of role that needed fulfilling, which was another reason she was scared to tell us what happened. During this time my grandfather was abusing me by interrogating me about whether or not I was gay and forcing me in front of the mirror to pop my acne until I bled and the acne became infected. My pockmarks are much worse than they need to be and he reinforced a lifelong belief in my hideousness and I was made to go to therapy at the age of 10 to address my latent homosexual tendencies. What prompted his obsession, I do not know. I think he was scarred from when I wanted to be a girl for Halloween 3 years in a row from ages 3 to 6\n\nA few years after Move3 came Move4, but it at this point my mom considered losing contact with him to be futile. She would move further and further each time and he would constantly show up unannounced. At this point I'm in middle school, brother in high school. During this time my 15 year old brother kicked my stepfather out, so my grandfather was around much more often so he could pressure me intensely to be confirmed Catholic (our family is heavily Irish Catholic) This would eventually cause me to have a psychotic break later at 15 where I had religious delusions for a whole year.\n\nAround the time I finished high school my mom met my now stepmother and we moved 100 miles away. Which was perfect considering grandpa would have an accident that made it harder for him to want to drive on the highway ever again. The last time he saw my mother's face was at her wedding 15 years ago. I would say his presence tarnished it, but it was full of drag queens and LGBTQ+ folks so I like to think it was a difficult day for him (the man is a vicious bigot).\n\nThis is around when mom tells me about how he raped her when she was 26.  I'm 19 at this point and I have been conditioned to worship my grandfather. He was my father for all intents and purposes, more than any other man in my life. I was resistant and resentful. I was stupid. I buried what my mother told me and it created a rift between us that is since mended but it is one of my deepest regrets.\n\nMy *absolute deepest regret* is moving in with him. Move5 left me in a rural town with only a grocery store to work down the street and I had no car or license. TIP FOR YOUR KIDS: Do not let them get away with thinking they are better than working their way out of a situation, or that they won't be grateful to themselves for it. Anyway, I wanted to go to college and grandpa lived in Baltimore. He offered to let me stay and I told my mother I loved her but I couldn't get stuck in that town (I wasn't stuck, I was undisciplined and ignorant). I will never forget my mother's crying face as I left in *his* car. So I guess *that* is the last time he saw her. \n\nFrom 2012 onward I was living in Baltimore, going to school, working, partying and going on trips with friends. I was having a merry fucking time, and rent free to boot (undisciplined). Somewhere in the first 2 years I did mushrooms and I gained a bone-deep certainty of how awfully I had betrayed my mother. I called her and apologized for everything, begged for her forgiveness. I didn't have to, because she understood. Then she told me EVERYTHING EVERYTHING. Not just about her rape, but the vicious abuse of her 6 other siblings, the rape and physical assault of my grandmother, and the manslaughter. \n\n**Out of her 7 siblings, 2 brothers defended her (after the rape) initially. One said that grandpa was dead to him but reconnected only 3 years later. The other just plain acted like it didn't happen even though he was the one keeping grandpa at bay while we left the house. When my mom told her sisters, 2 were silent, one acknowledged that my mother was traumatized, and the one I hate the most said \"He must have been so lonely.\" The remaining 2 brothers kissed his feet like they always have without skipping a beat. They still do.**\n\n**My grandfather viciously beat every single one of his children. He beat and raped my grandmother, and put a gun to her head with his foot on her neck. An uncle tried to defend my grandmother with a bat, grandpa caught it mid-swing, and completely blackened my uncle's torso. He coerced a neighbor's wife to crawl across the floor to him to ask for a kiss in front of the neighborhood and *his own wife and children* at a party. He hit me and my brother for as long as he and I were too young to defend ourselves, at least until we acted like he wanted. He beat me for bleeding on the floor when I cut myself by mistake at age 3.  I was hit and screamed at if I cried. At age 5 I watched him choke my then 8 brother, like it was Bart and Homer, for correcting his math. He stalked my mother's friends and called them in the middle of the night to say disgusting shit. He then raped my mother for god knows fucking what when I was 5. I have no idea what else he's done to my aunts and uncles.**  \n  \nI'm suspicious that he did something to me too because I was absurdly sexually obsessive when I was 4 and 5. By obsessive I mean I cornered a girl when I was in kindergarten and tried to rip off her clothes while screaming \"You're mine\". Where did those instincts come from? How often do 5 year olds do that?  \n  \nSo I was drinking pretty heavily after what my mom told me, enough to keep me from being able to move out from my mom's rapist's house, and then I met my current partner in 2018. Like everyone I was with up til that point, I begged her not to be friendly with him and I told her why. She has some sort of hyperaltruistic reflex, plus her grandfather treats her like shit so she just made my grandpa her grandpa. After I begged her not to get close to him. He then exposed himself to her multiple times and whispered \"something disgusting\" into her ear that to this day she will not repeat. I know it wasn't age because when I confronted him on this, he never did it again. Between 2018 and 2023 I was basically killing myself with booze about this and a lot of things. 5 hospitalizations in 2023. \n\nMy mom confronted the one that said \"he must be so lonely\" and she said none of those things happened. My grandmother can corroborate however and has. \n\nI'm posting this, one, because apart from my partner, I have no one to talk to about it. I'm not looking for moral validation, I know how badly I hurt my mother and what it says about me. Grandpa is 91 now and I think it's fair to say most of who he was is gone. I don't forgive, I see it as irrelevant to who is now.  He's a scared husk that's been glued to a chair since 2008.  I tried so hard to be a changed person in sobriety got into the habit of hugging him and telling him I love him, but by the time I realized it makes me feel slimy, I couldn't afford to stop. My mom knows this and she is, according to her, at greater peace with everything than me.\n\nMy present disquiet comes from the constant thoughts like \"WHAT KIND OF BROTHERS AND SISTERS DON'T DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO PROTECT THEIR SISTER? There were 7 of them and they left us for the wolf. There were 7 of them that never EVER let grandpop babysit their kids. WHY HUH? WHY CAN HE COME AROUND US AND NOT YOURS? Why are we the \"black sheep\"? Why did no one believe my mother after what they've been through?* I have an uncle that still tells me he has always loved me, he's my godfather and the sensible one and he has the fucking BALLS to ask me why mom doesn't talk to him anymore. \n\nLast year every single one of my mother's siblings gathered to celebrate his 90th birthday. *Two of my mother's sisters are sitting on his lap in a photo they took together.* The one that said \"he must have been so lonely\" is so pleased with herself in the photo. Recently she told me I was the favorite grandchild of his 9,000 grandchildren, and she looked like she's hated me for it for a while. I wasn't the *favorite*, I was a pressure point for a predator to make sure my mother could never get away.\n\nNone of these people have any idea that I know. Neither does grandpa. Neither do their children. They just think I'm a lazy alcoholic (part true). Been thinking about writing a book. But also I just needed this. If anyone can relate or just have some insight as to how in the fuck 7 siblings side with the incestuous predator and abuser. What's worse is how I've found this to be far less unique than I thought. I know more people than I would like that have relevant experience with men growing families as punching bags and sex objects. Every kid I see makes me worry for them, and I have a hard time seeing a father with their children and not have an immediate fear for the kids.\n\nTLDR; Seriously? Just kidding. Grandpa raped my mom and stalked her, my brother and I through life and I eventually ended up marooning myself in the same basement where he did all of the worst things you can do to a person while his children treat my mom with denial and even resentment.\n\nP.S.  \nMy mother is the strongest and happiest she's ever been and I love her and my stepmother so much. She has chronic illness and PTSD but she is creating all the time and excelling at her work. I've never been more proud of her. My brother is the same as he's always been, stoic and quiet about all of it in a way that scares me.\n\nP.P.S.  \nMy aunts and uncles have been snooping while I'm at work and leaving obvious signs they were in my fucking bedroom. Where I fucking sleep. If you are reading this, good. You should be fucking ashamed of yourself. You were all in your fucking thirties and were successful when you shielded her attacker. You had the resources to help your sister and put the man away. You chose her rapist over her. You're not the Christians you say you are, you're not good people, you're psychotic lowlifes whose kids don't really know them (some of them know, just not exactly *how* spineless and mindless *yet*). No wonder your daughter calls you by your first name like that. To the other, no wonder your daughter doesn't call you at all. For all of you, it is not close enough to karma that you have to literally wipe that man's ass now. You seemed like you would've jumped at the opportunity to *swallow* his shit at the rate you guys sided with him. Still thinking about that book.\n\nEDIT: For various grammatical/spelling errors and weird slashes. (I know still can't comma)",

For example, before we even started really interacting, he brought me napkins when I spilled something. Since then, we always say hello, how are you, etc. But I've always gotten the impression that he's self-conscious about... a lot of things. His scent is not ideal and, as I mentioned above, his English isn't great, and not everybody in the world is understanding about those things. \n\nToday, he seemed to feel more comfortable with me than ever before. He came over, said hello, and *sat down near me for the first time*. I tried to use Google Translate to communicate, but he needs glasses and couldn't read the text, so we just tried our best.\n\nIt was the most complex discussion we've had so far. We discussed politics! This is what he has to say on the current situation (I'm trying my best to remember precisely what he said):\n\n\"Politics... bad, bad things. Politics hurt people. Mexicans, woman, good people. Social Security? Medicaid?\" (I assume he was expressing worry about the continued existence of both programs.) \n\nI just wish I could speak Persian so we could understand each other better. It's clear that his life in America hasn't gone the way he must have hoped it would when he came here, and I'm extra worried about him now. \n\nAnyway, when he needed to leave, I gave him a big hug.

        "selftext": "I have to get something off my chest, it's been bothering me for a while.\n\nDepartment of Children's Services (Australia) are the most incompetent, useless, stupid government agency I've ever had the displeasure of working with, whom I'm sure hire only the worst and dimmest of candidates and have fostered a culture of ineptitude and apathy throughout the system. \n\nI have nothing but complete and utter contempt for the department and their so called social workers, as I can say truthfully and without hyperbole or exaggeration that I have not seen them make a good call on a child or family situation in the 30 years I've been cursed with their association.\n\nI am a psych and behavioural analyst and run a disability and aged care support company in remote Queensland. I am involved with the department because I provide therapeutic placement for children with disabilities. My company, as best as I can tell, is one of the very few with capacity for kids with serious behaviours of concern, certainly the only one that I am aware of in my or any surrounding regions, judging by how far some kids come to be placed with us.\n\nThe ignorance on display from DoCs staff is breathtaking. They don't listen. They don't understand disability, which to be fair, I don't really expect them to, not really, but they just are not willing to learn. Somehow the decisions they make seem tailored to be cruel and hurtful to parents for no good reason and they are openly hostile and dismissive to families they have independently decided they don't like.\n\nVague examples for privacy:\n\nSingle mother with 5 month old baby. Has 2 other children in placement. Meetings for one occur in Town A. Meetings for the other occur in Town B. She lives in City C. The meetings are set for 8am for one, and 9am for the other.\nTown A is 90km (56mi) from City C, and Town B is 107km (66mi) from City C. Town B is 193km (119mi) from Town A.\nShe has no car, and relies entirely on public transport to get around. This is utterly impossible.\n\nThere is a department office 7 minutes from her house by bus.\nThey flat put refused to entertain the idea of having meetings at that office, or even just Zoom meetings. She had to attend in person. Every failure was used as evidence of inability to manage her time, and proof she shouldn't have her children.\n\nChild with serious behaviours of concern (violence, property destruction, suicide ideation) who was surrendered by family was placed with us on short notice because previous two placements claimed no capacity. (Probably because of the damages combined between the two of them). No behavioural plan was supplied, despite them having one and being requested for 7 weeks, in the end I had to go behind their backs and track down the practitioner that wrote it myself. DoCs *severely* downplayed the behaviours upon placement, and frankly if we weren't so good at our jobs and able to adjust so fast, serious harm absolutely could have happened due to the lack of accurate information provided. We got lucky those first few weeks.\n\nTheir sole focus is on reunification with the family. Their solution was to force them together every weekend. No support, no plan, just shove a violent individual in a house with a shellshocked family for 2 and a half days, the siblings of which actively (and with good reason) do not want them there, for a couple of days and hope for the best.\nWhen sexual assault claims were made by a sibling, DoCs *ignored it* and tried to push for the next weekend anyway. It took a call to Children's Safety who in turn made a stern call to DoCs for them to decide against that decision for a weekend.\n\nI sat with the case workers and supervisors and went through the complex disabilities and mental health issue for this individual and explained what realistically needed to happen for reunification. What to expect. A recommendation for steps to take moving forward. I thought it went well. A follow up meeting with the school a mere 2 hours later and the case worker said that a fidget spinner should keep them occupied for 4 hours and thus solve the school attendance issues.\nMoronic. No attention paid whatsoever. \n\nThey openly blame the parents, their lack of parenting for the issues. Stay at home dad, mum has a pretty unusual job that has her travel often but pays very well. They mock her in meetings, talking about how she's \"living her best life\" on \"holidays\" when she's away for a week, working.\n\nI am so frustrated. They are now looking at foster care options. Removal from a therapeutic placement where they have made real progress, (for example, nearly $100k in damages, zero school attendance between 2 placement over 3 months, compared to us where we have had maybe $500 in damages and school attendance every day at first with support and now independently between an hour and 4 hours and we have had them for 6 months) to be put with some unsuspecting and unqualified family for $700 a week. Absolute madness.\n\nI just want to scream into the void. The family is actively working with us, the school is actively working with us, but DoCs... DoCs don't give a shit. And they hold the cards. They claim they care, but when it comes to complex disability they actively ignore vital information and forge ahead like it was a typical kid, damn everyone else.\n\nSorry, I got a bit ranty. They just piss me off so much.",

        "selftext": "basically what the title says. I've slowly lost sensitivity since we got married 4 years ago. I thought at first it was due to my depression, so I got therapy. Then, after overcoming depression, I was still experiencing very low/nonexistent libido, no sensitivity, nothing. It didn't matter if I was on my antidepressants or not, before, during, and after it was about the same. I used to be able to enjoy sex, and finish, but now I can't even remember the last time I finished at all. (No I'm not interested in masturbation, nor has that ever done anything to me). My husband has gotten mad at me over the years and accused me of being asexual or lesbian, which I don't think is the case because I KNOW I am sexually attracted to men and not women, and I've experienced normal sexual response cycles many times before, especially as a teen. I did save myself for marriage, if that makes any difference. I then thought, well maybe it's not my depression, maybe it's sexual trauma from seeing and hearing my parents doing it a lot after they always told me sex was bad? (religious upbringing) and so I went to a sex therapist, and she said she couldn't help me. I had another therapist after that who I really liked and helped with everything else in my life except my ability to enjoy sex/ have a sex repsonse cycle despite thoroughly discussing that topic and my traumatizing experiences as a child with my parents. I went to my primary care doctor and he basically told me there were no meds except one that costs $1000 a dose and only has a 10% chance of working. He did blood work on my hormone levels and those were all normal. so basically no one can help me and it leads to dissatisfaction on both sides of this relationship, and makes me so sad. I feel like I should just divorce my husband so he can find a functional woman who can have and enjoy sex with him :( ",

We have a friend group of five since high-school and she's always been the one who has the most other friends outside of the friend group, but we never minded. She has friends from other city and an on and off boyfriend (24M) who's literally the worst human I've ever seen. He's manipulative, controlling, alcoholic with anger issues and he controls who she is friends with, where is she, if she's drinking, etc. He constantly brings up her past before they met and holds it against her. When his friend started hitting on her he blamed HER!! They broke up two weeks ago and we literally celebrated because it felt final. She sent us a 13 minute recording, when they officially ended it, of him just cussing her out, screaming and calling her a slut who doesn't deserve love from anyone, even her parents. He also threatened to kill her dog. Her parents hated him (obviously) so he always talked bad about them.\n\nShe stopped texting us this week but we thought that she was just busy.

So, 40 something minutes ago, i woke up to him touching me again. And just like before, I did nothing.\n\nI wanted to move, to scream, to do something. But my body wouldn’t listen. It was like my brain had shut down, leaving me frozen in place. so I just lay there, pretending to sleep, trying not to make a sound. and he eventually stopped.\n\nWhen he finally rolled over and pretended to sleep, I slowly turned away, pulling my blanket tighter around me. I wanted to cry, but the tears wouldn’t come. I just stared at the wall and stayed there for about 20mins and got up to write this. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know how to make it stop.\nI just wish I could disappear. \n\nPLEASE give me advice on what to do. im literally crying rn because i couldn't defend myself. I just feel so icky about this\n\n\n\n\n\n**EDIT:**\nThank you so so much for the amount of advice you guys gave me and for reassuring me that freezing is a completely normal reaction to these kind of situations.\n\nim planning on asking my mom if i could maybe sleep in her room because im not \"comfortable w sleeping in the same room as my brother\" but im currently staying at my friends house to maybe just clear my thoughts about this whole situation.\n\nMany people are saying to \"Set up a camera and record the whole situation\" But im not gonna do that because i don't wanna experience that situation again.\n\nAlso just to clarify; no, i am not indian. i'm japanese. We live in a 2 bedroom apartment that's why me and my brother share the same room.

        "selftext": "hello! i hope im not going against any rules by posting this.   \ni intially wanted to post this to try and figure out how to turn this personal letter into an artistic creative thing that i can put out into the world, but for now, its just a letter that is true off my chest.\n\nthis is a letter i have sent a friend/lover that is very important to me. we have a weird, secretive relationship dynamic, somewhat of a situationship but much more communicative and relationshipy. its weird. the letter talks about it a little bit. the thing is, after he read it, he told me that the letter was personal, authentic, and very beautiful, that i should think about maybe doing something with it in the future-(creatively, he meant, we are both creative people, studied creative writing together, that’s how we met)  \n  \nanyways here’s the letter, keep in mind it is translated as it is originally in a different language:)\n\n”Hi \n\nthis letter contains things that are important to me that you know.\n\nEvery time I initiate a hang out with you to talk about things, I end up not saying everything I want to say, maybe because I forget, or feel better at that moment when I'm with you, and don't want to create a worse mood for either you or me again, /don't want to be a burden, so I end up not saying anything and end up regretting and getting upset when things don't work out between us.\n\nSo I want to take a moment here and write to you everything I can remember that I usually think and feel about us, and hope that with all the recoil you probably get from this letter, you can also take a moment of your time and read without too much pressure of responding quickly.\n\nI want to start by saying that you are a person who is very, very important to me. I have said it many times and I have no problem saying it again, simply because it is true: you are the first person that I have ever felt true, pure love. a feeling that I thought people invent in movies, that made me think it was not something that was even possible to feel. You made me feel it. It is real.\n\nYou know how sentimental and emotional I am, it is very easy for me to look at a picture of us from a month ago and feel nostalgic because I miss a specific day that I had a really nice time with you. Like for example on your birthday, when you invited me to sleep over at your place and told me that I was really cute and that you wanted to kiss me in front of everyone. These are things that are hard for me to forget and I hope I never forget because it makes my heart feel good. Sometimes I am completely reluctant to mention things like this or talk about it at all because the fact that I talk about it means that in moments like these have a lot of weight. It makes me very vulnerable and it's scary, I prefer not to mention any good moment we had, not to say I love you, not to say I miss something that happened two days ago, and that way if you don't say something nice back, I won't be offended by it, I won't think it's not mutual, I won't think I'm taking everything too personally and that for you I'm just another person to have fun with every now and then. even though i know if it was just fun it would have ended a long time ago for you. But I choose to say it anyway, because I want you to at least know how much good you can do, even if you don't mean to. I choose to get hurt a little every now and then.\n\nI think you are very talented You write in a way that is very impulsive, for better or worse. In the pieces you wrote, it is very clear that what you write comes from that moment deep inside, and it is not calculated, it is simply what is happening in your heart at that second, and you bring it out. Another talent you have is the way you get to know people. Something that I am very jealous of, but I feel I am lucky to experience it as a friend, and even learn from you. You ask bizarre questions that no one thinks to ask, go into strange depths, and we would sometimes laugh at you at that moment in class because it is really very funny that you ask things that no one thinks are interesting enough, but it is a trait that I appreciate very much. I think that I will move here in this letter between things that you might be flattered by and things that you have a chance of being offended by, It is important for me to point out that it is okay to be offended just as it is okay to be flattered by everything I write, but you should know that everything I write is things that I think and feel. There are no facts here. And there is not even a single intention to hurt.\n\nIf I could, I would write this in a letter and bring it to you physically, but right now we are after a not very pleasant interaction that was on through messages, as there is every now and then between us. And right now I am not in the mood to see you because I feel like I will cry and I will not be able to say anything coherent.\n\nMaybe I am too sensitive and take everything too hard. Maybe you love me but don't like me very much and sometimes try to hurt me. It could be both.\n\nSometimes I feel like you really want to hurt me. That you know exactly what combination of words will hurt me the most, and you choose them specifically. I don't think it's bad intentions. I think it's more of you trying to defend yourself. Maybe I say things that I think come out well, but they hurt you, and then you, who feel attacked, try to attack back, because that way you'll have the power, and you can hurt and leave. Sometimes we encounter a situation of unpleasant messages and at the peak you'll say something like you're gonna stop answering me, or something more cynical-passive aggressive to imply to me that you're not going to answer anymore no matter what I say. Sometimes I'm in a good mood, and after a conversation like that with you i get very sad in a restless way, like i have to talk it out. And when you cut off at the peak of this conversation, I have no way to explain anymore, no way to resolve, no way to do anything. All that's left for me is to sit with myself, with the feelings I have about myself, about how much I may have hurt you with the words I used incorrectly, about how much I want you to understand that I don't think such bad things about you. And to sit with myself, with the feelings I have for you, that with how much I love you, you are the person who most manages to hurt my most sensitive points.\n\nOnce in a conversation of this style, you managed to throw into the air that it would be better if we ended the relationship.\n\nAfter that, when we met and I mentioned it, you said that you said it in the heat of the moment, and that you didn't really mean it.\n\nI think you did mean it, just, at that moment. And then at some point when we managed to talk and get along again, you regretted meaning it. I think that both of these situations are correct, and that they don't necessarily contradict each other.\n\nSometimes I really have thoughts like, 'Wow, maybe I should really end this relationship.'\" Sometimes I feel like the relationship with you is doing me a lot more harm than good. Sometimes I feel like you hate me. Detest me. And maybe you stay in touch with me because it's easier than breaking up. And maybe that's true sometimes, I don't know. But I also don't think it necessarily contradicts other good feelings you might have for me sometimes. In any case, I can understand. There's not a single person in the world that I can say 100% that will never get on my nerves, accidentally hurt me, get tired of them. and I also told you, I think that if I spend enough time with anyone, at some point I'll want to not be around them. On the other hand, you're one of the only people I prioritize spending time with. And the only person I want to be around even if I'm very hurt and we're not at our best terms.\n\nI think something happened the day we started hooking up for the first time. That day I went out with you and a friend for a walk in the city, we went into your old school, the friend stayed outsid. we were left with just you, with the stories and experiences you had there, with all the nostalgia from there, and I was there, and listened to you, and I really enjoyed experiencing something sentimental with you. A big part of your life you spent there, and then I was there with you and somehow managed to be a small part of all of it. of you.\n\nLater that day, after we hooked up, when you walked me to the train, and we were both very nervous because we had arranged to meet the next day, but we were both afraid that suddenly we wouldn't want to meet again when the time came. Because we both had that similar problem. that weird avoidant way of dealing with life. And then the next day came, we still wanted to, and it happened, and it didn't exactly stop for a very long time.\n\nUsually when I want someone, as soon as they show interest in me back, I stop wanting them. It didn't happen with you. You shared your flaws with me and not only did I identify with a lot of them, but it only drew me in more. I really fell in love with a person, and not just an idea. I think that's why it's so easy for me to get hurt by you.\n\nI love you very much. The whole person that you are. I'm very attracted to you. Physically, emotionally, mentally. In just about every way.\n\nWhat you think of me, how you think of me, is very important to me. I really care about you and your opinions. Sometimes you say things about me, that you think I'm not intelligent, or things like that, I say very directly that these are things that hurt me. Insult me. You take it more lightly, and with a laugh, and with a certain detachment towards me and how I feel. I think you might have the feeling that you're above me in all sorts of ways. That you have more power over certain things. That your opinions are more important or true than mine. And that facts are perhaps more important or true than my feelings. Sometimes you are the most sensitive person in the world, looking for a hug, love, intimacy, making me laugh when I'm not feeling well. And sometimes you treat me as if you are a person who doesnt know how to be a friend. That you have no ability to understand or contain my difficulty, my feelings.\n\nI think a lot of it is also my fault. Every time I told you that you were crossing a certain line, that's all it was. I tell you that you're crossing a line, And that's it, there were no consequences beyond that. I say my piece, carry on as usual as always, and then it repeats itself. Again things are said, again I'm offended, again I don't want to talk to you again in my life, and then I come back to you the second there's a chance, because I want you in my life. It's like I'm giving up a lot of myself, so that I can feel good, sometimes, with you.\n\nI'll say something now that if it wasn't clear before, it can be very recoiling and disgusting to hear, at least for me- My relationship with you, and you, in general, is very addictive to me. I'm addicted to you. You feel like a drug to me and I can't find a better or worse way to say it, that's how it feels to me. When I'm with you and everything is good, everything is the best in the world. When it's bad, it's very bad.\n\nthere was another time, at some day, I was at your place I think a few days after we agreed not to sleep together anymore.- of course we met and slept together because how could we not): There was one moment, you put your head on my chest as if I were a pillow. we just sat like that in bed for an hour, cuddling, calm, comfortable, quiet, pleasant.\n\nWhy do I get so hung up on these moments?\n\nIt's like if I'm not bipolar enough on my own, there's another layer of bipolarity in our relationship.\n\nI remember especially at the beginning of this relationship, when I was at your place and I felt so nice and comfortable, I didn't want it to end simply because it was the peak of the day for me. The moment I had to go home, just being on the drive back home, alone, sleeping alone, suddenly that was the lowest point of my life.\n\nI've slept alone my whole life. Why does it feel so heavy now?\n\nIt's like craving you helped me survive a little longer, every time. And this is the most unhealthy thing I've ever experienced, and the most disgusting thing I've ever said. It's embarrassing to admit it at all, especially when I'm sure it's not mutual.\n\nFor a very long time I was emotionally dependent on you, like if you were in a good mood it would be great for me, but if you were feeling bad and would withdraw from the world, I could easily take it personally. Because when I'm in a bad mood, I still want to be near you. I still want to talk to you. And it's disgusting to me. Why is it different only with you? Why am I not interested in sleeping with anyone, except you? Why did I think for years that I wasn't interested in sex at all and that I could easily live without it, and then after I met you, I became a nymphomaniac? Why can I just say bye to people and leave without a hug, but with you this intimacy is so important to me? I don't even have one answer really I have no idea why it's like this\n\nOn the one hand I think, if I kept my distance from you, I would get used to being without you, it would have been hard at first, but little by little I would stop wanting anything like this with you, and then maybe I would be able to quit you. On the other hand, You're funny You love Why would I keep my distance just because it's a little hard sometimes?\n\nI'm in these dilemmas every now and then But I really don't want to lose touch with you\n\nSometimes I think you don't see or appreciate things I do for you, take me for granted. Why not, actually? you said so yourself, no matter when you text me, I will answer. if you need a favor, i will do it. if you want me to come to you and be with you, there will never be a situation in life where I will say no. I haven't given you a single reason to make you think that I'm not simply there whenever you need or want. So maybe it's my fault. Maybe I'm too accessible, not enough hard to get. and it's too convenient, it's easy to take it for granted, I don't know.\n\nMaybe you'll read all of this and think I'm a psycho, Tell me that you think it would be best and most worthwhile to end the relationship, and I'll understand from that, that you don't want anything to do with me, and I'll be offended, and we'll never talk again, and all that this relationship will be is some cute memories from time to time that are accompanied by a bad taste from how it ended.\n\nMaybe you'll read all of this and say nothing, pretend you never got it, maybe you'll even see that you got this letter, tell yourself wow this is really long I'll get to it someday, and forget about ever getting to it.\n\nMaybe you'll read this and tell me what you think and feel too. Share your side. Tell me that everything is okay, it's okay what I feel, it's okay that I'm an addicted psycho, and that I'm too important to you to lose touch with me over stupid things that can be solved in an instant with a little communication and the right mood.\n\nI don't know what you'll choose, but everything is legitimate and I'll understand in the end, even if not at that moment. I love you, I would be happy to talk whenever there is a problem, I just want us to really be able to talk.\n\nI am not here to apologize, and I do not demand any forgiveness from you, Whatever happened was. Do you want us to stay in touch? I would be very happy. Just please try to pay attention, appreciate me, respect boundaries. If situations arise where you feel that I am attacking you, that I am unpleasant, that I am unbearable, that I am repulsive, inconsiderate, offensive, - tell me. Let's talk about it. It doesn't have to be at that moment when you are at your wits' end, you can do it at any moment, but let's try to communicate more healthily and hug after that and be good please:)\n\ni love you”\n\nid like to know your thoughts about this. if it made anyone feel anything, or anythig like that.   \nafter he read this letter he has said that relates, understand, and he was the one to tell me to maybe do something creative about it in the future, i never even thought about it until he sais it, as it was a very personal thing that was meant for his eyes only.  \nthanks for reading:)",

        "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been together for 3months. Before we met he met a girl from a dating app; when we first met then he texted her information about us. Sometimes during dates he would text her constantly and tell me that she is lovey dovey with him saying “thank you for being the brother I never had.” She rejected him from dating app but suggested they be friends. I didn’t say anything initially but as we started getting serious I asked him to delete and stop talking to her. And he did. Fast forward to now, we have had some issues and almost broke up a couple of times. \n\nSome examples of problems include but not limited to incidences when we talk about the future plan and type of children we would have, he says they would have “chinky eyes” because it is a dominant gene. Or when I’m driving he always says “they are probably thinking why is that Chinese driving so terribly.” (I’m not even of Chinese descent btw). Or when I'm going to work and wearing a mask because I didn't want to get others sick, he would say that they would think “that Chinese is spreading covid” when confronted, he would say that he is only saying what the general population is thinking, and I shouldn't take it personally. \n\nRecently, I found that she texted him and they have been referring me as “chinita” (I’m Asian descent and they are Hispanic. Then they would talk about relationship life and sex life, as well as how her mother is doing (she is ill).\n\nWhen I confronted him why he kept saying “I don’t know why I texted back” and that there is nothing going on that is flirtatious. He is now crying profusely apologizing saying he loves me.\n\nIs this emotional cheating? \n\nUpdate 1: he keeps saying “I can’t lose you ur the love of my life I blocked her, and ur my wife”\n\nUpdate 2: he threatened to take his own life when I tried breaking up with him.

        "selftext": "I recently remembered an event from the past, and I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. It happened a long time ago, so it’s possible that what I remember is not exactly what actually happened.\n\nA few years ago, in 2022, when I was 14, I was coming home from school with some friends when an idiot thought it would be funny to open my backpack and ring a doorbell without telling me. Immediately afterward, everyone started running. I quickly zipped up my backpack and, for some reason I don’t remember, I decided to cross the road to the other sidewalk instead of running forward. Maybe it was because there were too many people in front of me, making it difficult to run quickly—I don’t know. I really don’t remember.\n\nThe thing is, as soon as I stepped onto the road, an older man on a motorcycle appeared right in front of me, just a few meters away. I moved away as fast as I could and got back onto the sidewalk where I had been before. I think I remember the driver swerving a little when he got scared after seeing me (though I’m not entirely sure about this). I didn’t hear any noise that would suggest the man had fallen, nor did I hear a scream of pain—just a “¡Me cago en la madre!” (which roughly means “For f***’s sake!” in Spanish), which I believe means he kept driving (I think).\n\nThe problem is that I don’t know if I started running once I stepped back onto the sidewalk, which could have prevented me from noticing an accident if it happened. But it’s more likely that I stayed still after stepping away from the road—at least long enough that I would have noticed if anything had happened. I’m not sure what exactly happened in that moment. It all happened so fast, and it’s been a few years since then.\n\nWhen I saw the idiot who opened my backpack again, all he did was laugh. I guess he saw what happened in some way, and that’s why he made fun of me when we met again. Or maybe I told him about it, and then he started laughing—I don’t remember. I also seem to recall that I had two other friends behind me, on the other side of the road, and when they caught up with us, they were laughing too. If what I remember is correct, that would mean nothing actually happened.\n\nI got home feeling like an idiot, but at no point did I think I might have caused an accident. I’ve walked through that area dozens of times since then, and while I wasn’t specifically looking, I never noticed any signs that an accident had happened. I also searched online for news from that year in my city, and I didn’t find anything similar to what I experienced. I never heard anyone mention that day again, which reinforces my belief that nothing actually happened.\n\nI recently remembered this incident, and I think I’m becoming paranoid. I’m scared by the possibility that the man could have had a serious accident or that someone nearby might have been hurt, since it was a very busy area at that time, with lots of cars and many kids coming back from school. I’ve been really worried for the past few days, and I honestly feel bad about it.\n\nDo you think I’m just being paranoid? I need someone to reassure me—I’m a bit scared.",

On Reddit . \nI had a pretty rough start of the years. \nBoyfriend cheated \nRoomate left our place without telling me. \nLost my friends \nHad to cut off some of my family.  \n\nSo I feel pretty isolated in all this. Anyway I received some good news. \n\nI was approved to follow a work/studies program. Which will allow me to go back to school while still being able to provide for my son and I. \nHe's almost 3 and I just want a better life for us mostly for him. I want to be a special need educator which allows me to work with kids having intellectual deficiencies. It's pretty common in my reservation and I wanna be able to help my community. \nI'll be graduating in a year\nAnd will be off to university by 2026-2027\nI'll be the first in my family to graduate university \nAll whole still being a mom.\n\nI was also approved for an apartment closer to school a d my son's daycare. I won't have to wake up at 4 am get my son ready and be out the door at 5:30. \nAnd hopefully get to work by 7. I take the bus in the morning sometimes I can't help but be late to work cause a bus is late or cancelled. \nI'll be able to do everything by walking.  \nThe landlord lowered the rent for me so instead of 1800$ I'll be paying around 1300$ per month.\n\nI am going to therapy this summer. \nMy older sister will be caring for my son for a whilee month while I work on myself. I went to therapy before but it wasn't as long and intense as the one I'll be going to.  It's 28 days in nature which I like. Everything will be paid off by the government. \n\nI am 21 years old. \nI've been on my own since I was 17. \nI felt like my life was going nowhere till I decided what I wanted to do. \nI can't wait for this new chapter of my life. One I can be proud of. One where my son and I will live struggle free. I am proud of myself. ",

        "selftext": "I’m a woman in my 60s who for the bulk of my adult life has been able to keep and cultivate good relationships with friends, family, and coworkers. I have suffered off and on with depression and anxiety that I felt was bad enough to seek treatment for since my mid 40s. I had no shame in admitting this as it was a difficult time for me given perimenopause, a stressful job, kids heading off to college, etc. \n\nThings really began unraveling for me about a year ago. I had gained a bunch of weight, felt like crap, was facing some unexpected backlash from my two adult kids whom I had raised alone and were each facing their own separate personal crises simultaneously, was helping my widowed, aging mother navigate life alone, and a second new and stronger wave of “ideology” was evolving.\n\nI started therapy for the first time in my life and leaned heavily into journaling out my feelings, as I have a love of writing and my therapist felt it would be helpful for me. I dove right in to a shadow work journal with writing prompts that ask you to relate negative thoughts and feelings you are having now to your childhood, in order to heal your inner child. I have written at length on my memories from early childhood and nothing came forward that I hadn’t pondered before, so no big revelations this time… except for my anger.\n\nAfter a year of processing these events, poking at my anger, examining every piece of it through the lens of this tired and wounded old woman, and having the entire world bursting into flames exponentially more every day, I am at my breaking point. In the past year I have lost my 3 friends to the above mentioned “ideology”, then most of my family, and now, because I am so sad and really suffering from the effects of anger about not only the abuse and neglect I experienced in my past, but the trauma of the problems my entire continent is facing, I’ve got my mother in my face telling me she doesn’t like how it makes her feel that consequences are happening as a result of her actions. Nobody is blaming her for anything, merely mentioning they are losing their job. Or that they are struggling mentally. Or that they’re boycotting hyper consumerism. Or that they’re scared. Or that they feel compelled now to join this movement or become anti-whatever to make a statement and support people who’ve been hurt. She doesn’t like feeling that feeling that comes up when she has to wonder if people actually know her leanings, and maybe even think her actions are causing harm to them. It’s her own thought process guilting her, and outing her at the same time. \n\nIt’s so hard telling this without using certain words that are crucial to the story, but hopefully I’ve avoided the flags that will get this story banned. \n\nNow, I find myself on the verge of lashing out at my 84 year old mother the next time she berates me (I see it coming) because I don’t know if I’ll be able to bite my tongue. I carried for 60 years the memory of her attempted suicide in front of me as a 3 year old, where just before losing consciousness, instructed me how to use a telephone to call for help. She doesn’t think I remember. I protected my mother from her own shame of her daughter carrying this secret knowledge all her life, while enduring beatings from her 2nd husband, repeated emotional betrayals from her, being called a slut every day of my teen life. I was shamed mercilessly for my own emotional problems growing up, and was told I’m not good enough constantly. My own suicidal thoughts at 13 were claimed by her as embarrassing, and would make her look bad. I was never allowed to feel my anger and it caused me to make some really poor choices regarding relationships in my life. \n\nWell that rage has come to life and I think if I express it the way it deserved to be expressed all along, it might kill her. \n\n\n",

Because I have never consumed alcohol so I'm so confused. Anyone tell me please. And do you know what's even more worse?

        "selftext": "Me (21M) and my girlfriend (22F) have been together for 4 months now. After the first 2 months I started to notice and understand better all the things she has to deal with in her head, bad experiences in past relationships that affected her deeply and left her with traumas that are now being reflected in me just because we are in a long distance relationship and we can't see each other 24/7 and know what the other is doing or know entirely what is happening to us. Although she never saw a specialist or therapist to treat these problems (which she admitted to me was out of fear or pride), I always try to explain to her that right now it is impossible for me to be devotedly aware of her every second of the day, with my career, my activities, my friends and my own life in general. Every day I talk to her to accompany her in the little free time I have during the day and when I return home exhausted I also make sure to communicate with her and ask her about her day and if she would like to talk about something with me, in which most of the time her answers are \"I have nothing interesting to tell\". There are also times when a harmless joke I make unleashes hell where she gets offended at me and I need to reassure her of how much she means to me and how much i really love her, I apologize for upsetting her with something I said, to which she (apparently) accepts my apologies and (also apparently) everything is resolved. Last night I even went out with my guy friends to a bar after a hard week and all day long I let her know who I was with and what our plans were for the night, to which she ended up responding, as a way of throwing it in my face, that I will never be able to understand her and solve all the damage she suffered with me with a simple forgiveness, and acussed me of not caring about her and not being able to see things the way she sees them. That made me feel like like I'm worth absolutely nothing, like all the sincerely unconditional love I give her when we're together isn't worth it even in the slightest, that all the moments in which I was there to listen to her and understand her also meant nothing. I need honest and direct opinions on this. ",

        "selftext": "I’ve been thinking a lot about how cultural assimilation impacts opportunities, especially in the workplace. I was raised in a predominantly Caucasian church group in the Midwest/South, where my mom worked multiple jobs, and members of the church helped babysit me. Because of that environment, I never learned Spanish, and I became a native English speaker without an accent. My name and skin color make it obvious that I’m Hispanic, but everything else like my speech, my interests, even the way I present myself is very much in line with mainstream American culture.\n\nI never really thought much about this until I started noticing a pattern in my jobs. I’ve had no issue moving up. I’ve always been recognized for my abilities, and promotions have come naturally. But people I know people who are just as educated and capable tell me they’re being overlooked for management positions or even treated differently at work. Most of them have thick Hispanic accents, and many were raised in predominantly Hispanic communities, even if they were born here.\n\nI live in a primarily Caucasian area, and it’s become clear to me that how you present as Hispanic plays a massive role in workplace opportunities. Whitewashed Hispanics, whether they grew up like me or are half Hispanic with “white” first names, seem to have a much easier time getting ahead than first-generation or immigrant Hispanics who retain strong cultural ties.\n\nI don’t think this is talked about enough. People love to say that discrimination is just about race, but I think it’s also about how comfortable people feel with you. If you fit the dominant culture and don’t challenge their perception of what’s “normal,” you get a pass. If you don’t, you hit a wall.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this?",

        "selftext": "I (27) father of three lives alone with my three children. Thanksgiving month of last year the mother and I got into a heated argument which led to a back and forth (physically) the most I did was push her to get some space to walk away, because I truly don’t believe in hitting women( unless it’s life or death). Before that even happened, two days prior to this she was already putting her hands on me which led to a big bruise on my back. And a long scar going from my neck down to my back. Once I pushed her away from me she instantly called the cops and said I was the one being belligerent and she wanted me removed from the house. The police arrive and she!! Yes she showed them the camera footage of what had been going on and ofc she was deemed the main aggressor and was taken to jail. Once she got out “apparently” she has a court order to stay off of the property and to have no contact with me. Her name is still on the lease so she helps out by paying her half of the rent and once a week will ask if the kids need anything( she has a friend that reaches out for her). She currently has no where to live but she stays with a friend and still has her job as a nurse and is in school during the day. She gave me the option of getting a hotel room to get the kids because it’s going on four months since she has seen or talked to any of them. I thought the hotel option was a good idea and I even offered to pay for half the expenses. But it never happens because she either to busy with school and work. I would like too take her to court so she can at least help me by getting them and keeping them for a week. I have managed to do what I can with childcare and anything else the kids need so I can work my self and I have managed to do this alone. What do I need to do to get her to court so we can have our time with the kids individually? I understand she is in a situation but I shouldn’t have to suffer because of it. I hope this doesn’t sound bitter on my end but we are not together anymore so she is going to have to start riding her storms out alone now. Im not complaining about taking care of my kids because I love them dearly and I don’t find anything manly about complaining about something you helped bring into this world but I need a break some times and I’m only asking for a week.",

        "selftext": "     I was heavily bullied via social ostracism as a kid. It also didn’t help that I am very likely autistic and I have a very hard time picking up on unspoken social cues. I also grew up in a bit of a turbulent environment where speaking my mind often ended in punishment. Therefore, my own communication habits are not the healthiest - I tend to bottle things up for months and then crash and bedrot for days on end when it all becomes too much. But I have a best friend who I finally felt comfortable attempting more immediate, healthy communication with, and it’s blown up so badly that I’m almost wishing I’d just kept my mouth shut instead.\n\n     They’ve been getting really into a TV show for about 5 months now - which is great, and I’m truly happy for them. A lot of the time they’d send me voice notes about it, or we’d call and they’d end up talking about it to the point of apologizing for “overtaking the conversation,” and I’d always say they had nothing to be sorry for, because I love listening to my friends be happy about stuff. Genuinely, I do, and it was literally all fine up until last week.\n\n     After months of searching due to unemployment, I had a job interview lined up for the next day. Of course, I immediately texted my best friend, and they congratulated me and said they’d send me messages of encouragement before the interview. I thanked them, and then they immediately proceeded to talk about the show again. I didn’t think much of it and listened as always, because I enjoy it. \n\n     The interview day comes the next day, and it’s HECTIC - I was so busy that I was literally going from 5:30am to 5:30pm, and by the time I got home I was ready to crash. My interview was scheduled at 4, and they’d been texting me about the show prior to it, so I figured I’d get my messages soon. Well, long story short, they never came - I got home at about 5:30, immediately crashed and took a 2 hour nap, and then woke up to chat with them only to have another conversation about the show. Admittedly I didn’t feel great about it, but I thought it was just the lack of food and sleep talking, so I brushed it off.\n\n     Over the next few days, though, I noticed that sometimes the things I’d send them would just get liked and immediately moved on from in favor of talking about the show - eventually I realized that this wasn’t making me feel great, so I decided to ask them if we could maybe tone down the conversations about this show and explain how it made me feel. Sounds like a healthy way to communicate, right? Wrong.\n\n     As soon as I sent the message I realized how badly I fucked up. They were (rightfully) upset that I’d waited a week to tell them this and didn’t give them the opportunity to correct themselves in the moment, and for that I apologized - I genuinely thought a week wasn’t that much time, and it wasn’t something I was even mad at, just mildly upset. But then the whole conversation kept spiraling, and I literally feel sick at the way I made them feel. \n\n   I thought that I was avoiding bottling it up and actually doing the right thing because I was communicating a relatively minor (on my end) issue early on, but it turns out that by not saying anything immediately, I’ve basically reinforced their worst fears about themself. They’re now scared to talk too much to anyone about anything, and now any mention of the show makes them feel sick. They said they feel like a bad friend, and part of them feels lied to because I always said it was alright how much they talked about it - but it wasn’t a lie. It really was alright, the job interview was literally the only incident that made me feel not great about it. I kept apologizing because I never wanted them to feel like that around me, but they’re still really hurt and now we’ve been taking some space from each other for about four days now.\n\n     I feel sick. I feel like I ruined the one friendship where both of us felt safe to be ourselves. Even if we manage to move on from this, I know it’ll never be the same, and it’s all my fault - they’ll never talk to me again without worrying that they’re being “too much,” and that’s the one thing I never wanted them to worry about with me, because I know what it’s like to be “too much” for the people around you. \n\n     I wish I’d kept my stupid mouth shut. It was never even that big of a deal, I could’ve just dealt with it and bit my tongue, but of course the one time I feel like communicating is the right thing it just ruins everything. I hurt my best friend so bad and I didn’t even mean to, and now there’s nothing I can say or do to fix it. I thought I was finally doing things right, but it all just went wrong anyway, and now one of the people I care about the most is hurting because of me. The guilt is eating me alive, I’ve been crying ever since it all went down, and now I wish I’d never even said anything. ",

I’m not gonna explain everything that happened in those 6 months, but I can say that nothing went back to how it was. \n\nBecause I was still in love with him when he basically ghosted me at the time, I never got the closure I needed (I think). And I begged him to let me stay in his live as friends, and now that I’m hearing myself I sound so stupid. After everything that happened in those 6 months we kissed etc. for like 2 more times and that made it even worse to get over him. \n\nLike I said we stayed friends and talk like 3 times a year (new years, birthdays and holidays). I even got a new amazing boyfriend whom I’ve been together with for almost 2 years, and who I really love and could see myself marrying one day. But I still think about him (the ex). \nLast week he even responded on a story I posted on Snapchat and we exchanged maybe 10 sentences. I wake up the next day and he deleted me from snap. I would like to think his new gf made him do it, because it would honestly hurt more if he did it himself. \n\nSo now 1 week later and everyday I’m thinking about it and everything that happened almost 3 fk years ago. \n\nSo my question Reddit users is why can’t I get over him? Why can’t I get over the memories that we made? Why not after everything this person has put me through?\n\nEnglish is not my first language so I’m sorry for my grammar. \n\nSide note, 1,5 years ago he moved to another city so I haven’t seen him in 1 year. And I see him maybe once I year now. I was supposed to see him last week, but he couldn’t come…",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone. I am writing this in hopes to get it off my chest no matter how familiar or boring the subject may be. \n\nI am a 24yo woman, I am a student, currently unemployed and I live with my boyfriend. I consider myself a normal person, nothing out of the ordinary in my life or in my character. I am healthy, i have hobbies, i have friends and normal healthy relationships, and nothing in my life is out of line. \n\nI am giving this info because the story concerns my father’s behaviour towards me basically since i was 11yo. \n\nHe has always been the provider for our family ( my mom, sister, dad and i ). \nThe problem in my story is his character and his behaviour towards everyone in his life ( i mean family and close ones ). \nSince I was a little girl he has always used derogatory language with me and my mom. He has fits of rage every day and shouts at us and mostly her because i do not live there anymore. Name calling of all sorts for no reason. \n\nI will give an example - once i was going out for a walk and i took a bottle of water with me (1L), small bottle nothing insane. He saw it and started screaming at me every offensive word you can think of. He said no person in his right mind takes water outside on a walk. \nAnother example - he screamed at my mom and the didn’t speak to her a whole week because HE forgot his lunch on his way out. Apparently she needs to be there every second and remind him to even blink. \n\nHe is the same with my sister and his parents( my grandparents). \n\nNo one in my family has ever talked to him about this and they are enablers to his behaviour. \n\nFor the years that I spent living with them, when he would get home from work I would stay in my room and not even go to the bathroom for hours even if i needed to just because to get to the bathroom you have to go through the living room and that is where he watched tv and spent the evenings. \n\nOver the years i developed severe anxiety, low self esteem, binge eating disorder and many more characteristics and conditions that make my life miserable. \n\nThe binge eating disorder came because all my life he would call me fat and huge and enormously big ( I have always been 50-55kg at 1.65cm height, i work out at the gym and have been a runner for a few years, so yeah I am slim and have even been very skinny for some time ) \n\nSo, this person with his insane behaviour has long ago lost my respect and fondness of him. Although until now i have been silent.\n\nToday, at dinner i couldn’t take it anymore. For months i’ve been having dreams of him screaming at me and while asleep I felt the hatred in my heart. So today, he started to insult me again and I didn’t stay silent this time. I told him that respect has to be earned and he doesn’t have mine because of all the years of name calling and treating me like garbage. He was stunt and said that i don’t have a father anymore. To be honest, i’ve felt like that since i was 11. \n\nEven though it hurt him, he can’t begin to imagine the pain i’ve been feeling for years.\n\nI can’t stop crying because of the words I said but I know I had to say them at some point in my life to free myself and defend myself. \nI feel pity for him and nothing else. I am sorry that he is the way he is because it can only end badly for him. \n\nI am proud I defended myself for the first time but I will always be in pain because he’s been brought up to be the person he is. He is incapable of change and I am sorry for him. \n",

There was this one small house on the left side of the road and coming up on it, I could hear splitting noises like someone was being hit but I think I couldn't believe it until I actually got close enough. There was this guy, 20s maybe both of them, standing over his wife or girlfriend on the front lawn, she was lying down on her side and had her arm stretched out. Then as I walked by slowly, unable to stop for some reason, he started beating and slapping her and grabbing her by the hair and yanking her towards the house. He also kicked her multiple times. I think he might have called her Alicia. But the eerie thing was that she was surprisingly quiet about it, not like crazy screaming, but just like, please stop! You would think she'd be screaming and crying out for help or something. I remember that I was just walking in horror, the guy didn't seem to notice me or if he did, he didn't care. I couldn't stop and I couldn't stop looking at them. I think I was trying to figure out what street I was on but I had never thought to memorize the alley way streets so I didn't know. The whole scene moved in slow motion but I still remember the entire beating, the sounds, the sounds of grass scraping, the shape of his hands. Just broad daylight at 3pm on a weekday, front lawn, no one else on the street but them and me, springtime.\n\nI ran home in tears and told my mom who just told me not to get involved. When I tried to tell her that I think he was going to kill her, she asked me what street and address this happened because if we report it, I'll have to know all these things. I had no idea, so again, she told me to mind my own business.\n\nI was 10 or so when this happened and I'm in my 30s now. I still have the exact same fantasy memory of having gone back in time and instead of walking away and running away from the scene, I get in between them and save her somehow. If not save, but at least make such a fuss that someone calls the cops. It's always the same thing - that I don't care if I get hurt in the process, I would have done the brave thing. Instead of what I actually did... just run away in literal horror. I feel so haunted by this scene. I don't think I'll ever forget it for the rest of my life, honestly.",

        "selftext": "Recently my sister got engaged, and she asked me to be a part of her bridal party. Initially I was very excited to have a role in her wedding, kind of still am, but now I'm feeling iffy because she invited our brother, who I don’t have a positive relationship with.\n\nFor context, I’m the youngest out of the three of us and we were raised by a single mother who worked a lot. Because of this, my sister took a lot of responsibility over us when our mother couldn’t. She’s like a second mother to me and my brother even though she shouldn’t have been. My brother, on the other hand, was kind of a weirdo growing up. He dressed alternatively and had “nerdy” interests, something that younger-me at the time thought was really cool, and was all around awkward.\n\nI was maybe 8 and he was 14 when he started getting curious with his body, and that eventually led to him sexually assaulting me. It didn’t happen for long, thank god, but the experience left a disgusting stain on me. Eventually I realized that what had happened to me was wrong, and it wasn't until I was 13 that I finally had the chance and courage to talk to someone.\n\nI was removed from my home and placed in a children’s psych unit, and my case was being handled by a social worker. Of course, they informed my mother, who then told a few others, my sister included. I didn’t know this at the time, but some of the adults around her pressured her into convincing me to recant my statement. So when she visited me, she asked me to do just that. I was obviously so betrayed and angry, she was my role model and the one person I relied on the most at the time. I can’t recall the rest of our conversation, I just remember leaving the visitation area and completely losing it in my room.\n\nBut I was young, impressional, and ruminating a lot at this time, so I did end up recanting my statement. My case worker didn’t agree with my decision but respected it anyway. For the sake of procedure, my case was still investigated, but without the victim’s statement it fell through. It didn’t erase anything that happened to me, but it felt like it did with how everyone else around me went about their lives like nothing happened. It was jarring and fucked with my head, and I slowly started believing that I made the whole thing up for attention. My memory wasn’t the best, and it could’ve just been a messed up dream I had. I started feeling disgusted and I couldn’t trust myself anymore, and I began spiraling.\n\nFastward to when I was 17, I was hospitalized for almost taking my life. For some reason, this was much more serious than before. I was finally put on medication and was put into a program for other at-risk teens. It was through group therapy I started thinking about getting closure for myself, so after a lot of mental and emotional preparation, I confronted my brother. At the last minute I decided to record the conversation without him knowing, and I actually got a confession. I went to my social worker, and after a few days he was removed from the house.\n\nAfter that, I was both relieved and stressed by the events that came next. To be honest I didn’t follow too closely with the court proceedings, I couldn’t bring myself to care what happened to him, all I remember was being interviewed by SVU and getting monthly check ups by social services. But the whole ordeal was mentally and emotionally draining for me and my family. My mom couldn’t believe it at first, and briefly experienced religious psychosis, but no one took it harder than my sister. I guess she felt guilty, because 1) such a serious thing happened between two of her siblings right under her nose, and 2) she didn’t have my back when I first came forward about it. I don’t blame her, or anyone really, for not noticing what was happening. I can’t bring myself to blame anyone, no one wants to believe that someone you love is capable of something as horrible as sexual assault.\n\nA few years have passed since then, and I’ve been working on improving my mental health. My sister was my rock throughout the process, the most understanding of me and my circumstances, and after a while I thought I had made peace with the whole situation, until her wedding. My sister’s decision to invite our brother, after years of no-contact between the two of us, kind of blindsided me. Not because I didn’t expect her to, but because she didn’t tell me. Now here’s the thing, I would never ask my sister to choose between me or our brother. I understand that she loves the both of us despite what had happened, so to ask her to do that wouldn’t be fair. But I would’ve liked a heads-up. I had to ask her myself if he was coming, and I’m glad I did. The thought of walking into the venue and seeing him in the crowd without warning would’ve sent me into a panic.\n\nAnd because of this I started to rethink my relationship with her. She’s done a lot for me, and I’ll go as far as to say that she has a bigger impact on me than our mother does. I want to give her some grace for this, but I still feel so uncomfortable with his presence. He’s also still in good standing with our extended family, who don’t know of the situation, so the possibility of them joking around and having fun with him without knowing what he’s done doesn’t sit right with me.\n\nI most likely won’t do anything regarding my sister’s wedding because I don’t want to ruin her big day, but it’ll probably change the way I see her. Like I said, I won’t ask her to choose between me or him, but that doesn’t mean I can’t. It’s a scary realization that my relationship with my sister can change, I really don’t want it to, but I can’t ignore how she’s willing to look past what our brother has done to me when I haven’t. I want to start by having a proper conversation with her about this first though, after the wedding. I want to fully understand her side of the story and her perspective before making this big decision.\n\nI honestly don’t know what to expect or hope for, but I feel like if I don’t do something then all the improvement I’ve made will come undone and I don’t think I’ll recover this time.\n",

        "selftext": "My (F20) oldest brother (OB, M31) is an abusive misogynist. He genuinely thinks that women - his girlfriend, his wife, his mom, doesn't matter - should be beaten and/or be physically intimidated when he has any (even the smallest) disagreement. He was kicked out of the military for beating his wife (he somehow got honorable discharge from what my mom says). My mom also has video evidence on OB practically dragging his girlfriends down the stairs in front of her children (my brother *only* went after single moms)\n\nWith that said, let's get into the main reason I'm scared for this child. I recently found out my OB is a child predator and that the reason OB was kicked out at ~14 (almost 15) wasn't because of no reason. It was because my mom walked in on us with our pants down in my closet when I was 4. 3 years later, OB got my name tattooed on his arm. I don't really remember it that well because I had pushed the memory deep down in the back of my mind because I thought it was my fault. I remember thinking \"all I have to do is push it all the way back, behind the wall, into my subconscious\" because I heard that's how other's got rid of the bad feelings or bad memories (I think it's because I heard that there was 2 sides of the brain). I remember thinking, \"Why didn't I just say 'no'?\".\n\nIt wasn't until years later (OB had moved back into our house) when I noticed weird things OB would do (like how I mentioned he only goes after single moms or moms who recently left an abusive relationship,  only for them to leave OB because \"I never wanted my children to be put back into that situation, luckily the Girlfriend he practically dragged down the stairs has a new boyfriend who said \"I'll make sure he doesn't goes anywhere near my family again\"). I would notice things like how OB treated me like OB would his girlfriends or how OB would stare at my chest or at me in a weird way like a dog would a squirrel (or almost like how they describe jaws eyes) but I thought I was just being crazy. Then OB offered my underaged friend alcohol if she got into his car and went on a drive with OB (to nowhere is particular). \n\nAfter a couple of years, OB was kicked out again for trying to beat my dad for telling OB to stop yelling at my mom about how *OB* crashed his car while drunk and the entire time, the way OB was talking to her it sounded like he was trying to blame her or the mechanic who fixed his car (my mom said the next day OB went back to the mechanic and yelled at him, then OB got upset that *the best mechanic who worked there wouldn't fix his car and told him to go somewhere else*). And, then as soon as she raised her voice above him to get him to stop screaming and yelling, he immediately started the crocodile tears. The story OB told us was actually ridiculous, OB apparently hit a boulder in the middle of the road and swerved (?) off the road into a ditch.\n\nMy parents visited the crash site of where the supposed boulder was, and all they found were swerve marks to a ditch. As for the road, it looked completely fine for a road that had a boulder land on it a couple hour prior (we live in a part of America where the roads don't get that much maintenance and when we do, it's noticeable and definitely lasts longer than a day)\n\nAfter a little while, the whole p diddy thing came out, and something about it made me snap, and I kept thinking about predators and how they are disgusting creatures. (At the time, I had recently bought some shrooms bars from a local store.) The more I thought of the p diddy situation, the more the memories of my own molestation started coming back. I started getting angry a lot, and eventually, I told my mom. \n\nShe said that when she found us, she didn't think anything had happened yet and that OB was just about to do something. I asked her why she didn't call the police because OB would have still attempted to molested a 4 year old child. She said it was because of my dad's crazy ex-wife. \n\nSometimes, I wish I could go back in time and stop it. I was littarly just playing with my toys before OB came home from school and immediately ran to me like I was present under a christmas tree. I still remember the conversation we had.\n\nOB: (he said something along the lines of) \"we should take off our pants or something about a game\" (I wasn't really paying attention when he initially walked in because I was focused on my toys)\n\nMe: \"But, why?\"\n\nOB: \"Because I want to show you something.\"\n\nMe: starts to take off pants\n\nOB: \"If you kiss mine, I'll kiss yours\"\n\nMe: (senses something is off and starting to get scared): \"but why? I don't want to\"\n\nOB: \"it's not scary, see.\" (does what you think he said he would, I genuinely feel sick thinking about it)\nThen I geuss he heard my mom or he had locked the door. \n\nOB: \"You need to get your pants on, she's not supposed to see us\"\n\nThen my mom walked in and stopped when she ws my still trying to button and zip up my pants\nMom: \".......... what.... what..the Fuck.... (then she started yelling at OB) WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU DOING TO HER (then, she grabbed him and pulled him out of the room)\n\nI don't really remember much after that, but I do remember the couple of times I would think about it and get a disgusting feeling or like shame before I had successfully pushed it down. Now, I don't know what to do, it's not exactly like I can go to the police and get justice when it was a long time ago and there is no actual proof the court would listen to. My family has cut him off though, which is good because I was scared of what OB would do if OB moved in with my nana and papa (they're 80 and my aunts have mobility problems, the only person who would be able to defend them is my uncle, who isn't exactly the athletic type and is much older than OB)\n\nEdit: I fixed the spelling and grammar mistakes \n",

People find others who talk to themselves to be weird or crazy anyways so honestly this is an improvement. \n\nI wonder if I’ll lose my voice completely and then I really can’t talk anymore. That would be both interesting and scary. I wonder if that’ll happen with my face too. I stopped looking at my reflection along with not talking. Idk why, I just did. I actually like it.

        "selftext": "Hello. I just came to get this off my chest because I can't take it anymore. English is not my first language.\n\nThree years ago, I adopted a stray puppy. After having him at home for five days, I realized he had parvovirus, so I had to hospitalize him for ten days. It was a miracle that he survived, and after that, he had to stay home for two months without going outside, as recommended by the vet.\n\nThe first time I took him out, I noticed he was terrified of absolutely everything—noises, cars, other animals, people, but especially men. It took a lot of effort to get him comfortable going on walks. We took it slowly, and after a year, I managed to take him to the dog park.\n\nNow, my dog is three years old, and for the past three months, his condition has worsened. He only wants to go to the bathroom once a day, around midnight, when no one is on the street. I live in the city center, which is always busy and noisy (for various reasons I just can't afford to move to the country side). Every day is a struggle. He prefers to go inside the house to avoid going outside. He trembles and cries. If visitors come over, he hides and shakes the entire time. The only time he is happy is when it's just me, my partner, and him at home.\n\nSeeing him like this breaks my heart, and on top of that, no one wants to take care of him—not even paid services or dog daycare centers because of his condition. I took him to a specialist ethologist, tried medications, relaxants, and behavioral exercises, but nothing has improved.\n\nSometimes, I think about giving him to someone with a huge field where he could run and be happy, but at the same time, I don’t want to let him go. It feels wrong—no one will take care of him like I do, no one will love him like I do. What if he misses me? What if he feels abandoned?\n\nEvery day, I suffer for him and blame myself for not being a better owner.\n\n",

        "selftext": "I worked for Child Protective Services in a metropolitan area of the US for 12 years. I did both long term case management and later investigations that led to the removals of children. With about a decade of time and reflection, I’ve come to realize the following:\n\n- I was a young woman with lots of privilege who did not understand the lives or needs of the people over whose lives I made decisions for.  This now causes me great pain. \n- Turns out I was dissociating through most of it due to secondary trauma and moral injury. The ability to dissociate (although we just saw it as toughing through back then) was seen as showing that you were a great worker and could “get shit done”. \n- I wanted to do good in the world and I wanted to help children. And I did. But I also caused harm because I had too many cases, not enough supervision and no real self-awareness.\n- It took years of therapy to understand and grieve the harm I had caused and the harm caused to me. I don’t even remember the first few years of my children’s lives because I was so dissociated. I often have to look at a photos to remember events with them. \n- I still get flashbacks of things I was exposed to and am swapped with pain. \n\nSometimes it all comes back. Just this week, I was contacted by a former colleague and a child who was on my caseload many years ago. \n\n- The colleague reminded me of a child death case we worked on. It was particularly searing because we both had children that were about the same age as the child who died. \n- She also reminded me about the death of another colleague (through an aneurism) and the suicide of a couple others. Yes, our work had a death count. \n- The girl, now an adult, reached out to me to say she is doing well and to thank me for helping her find an adoptive home. \n\nIt’s a mixed bag. And these memories reinforce in me the idea that nothing in life is guaranteed and I’m just trying to do the best I can each day. I screw up and I repair where I can. I put kindness and compassion into everything I do, but that isn’t always enough. \n\nI don’t really have a purpose for this post. Just wanted to get it off my chest. ",

We met during 10th grade and they had already been dating a year so she had already met his family and such. She would make these comments like “Max’s dad is so hot” or “Max looks just like his dad and they’re both so attractive”, it was kinda funny at first, then she said “Max’s dad said if we were the same age, we’d be dating”, and that’s when we knew Max’s dad was a creep but she kept dating the boy and we couldn’t do anything.\n\nFast forward to senior year, Max decides he wants to date other people so they break up. Charlie was distraught, barely even speaking to us, dragging her feet around school, the usual teenage break up shit, til eventually they get back together. And this is where things got interesting for us.\n\nCovid hits, we’re out of school and hanging out at Charlie’s when she tells us she slept with one of Max’s family members but wouldn’t specify who. We thought it could’ve been his younger brother who’s 2 years younger than us, she said it wasn’t him, we said his dad, she claimed she wouldn’t say. We didn’t have to wait long tho, Max somehow finds out, we still don’t know how, that she in fact fucked his father and all hell broke loose.\n\nHis father denied and denied, Max and his brother stopped speaking to their father and Charlie, we never heard anything about his mom but I can only imagine she was drawing up divorce papers. Oh, and the reason she didn’t wanna specify it was him? They had sex in January, her 18th birthday was February…\n\nWe haven’t talked to Charlie in years, but before she stopped talking to us, she made a comment in a text like “My man is taking me on vacation” and when we asked who her “man” was, she just sent a smiling emoji and basically never talked to us again. Recently, we discovered through FaceBook that apparently, Charlie and Max’s dad are still together, Max and his brother don’t talk him, he and his wife divorced and he hardly ever sees their youngest daughter who’s maybe 8 now. \n\n",

        "selftext": "I always hear a lot of critique about how the western world is too individualist. Well, I feel like I completely understand why now. I’m in Canada for reference.\n\nI have been at my current job almost 3 years now. I have been on contract that entire time. I’ve been fighting to get permanent but no positive movement yet. Anyway, the last position I got was a 2 year contract-which comes to an end this summer. I feel I’ve been a positive addition to the team. The team was short staffed (*is* short staffed, even now) and I was able to help out with the work load. I’m a quick learner and pretty efficient, and I’ve definitely shown that on our extremely busy days, or days where extremely short staffed (we often have people falling ill or someone is on vacation). With my contract end coming up I asked my boss if there was a future for me. I have also been looking for work-with no luck-in preparation.\n\nWell, this week she told me the chances of me being kept on were slim to none. I cried at my lunch break. Hell, I had panic attacks and cried before all this. I have been trying to find work and it’s rejection after rejection or just not hearing back at all. Even jobs I’m more than qualified for aren’t responding.\n\nWhat has really hurt and frustrated me, is the apathy of those around me. Friends, coworkers I thought liked me, even family to an extent, could all care less. “Oh damn that sucks. Anyway.” \n\nAnd I 100% understand why. Why would *anyone*, even people who like me, give two shits about me? They have their own partners, families, finances, etc. to worry about. People don’t give two shits what happens to anyone around them when they have their own lives. Someone they know could go homeless and it’d just be a “damn how tragic! They were a nice person. Anyway, what’s for dinner?” \n\nI’ve been bullied at jobs to the point of being suicidal. People saw-and looked the other way. Dont want to involve themselves. I’ve complained to bosses/supervisors about workplace bullies only to go ignored. I’ve been chastised for speaking up. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. No one cares-they can like you, but they’re there to get their bag and go home. \n\nI see this a lot in Canada with the housing crisis. People who own their homes have a “fuck you, I got mine” attitude. They don’t care about the rest of us, especially younger folk, who will never be able to afford even a modest apartment. They got their house, they got their family, fuck everyone else. The homeless are just an inconvenience/nuisance to them.\n\nI’ve tried in my life to have a community mindset with helping others, caring, I always would send fitting job postings to unemployed friends who were looking to try and help out, tried to be there for others. No more. Never again. Not a single person around me would give a fuck if I died tomorrow because understandably, they have their own shit to worry about. Only people I can see caring about me being gone are my mom and dad.\n\nI have fought my entire life to try and be better. Grew up with abusive step parents. Didn’t grow up wealthy. Pretty much everything I did after 18 was my own-rent, schooling (with help of loans, which I am also paying off solo), finding jobs, figuring shit out, etc. \n\nI’m done. My hope for finding work in time before my contract ends is extremely low. Even with experience and schooling, companies dont want to hire, or they want to pay you minimum wage for skilled work. And if they can’t get a canadian to go that low they’ll find a TFW who will take below minimum wage (story for another time). Idk what will happen to me but I know that I will not care about anyone else again. Im gonna worry about me only. Good luck to everyone else.\n",

Initially we wanted to wait until they were old enough, but it became hard to find places to go on vacation or long weekends that had facilities for children.\n\nToday we were at one on the parks — and at a slower ride intended for all ages (toddler friendly), when our youngest threw a tantrum (1.5M). It was close 30 minutes until nap time, and he’s been teething.  We decided to come celebrate my eldest’s birthday (3M), and especially since the recent passing of my father left him very sad and aggressive toward others at daycare (he cried seeing photos of my dad and asking where he was). \n\nWe apologized to the two women next to us, as my youngest threw things on the ground near them. They started off saying that it’s OK. Then they proceeded to let us know that they never came to the parks before a certain age, and that my kids would be better “just by the pool or something.” Keep in mind, we are in the Disney Junior area. And that drowning is a common cause of death in young children, and I know at least three families that have experienced that loss. I tried to keep it nice and then I finally said “you know, they usually do well with travel, they’re just tired today.” And said goodbye. \n\nWas biting my tongue the whole time and wanted to remind them that this is a ride meant for younger children, and not adults in their 20’s-60’s (the two women were mother and daughter). I never understand the idea “children must be seen and not heard.” At a children’s ride in a theme park that is centered and based on children’s cartoons and film. I don’t care if adults show to the parks, but it’s insane that adults want to also keep children acting like children from children’s spaces. ",

But life was going on anyway.\n\nDuring those months together. I've had multiple relapse of alcohol and would send dumbs drunk messages to her. Nothing to serious. But it happened quite a bit.

I didn't told her but it was really really harsh, sweating, mood swing, shaking. But I was determined to not disappoint her.\n\nLast Sunday. She sent a friend of her to message me on Instagram. I told her I was in couple. But then, I liked a photo of her in bikini, and told her we could flirt. \n\nShe had few followers, only one photo, for me it was pretty much a fake and I was messing around.\n\nI would never have gone said that if I knew it was someone real, nor gone any further.\n\nI am french and here, I've been asking friends and most of them tell me it was dumb, and a bit disrespectful, but not cheating, that our love must go above this mistake.\n\nFor her, friends and family all tell her I'm disgusting, it's unforgivable, and she told me you can't repair a broken glass... She never forgave cheating, and won't.\n\nShe is now ghosting me, blocked me everywhere because I have been spamming her to talk to me at least. I didn't realised at that time it was cheating and I feel miserable.\n\nI've been sleeping for weeks, I've had found a job that I left the day after she broke with me, I even booked a flight and then canceled it, losing money in the process.\n\nIt's been one weeks and I desperately need her help, she was the one goal of my life, the only one I've ever been able to love again, I feel like killing myself everyday and I am not even joking, I know it will go wrong for me, i physically cannot live my life without her, not for a mistake I didn't realised... I never ever cheat, and I would never ever, I guess our boundaries are different and it's a miscommunication.\n\nI have nothing to ask, my chest is empty, my life is empty, I just wanna kill myself now, and I have no way to contact her to explain her my point of view...\n\nTLDR : Sorry if I failed you, I don't know how much longer I can endure this. I love you more than anything. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry...\n\nEdit : The worse part is she never let me a chance to explain myself, to even say goodbye, she just disappeared like I am nothing.

        "selftext": "Okay, so I’ve been feeling some type of way about this for a hot minute, and I just need to rant. Idk if I’m overthinking or if I’m actually onto something, so here goes.\n\nI have these two friends, right? They’ve been besties since nursery, and I joined them in 7th grade. And listen, I never had an issue with that—I knew their bond was stronger, and that was fine. But recently, it’s been feeling like I’m just... there. Like, I’m included, but not really included, y’know?\n\nOne of them is dating this guy, and their relationship has been a damn rollercoaster. Long story short, dude was dramatic as hell, dumped her over some misunderstanding, then ran around spreading shit that made her look bad. Back then, our whole group was like, “Nah, he’s trash, you deserve better.” Fast forward a few months, and suddenly they’re treating him like he’s some god-tier boyfriend. Now he’s “so sweet,” “so caring,” “such a gentleman.” Like girl, be so for real.\n\nNow, I’m also dating someone, and every time I bring him up, I get the driest reactions possible. “Oh, he’s nice.” Thanks??? That’s it??? Meanwhile, they’re out here writing a whole PhD thesis about how amazing her man is, even after he did her dirty?? The math is NOT mathing.\n\nAnd it’s not just that. Even when I ask them basic questions, they either leave me on seen or reply two days later with the most half-assed response ever. But somehow, they have the time to be active af on Instagram, sending me reels??? Calls? LMAO, those don’t even exist anymore. And yeah, they’ve never been big on calling, but even when they promise they’ll call, they never do. And before anyone says “Maybe they’re just busy with college?”—nah, they have time for our other friends, just not me.\n\nAnd yeah, I’ve tried bringing it up before. The problem? They’ll act normal for like, a week, and then go right back to the same cycle. Atp, I don’t even see the point in saying anything anymore.\n\nOh, and the cherry on top? I recently got a pink rose from my boyfriend, and I was so happy because I genuinely prefer pink roses over red ones. I shared it with them, and the reaction was so bland. Like, no hype, no excitement—just a casual “Oh, that’s nice.” I know if it were one of them, the energy would’ve been completely different.\n\nIdk, am I tripping, or does this sound off to anyone else? Cuz it’s kinda giving “you’re an option, not a priority” energy, and I don’t know how to feel about that.\n\n\n(Your opinions are welcome, and if you have any recommendations on how to handle this (or just anything in general), I’d love to hear them.)",

        "selftext": "So, my girlfriend (32) and I (30M) have been together for almost a year now and everything is going really well. There have been Ups and Downs in our sex life in the past because of several health reasons, but recently we both feel like our sex really took off. I was kind of inexperienced before I met her so there are a lot of firsts for me.\nA few weeks ago we started experimenting some more and talked about things we'd wanna try, and even watched some video footage of those things to get some ideas and stuff.\n\nI told her that I'd experimented with butt play on myself in the past and I would like to try that during sex (not talking about pegging here). We ended up buying a whole bunch of toys and stuff for both of us including some buttplugs.\nLast night we ended up really tipsy and horny so I suggested giving it a try.\nWe did... And at first it was really nice and hot. We both enjoyed it and had some fun UNTIL all of a sudden I felt the plug pop out. We stopped, and looked around everywhere but the plug was nowhere to be found. That was the moment we realized the (moderately big) plug, even though it had a wide base, got sucked up my butt and was in fact stuck there.\nI straight up fucking panicked and my gf said she could see the terror in my face. I instantly felt sick and started sweating, felt like throwing up. So it was like, do we go to the ER or what do we do?! I preferred not becoming one of those embarrassing sex accident ER stories...\nSo we decided to try and get it out ourselves. I kneeled on my bathroom floor with my upper body leaning over my bathtub because I felt like I'll throw up.\nAnd yeah... My girlfriend basically had to use half her hand trying to fish it out real deep up my butt. It hurt like shit and when it finally got out I was grossed out, felt violated, exhausted and traumatized. I ended up in fetal position in my bathroom with my girlfriend nearly crying for having to hurt me.\n\nMy butt still hurts today and was bleeding a bit this morning and I'm severely traumatized. Even though I'd love to keep trying this, I don't know if I'll ever be able to trust a plug again.\nMy girlfriend did an amazing job being there for me and preventing me from going into a full panic attack so we kinda bonded over this even more. All in all a very traumatic but kind of funny story, I wanted to share! \n\n",

I've always thought of my friend as a bit of a shy guy, so it's hard to imagine him with someone who's so... outgoing. But as I watched more of her videos, I started to feel a twinge of concern. I mean, this is a whole different world that I'm not familiar with, and I worry about my friend getting hurt or caught up in something that's not good for him.\n\nBut at the same time, I have to admit that I'm also kind of fascinated. I've never seen anything like this before, and it's like my eyes are glued to the screen. I feel like I'm getting a glimpse into a secret world that most people don't know about, and it's both thrilling and terrifying.\n\nI don't know how to process all of this, to be honest. Part of me wants to talk to my friend about it, to ask him if he's okay and if he knows what he's getting himself into. But another part of me is afraid of judgment, of being seen as a hypocrite or a voyeur. I mean, who am I to judge what he's doing or who he's dating?\n\nAll I know is that my mind is reeling, and I don't know how to reconcile my feelings about this. I guess all I can do is wait and see how things play out, and hope that my friend knows what he's doing. ",

My wife's family has never been too keen on the idea, but we managed a lukewarm truce until they graduated high school.  That ended last night.  People started dogpiling my wife on a social media post, and once the attacks got personal, my name got drug in, cause I have had my angry eyes in over social media for a few months.  And I snapped. They were abusing my wife for some dumb shit i posted to deal with my anger.  So I told them all the truth.  About how bullshit it was that we were constantly being gaslit into thinking they accept my son for who they are, but even after 7 years they still can't use their preferred name.  \n\nOf course, that self righteous anger rarely feels good the next day.  Sure I felt vindicated, but my wife is devastated.  Her family has abused her, her entire life, but to her, they are still family.  I can't stand them, because they are those reformed drug addicts that now think they are better than everyone else.  But she loves them, and she is devastated.  \n\nAs much as i can't stand her family, I really regret telling them how I actually thought of them over this issue with my son.  Because it won't fix anything.  It's just gonna make shit worse, and the only person that is going to suffer is my wife.",

It was my absolute favorite, basically the only one I wore and I wore it everywhere, it was perfect for everything, I didn't even need another one.\n\nI wore it to a party in December, and I clearly remember taking it off inside the house and putting it in my jewelry box. But when I went to wear it again, where was it? It doesn't make sense. I didn't lose that earring, I put it where it should have been, but someone took it, didn't tell me and to this day has never given it back to me.\n\nI live with my mother, two sisters and my grandfather; and my aunt is the neighbor in the apartment across the hall, and she and her daughter have complete access to my house. I've already gone to everyone, calmly asked if they had taken it, if they had borrowed it and forgotten to return it; everyone said no.\n\nBut here's the thing: my older sister is a bitch. She comes into my room and takes my stuff. She's already finished my perfume, makeup, skincare, hair products - expensive stuff. She complains when I complain, she takes absolutely no care with anything. My whole life has been like this with her, and my whole life I've complained to my mother about it - but my mother just told me to keep my stuff away from her. It's kind of hard when we live in the same house, but it's okay.\n\nShe's already taken some of my jewelry and broken it. When I was a kid, she took three of my rings and returned them to me broken that same night, but I was a kid and the rings had cost 30 reais in total.\n\nWhen I was 17, she took a pair of earrings that my aunt gave me for my 15th birthday, big earrings with stones, more expensive, but besides everything else, a gift, the same thing happened, they disappeared and one day, rummaging through her room, I found them broken; She didn't even bother to show it to me. This one caused me problems, but this woman had the nerve to tell me to my face \"I'm not going to buy another one, they're too expensive\" with the utmost disdain in the world, and my mother did nothing. I kept up the conversation for a while, telling her that she was an irresponsible idiot who had stolen my earrings, but it was no use, and at 17 years old, what was I going to do? Sue her for a pair of earrings? Alone, even more so, because my mother wouldn't help me.\n\nBrother, this story about that earring that she broke has been cooking in me all these years and, along with everything I went through with her in my childhood, God, I hate this woman.\n\nNow, the same thing happened. My earring disappeared and there was absolute silence. I know she has it, I know she took it. But it was in December, it's already March. I've asked her on separate occasions if she took my earring and she said no. I've already gone to her room and turned everything upside down looking for those earrings and I couldn't find them (I found other things of mine that I hadn't even noticed were not even with me anymore). I want to look in her bag, but she won't let me, she'll get stressed and throw them to my mother who will be on her side like she always is.\n\nBrother, I'm going to go crazy because sometimes I stop and think about this piece of crap earring that I know she took. I know I didn't lose it, I know where I put it; if it had been my fault, if I had left it at the party where I wore it, if I had put it in my bag and it disappeared, if it had fallen on the street, I know I would have gotten over it by now; but no, it disappeared in my house, in the place where it should be, someone took it. The only person who has the nerve to steal it from me and act like the biggest sly person there is. Practically every week I end up staging fights and fights with her, demanding that she give me back the earrings that I know she stole, but she'll turn the story around and I'll leave like a crazy person because I've already looked in her room and nothing. And I swear that, for real, if I found that piece of shit earring with her I would sue her, now I would sue her. It costs a lot less than the earring she broke, but I don't care. I just want my earring, I just want that bitch to give me back what's mine because I know she has it.",

She's made so many stains on our carpet, left drinks and food out, and leaves a mess in my car. She's been overweight our entire relationship and I've tried so many times to get her to lose weight and every time she throws a fit about it and makes it unbearable. I've pleaded to her about how i care about her health and i want her to live a long happy life, and she just doesn't seem to care. She has horrible friends who cheat on their bfs, were ex meth addicts, and all are going to go no where in life. I've always wanted to be something big and keep improving myself over time to reach those dreams and goals i have and she doesn't. The only thing she wants is to be a mom, thats it. No drive for a good job, good career, legacy just nothing besides the bare minimum. \n\nDespite all of this i still love her. I'm frustrated with myself cause maybe i did something along the way to make her this way? I'm not sure, but it's heartbreaking and at this point I'm just waiting to get to a good place where I can afford my own house and live on my own. I'm sorry I failed you b.\n",

        "selftext": "I am a male in my late 20s and am writing this post because I wanted to get something off my chest to get honest feedback from people. Good or bad. I have a pregnancy fetish. Essentially I find a big pregnant belly extremely attractive and the thought of the women's breasts, hips butt, getting bigger very attractive. It is purely objective/visual and I have had this ever since I was young. I have always felt very uncomfortable with having this fetish. Pregnancy is normally thought of as an amazing beautiful thing which to most people means 'baby' on the way. I also see it this way but separate to that I have this fetish as well. I worry that if someone hears pregnancy fetish that they will immediately think that this is some sicko thing for unborn babies or just not understand what the hell that kind of fetish is or what it means and immediately feel uncomfortable. Don't get me wrong, I'm not planning on openly telling people but as my peer group enters the 'having kids' stage of life I am feeling weird about it. I know that society has changed quite a lot but fetishes are still very taboo and make a lot of people uncomfortable. Sometimes I wish I didn't have the fetish just so I wouldn't have to deal with the mixed feeling. The only person who knows about it as an ex girlfriend of mine. I worry sometimes that she might tell people about it and I would feel very embarrassed and not know how to deal with it / friends looking at me differently. I know this post might be a bit of an unusual one but any honest and realistic feedback would be appreciated.",

        "selftext": "I’m a 17-year-old guy, and I’ve always been a hard worker—energetic, supportive, and the kind of person who lifts others up. But for the past eight months, I’ve felt like a completely different person.\n\n(No one knows about this, and this is my first time venting or talking about it.)\n\nMid-2024, my parents had a huge fight. I thought, they argue all the time, it’ll be fine, but this time was different. My mom fell into depression right in front of me. I took her to therapy, checked in on her daily, and tried to be there for her.\n\nThen my dad shut down too. He locked himself in his office, barely ate, and was cold whenever I tried to talk. My dad is just like me—we hate sharing emotions—so I just sat with him in silence, hoping he’d feel less alone.\n\nWatching the two strongest people I know fall apart broke something in me, but I held everything together. My routine was: wake up, check on my dad, school, gym, study, then spend hours with my mom. The only time I had to myself was 12-4 AM, and that’s when I met a girl online. Our dumb late-night conversations were the only thing keeping me sane.\n\nBy September, my parents were worse—and so was I. My grades were bad no matter how much I studied. And the girl who helped me escape started playing mind games, making things worse.\n\nThen in October, my parents got better. They were laughing, eating together, and finally acting like themselves again. I thought life was turning around.\n\nBut a few days before my birthday, I got a phone call. One of my childhood best friends had died from cancer. That was my breaking point.\n\nAt his funeral, my brother cried. Everyone cried—except me. At the grave, surrounded by people sobbing, I felt like an outcast. I wanted to cry. I should have cried. But I couldn’t.\n\nThat night, I sat in the shower, eyes red as hell, trying so desperately to cry. But nothing. I just wanted to feel human again.\n\nI held it together until February. That’s when the girl told me she loved me. I said it back, and for the first time in months, I thought maybe life was finally giving me something good.\n\nBut now, for the past eight days, I’ve done nothing but eat, sleep, and doom-scroll. I haven’t gone to the gym. I haven’t studied. I haven’t done anything. And I have an important test in three days. I’m stressed, but I don’t even care.\n\nAnd to make it worse, the girl who said she loved me is playing the same mind games again. I don’t understand why. I thought I finally had something good, but now I just feel like an idiot.\n\nI feel like everyone’s life is moving forward except mine. I’ve been stuck since July, and I don’t know how to fix it.\n\nNobody knows anything about this. It’s just me, alone, going through all of this by myself.\n\nI just feel lost, scared, and overwhelmed, so please, what’s happening to me? What do I do?\n\n(Small note: I finally cried actual tears today, and I don’t even know how to feel about it.)",

        "selftext": "Y’all, I’m struggling. There’s so much, and I’m not faultless. Mother &amp; Daddy divorced before my 5th birthday. Mother “let” my older half-brother* live with his bio-dad once he turned 13. Mother also was diagnosed as bipolar in the 1960s and was treated far too long on lithium. I get this logically, but emotionally.,,I always lost out. \n\nMy mother &amp; my aunt/:her sister have always found a common ground. They’ve had typical sister disagreements over the years*but* have always been each other’s biggest advocates. Point is my mother was not a bad person. \n\nAround my 5th grade year I tuned into fashion. I wanted what I liked, not her cutesy smocked dresses, etc. listen I am now as Southern as can be…I have a ridiculous amount of monogrammed items and would/will happily support a smocked personalized/monogrammed adult dress! There’s no shame in my game. Whatever I buy for my niece will have a matching auntie(or mom) part! ***\n\nWhen my older half-brother was 12, he went to live with his father. After my older brother’s death when I was 12 myself, I was sent to *my* father and his wife and my younger half-brothers. To this day, we are all full siblings in each other’s eyes. My daddy raised my older brother, and his final wife helped raise us. This stepmom loves me and adopted me. \nToday, on the anniversary of my husband’s death, I learned that my bio mother passed away 6 days ago. Our last visit was very pleasant; neither of us drug up the past. However I am struggling with the fact that the hospital (where I used to work, and still love) did not notify me, my aunt, or the temporary Power of Attorney. I’ve been out of reach for a couple of years so a family friend stepped in as mPoA, knowing my mother’s wishes. My aunt &amp; I have consistently been listed in medical records as emergency contacts. No one from the hospital contacted my aunt, me, or the mPoA.\nMy mother’s body has been unclaimed in the hospital morgue for 6 days. 6 days!!!\nHow am I supposed to feel? \n\nTL;dr: my bio mom passed away 6 days ago in the hospital. They disregarded all emergency contacts listed and her temporary medical PoA in my absence. Her body has been unclaimed in the morgue for almost a week. They told my aunt on Monday that she had been discharged(blatant lie). There’s a lot to unpack but she was my mother. We had a lovely visit before I left town 3 weeks ago. I’m so furious that her body has been “unclaimed” in the hospital morgue. \nNote: I loved this healthcare system. I spent almost a decade of my career in their local hospital Admin. When I was very, very sick, this staff literally saved my life. I’ve been so loyal until this circumstance…",

        "selftext": "It was just my almost 2 year old son and me in the house. Dogs were outside and I was at the kitchen table doing my makeup getting ready for work as I was supposed to leave in 2hrs. The doorbell rang and I ignored it for a couple minutes. It's not uncommon for solicitors to try and sell shit. I slowly walked up to my front door peephole and looked out. There was a man standing with his back to the door blocking most of my view and then a second man was out at my curb back also facing my door kinda looking around. I started to get nervous and slowly turned the lock on the front doorknob so he wouldn't hear I was on the other side. \n\nImportant to note: my mom's transmission went out last week so she's borrowing my car. No cars in the driveway or in front on the street. But the TV was on playing a kid show for my toddler so he wouldn't miss my presence as much while getting ready. \n\nI watched him for a bit and decided he'd probably leave soon and started walking away. That's when I heard my glass door open. I thought I'd hear him knock next but instead I got to watch as my front door knob started jiggling like someone was trying to get in. And then I froze. Instead of getting my husband's gun to protect myself and my child I did nothing. I just froze. He fiddled with the door knob for a bit and then eventually walked away. I peeped out the kitchen window and watched as this dude met up with his buddy and then they started walking away. \n\nI texted my husband instead of calling the police. He's the one that did. He told me to call them because they wanted to ask me questions, and so I did. Then when I tried to call my phone said I had to connect to a wifi or network to make a call. My bill is paid every month on the 2nd and I was connected to wifi. Just another thing that was going wrong. The police had to call me back and ask if I was ok to even talk to them. When the police did show up they said the guys were solicitors and it's illegal in the city to do that. We even have 2 no soliciting signs taped to the glass door. She said her partner found them up the street and was kicking them out of the neighborhood. Since there was no proof they tried to enter the house nothing could be done. The only thing they could do was drive up to the company and tell them that if they walk onto our property again they will have trespassing charges filed and the company will receive a citation. \n\nAt the end of it all I'm extremely shaken. I didn't do anything right except lock the door. I didn't tell them to go away. I didn't call 911. I didn't get a weapon. I just locked the door and then watched as they tried to get in, texted my husband, and then did what I was told. I cried for a long time after. I'm still not doing great. If I hadn't locked that door I really don't know what could've happened. If you've read this far thank you, I just really needed to get this off my chest and out. ",

I thought I looked young and still had the teenage look. As someone born in 1998, it wasn’t my turn to be 20+ yet, I was still a teenager. Growing up, people born in the early 90’s and mid 90’s seemed to look more mature than me and I thought it was obvious that I was younger. \n\nI began posting pictures of myself to Yahoo Answers and Facebook “guess my age challenges” and asked people to guess. **Every picture I posted, there was at least one person or a few people who guessed correctly that I was 18. That gave me validation** Yet I also heard 23, 24, 25 etc and that felt super weird at the time. I felt weirded out and uncomfortable because I just didn’t understand how/why I was being perceived as much older if there were people who were guessing my age correctly. I remember feeling upset even if I heard 20. I suffer from OCD too and numbers are very triggering for me. They were adding on years to my life and that just made me feel very restless and I felt absolutely disgusted. I was like **Omg i’m still a teenager and I’m being seen as old??Do I have an abnormal appearance, what’s wrong with my development.** But at the same time there were many people online who guessed correctly that I was 18. I remember one picture someone told me I looked like a teen and that she thought I was 14/15 but another person thought I was 23. Another picture, 4 people thought I was 15-19 yet another person thought I was 24. One picture someone guessed correctly I was 18 but another person said “early 20s unless you have brilliant skincare regime”. I also uploaded a picture of myself with glasses once and someone thought I was 17 or 18 yet another person said 20-25. I was like 25!!?? And that haunted me for several years. I constantly kept having intrusive thoughts about these extreme perceptions and suffered so much. I even had to see a doctor and psychiatrist and took medication to try and stop the intrusive thoughts. I made a vow in September 2017 to stop posting.\n\nIn real life, many people thought I was a teen in school and asked me what grade I was in but at the same time some people thought I was past university age and doing my masters. It just felt super weird. This kept happening to me throughout university. People asking me what grade I was in (being shocked that I was university) and a few people who thought I was past university age. I will never forget September 2019. A guy born in 1992 told me that I looked younger than 21 to him and still looked like a teen but the day after that, a lady thought that I was older than my then 29 year old sister (1990) and kept saying she looked really young like 22ish and I wasn’t even 22 then like wtf.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I suffer from OCD and constantly had intrusive thoughts that I was filthy and disgusting because years were being added onto my life and I wondered what I was going to look like when I was actually 23-25. These numbers were disgusting in my mind. I also developed Body Dysmorphia and hated my appearance. I didn’t mind being perceived as young but wondered what was it about my face that made me look old to others??? How could I look young and old at the same time? \n\nThen when I was actually 23/24, 2 people asked me what grade I was in and a few days before I turned 25 in 2023, someone asked me if my school was closed for summer break. But then in January 2024, someone asked me if I was 25 and I was like omg have i looked 25 for the past decade?? Am I living in some sort of time warp??\n\nNow I’m 26 and many people ask me if I’m a student of a postsecondary institute (uber drivers, restaurant/cafe owners, people helping me in stores etc) That’s a common perception many people have of me. But I have a sneaking suspicion that history is going to repeat itself in a new context and that a new trend will form that I’ve got to be 30, or 30+ when I’m technically not even in my late 20s yet. This is why I don’t post pictures online and avoid socializing with people. Because I’m afraid history is going to repeat itself again and that I’ll suffer again. I’d much rather be alone than be around people who have the potential to make me uncomfortable in my own skin. I wasn’t uncomfortable withy appearance until I became aware that some people have extreme perceptions of me. I also get really angry like why are most people so stupid and unable to read my face??? \n\nSometimes I just wish I could stay locked up in a tower like Rapunzel away from the whole world so that no one can ever see my face again. I’m also pretending to be Evil Queen now as a coping mechanism. Someone obsessed with her appearance, constantly needing validation and being vindictive towards those who challenge her identity. \n",

They never told me because they were sure they had stretched my robe out in the shoulders and didn't want to upset me. I personally think they look great in tight clothes but I can understand why seeing a big, burly ginger man in a barely closed, ill fitting silk robe could get us put on a religious shit list.

She's just so beautiful and smart and funny, there's nothing I don't love about her. She's a great mom too and I've been partially filling a void in her sons life of a male role model. \nAnyway on to the incident. We were out for dinner after work. I had asked her out knowing I was going to finally confess my feelings, but she didn't know that was my intention, we get dinner regularly enough. \n\nWhile eating we were gossiping about work and about a new project we are starting. It'll be us two and a guy called Craig (m 50s). Craig has asked me out multiple times to the point its definitely an ongoing joke. He knows I'm interested in women only and we have a great working relationship. Annie makes a comment about us having some late nights working coming up and I better watch out for Craig's advances, I joke that I guess everyone just wants to kiss me, she says not everyone. OK not a great start. I say well speaking of kissing and she cuts me off and just says \"please dont\".\n\nI just said ok. We both got fairly quiet. Finished our dinner with some small talk and work chat. Went our separate ways and haven't spoken since. It's been 2 days. I'm just so sad and lonely without her. I miss her son. I want to talk to her so much, but I know I can't keep this situation going on or I'll lose my sanity. I'm going to look for a new job. Maybe actually start dating women. In time I hope I can be a real friend to her. I feel bereaved. If anyone has been through this type of situation and has any advice please let me know. ",

After all, for a girl, spending the night alone in a big house isn’t always easy. But this time, it was completely different—I felt calm, confident, and absolutely at peace.\n\nWhat surprised me the most was that my parents didn’t call me even once to check whether I had eaten or done my work. Not because they forgot, but because they know I am responsible enough to handle everything. Being the eldest daughter of the house, I have always been expected to take care of things on my own.\n\nWith ₹200 in hand from my dad, I first treated myself to chhole bhature. Later, I managed to earn ₹1000 by sending some rice, so now I had even more freedom to enjoy!\n\nFor lunch, I had paneer curry with rice, and at night, I went full feast mode—pizza and pasta while watching Tenali Rama on TV. No one to disturb, no distractions—just me, my food, and my favorite show! After that, I enjoyed gulab jamun and ended the night with a cold Thums Up, making the day feel even better.\n\nThe best part? This time, I didn’t feel scared at all. Sleeping alone, which once felt a little uneasy, now felt completely normal.\n\nWhat I realized was something even bigger. Every night, when my family is around, I feel lonely. But when they weren’t there, I understood that I don’t actually need anyone to feel complete. If someone doesn’t want to be with me, I can still live happily on my own. As the eldest daughter, I have often been ignored because of my younger brother. But now, I’ve finally understood—there is nothing wrong with being alone.\n\nThis morning, I woke up, spent some time soaking in the warm sunlight on the terrace, and now I’m making myself a cup of tea. After this, I’ll do some housework, and before my parents return, I’ll prepare a meal for them.\n\nHonestly, this experience made me realize that being alone doesn’t mean being lonely. It’s peaceful, freeing, and fun! No unnecessary stress, no chaos—just me, my time, and pure happiness.\n\n\n\n\n",

I can understand why she resents us to an extent, my brother and I are rape babies and we look like our dad.

The last few times we've gotten in fights I never even yelled once and just keep talking calmly because I heard that helps calm angry people down, it doesn't work she just keeps yelling, and there's even been a few times when I do raise my voice that she literally covers her ears and says \"lalalala\" like a toddler until I stop talking. \n\nAfter she threatens this, she usually leaves the house and says she's never coming back and says we can live with our grandmother. She says either that she's gonna drive off a cliff, into a brick wall, etc etc, or that she'll just straight up abandon us and start a new life somewhere. Then she'll come back some time later and act like nothing happened, very rarely she'll apologize but if I ever try and bring up what she's done again when she's calm, she'll just get enraged again. I've tried talking to her about it through text only once when she was out of the house, sending her a lengthy few paragraphs about my concerns, but she responded back basically just shaming me, and when she came home she was angry and she said she showed the text to all of her friends, which are mostly my friends parents, and she said they don't like me anymore and I won't be able to hang out with any of my friends anymore. I started avoiding all of my friends and eventually began online school because of this, and now my mom claims all my friends and their parents miss me and they don't understand why I don't talk to them anymore. I don't know what to believe anymore.\n\nWhen she isn't in these weird freak out modes she's an okay mom but she snaps at random stuff before flipping like a switch and being happy again. Just yesterday she was yelling and slamming around her computer because she couldn't upload her photos to Facebook, she's a photographer. A few people had just been over to fix our dryer about an hour earlier, which has been broken for months, so mid yelling at her computer she just got up and went to go text out the new dryer and then when it worked she was all smiles and apologized for yelling.\n\nShe also frequently tells me and my brother that we're the only thing keeping her alive and that she would probably kill herself without us, and she's told us multiple times that she doesn't own a gun because she's afraid that when we grow up and move out she'll kill herself because she has no one to rely on anymore. This scares me and I want to move away for college when I'm grown, I planned on leaving this household as soon as possible, but I don't really want to anymore because she keeps saying things like that. She says stuff like that and says she loves me and my brother, but then says the exact opposite when she gets really angry and says she wants to die because of us and she blames everything she's mad at on us \"stressing her out\". She's also gotten physical with me and my brother multiple times, like digging her nails into the back of my neck and holding my face into a pillow because I wouldn't give her my phone because she said she was gonna break it, chokeholding me and dragging me out of me room before locking me out of my room and tearing it apart because I hid my art tablet from her, and more. She's done stuff with my brother too and I'm ashamed to admit this but I don't know what because whenever she's mad at him I just hide in my room so I won't get punished for helping him. He does the same when she does that stuff with me. I only know she hurts him because I can hear it. \n\nI don't want to call the police, I'm scared and I don't want to live with my grandma or in a foster home or anywhere else and I don't want to be separated from my brother and pets. She actually encourages me to call the police on her and says she'd rather go to jail than live with us. I just want to explain to her how her her actions hurt me and my brother and I want to get her to stop. There's been periods of times where everything has been fine for a while and my family is just a normal happy family and I cry sometimes thinking about how that's what my family could be like if my mom wasn't the way she was. I know I'm doing it to myself at this point by not calling the police but I'm just scared and keep hoping things will change.\n\nRight now is one of those times where everything's fine, my mom is currently talking to my brother, offering to clean off the couch and sit and braid his hair while they watch the movie together. We're all acting like nothing's wrong. I just wish my family could be this way all the time.",

        "selftext": "I usually don't post about this kinda stuff online or really talk about it out loud with anyone, to be honest; It's often just a page on a random notebook where I braindump anything and everything that crosses my mind at the moment when I feel like it's too much to handle. \n\nToday is different. I decided to expose it exactly because I never did. Been trying different stuff to see if something changes, in hope that any change could chain more and eventually things get better.\n\nI've always felt sort of an inadequacy around life, if that makes sense; A feeling that I never really belong anywhere or am passionate about anything. I'm currently 30 years old and so far I've been navigating passively. I wonder if there is such a thing as not really fit to being alive. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a cry for help and I'm not planning on hurting myself in any way; Also, I'm not trying to throw a pity party, I'm coming from a place of trying to figure this out logically.\n\nLike I said, I'm currently 30. Turned 30 this year. I still live with my parents, am unemployed but am currently studying computer science at an university. Never really been into a relationship, but I do have some good friends and a loving familt, for the most part. Still, there is something wrong with me. I look around sometimes and hear shared experiences from other people about romantic adventures or success on their jobs and I feel like I want that. It's not jealousy, mind you, it's more of a self questioning as to where have I been if not doing all that stuff?\n\nMy current situation is my fault, and I understand it's not good and even then, I don't have the strength or willpower or whatever you may call it to change it. It's like part of me wants to experience the world and... I guess a good way to explain it is, I want to want to do stuff, but I don't know what or how to start.\n\nStarting things is another problem of mine. I know what needs to be done and even so starting things is so difficult that it's insane. Normally that could be ruled out as being lazy or procastination but frankly, I've putting things off for 30 years, the problem has to be something else right? Currently, I know that I should be sitting down to work on programming projects to create portfolios and help me get employes but doing so is... hard. Not as in, programming is hard, it's not that. I'm also not scared of making mistakes, I embrace them as an opportunity of learning. It's a mix of not knowing where or how to start and perhaps a disbelief that it is going somewhere? I even thought at some point this might be related to me playing too much games or watching too many shows but even if I cut all that off, I still won't do what I need. I'll spend time laying in bed, overthinking, planning too much for stuff I never have the guts to get done.\n\nI guess you could call me a leech, but I don't feel like it's the case. I don't take pride nor plan on taking advantage of my dad's kindness forever, but I just feel... lost? It's always been hard for me to set goals to achieve because I feel like I don't really have anything. I can feel content with so little and that's maybe the reason why I never try and get more. I don't consider myself ambitious: Having fancy stuff or being famous or helping people... None of that stuff really pushes me forward. And those are the common stuff that people want so how can I move forward without a good reason to?\n\nThere are things I'm interested in, yeah. Like learning languages. But also some stuff I'd love to try and have no money for right now like woodworking maybe, music and theater.\n\nI still feel like a kid, frozen in time watching it go by and desperately trying to grow up but failing miserably. And although I umderstand there is no point in thinking too hard about my past mistakes that led here, I'm scared that I'm forever trapped in this loop of not being able to move on. I want to escape, but am not sure what I should do. Therapy would help I feel but I'll only be able to afford it when I manage to get a job. I'm hoping I'll manage to get my first internship this year and maybe talking to someone would help me figure things out. Sure, I have friends, but I don't feel like I have a safe space to be vulnerable with them or anyone else in my family.\n\nI always thought, back then, that I would have this figured out by now. Sometimes I think all it's needed is a small change that gets other things in motion, so lately I've been trying to do that. Doing things differently, trying to experimenting new stuff. I recently created a routine to try and force myself to do stuff; It hasn't helped much so far because even if I write things down I end up forgetting to look at the list or just can't bring myself to do it but on good days, I actually get a small amount of stuff done.\n\nI'm the kind of person who tries to understand and look for a purpose on everything and this here is kind pointless. This post went nowhere and is not going anywhere. Kinda like my life so far. It's funny to think that. But that's why I decided to do it. I'm not sure things will work out and despite hearing positive encouragement from my friends, still can't see much of a future for me but I'll keep doing what I can and trying my best, even if it's not the most optimal for a normal human being.\n\nIf you actually managed to read this far, my apologies for this mess. I wrote as the thougts came, no organization or anything. \n\nI hope someday I understand myself and determine my purpose.",

        "selftext": "Well i dont hate HATE him. I still respect my husband. He provides a lot, roof over me and our son’s head, food on the table, water to drink.. yeah what am I complaining for right? I should always be grateful that im in this position, which i am. It’s just there are things that still bothers me, that ruins my mood, sucking the soul out of me little by little, draining my life day by day, inch by inch. Idk if im just a whiny wife, but here are some things that messes w my head everyday:\n\n1) He NEVER puts his coffee mugs in the sink after he used them, there’s always hundreds of them outside where he smokes (i told him a million times to put it in the sink after he finish using it, i dont mind washing it, JUST PUT IT IN THE FUCKING SINK) but noopee, still compiling outside the house. Til this day, i let it be, there are still 4-5 mugs outside the house, not gonna touch it ever unless he brings it in. This is so sad for me, cus he knows i got a bad eczema on my hands, so everytime i wash BUTTLOADS of dishes, i have to wear gloves, wash the gloves, dry the gloves, also wash my hands bc rubber gloves makes me itchy a bit etcetc my main point is its hell and back on earth for me to do dishes, and he’s not considerate of that. We once had a big fight bc when we’re at our inlaws (his fam) he fucking WASHED HIS MUG??? Huh? Since when the fuck do u do that? So you care what your family says about you instead of caring about your eczema hands wife? Yea fuck you.\n\n2) he rarely takes care of our son. I literally do everything. He only takes care of him if i told him to. Sometimes when i shower, i have to actually ask him ‘can you watch him for a bit’ he has this ugly smug face and said ‘k’ like um wtf? You’re supposed to b excited?? He’s your son??? You will b rarely seeing him cus you work offshore???? Get this, infront of his family, he acts so fatherly, playing with him, taking care of his diapers etc while me, if we’re actually home, IM DOING ALL THE FUCKING STUFF, not him. He literally does shit IF i tell him to. He’s never considerate of how tired i am 24/7. 90% of the time if I dont wanna see his smug face if i have to shower and no one is watching our son, i had to put our son in his crib and let him watch ms rachel on ipad, eventho it hurts me doing that cus im limiting his screen time. And what was my husband doing that time? PLAYING LEAGUE OF LEGENDS, and he’ll be like ‘sorry im in game, i cant quit’ well fuck you. And also get this, when i found out that im pregnant and i wanted to abort it (cus i know im not ready) he was the ONE who strongly insisted to keep it cus he said he cant wait to be a dad. Well step the fuck up bro\n\n3) idk if im wrong or just exaggerating but he prioritizes his family over me and my son. If there was a fire, he would save his 4 brothers and 5 sisters instead of his wife and son. He would go to the ends of the earth for them ( once he had to deliver something car oil at 6AM for his sister n her husband, 6AM??? Mf usually wakes up at 2pm ffs. \n\n4) he has this obsession w fixing up old cars he would spend loads of money on it and w literally his blood, sweat, tears and his time. Yo i don’t mind mf got a hobby, i got a hobby too, that’s great for him, but wht abt when i need to shower???? Do i have to go outside to ask you to watch over our son again with your ugly smug face again?? to sum up he has 2 obsession, league of legends and his car. None of which you can bother him at all. My hobby is just gym. JUST GYM. FOR 1 HOUR. At which i can ONLY work out when my son takes his afternoon nap! I just want him to evenly schedule his hobby.. not to the point he doesn’t have time for his son or me. Do u think he listens? Nah. Everytime i told him this he’ll be like ‘this is the only time i can do this, while im working at sea i cant do this stuff’ im like HELLO? cars and games are forever?? Your wife and son could leave you or die anytime? wtf is his mindset mahn istg he’s still acts like a teenager. I literally feel like i have 2 sons as of this time.\n\n5) his dirty clothes and socks. Need i say more? I feel like almost every wife experienced this. \n\n6) he spills his coffee and chocolate milk every where in the kitchen but never wipes it. (I once saw the mf VACUUMS his family’s kitchen bc there was a spilled rice grains). Basically he’s really sloppy. \n\nThere are more but that’s the top of my head. Idk what I should do. Everytime i tell him whats been bothering me, we always have a huge fight and it always ends with (ok i promise i wont do it again) but he still does and its and endless cycle. I cant leave him bc I literally have no money to raise my son alone (AND my mom is getting old, so i have to take care of her too). So til now im just tolerating everything but it drains my energy so much but at the same time i put on a happy smile on my face for my son, i dont ever want my son to see depressed or angry. \n\nMind you, he used to b very sweet and thoughtful at the beginning of our dating life and marriage life. I thought he was the most amazing guy. I know he loves me and my son, but i dont think he loves me enough to change his ugly habits. ",

His brother was in the bathroom and his wife was talking to other family. So being the nosy assholes we are we listened. \n\nTurns out his brother has been having an AFFAIR on his PREGNANT WIFE. We heard the woman tell him that she wanted him to divorce his wife for her but to wait until after his wife gives birth which is in a few months. Apparently she ‘doesn’t want him to stress his wife out into a miscarriage’. And that she still wants him to be in the child’s life and she’s be an ‘amazing step mother’. What’s worse is he agreed though I don’t know if he’d actually go through with it or not. \n\nWhat. The. Fuck. Is. Wrong. With. People.\n\nShe said she had ‘morals’ on the call. BULLSHIT!

        "selftext": "Growing up in a small town in England, I always felt like an outsider, even in my own family. I loved them, but I never truly felt like I belonged. When I moved to New Zealand at 16, I hoped things would change, but I found it even harder to make friends and felt even more misunderstood. That sense of not fitting in just followed me.  \n\nOver time, I started wishing I had been born into a different culture—not because I think life would’ve been better, but because something just never clicked with my own. I’ve always found my culture awkward and uninteresting, but when I met my first South American friend, something felt right. The more people I connected with from Chile, Peru, Brazil, and Colombia, the more I felt at home.  \n\nI know South America is incredibly diverse, and I don’t mean to generalize, but I can’t ignore the feeling. Maybe belonging isn’t about where you’re born, but where you feel understood.",

        "selftext": "To start off, I’m 27(f) with a 22(m) boyfriend. We’ve been together for almost 3 years, and we met due to working together. I still cringe at our 5 year age gap. I have a friend that is 30(f) and I don’t know if I am a complete a**hole for wanting to cut ties with her, or maybe I already accidentally did.\n\nThe last time I saw her, I ended up staying for a weekend which was fun at first, and we tried to drink, but we both fell asleep too fast, which her boyfriend got mad about. I did not like this boyfriend (36m) due to him constantly sleeping with his ex and being so obvious about it but she’d be in this denial or whatever and cry to me constantly about it. He was also somewhat a neglectful parent to his daughter from what my friend would tell me. So anyways, the next day came and I agreed to stay an extra day to watch her two daughters, and figured I’d be getting paid because we discussed it prior. Well I didn’t and during this, I ended up getting bed bug bites on my neck, hands, and ankle area. Pretty much where my skin was exposed. Since leaving there I still feel like I have bugs on my skin and I’m honestly afraid to ever go back. I don’t know why I pick and choose when to be confrontational because I just let left and didn’t say anything. I don’t know whether to say anything at all. We’ve talked about bedbugs before and she’s said she’s gotten rid of them so I don’t know what to say. Fast forward a few days and she tells me her and her boyfriend (36)m broke up and she’s back together with an ex (32)m. This ex (32)m was sleeping with a 17 year old girl and my friend (30f) let both of them move into her home with her two children, before they both just dipped and apparently had left the place trashed and that’s when the bedbugs originally came about around this time too. Oh, and that man(32m) knew her children for a few months and was having them call him daddy. I felt so uncomfortable witnessing all of this, and then seeing what she allows herself and her children to be put through willingly. For months I was telling her xyz was not right and she’d be defending herself and him (36)m until they broke up. At that point is when she is like oh I could never be with someone who does xyz and completely shitting on this man talking about everything she defended and excused, when she put up with it for months and would have continued to put up with it if he (36m) didn’t have his baby momma over again to stay the night after she had been begging him to stop for months doing that for months. So I’m just over it? I’m like why are you actively choosing to put yourself through these things? I don’t like to sugar coat things, because why the hell should I act like neglecting a child is okay just to be a girls girl? Their relationship wasn’t abusive or anything like that, a lot of accusations of cheating coming from both &amp; issues starting a few days after they began dating which is never a good sign but neither were afraid of each other it wasn’t like that, and she will put up with almost anything to keep a guy around and that’s my issue. I used to think she was a good mom, but I don’t think she’s that great anymore. I used to praise her when she would say she wouldn’t let strangers around her kids and doesn’t let anyone else watch her kids until I realized she’s letting men she just met meet her kids inside her home, and be around them unsupervised. I used to think she was a good mom until I realized she raises her daughters through sugar and electronics, and doesn’t really “watch” even though around her children. All of these realizations have come to me now after she broke up with her long term boyfriend of 2 years(34m) and have gone through 4-5 relationships in a year and I don’t think she’s the person I thought she was, and I feel awful but I don’t want to be around someone like that. So she has her new boyfriend ex boyfriend (32m) currently living with her again, and I sent her a message a couple days ago saying I think that he’s a pedophile and I don’t want to be around him to which she’s never responded, but has sent other things. I know that once her and her current boyfriend (32m) break up or start having issues, she will be wanting my pity party but I can’t do it anymore. I feel like I have no empathy for her anymore. If we had more to talk about than her and her relationships I feel like it wouldn’t be such an issue but she has no subsidence to her at all if it is not about a man. Any advice on what you would do in my situation? It’s not my life so I don’t know why I’m so bothered. ",

I (27M) haven't even been lucky enough to go on a date in like 5 or 6 years, but I have not given up hope even though things do look a bit bleak for me at the moment. I am a really busy graduate student, I try to fit in workouts and other activities too but it is pretty hard. I do not have a lot of extra energy left to put in substantial effort to find the right person for me on most weeks. So the thing I kinda wanted to get off my chest is I have been working on concepts/writing for a (fantasy) novel for a while when I get some time alone. With my life being romantically unfulfilled, I have fit in a relationship between two characters (the MC and another) to fulfill all the things that I have dreamed about. It was not really part of my original ideas for the story but it kinda just happened. Its pretty much all wholesome relationship stuff that I have never really got to have; the hand holding, the closeness, sharing feelings, tender moments, having each other's back, etc. As lame as it sounds, it has been decently fulfilling for me. There are still days that I really could use a hug even from a friend, but there is something about getting all the stuff I have always wanted on paper that has been pretty nice and comforting. Even though adding this stuff in has been satisfying for me, I am a little afraid it makes the writing worse lol, and when its all finished it makes me that much more afraid to show it to anyone. Some of my friends know I have been working on this but have no idea there's romance involved in it. I just really wanted to get off my chest I have been vicariously living out my romantic dreams through my fictional characters because I do not really have a better outlet. I think its been a healthy way to express what I am missing out on?",

        "selftext": "So I (18f) just finished volunteering for the day at my workplace (animal sanctuary) yesterday, when I got a message from my boss to see he sent me a termination letter, nothing in the message either just the letter itself, and they have ignored me since. \n\nAlso sorry this is a long one, I just have a lot of things in my head I need to sort out. \n\nSo a bit of backstory, since I was around 14 I’ve been dealing with the struggles of depression, anxiety and adhd and ended up leaving school in yr10 because of it. Took a while to figure out but I ended up going to tafe to complete my cert ii and iii to become a qualified zookeeper as I’ve always loved animals and can’t see myself doing anything else. Because of tafe I had to start volunteering to complete the practical component of my course and ended finding this amazing sanctuary to work at. \n\nSo I ended up starting there in early February 2024 and fell in love with the place and the people. I was originally going once a week but started going twice a week in around November bc I loved it so much and wanted to be there more. They always told me they loved how I would be there consistently every week and I would pride myself on it as it was a big commitment for me as I lived an hour away. \n\nThe environment there was great, honestly I couldn’t have asked for it to be any better. The owners always quite involved and prided themselves on this and wanted us to feel more like family rather than a workplace. Because of this I became quite close with the people who were on my days and considered them my second family. \n\nThe owners also lived on site and their kids were always around, because of this I became quite close with them as well, even buying them small presents for their birthdays and helping them with their homework. \n\nI suppose I’m telling you this so you understand how close I was with them, their family and the other volunteers, so you can understand how hurt I am by the way they’ve handled this situation. \n\nEven on my bad days, they were half the reason I’d get up in the morning, even when I didn’t want to drive, or talk to people, I’d still show up bc I didn’t want to let them down, as again I seen them as my second family and greatly valued their opinion. \n\nSo fast forward back to yesterday, it was completely normal. Nothing out of the ordinary, we were still talking like normal, doing all our tasks as normal, having lunch together like normal, I even got a last minute tour and stayed back to finish it up, which brought in a fair bit of money for them. \n\nAlso just a note, it’s a non-profit, all the money from tours goes right back into the sanctuary to care for the animals, food and water, vet bills, etc. \n\nSo just my little routine afterwards, I stop on the way home to go to the bathroom, get food, etc. So I was checking my phone like normal, and seen he sent me an attachment, funny thing is I thought he was sending me a dumb reel or something. Boy did I have a rude awakening when I read termination letter. So naturally I read through it and start crying because again, that day was normal, there was not even a hint that something like this was coming. Luckily I had one of my friends with me so I didn’t do something dumb like driving with so many tears in my eyes I could barely see and probably getting into an accident. \n\nIn the letter he basically highlighted the fact that he wants to maintain a positive workplace and while he values my input, he needs to put the sanctuary first, blah blah blah, the typical things in a letter that would put the blame on me so he doesn’t seem like the bad guy. \n\nSo one important thing to mention, they say this to everyone but from the start they said that they’re the kind of workplace to make sure everyone’s included and don’t like people to form cliques. However, I became really close to two people in particular, specifically because they’re great friends and have done so much for me. \n\nNow while I was really close with these two, I feel we included everyone when we could. Especially since some days at the sanctuary we’d be so busy we’d barely see each other that day. So we’d always go out for lunch, however we’d always ask everyone if they wanted anything and never ate out, always came back to be a part of the whole team. (We’d all have a break at the same time.) \n\nNow obviously being friends, we’d hang out after work, (but again we’d ask some people if they’d wanna come if we weren’t going too far away.) And we would call and stuff, but I feel it’s normal for friends to do that. \n\nSo one thing I could see where they wouldn’t have been to happy with this, is that we were doing an animal course about 5 hours away. You have to finish the online part first before you go do the practical bit. So one of my friends told the boss that we were going to be doing it (he already done it prior and was just driving us), and unlike the last time it was done, they didn’t put it on the group chat or anything for people to say they’re interested. I think they assumed we’d tell people that we were doing it and ask if they’d want to come. Mind you this was about a month in advance, so plenty of time for people to do the online section. I will say this course ends up being quite expensive so some people weren’t able to do it due to financial reasons anyway. \n\nAnyways long story short, one other person from the sanctuary ended up doing the course (btw the course only has 4 spots for the Prac part). We had a great time and included him in nearly everything we did (he traveled separately to us so was only left out of stuff we did on the way). We even had a game night and everything and really the only people who were left out were the people who couldn’t come but wanted to, which I don’t blame them for. \n\nI can only assume that this is the reason they fired us (my friend that drove was quitting, next week was going to be his last, however they messaged him yesterday basically telling him to not come back, and my other friend also got a letter similar to mine.) \n\nAgain, I was completely blindsided by this, as yesterday and even the last few weeks were completely normal. No they didn’t even try to chat with us, saying something like, ‘hey this is what we can see is happening and we don’t like it, can you just try to include the other people more’. Something like that and I wouldn’t have been as devastated. \n\nThe only other thing it might be is that I would make some pretty crude jokes, although I wasnt the only one that would say them, and me and my boss would say them to each other and everything (we’re Aussie btw, it’s part of our culture I suppose, if we don’t know you or don’t like you, we’ll be quite civil/polite to you, but if we do like you then you’ll probably cop it.) although I don’t think this was the problem bc again it wasn’t just me making these jokes. \n\nI guess what hurts the most, is that I really respected my boss and viewed both of them quite highly. Like they’re great people (at least I use to think so), they’re great parents, really community oriented and from what I’ve heard, quite highly regarded in our field. So basically for him to not even have the decency to even send me a message along with the letter it is what hurt the most. So naturally I sent them both a message, asking them to give me a call bc for my own peace of mind, I really need an explanation. Both of them (I assume accidentally) opened the message and I can see they read it, however they both ignored it. So I sent them an email this morning, however still waiting on a reply. \n\nI’ve never been through a breakup but I imagine it’d be like this, except instead of breaking up with one person, I’ve just lost my second family. With no warning, no explanation. \n\nAnyways thanks for listening to me ramble, sorry it was so long, I’m just kind of at a loss for now. Hopefully I’ll stop crying and get out of bed soon. Thank youse 🫶\n\nTLDR - I was volunteering at an animal sanctuary when I got a termination letter from my boss, with no warning, no explanation. I feel like I’ve lost my second family. \n\n\n",

All her and my mom do is fight and it’s too much, all my mom does is complain and say she’s gonna kick her out but she never freaking does. I’ve had a rocky relationship with my mom but it’s getting better but my step mom makes me literally want to move out. She complains when I do literally anything or if I go anywhere. Like a couple hours ago I used some nail clippers and a nail file to do my nails and I used hers (mind you she uses my shit all the freaking time) and me and my family used to Sharing stuff If someone needs it and she texted me while I’m at work bitching at me telling me not to use her shit and she’s sick of me. I told her sorry and she just kept going demanding that the minute I get home I gotta give them to her (which I already planned to before but I had to leave for work) I’m literally a minor and I work two jobs and she’s always on my back calling me lazy and spoiled. She loves to compare her childhood to mine (she didn’t have the best childhood) she told me I’d never make it if I went through what she went through, mind you I’ve been through abuse and assault ontop of that depression and anxiety. I literally just want her to get off my back, any advice or help? (Sorry if there’s spelling or anything I’m at work writing this)",

        "selftext": "Am I being used?\n\nDo I (26F) need a reality check? I’ve been friends with my friend, Blake (26M), for over a year now. We have been pretty close since the beginning. When we first met, we bonded over our shared love for playing soccer together and music. I would say we have many similarities. We both enjoy adult animation, like Studio Ghibli, raves, and playing board games. Since we shared many similarities, we kept in touch daily through text messages, phone calls, and FaceTime. We had a mutual friend named Jennifer. Jennifer and I were very close until I noticed that whenever we spent time together, she spoke negatively about everyone around her. As a result, I gradually distanced myself from her. Around the same time, Jennifer and Blake started dating. Although I wasn’t close to Jennifer and didn’t personally like her, I wanted Blake to be happy. Blake and I maintained a consistent relationship and communication. We talked every day, even during our lunch breaks, via FaceTime. However, things took a turn when Jennifer informed Blake that I had feelings for him and wanted to pursue a romantic relationship with him. That was not the case, and I was even in a relationship at the time. As a result, Blake ended our communication to preserve his relationship with Jennifer. We did not talk for eight months. However, in January he reached out to me. He told me that Jennifer suddenly broke up with him in December. Since then, we’ve been hanging out again. In February, we attended a rave and ended up having sex that night. A week later, we confessed to each other that we had both harbored feelings for one another since we’ve first met. At this point, I informed him that I didn’t want to be a rebound, and he responded by stating that he wasn’t ready for a relationship and wanted to focus on healing. I accepted his decision. We continued spending time together and continued having sex. However, I later told him that I no longer wanted to have sex with him because I was struggling to separate our friendship and romantic feelings. Around the same time his ex-girlfriend, Jennifer, filed a protective order against Blake.\n\nSidebar: Personally, I have had past experiences with abusive men, which may have influenced my perspective. However, I must admit that I am not entirely aware of the details of Jennifer and Blake’s relationship. Given Jennifer’s personality, I can’t help but wonder if this situation is a attention-seeking ploy. On the other hand, I have only heard Blake’s side of the story.\n\nHowever, I suggested that we establish boundaries. We agreed to refrain from having sex and I told him I need a break from constant communication. I also told him to fine another trusted friend to confide in about the Jennifer situation because I haven’t healed from my own trauma from the abusive I had endured. Blake expressed his agreement to the physical boundaries and expressed he didn’t want to lose me again and our friendship.\n\nSince implementing these boundaries, our relationship has undergone a significant change. We don’t talk that much anymore and when we do the protective order case seems to be the main topic of discussion. Although, last night, I visited Blake’s place to watch Star Wars. During the movie, he asked me to engage in a platonic cuddle. We did, and he said Thank you. I inquired about the reason behind his gratitude. He mentioned that my presence was naturing and made him feel less lonely. Am I only in his life  because he feels lonely?",

        "selftext": "\nThree weeks ago me (28f) and my husband (29m) went out to a bar. When we got there, we happened to run into a middle school friend of his. We got to talking and his friend was sharing stories about when they were in middle school together. Like the time his friend walked into the wrong restroom by mistake and was made fun or for a year and when my husband got hard asking out a girl, after a few more embarrassing and funny stories his friend who we'll call Jeff says \"hey remember that dog\". I think you can see where this is going. My husband started breaking down laughing and I was totally confused. So I asked \"what dog\" Jeff explained in sixth grade was/is/whatever the terminology is a \"zoophilia\" he was sexually interested in a dog named \"champion\" he didn't do anything but got a boner after he was playing with this dog. He and his friend shocked about it for a while but he kept taking pictures of this dog. It started to move from joking territory to creepy. Three months later, he attempted to kidnap the dog. Thankfully, Jeff's father (the owner of the dog) caught him.\n\nIs it weird that I'm reconsidering my marriage even though this hasn't been a problem in decades. My whole view of my husband has changed, so am I over reacting to my husband's middle school issues?",

        "selftext": "It has been almost 15 years since it's slowly started to dawn on me that my sister never really loved me: she just thought I was so much lamer than her, that she didn't see me as a competiton.\n\nFor the context: she is 10 years older than me and for as long as I can remember, I loved her more than anyone alive. I loved her more than our parents, brothers, friends etc. She was my absolute role model and everything she did was perfect.\n\nIt is fucked up to compare kids ever, but when parents and relatives are comparing two people who are so different and not even in the same age group, that is especially fucked up.\nShe was always labeled the beautiful one, me as the smart one. She was the caring child, I was the mean one. Her life was hard, mine was easy.\nEverything that was happening to her was always celebrated if it was good, or we were all devastated together with her if it was bad - and it was never her fault when it was bad.\nEverything I ever did was considered as luck, or as normal if it was good and my fault if it was bad. \n\nShe loved me back and always worked on building my self confidence - but never to the extent of me succeeding in being better than her in any way. This was particularly obvious in her relationship with our parents, where she told me multiple times that our father wanted mom to have the abortion when she was pregnant with me. Any sign of me not liking that thought was being met with the comment along the lines of \"me being too sensitive\" or \"oh, come on, he loves you now\". I reacted explosivelly about that only once, when I told her openely to go fuck herself with those fucked up pieces of info, which, of course, ended with her being in tears, appologizing, and making me promise THAT I WILL NEVER REMIND HER ABOUT THAT EVENT. She made it about her and her feelings and I was told by the involved parties that I shouldn't have been so hard on her.\n\nThese were occasional outbursts, when I would always make a conclusion that I over reacted and I would end up crying, begging her to forgive me and promising never to do it again. Bear in mind - we are talking about my teenage yeara here, not adult me.\n\nFF to my 20s: while she had one relationship with her then long-time bf, who became almost like a family member, I mostly fucked around and either didn't really meet reciprocated feelings in guys, or I didn't even want anything serious. She eventually broke up with him - it was a family tragedy, ofc, like anything bad that happens to her - and she somehow put us both together to \"we are never getting married\" file. I mean, she never said it, but it was obvious that she is not supportive of my potential relationships. I kind of knew it, but I became sure about it when I started to date my now husband, when I was 25, and as I became more self-assured because I felt loved, she started to become more and more openely toxic, and she was doing it often. She would use every opportunity to let me know she thinks he is lazy and irresponsible, while I didn't think any of that.\nShe started to hate my hobbies, style, habits (which didn't change much - I just wasn't as miserable as before) and she was suuuuper pissed when she broke with her second bf and I got engaged.\nShe called me and raged about how it is inconsiderate that everyone is saying \"congrats\" on social media, while they are aware of her recent break up. I felt bad because during the last year of her relationship she lost one pregnancy, but I still didn't think that I should hid posts my boyfriend put on social media when he proposed.\n\nAfter that, it all went downhill.\nShe was good to me either when something super good would happen to her, or when something really bad would happen to me.\nShe hated my wedding day and pregnancy, but she was full of understanding when I had PPD. She did nothing to help, but she was good to me then.\nAs soon as I got better, she was hating me again. In the meantime - all good that was going on in her life was still celebrated and all bad was mourned, while my life was kind of unimportant to our mutual loved ones (mostly).\n\nI started to fight back, but I was rarely talking shit about her to our family, while she wasn't really private about her opinion on me. Every time when she would show her good side again, I would come back to life because I would regain the hope that the most loved person from my childhood is still there.\n\nRecently, I lost all hope that I will ever want her back in my life. Our father died and in his final months, while I was crying my guts out and doing EVERYTHING to help him - as we all did - she told me that I was selfish as always and not showing any empathy towards him.\nThat was the straw that broke the camel's back for me and I screamed at her and told her to get the fuck away from me forever.\n\nWe did communicate after that, because there were many things that had to be done with our dad, and I was there for her to be her shoulder to cry on when she needed me, but it was just because I felt I had to, for the rest of our family.\n\nAs our dad passed, my feelings of disgust came back and I am back to feeling hurt by our last fight. She mentioned it briefly and said that it was just a dumb fight, as she always does after moments like that, but to me - it wasn't. To me now, none of the fights we had were dumb and they were all about one thing: her wanting me to be the obedient, loser sister that she had when I was from 0 to 20-ish and her from 10 to 30-ish.\n\nI can't stand the thought of her hanging out with my kid anymore. My kid loves her and I was so happy when my sister and I patched our fight from a few years ago and she had good relationship with her niece, but honestly - I have two fears:\n\n1. She would fuck her up the way she fucked me up,\n2. She would be telling my kid mean things to show me as a bad person, for whatever reason.\n\nOne thing I found out later, after my PPD was gone, is that she was planning to take the kid away from me \"because it seems like I am not fit to do it\", but she never considered talking to my husband about it. Like, he didn't have PPD, he was fine - why didn't she talk to him? Why was she planning to adopt the kid who was not out for adoption?\n\nAnyway... I am done with her, but I think I will need a lot of time to process this. Maybe therapy would be beneficial.",

        "selftext": "I don’t know if anyone remembers me but a while ago my girlfriend and I had a home invasion incident that culminated in her beating the shit out of the intruder. I’m tired of saying my gf so I’m going to call her Diana. \n\nTurns out the guy was a drug addict from the next town over. He was in his 60s and he had an extensive history in jail and mental hospitals. Unfortunately about two months after my post, he passed away. We didn’t know anything about why until we got a chance to talk to his sister, who insisted she didn’t blame Diana and that the doctors even said that he probably didn’t have much longer anyway. (Diana was visibly distressed during this conversation so I’m not sure whether or not the sister just said that to comfort her)\n\nAfter that Diana went on a trip to a national park during a week she knew I couldn’t take off and forgot her meds. She has seizures that look like mild psychosis/magical thinking and ended up refusing to come home at the end of the trip. She kept saying that she felt like she couldn’t leave the woods because she was certain there was something she needed to learn there that she hadn’t yet, and when I asked her how long that might take, she said “some people take a lifetime.” I asked if she was breaking up with me, and she said something about feeling like she was “too attached” to me, her house, her pets, etc and that she needed to meditate on that for a while. \n\nI ended up going to her temple to see if anyone was willing to give me some perspective on the situation since she was seeing things through a Buddhist lens. It was the right choice. A monk actually drove the six hours out to her with me to talk to her in person since she wasn’t picking up calls. I am so, so unbelievably grateful for that monk because Diana started taking her meds again and came home soon after. I’ve never been religious but I started to read the Pali canon afterwards and that shit slaps. Diana was already volunteering her time at the temple so now we both go together when we can. \n\nAll things considered, since then, things are back to normal and going well. We’re both children of divorce so even before all this we were doing prophylactic couples counseling every few months, and for a while after we were going once a week. Diana has started seeing a therapist on her own as well which I am so proud of her for since she’s always hated the idea of individual therapy. \n\nWe also stepped up our home security game. Diana already had plenty of cameras, but now we have door/window alarms and motion sensors. I also convinced Diana to get another dog, so now we have a 75lb puppy… \n\nI know a lot of people were rooting for us to get married, but that’s not going to happen. Legal marriage isn’t something that interests us and it never has. But we did buy each other rings, and it’s been a great comfort to have something physical to remind me of her on my person all the time. We’re also considering having a small commitment ceremony next fall &lt;3\n\nThanks again for all the feedback on my previous post. I got a lot of great advice, and some good criticism. I showed it to Diana and she got a kick out of the comments, and we had a little mutual cry over how kind a lot of you guys were. I asked her if she was okay with me posting this update, and she clucked at me and told me to do whatever I want online as long as I’m being nice (and anonymous lol). So… hope this qualifies! ",

        "selftext": "damn i will definitely be embarassed about this in the future but anyways  \ni've always been a sensitive person, i always cared about others and made sure to make them feel good and happy. My middle school years weren't the best: i had to move out of my old house and i completely changed life by moving to a town 50 minutes far from my previous residence. You can imagine that I, an introverted and nerdy kid, wasn't able to make many friends, and so i got lonely. In fact i was known as the lonely kid, no one ever wanted to talk to me and sometimes even made fun of me (i discovered some years later that everyone talked behind my back during those years, and that was the reason no one even wanted to approach me). And so i spent three years of my life by myself: i spent my days alone, definitely years that i wouldn't want to live again. Once middle school ended, i was full of hope: that same summer i made some friends and had a lot of fun with them, and so i was positive about starting high school. And so, once my first year of school started i tried to me more extroverted and social (the outcome was awkard, i'm not good at being extroverted). Even tho i tried, the outcome wasn't positive. This time no one talked behind my back, but i had trouble making friends and so i became the lonely kid once again. I was depressed, spent my days listening to music and sleeping all day just to escape that feeling of void that was suffocating, swallowing me whole. I was ready to end it all, but i wasn't brave enough to even try, so i kept living my life and eventually things got better. I made new friends, i became more social and felt truly happy after years of suffering. I am happy about how i lived the rest of my teenage years, but that feeling never got away. I am now left with an overthinking mindset (idk if i can call it like that), which leads me to anxiety about all the friendships that i currently live: i can't be calm, because i sometimes think that everyone will sooner or later go against me and make me live the hell i went through one more time. I can't trust anyone, and this thing is making me mad, because come on, why am i so defensive? why can't i just live my life like the others, and not worry about this? i don't truly know why i wrote this, probably to feel better or to relate to someone here who perhaps lived my same experience. Anyways, i feel costantly feel this overwhelming sense of entrapment in my own life, i feel like my past will always follow me, no matter what i do. No matter how many new people i will meet, i will always have this anxiety that they will disappoint me, and life is so hard this way. I don't even know if someone will read this, i will probably only get some upvotes and my post will be forgotten in this sub",

        "selftext": "This happened in mid January. For context, I am 32F and my boyfriend is 34m, we’ve been together for 3 years and we live together in a house that I own. Now for the story- my dad has been unwell for over a month and my siblings and I (mom died from cancer when I was young) have been taking care of him while we waited for test results and some answers. Last week his condition took a turn for the worst and he ended up being taken to the hospital by ambulance and has been in the icu for a week. He was diagnosed with cancer. We still don’t have all the answers and I don’t know what the future holds for my family. On the third day that my dad was in the icu, my boyfriend was at work and texted me about his plans for the following day that consisted of him meeting up with friends to “plan their trip.” I knew they had been talking loosely talking about potentially going on a trip at the end of the month, but I thought it was common sense that since my dad is in the hospital, the trip would be off…. Well apparently not. Needless to say, we had an argument. I told him it’s extremely hurtful that he would abandon me at a time like this. \nAfter a lot of back and forth throughout the day he let me know the trip was cancelled (nothing had been paid for or even booked yet), but at this point I just feel like the damage is done. Who would prioritize a “boys trip” when their partners only parent is extremely sick in the hospital. The obvious answer is to break up, but I don’t know if I have it in me to go through a breakup right now. It’s been a few days now, my dad is doing much better, he’s out of the icu and I’ve been there everyday helping him with his recovery so he can come home. I’ve been off work for the past week and a half during all this and went back yesterday and have been going to the hospital between shifts. My boyfriend has been moping around the house the last few days and every time I ask him what’s wrong he says “nothing” or “I don’t know, I’m just sad.” I said if this is about the trip, then just go. He says that’s not what it’s about. I suggested he goes to talk to someone , a therapist or a friend.. or me. He declined all of this. I asked what I can do to help, he said nothing and “I’m not his therapist” I said nothing and just collected my stuff and went to work. I have a lot on my plate already, and I’m feeling angry that he’s putting this on me now as well. We spent the next few days avoiding eachother around the house which was making my mental health seriously depleted. We finally had a conversation, I told him he should go on the trip because there’s no sense of him staying here if he’s not even going to acknowledge me or be supportive to me and my family anyways. The next day, he booked his flight. I tried to convince myself I was okay with it, but his 5 day trip suddenly turned into 10 days, and I just knew I was done. We had a few conversations while he was away, mostly me crying and telling him how angry I am with him. He came home, and I ended it as soon as he walked in the door. He begged and pleaded, said he “never would have left” if he knew I would end it because of the trip. There was a lot of back and forth and I asked him if he could just leave for a few days to give me some space, which he did. He ended up taking me on a date for Valentine’s Day later that week and things seemed to be getting a little bit better. We planned a night away the following week to try to connect again. During our “romantic night away” he decided it was a good idea to invite his friend and friends girlfriend to join us for dinner (the girlfriend ended up not coming so it was just me, my bf and his friend) ….. and then “surprisingly” a bunch of his other work friends just happened to be at the same restaurant. What was supposed to be a romantic evening to try to repair our relationship ended up being a table of 8 of us, talking about my boyfriends job. We went back to the hotel, got into an argument and went to bed angry. The next day we woke up and he got in the shower and left his Apple Watch on the night stand. I had that gut instinct to check his messages, and there it was. He was been messaging with another girl the entire time my dad was in the hospital and was meeting up with her for “coffee dates “ …. Which I highly doubt is all that happened. So ya, that’s it. He moved his stuff out last week , and the person I thought I knew for the last almost 4 years has become the person whose hurt me more than anyone ever has in my life. I’m on my own again, going to be 33 next month, and starting from scratch. I don’t know what the future holds but it has to be better than this, right? ",

        "selftext": "just saw a post about their narc maybe being DL and i’m realizing mine definitely was, and after everything he did and blaming me for it he said that’s why he did it and couldn’t have let us every happen or get married bc of his hidden desires. (exact quote at the bottom) in the beginning, he said he had a deep fetish, he said it was humiliation at first. then the real truth was later revealed to me. and then it wasn’t until after the break up he said there was sissy and cross dressing and that he might be gay. which is so bizarre bc one he only ever told me about the real kink way later and never told me the full details of it and he loves women sexually and is very sexual and addicted to porn. but he was interested in trans women and anal sex i guess.\n\nit’s wild bc he always said he could never be in a relationship with a man bc he needed a woman who was submissive and he had control over basically. he wanted a woman in her feminine energy but wasn’t safe enough to let me stay there. after our break up also, he went on a power kick after i was trying to say goodbye like i guess trying to regain power and he was being agressive and telling me to submit and basically confirm that he was right and i was wrong and legit got hard from it. the next day i said “i will only submit to a man who protects and takes care of me and does not abuse me” and he said he would still abuse me and i should stop “whinning” about it.\n\nthere were times he wanted to have sex with me while watching porn and wouldn’t show what the porn was, or giving him bjs and hjs while he watched porn.\n\ni’ve posted my story lots but have left out this major detail bc it felt wrong to discuss but for reference, we got engaged, i uprooted my life to go move in with him in another state. 6 days after the proposal and me thousands of dollars deep into the move, he called it off unprovoked (bc by this time i had been “perfect” according to his unreasonable standards) but he still blamed me. this is all after months of emotional  and verbal abuse. i lost my home, a job, a baby, mental health, love, my best friend, my safety\n\nthe realization is: \n- he legit told me he loved his fetish and addictions more than me. and he also said after he broke off our engagement and putting me through absolute hell and destroying my life and financially abusing me and me loosing my home to go move with him after our engagement, AFTER blaming me for the reason why he did it and a couple weeks after i came back to my state and was recovering from the move. \n\nhe said “So we get married have kids And I say by the way I love wearing diapers. Dressing as a girl and letting dudes or someone fuck my ass? I wasn’t gonna let that happen” and that he wasn’t sure if he was bi or gay.\n\ni couldn’t tell if he was saying all of that as a ploy to make it “easier” to be friends with him, bc he was actively saying he wanted me in his life and he said would it be easier if i were gay and then told me all those things. idk if it was more manipulation or if it’s true. i know his kink is a major thing and it wasn’t something i was into and he wants to be with someone romantically who isn’t into in but still have sexual encounters with people who are into his kink. i can never tell when he was being honest or just saying something to get a certain reaction out of me. there were several times he’d say “im going to go fuck this girl tonight bc you stress me out” and then i’d find out he was home along and not with her. his mom would tell me or he later would tell me he never did. there were plenty of cases like this too. he would just say things to make me believe it. so i couldn’t tell if he was saying he might be gay for that instance too. idk. \n\nin no way am i being insensitive to sexuality or kinks. i was very supportive to him through it all but this is just making me realize he was never going to follow through and legit used me. \n\n— he basically admitted to putting me through hell, abusing me very thoroughly, blaming it allllll on me and my character flaws, made me lose my home to move states with him, tell me entire family we got engaged, lose my job, and spend thousands on moving, lose a child, all to cancel our engagement and move during a mania spike he had and BLAMES IT ON ME, all while he was literally never going to be capable of following through.\n\nthere were so many signs too im realizing now that i’ve missed. he used to straight up tell me that he was mirroring me and i thought that was weird bc women typically mirror the man. he used to also say he’d just find someone to marry him out of convenience bc he wasn’t capable of love. he was always so selfish in every aspect of our lives. he always made it known to everyone and called me his wife and loved the image that it gave him but treated me like dirt. this man was straight up telling me he was a narcissist and i missed the signs in a haze. \n\nhe emotionally, verbally, mentally and financially abused me for literally nothing. bc i was kind and sweet and supportive and empathetic and showed him love he couldn’t even fathom. he literally watched me as i bent over backwards for him and took care of him and lost the stability in my life to create one with him while he was just belittling me and destroying my worth and esteem. he needed control over me bc he lacked it in his own life and addictions and self. and was never going to marry me or create the life together we planned bc his demons and desires would have never allowed it even when i was accommodating and understanding. but the blame is all on me for loving him and having needs.\n\nthere’s so many factors to this and so many versions of him, it’s hard to wrap my head around it all ",

        "selftext": "I don't know where to start with it all. This is going to be long, and if any of you get to the end, I appreciate you taking the time to read my story. I would say that this feels like a common place story that happens to a lot of people in different ways. I just need to get my story told. almost feels like I am just asking for pity, maybe I am, and that is an issue with myself because seeking pity is not good for one's mental health, but what I've been holding in also isn't good for my mental health. I'll start the story at 4 years ago when my relationship started. It started 7 years ago. I start there. I was a lonely type of fella and I did not have much relationship experience from my time growing up and being in high school total of 2 relationships before this current one I find myself in one 8 months with it ending with me getting cheated on and the other 1.5 years with me proposing and then getting cheated on. Both in-person and then transitioning to long-distance, you'd think I'd learned my lesson the first time. Anyways, I go about a year of being single and searching for love as all young people do, and nothing worked for me: dating apps, social events, or just finding people in places that you'd want to be able to share interest with. Until one day, I posted a nice thirst trap online to get the self-seeking validation that I felt I needed at the time, and someone slid into my DM's someone that I had known from HS but never truly talked to. I began talking with this person, and then we grew closer every day, despite being long distance with a 3-hour time difference. We Facetimed each other every once in a while and then twice a week and then every day. The problem at the time in that relationship was two things: I was not emotionally intelligent, and I had a group of guy friends that were semi-toxic. My significant other was not fond of my friends as they wanted to go out and party all the time, which I didn't mind doing, but it wasn't my cup of tea. So I spent more time talking with her, and then one day I tried to introduce her to my group of friends on Facetime, and she talked to everyone a little bit and just found them all disgusting and asked to talk to me again. She said something along the lines of Wow, can't believe you did that and hung up on me. Now for me, I was confused because my buddies did the same thing with their signifcant others and no one was upset and it was nice getting to know the person they loved back home(for a little context me and my SO had not met up yet we were still having facetime and what not). It was also a surprise for her because when she called, I was hanging out with my buddies, and one of them picked up. So after she hung up I called her back in private and I asked her what was wrong and she told me that she felt disrespected by what happened and that was our first big fight with each other, and it ended with me texting her updates of when and where I am so she knows if she can call with me. I agreed with it all, not thinking that it was a big deal. We continued the relationship with one another with basically a gradual turn of all my free time being spent with her. I neglected friends and became somewhat isolated from my world. As an inexperienced youngling, I didn't see that issue. I kept the good friends and started distancing myself from my friends we'd hang out with, but it started to be less and less as the month went by. I would say that we are about 8 months into this relationship with each other when we first decided to meet up with each other and have about a week together. Now before we met with each other she alluded that there were things that she wasn't going to give me or ask of me unless we were dating because I hadn't asked her to be my girlfriend and I don't know why but that enticed me to figure out what she was alluding to and that brought me to the point of when meeting up with her I asked her to be my gf and she said yes but I was so nervous asking her it felt like she was a bit hesistant on that matter when replying yes. That happened the first day, and then we started dating with our first week in a relationship of hanging out with each other. I stayed at her place the whole week, and we did various things and hung out with each other. It felt like things went well for the week that we spent together; it felt like we connected, and everyone had a good time before we had to say goodbye and continue our long-distance relationship. After I got back to my home things started to change with our relationship she wanted more from me in ways of being more emotionally aware of my day and tell her my feelings and how things made me feel and as the emotinally unintellegnet person I was it was hard for me to change that in my everyday life, I was just going with the flow of life and never realy discussed my emotions with others becasue it never really came up in conversation. We argued about how I was still just discussing my day with her and not sharing my emotions with her, so I worked on it and slowly got better with being in touch with my emotions, yet I feel like it was never really enough for the relationship. As the months went by, she continuously felt like I wasn't telling her enough about my life and felt left out the more I told her about my day, so I committed to telling her everything that happened in my day as she was doing to me. Now, my struggle was that there was a lot that happened in my day, so I would sometimes do it when it happened in my day. Still, I would eventually tell her about it when we called each other every day. Still, she would then get upset that she missed out on knowing when it happened and what I felt in that period. Once again, being the emotionally unavailable guy I was, I tried my best to do what I could to satisfy that need for her. At this point, you're probably wondering why we just didn't break up. I have no clue; it's probably just me being weak-willed. At this point, I spent just about every waking moment texting and talking to this girl, and we got into arguments just about every single day, either about me missing information I was telling her or me not being emotional. Being young, I thought this was healthy because the arguments led to deeper conversations with each other and figuring out what made us who we are. I would say about 4 or 5 months after our initial meetup, I had pretty much completely distanced myself from my friedns with rarely ever hanging out with them but maybe once in a blue moon, but it made it harder in my relationship to hangout with them becausea of her wanting to know everything and me jsut wanting to spend time with friedns so there was communication delay from waht was happening in the conversation and what I was doing vs what was acutally happening in my life. This all led to arguments down the line, and then our next meet up, this time I was meeting her parents and she was coming to me. I set things up so that I could stay with her and got a friend that I was closer with that she seemed to like because he was married and approved more of our relationship. We spent the time together for about 2 weeks; this time, one week just me and her at my \"place\" and then a week with her parents. It seemed like another good meet up with both of enjoying ourselves but, a little bit of tension between us from the arguments and the fact I was moving from a 3 hour time difference to a 13 hour time difference, which we both imagined would put more of a strain on our relationship, her parents liked me on a side note. We parted ways, and I began my new path in life with her being in college and me being abroad for work. We had both been right tensions did increase with each other as I was abroad it became even hadrder for me to comunicate with her with everything that was going on in my day to day life as it was for the most part always unpredictable and hard to keep up with myself and she would sleep half way through my day as the time differnece so if she didn't wake up to a butt load of text about my day she felt upset and always had this feeling of misisng out on my life, so I continued to distance myself from others and not participating in group events and when I did I tried to keep to myself to minimize the updating I had to do. At this point, she just felt like I didn't love her because I wasn't involving her in my life the same way she was involving me in her life. She told me everything about her day, so this wasn't a double standard, and she was also busy, but I would say that I was definitely busier than she was. I continued to apoligize about the communication issues with keeping in mind I still was telling her about everything that happened in my day whenever we talked on the phone especially all the things I forgot to tell her and she felt that I conviently kept forgetting to tell her about the interations that I had with Females throughout my day beacuse as you can imagine she was jealous that other females got to interact with me throught out the day more and she didn't. I was better about telling her about female interaction through my day, but I still missed a few here and there. Sometimes, I got rides from females, and she'd get upset that I didn't tell them when it happened. She always felt she never got the full story the first time and she had to ask multiple questions to get the whole story and that was tiring for her and it got to the point where, I thought I was doing a good job but was not and I just gave up on updating her one day because life just got overwhelmed and I couldn't handle life and my relationship at the same time and she ended it after that day. I was devastated as we had been going through this struggle for almost 3 years, and it just felt like it was all for nothing. We met a third time before breaking up and were going to meet up a 4th before COVID-19 occurred and travel bans happened, which didn't improve our relationship. We broke up, I got friends, and started to move on with my life, slowly finding myself and what makes me happy. For about a year, I was single. I decided to move back to the same timezone as her and go to the college that she went to. Not expecting her to be in the area, not ever really knowing why I did it either. I wanted to complete college not being in a relationship, but that was not what occured. As you can expect, we ran into each other again and started dating because she felt like I was a changed man and was able to prioritize things in my life a little better. I can say that I did grow in the time after we broke up and explored my inner workings a little more. The thing is, she thought I started dating her again because she was a different person, but she hasn't really changed all that much, still wanting the same things, and I was more able to provide those things she wanted, and it felt like things were going in the right direction. We moved in with each other and where \"dating\" for a year until she said that she wanted more and didn't feel we were growing and she said it was because I had not asked her to be my gf so about 3 months of me trying to find the right time to ask and it not working out we get into an argument about it and I asak her and she says no ask another time. So I don't plan for it and just start asking her once a week until she just says yes about 2 months later while we are living and sleeping in the same bed with each other. Anyway, things started getting a little tenser between us. I don't have many friends as I learned not to make friends in this relationship, and I don't talk to my old friends much because it just causes conflict, and I'd rather avoid than lie. We continued dating, and for about 2 years, we lived in the same place. We have had our ups and downs through the two years. I changed my job twice and have a female supervisor; as you know, she is upset about that, but she ignores it better. She says she just, at this point in the relationship, buries her emotions and hides her concerns because she doesn't want conflict in the relationship, and she only ever feels that she has problems with what is going on in the relationship. We still argue a lot and have those arguments turn into deep conversations, and I become more and more emotionally drained as these arguments happen, and I can barely keep up with my studies, work, and relationship, yet I push on. We are starting to get to the real point of this story and why I am just done is that we were initially very active sexually in the beginning of our relationship like once a week and then it moved to once a month which you know I didn't think to much of it because I figure sex drive just went down as the relationship got more secured, but we just moved to a new place and signed a 15 month lease that niether of us can afford to break and I tried to be sexual with her this morning and she told me that it felt nice but shed been thinking of her ex when we've been doing stuff and that its kinda always been that way becasue she used to be very sexually active with her ex but he was fine with not having sex and she puts herself in his position and wouldn't want that pushed uponed her and makes her feel sad and turns her off from anything that we are doing and I tried to help her get to the root of it this morning before leaving to work and I just felt that I disrepected myself by doing that and not being more upset about her thinking of her ex and it just hurts because it means just about everytime we do sexual stuff its about how she feels about her ex and makes sense why she has to sometime watch things when I go down on her. Honestly I know that this is a super toxic relationship but, I love her so much and have tried so hard in this relationship with the time and effort I put in everyday it just sucks all of it \n\nTLDR; GF thinks of ex during intimate time after 7 years of relationship and gets turned off just about every time because she pushed herself on her ex, and her ex didn't care about having sex and she didn't like the idea of being in his position. So it has tanked our relationship, and everything feels distant and We moved to new place with 15 month lease no one can afford to break. I feel stuck",

        "selftext": "I (22 F) have had a chronic condition for more than 10 years now. \n\nThe thing is, it's something I haven't seen mentioned before or other people experiencing it. I feel so alone and I've seriously considered an \"escape route\" in the sense that I genuinely do not have a will to live.\n\nI have a chronic sore throat and it's ruining my life. I cannot drink or eat anything cold without getting ill after. Absolutely anything. **I cannot just eat ice cream and enjoy cold drinks.**  I always have a lump in my throat no matter what I do. After I eat/drink something cold or when I'm sick, this lump gets thicker and inflammation follows.\n\nBut the worst of all is second hand ciggarette smoke and other dense smokes. Just feeling it makes this lump get thicker and I start coughing.\n\nI cannot walk normally on the street and always have to avoid smokers that are everywhere. I cannot go out to bars, hang with people my age because they're all smoking. I am the insane one.\n\nThe doctors do not care since there is no concerning inflammation and I've been told to just deal with the smoke and \"avoid\" it as if that's possible. (I live in Eastern Europe) I've also had my tonsils removed, because the inflammation affected my bones and heart, but even after that, there's been no improvement.\n\nThe thing that's causing it is a bacteria called staphylococcus aureus and this chronic state most likely developed when I failed to do a treatment properly. I've been desperate to find an explanation for my pain on my own and was able to find just one scientific paper studying the sensitivity of this bacteria to second hand ciggarette smoke.\n\nI wish I could live somewhere isolated without pollution from smoke, but it's not likely since I'm just an average woman. No skills to survive on my own, nor the resilience for that. I am so tired. \n\nI do not see a future for myself. I've never had a relationship due to some other reasons in the past, and I don't see myself having one because of this.\n\nAlso sorry if this isn't the appropriate sub for this. I mostly posted this as a cry for help and maybe to attempt at finding people who relate. I'll remove my post if needed. Thanks for reading.",

        "selftext": "Life is feeling real batshit today.\n\nCame across my partner’s alt account on social media. Open to public viewing. They described it as an ‘orgasm journal’ where they seemed to be exploring self pleasure. Cool, love that. Very data-driven. Cut to a post about ‘collective’ episode with another online user. They had been exploring what sounds to be a lot like mutual masturbation where you’re turned on by the idea of someone watching, viewing things through a data-driven lens in the name of ‘research’. Naturally I lost my shit and messaged them.\n\nWe called and I told them all of the assumptions I’d made. They didn’t say I was wrong, just said ‘it’s research’. I feel like I’m getting pulled into insanity and delusion here. It feels like kink gone wrong. What do you mean it’s research?? Research is ethical? Having sexual conversations around topics that arouse you with another person for the purpose of sexual pleasure sounds like… infidelity to me? \n\nI can’t believe I had to tell this person who most of the time has their head on square &amp; thinks intelligently and rationally that this constitutes as cheating. It’s not research or data what are you talking about!! \n\nThey’ve just posted after our break up (yes I’m going to stop looking but it’s been 12 hours please let me wallow) that they’re open, not poly. Fast fucking turnaround when we were in a monogamous relationship literally 8 hours ago. \n\nWe were in a long term relationship and I cannot for the life of me process that this is the way it ends. Can someone please tell me I’m not going insane?\n\nEdit: just to clarify - we’ve had in depth conversations around our expectations of a monogamous relationship. I didn’t specifically set a boundary of ‘I am not comfortable with mutual masturbation online in the name of research’ because.. that’s very specific and not at all a normal conversation to have, lol. but I did explain what would be uncomfortable or deal-breaking for me and I would fully put the onus on them to have needed to clarify in this situation instead of going in blind because I think it’s very clearly something I would take issue with based on every other conversation we’ve had on the subject.

        "selftext": "TW: drug abuse \n\nSo, I don’t know how to start. My sister has/had a long-term relationship and I even considered him my brother because he was like that with me. They even have a child together. It all started last year when my bil asked my father for 400€  but not to tell my sister and he would pay it back as soon as he got paid. To this day he never payed back and he lost my father’s respect because of this. We suspected that he may be doing drugs but we kinda hoped he wouldn’t do something like this because he loves his child to the moon. There were few incidents where he acted off… we never interpreted much into this and just hoped everything would be okay. He works in a field where the future is the secured and a few weeks back he told us that he and his other colleagues were laid off but they would all receive loan payments till the contract ends. Idk it came with a surprise and I had a thought that maybe he was the only person that got laid off. I asked my bf about it because his father works in the same company but in a different department. He said he didn’t know anything about this. Well, wednesday was the incident that ruined my sister’s life. We don’t know what happened exactly but my sister has ended the relationship for good and threw him out because she found drugs. She told our mom that he had a history with drugs a long time ago but he swore it would never happen again. Since yesterday he is supposedly in rehab. I don’t how to talk to my sister about this and I don’t know what to think myself. He was like a brother and I always defended him to everyone. I am scared what will happen in the future, I mean what if he collapses again? Right now my sister is a single mom who works full time with only a half day daycare. I don’t know whether my bil was under influence when he was watching my nibling. There were times where he was alone with my nibling for two weeks. Was he driving under influence? And was my nibling with him? For how long was the abuse? Will my sister recover from all this? Was he thinking about what his abuse will do to my sister and nibling? Was he even thinking? \n\nThere is only so much hurt that a person can endure and my sister had enough in her life. My mind all over the place and I have so much questions I would like to ask but I know that I can’t get an answer. I would like to tell my bil how disappointed I am but I know that this would not help his rehab. My mind is all over the place and my heart is hurting and I can’t talk to anyone expect my mother but she feels the same way expect that her heart hurts more because this is her daughter. I don’t know what to do right now. I don’t know what to think. I don’t know what to feel. I don’t know how to help my sister. \n\nI had to get this off my chest, thanks for reading",

        "selftext": "Me and my husband have been married for 3 years and we had a rough start to marriage, we were both very toxic to each other and ended up putting hands on each other, but over time we go the help we needed and we are trying to rebuild but it’s been difficult very difficult. He was a virgin when I met him, and he was my second partner Ive been with. Lately I’ve been feeling very lonely and discouraged from trying to be “sexy” around him, before we got married and were dating he was very horny all the time and wanted it almost 3 or 4 times a day but now I’m lucky to even get with him once every week or 2 weeks and I’ve noticed that it’s always me initiating it, also he doesn’t really touch me he straight just only goes to fumble my boobs and nipples then goes down on me then we only do missionary and doggy that’s it and it takes about 30 min. \nOnce I didn’t initiate at all and wanted to see how far he will go to not having sex, it was a month and that’s because I couldn’t handle it anymore. Recently I’ve been trying to talk to him about it but he says that he wants to build up emotionally because of our past and doesn’t want to focus on the sexual stuff which I feel is important too. I’ve bought lingerie to maybe inspire him but all he does is say I look beautiful and that’s it he doesn’t go feral he doesn’t dirty talk, he doesn’t admire me, he doesn’t role play, he doesn’t grab my ass nothing, we don’t even make out. \n\nI’m starting to feel more like a roommate, I stopped putting in the effort of being a “woman” I stopped shaving I stopped plucking my eyebrows , I stopped waxing or trimming, I shower only once a week, because I thinks what’s the point? And yes I’ve brought this up to him multiple times and he says I still look beautiful and that’s he still loves me. I just don’t feel wanted or desired, I don’t know how else to explain it to him. I’ve said to get home and throw me on the bed and fuck the shit out of me but he says that no because he comes tired from work and dirty, which I don’t give a fuck, I’ve told him to look for more positions to try but he always says well you research and I’ll do it. Which I dont want I want it to come out of him to want me to desire me. Ive put lingerie on and once i really out did myself i got my hair done and shaved trimmed everything but then he said that he doesn’t get turned on by lingerie, but he also doesn’t know what turns him on. Also one time we were getting into it and he pointed out I missed a spot when I shaved down there which made me feel really embarrassed and we ended up not doing it. I don’t know what else to do really I’ve brought this up to him a hundred times but he never gets the point and leaves it to me. What do I do? I feel so frustrated with the situation ",

Being told your entire that married and have kids is something I have to do, and that if I don’t now I will someday. So when I found at the age of 14 that I am Asexual and just a couple years after Bisexual. I kinda felt relived but also terrified. I have only told my cousin and she was very accepting of me and we tell each our problems all the time. I have been debating on telling my brother about my sexuality for a couple years. Just the two of us are going on trip, this can either going to ruin our whole trip or strengthen our bond. The biggest problem is that I am worried he will think I am too young to talk about these topics and he’ll say I can change, either when I am older, or when I find the “right” person. All that to say that I love my brother, but knowing his biblical stance on sexuality has made this very difficult for me to say anything.

        "selftext": "Today is my 18th birthday a milestone that’s supposed to feel like the gateway to adulthood, independence, and new beginnings. But instead of feeling celebrated, I feel overlooked. Instead of joy, there’s this heavy weight in my chest, pressing down on me, making it hard to swallow the disappointment.  \n\nFor almost two months now, my father hasn’t been able to work due to a job-related injury. Money is tight so tight that even something as simple as a cake, a small token of acknowledgment, is out of reach. I understand. I really do. I know it’s not their fault, and I know they love me, but that doesn’t make it hurt any less.  \n\nBirthdays are supposed to be special, a day when you feel seen. But mine never really have been. I’ve had birthdays forgotten, birthdays I had to share like they weren’t fully mine, birthdays that felt more like an afterthought than a celebration. And now, here I am, reaching a turning point in my life, and it feels like just another ordinary day except worse, because deep down, I wanted it to be different.  \n\nWhat makes it harder is the facade I feel forced to maintain. Everyone around me assumes I’m fine, that I’m well off, that things in my life are smooth. My friends ask me what my plans are, and I don’t even know how to answer. Do I pretend I have something lined up? Do I admit the truth? How do you explain to people that your birthday this huge, symbolic moment feels hollow because even the simplest things are out of reach?  \n\nI keep telling myself to be grateful, to focus on what I do have, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t struggling. It’s not about material things it’s about feeling valued, feeling like this day matters, feeling like I matter. And right now, I just feel invisible.  \n\nI know life isn’t about birthdays, that one day in the grand scheme of things shouldn’t define anything. But when you spend every other day just pushing through, birthdays are supposed to be different. They’re supposed to be a pause, a moment where you feel like the world sees you. But today, I feel like I’m standing in the middle of a crowded room, screaming for someone to notice me, and no one even looks up.\n",

Later, he got into a relationship, and we stopped talking. Now, they’ve broken up, and we’ve reconnected—but in the process, I’ve realized I have feelings for him.\n\nThe problem is, he’s still completely in love with his ex and desperately wants her back. Recently, she reached out to him, and I’m scared they’ll get back together. It hurts because I can’t stop thinking that if I had spoken up back then, things might have been different.\n\nNow I don’t know what to do. Should I tell him how I feel or just accept that I missed my chance? Has anyone else been in this situation? How did you move on?",

It's been 9 months, and although I don't \"think\" about him anymore (in the sense where I'll openly think \"oh I miss him\" out of the blue), I still feel like I see him in everyone. I've moved on, I don't think about him randomly, hearing his name doesn't upset me anymore, nothing about him hurts me anymore.\n\nThe problem is just that certain gestures that he'd do, certain things he'd say, every time someone does the same or does something that reminds me of him, he comes to mind immediately. Mostly it's the way he'd word stuff, and for some reason whenever someone says the same thing or acts similarly, it's like I have to tell myself it's not him. Nobody had ever made me feel the way he did, which I find weird cause we never dated. Kinda feels like I found my soulmate but lost him, if that makes sense.\n\nIt sucks, because I'm in a relationship, and I love my boyfriend to bits. We've been dating for around a month now, but despite that he's my favourite person. Being with him and being able to know him is the highlight of my life, so why does that one guy still haunt me? I feel so incredibly guilty writing this, because although it's not something I can help, I feel like shit about it. I feel like the guilt is eating me alive, and I'd bring it up with my boyfriend, but I know what he's like. If I do he'll start telling me to break up with him, even though he could say the same exact thing to me, and has actually admitted to feeling this way about someone before, and I'm not mad about it because I understand. \n",

He says he going to dye his hair, he has been saying this since I’ve met him he hasn’t done anything to it. Then his home country. On multiple occasions he has lied to us about going back or buying plane tickets to go back. It just annoying. \n\nThen he lied to us about making plans. We invite him everywhere and he says he will come and never dose them proceeds to lie and say we never invited him anywhere. Which riled me up and to the point i shouted at him and I did take it a bit to far and rude and I hold my hands up to that it was wrong of me but then I apologised for that but he’s now started it agian after I invited him to my birthday and then said I never invited him.

        "selftext": "I was in a car accident in November of last year. Or rather, a car accident happened to me. I was on the interstate when I suddenly saw a set of headlights facing the median. They were in a T-bone position with the truck to my right. Before I could react, both vehicles slammed into me, totalling my car.  Thankfully (or so i thought) I wasn't injured. I got photos, names, insurance information, license plates, everything I could think of. I was told by two of the adjusters involved that I pretty much did their job for them. After 4 months of being pulled around, being told that I was not liable by all parties involved, that the claim was going to arbitration, then in subrogation, and finally being told that my insurance didn't cover damage to my own car, I am so frustrated and exhausted. I have a part-time job an hour away that I haven't been able to go to for the past 3 months. My husband has his own business that uses the only other car we have. I was told by so many people that I just needed to wait for liability to be settled and I'd get payment for my car. But today I was told that I am fully shit out of luck, that because insurance hasn't paid anything for repairs or a rental or anything that there's no point in paying for my car. I understand it's because I had basic liability, but I can't afford another car right now. \n\n  \nI've been trying to find a lawyer to help, but I've been told by literally everyone that it just isn't worth it to pursue. That the lawyers fees would be more than I'd get in a settlement. I've tried legal aid, the local law school, referral after referral, and as soon as I mention I wasn't injured it's over. I'm at such a loss. I don't know if it would be worth it to try and represent myself, or just leave it alone, but even the few thousands of dollars I could get for the value of my car would make things so much easier. I'm so frustrated that something so detrimental to my day-to-day is just not worth it for absolutely everyone. That I can lose my only asset, be told I've done everything right, and still be on the losing side because I wasn't injured. ",

        "selftext": "There was once a boy who believed in love—not the fairytale kind, but the kind that made the world feel right. And for a while, he had it. A girl who stood by him, who saw the best in him even when he didn’t see it himself. She loved him with a kind of loyalty that was rare, a love that never wavered even when he gave her reasons to walk away.\n\nBut love isn’t just about feelings; it’s about choices. And one day, fear made him choose wrong.\n\nHe let go—not because he didn’t love her, but because he was afraid. Afraid of not being enough. Afraid that one day she would leave, and it would hurt too much. So instead of holding on, he let himself drift away. He convinced himself that if he stopped putting in effort, if he stopped making her a priority, then maybe, just maybe, it wouldn’t hurt when it finally ended.\n\nBut she never left. She stayed. She still believed in them, even when he had already started moving away. And then, he made a mistake he could never take back—he gave his heart to someone else before he had truly let her go.\n\nAt first, he thought he could move on. But something inside him shifted. After some time in his new relationship, he finally understood his mistakes. He realized how deeply he had hurt the one person who had truly loved him. But he never knew how to make it right. How do you fix something after breaking it beyond repair? How do you face the person you betrayed, knowing no apology will ever be enough? He wanted to go back, to do something, anything—but the guilt held him back.\n\nAnd so, he stayed.\n\nNot because he had moved on, but because he was afraid—afraid that if he left his new relationship to make things right, he would once again be the villain in his own story. The guilt consumed him, so instead of looking back, he convinced himself that staying was the only way forward.\n\nAnd in his guilt, he changed.\n\nDetermined not to make the same mistakes, he became kinder. He tried to treat the new girl right, giving her the love and care he had once failed to give. But kindness, when given to the wrong person, is easily taken for granted. And she did exactly that.\n\nShe manipulated him, gaslighted him, twisted his guilt into a weapon against him. She made him believe he was always wrong, always at fault. Every time he questioned her actions, she turned it around, making him doubt his own reality. Whenever he felt she was wrong, she made herself the victim and made him feel like he was the one to blame. Slowly, he lost himself. The person he once was—the person who understood things clearly—began to fade.\n\nAnd as you already know, he never spoke up.\n\nRegret became his shadow. Guilt, his reflection. He had apologized to the one he had hurt, over and over again, but some wounds don’t heal with words. He had hurt someone beyond repair, and now he was paying the price—not just through his own pain, but through the way he was now being treated.\n\nHe wanted to move forward, to leave it all behind, but no matter what he did, the past followed. Every quiet moment became a reminder of what he had lost. Every time he tried to love again, he feared he would be taken for granted, just as he had once done to her.\n\nMaybe this was karma. Maybe this was what he deserved. Or maybe… just maybe… he still had a choice.\n\nAs he stood at the edge of everything he had been and everything he could become, he realized something: he had no idea what came next. Would he ever forgive himself? Would he ever find peace? Or would he always be haunted by what he had done?\n\nHe didn’t know.\n\nBut for the first time in a long time, he was ready to find out.",

But of course with my luck I’m here to tell you it didn’t work. Around 1 pm I woke up with nothing to show for it. I made sure not to have any signs or tell anyone I was trying to die but that doesn’t even matter now. \n\nThe worst part of this is that I’m really dizzy and unbalanced when I’m walking around but that’s literally the only sign anything happened. I’m so disappointed. People overdose on Xanax all the time without even trying— actually trying to just get high and feel better. But when I try all I get it 13 hours of uninterrupted sleep and a bit dizzy. \n\nPeople die every day on accident without any thought or desire or knowledge but everytime I try to die it doesn’t work. I think it’s bc I’m 250 lb and I needed to take more to match my weight but I literally took all of the CNS depressants I had and even then I woke up with minor symptoms. This isn’t fair. \n\nI know so many people die from trying even less and without trying so hard. I also know that some suicidal people are grateful they wake up after their attempt and maybe I wish I could be one of them but I’m not. \n\nI’m angry and sad and confused about why I didn’t die and why I have to keep living this insanely miserable life. I wish I had just died last night but I’m even terrible at killing myself. \n\nETA: I did some research and I didn’t take nearly enough of either drug. ",

I went to class and didnt hear anything for a few days but i know that A and B argued. \n\n  \nthen some friends from me and As highschool that we still regularly talk to texted me and said theyre gonna do something fun over this coming weekend and i was like hell yeah i love hanging out with my friends and they told me to ask A if she wants to join in and i call up A and ask her and she goes 'idk... i dont have my work schedule yet...' and i said 'ok could u text ur boss and ask for the day off? we really all want to hang out with you!' and she says 'ill see'. weekends coming around and i just texted A to ask if shes gonna hang out with us and she goes 'no i have work' i say 'oh im sad you couldnt get work off' and she goes 'oh i didnt really try... they (highschool friends) didnt directly ask me so i figured i wasnt invited.'  \nlike girl.... i literally asked you because they wanted you there? and i showed her the texts from our friends asking if A is coming because theyre so excited to see her, both friends live a ways away so we dont see each other often and one of the friends hasnt seen A for about 4 years due to moving states and then coming back. and we were all excited and waiting for her to join us. but i go 'ok... i wish u could have joined us maybe we can pick u up after u finish working and hang out?' and she just goes 'no i think your all going to have fun without me'  \nand i kinda was a bit pissed w her so i said she should have take the day off when i asked a while ago and shes just like 'oh. i could  have. but i didnt.' ??? girl?   \nthis is around when i told her she needs to stop victimizing herself.\n\ni hung out with her roommate later that day and we discussed how shes kinda been and B said she would talk to A about how she needs to stop isolating herself. I also ended up inviting B to hang out with us over the weekend instead as the highschool friends have all met B in passing and like hanging out with her. ik this is gonna piss off A a bit but like A could have also hung out with us.... and then A is gonna be mad and not want to hear about what weve all done for a while.   \nim just so tired of her self deprecating behavior where she always HAS to be the victim who just CANT hang out or CANT do anything fun and all that bull.\n\n\n\nTLDR; exactly what the title says. i told my friend that she needs to stop victimizing herself and i dont really feel that bad about it. thats the end.

        "selftext": "\n\nHey everyone, to whoever’s reading this story.\nI’d love to hear your thoughts on it. I guess I should start with a little backstory.  \n\nAround early autumn last year, I was walking through one of the neighborhoods in my city. It was my last day at work, and after finishing up, I decided to take a stroll, grab something to eat, and soak in the last warm, sunny days. I found a nearby bench, sat down, popped in my earphones, and just listened to music as I made my way to a café.  \n\nAt some point, I noticed a girl who looked really upset.  \n\nI hesitated for a moment but then decided to go up to her and see if she was okay. Turns out, she’d had a really rough day. We ended up walking together, exchanging contacts, and chatting later on when we had time.  \n\nOur first few meetups were easygoing and fun. We talked, got to know each other, and with every meeting, we started growing closer. After about a month, I started visiting her place after the gym to unwind a little.  \n\nAnd then, at some point, things between us started feeling like more than just friendship. There was this warmth, this physical closeness that I’d been missing (even though I had plenty of friends, I was single at the time).  \n\nShe’s absolutely gorgeous—like, the kind of girl who turns heads wherever she goes. She’s tall (about 185 cm), has an amazing figure, a beautiful face, and these deep brown eyes that just pull you in. She’s got a great body, though that’s far from the only thing I like about her. She’s also a few years older than me.  \n\nThen, about three weeks later, after lots of time spent together and some really great conversations, I went over to her place again, this time bringing flowers to surprise her.  \n\nI rang the doorbell, and when she opened the door… my jaw literally dropped.  \n\nThere she was, standing in front of me in red silk shorts and a top, looking absolutely breathtaking. I just stood there, speechless, until she pulled me inside, wrapped her arms around me, and kissed me.  \n\nWe headed to the kitchen, where she was cooking some meat for dinner—something she knew I liked, even though I’d never actually told her. That moment just hit differently. It was like she knew me better than I knew myself. That was when I realized—this girl had completely stolen my heart.  \n\nLater, she even got me a pair of shorts and an T-shirt so I’ve have something to wear around her place.  \n\nI changed, sat down with her on the couch, and we put on some YouTube. Before long, we were cuddling, and yeah—that was when we kissed. The whole evening was just perfect.  \n\nAnd now, every day, I catch myself wondering: am I doing the right thing? Because I honestly love spending time with this girl.  \n\nI could really use your advice.  \n\n\n",

This happened 2 separate times and all they said was that \"my memory is really bad\".\n\nWhen I try to talk about any part of my life they start kissing me as if they want me to stop. Now I'm here sitting across them and realising that I am invisible to them. I've been having a rough time, they haven't noticed. I noticed when it happens to them. \n\nI keep telling myself that this is the healthiest relationship I've been in and that we communicate well and that maybe this is something to just talk out and hope it gets better because whilst I dont feel important to them, they're are important to me and I don't want to lose them. \n\nIt makes me extremely sad that I feel this way and a part of me wants to accept this as my life now because maybe this is the best love that I deserve? Maybe this is karma for the things I did wrong.",

        "selftext": "Me (26F) and my friend (25M) met during university, but we didn’t talk much back then. He had his own friend group, and I had mine. It wasn’t until a few years after graduating, when we ended up working together, that we became inseparable, because our cubicles are right next to each other. \n\nI have pretty bad abandonment issues, but I also get attached to people way too easily (a deadly combination, I know). So when we started hanging out more, I didn’t think much of how close we were. I was just happy to have such a good friend.\n\nI didn’t realize I had feelings for him until my birthday. He was running late to my party, and I caught myself looking at the door constantly, waiting for him to show up. I felt this ridiculous relief when he finally arrived. At the time, I had just gotten out of a really toxic situationship, so I dismissed my feelings. I told myself I was just trying to replace what I had with the other guy.\n\nThen, a few months later, he told me he was interviewing for a job on the other side of the world. I had a full-on breakdown. That was the moment I realized how deep my feelings for him actually were. I can’t even tell you how many nights I cried over the idea of him leaving. In the end, he got the job, but still chose to stay.\n\nSome part of me thinks maybe he likes me back. He’s told me before that he thinks I’m pretty, he cooks for me, listens to me vent, spends whole weekends with me, and just shows up in a way that no one else has. Sometimes he makes comments that imply he does want something with me, but then he also says he wouldn’t date someone outside of his culture (we are from two very different countries). So I don’t know if he’s sending mixed signals on purpose or if I’m just reading too much into things.\n\nTo make things worse, he recently started messaging back and forth with a friend of his from high school, and it seems pretty flirty, he seems excited. It’s killing me. I don’t know what to do or how to deal with it. I want to cry every single day. He is going back home for vacation soon, and I’m terrified that he’ll come back and tell me he has a girlfriend.\n\nI know now that a relationship isn’t possible, and I don’t want to lose him as a friend. But I don’t know how to deal with these feelings.",

        "selftext": "I want to start by saying that this is a personal opinion and I understand and also support personal opposing views on this topic regarding individuals who believe the days to be an \"exemplification\" of feelings rather than the notes listed below.\n\n\nIn the past few weeks I've been hounded on a LOT about not celebrating valentines day, mothers day, or International Womens Day by people other than the ones I'd celebrate them for. Ranging from people telling me I'm an awful human being for not appreciating my mom or women in general(despite this being wholly inaccurate) to people threatening to assault me because i didnt do something special for my mom on mothers day. I wanted to hear from random strangers online if my reasoning is sound and makes sense as toward why I don't celebrate them specifically as when I explain it in person, people seem to get quite upset with me regardless.\n\nI would like to note that around the holiday, not on the holiday itself all the time, just around that time period, I still put more effort and care into the relevant individuals, but I just don't like to celebrate the days themselves for the reasons listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy reluctance to celebrate holidays like Father’s Day, Mother’s Day, International Women’s or Men's Day, and others that specifically celebrate a group of individuals stems from a few key personal beliefs and feelings.\n\n1. Forced Social Expectations\n\nI often feel that these holidays create an obligation rather than a genuine expression of appreciation. Society dictates that on this specific day, I must express gratitude or admiration, even if I already do so in my own way throughout the year. It feels performative—like I’m expected to participate just because it’s a designated date, rather than acting on my feelings when they naturally arise.\n\n2. Commercialization Over Meaning\n\nThese holidays have been heavily commercialized, turning what should be a meaningful moment into an opportunity for businesses to sell cards, flowers, gifts, and expensive dinners. It feels less about genuine appreciation and more about fulfilling a marketing-driven expectation. I don’t like the idea of my relationships being tied to consumerism, where love and respect are measured by the money or effort spent on a particular day.\n\n3. Personal Connection to the Honored Group\n\nSometimes, I don’t have a personal connection that makes celebrating these holidays meaningful. For instance, if someone has a complicated relationship with their parents or lacks a strong figure that fits into the holiday’s framework, these days can feel alienating rather than celebratory. It’s a reminder of what someone might not have, rather than an opportunity to appreciate what I do.\n\n4. Selective Recognition Feels Arbitrary\n\nWhy do we elevate specific groups on designated days while overlooking the everyday contributions of others? It feels arbitrary—why celebrate fathers on one day and mothers on another when both play roles throughout the year? Why single out women for one day rather than advocating for equal treatment and appreciation daily? It seems more symbolic than substantive, and I prefer actions that carry meaning every day rather than confining appreciation to a calendar date.\n\n5. Pressure to Conform\n\nThere’s an implicit pressure to participate in these celebrations, whether it’s through social media posts, attending gatherings, or giving gifts. If I choose not to, there’s often an assumption that I don’t care or that I’m being inconsiderate. But in reality, I simply prefer to show my appreciation in my own way, at my own time, without feeling compelled by external expectations.\n\n6. Not Everyone Experiences These Days Positively\n\nFor many people, these holidays can be painful rather than joyous. Someone who has lost a parent might struggle on Mother’s or Father’s Day. Someone who has faced discrimination or hardship might not feel comfortable with the broad generalizations made on International Women’s Day, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, or International Men's Day. These celebrations assume a universal experience that doesn’t exist, and I’d rather avoid engaging in something that might inadvertently bring discomfort to others.\n\n7. Personal Values and Approach\n\nUltimately, I value sincerity over tradition. If I appreciate someone, I want to show it naturally, in a way that feels right to me, not because a calendar tells me to. I don’t need a designated day to tell my parents I appreciate them, nor do I need a specific date to recognize the struggles and achievements of any group. I’d rather express my respect, gratitude, and admiration in everyday moments, through my actions and words, rather than as part of a structured societal ritual.\nFor these reasons, I tend to avoid participating in these kinds of holidays. It’s not out of defiance or lack of appreciation, but rather a personal preference for authenticity over obligation.",

        "selftext": "My (52M) father-in-law (85) moved in with us from another state due to his declining health. There was no way he could live by himself any longer. He’s a solid guy...sharp-minded, well-read, but lately, he just sits, naps, and stares into the void for hours. I work from home, and watching him decline, watching him die...has started to weigh on me in ways I didn’t expect. He says that if he stops eating he won't last as long and things like that. He's on all kinds of meds for cancer to depression of knowing he's dying.\n\nIn the past two months, I’ve had to give him more showers than I can count after accidents. I’ve hosed down clothes, scrubbed poop from the shower, and still not used to the loud burps, the constant farting, the mad dashes to the bathroom, while using a walker, hearing his despair as we walk, listening to him crumble in humility. I haven’t said a word to anyone about it because the first thing I feel isn’t frustration...it’s sadness. He had prostate cancer, and it’s spread to his bones. The doctors haven’t given us much insight into what’s next, but every day, I can see him slipping. My heart is breaking in all kinds of ways.\n\nMy bride works crazy hours and makes about twice what I make. She feels awful that this is upon me, and we even tried bringing in a nurse for a day, but after they left, he begged me not to have them come back. He likes it here, just the two of us most of the time during the day. He moves between the window with a bird feeder, his recliner, and his books. When my teenage boys are home, they watch history documentaries together, and for a little while. And we do small things on the weekends.\n\nI don’t say anything to my wife—she’s losing her dad. I won’t let her see me struggle. I won’t let him see it, either. I’ll be here 100%, without a single complaint. But the truth is, I can feel it getting to me, and my kids can too.\n\nHow do I stay positive? How do I keep from drowning in this? I knew this would be hard, but I didn’t realize just how much.

        "selftext": "For some context, my boyfriend (23m) and I (24f) have been in a relationship. He was after me for 1 year, dated for 1 year, broke up, and have been dating for 6 months now.\nI have an autoimmune disease that is mostly affected by my mental health, and can create severe illnesses and damages to my body. Since I’ve been dating him I´ve been noticing my health getting worse and worse. To add more to the story, I found out he was attracted to his work-colleague and made some sort of move, check my other post to figure out some more about this (if interested, but it will add more to the story and will help you gain a better understanding). Plus, my boyfriend since the start of our relationship has told me how he’s a man who doesn’t watch corn, and has been flexing it to his guy friends and all.\n\nSo, my boyfriend has been recently saying non-stop how he’s open for me to check his phone, he has actually said it so much it was beginning to be suspicious. I had been noticing him becoming more irritated with me by the second without me doing nothing, and I asked him. I told him that I knew there was something he was hiding that was making him so anxious with me all the time, that's when I began suspecting, and he denied all of my comments, saying it was because he’s been so busy with work.\n\nAfter some days, he started saying it again, telling me that I could check his phone whenever I didn’t trust him. He was always used to me saying no, since I was keen on not doing so since I felt like doing that. There must be a lack of trust in a relationship and that’s how they fall apart. So, he didn’t expect me to say yes this time. I did due to all my suspicions at the moment. He watched me, and didn’t dare say a word. I gave him some time to be honest with me before looking through his phone and he reassured me there was nothing. I went to his recently watched in tiktok, and I found gems there. He watched these typical girls with boobs bigger than their heads move their butts and boobs sensually. Then, there were many replays of this girl we both knew he talked to before ever getting with me. He didn’t say anything and denied ever doing anything with her videos, only getting hard and then looking for other stuff to jerk off, which I think is a complete lie, but still.\n\nNot only did he break promises by telling and promising me that he didn’t watch corn or other girls, but also lied to me about it until I figured it out. He was never honest and I believe that he still is hiding things from me just because I didn’t figure them out yet. It was already bad that he did this, but worse when it was his ex situationship.\n\nI need some help and opinions to clear my mind, I don’t know if I’m crazy or being rational. I would appreciate other people’s experiences dealing with wrong people and then finding a good person for you. I need to believe that this is not the love I deserve and that there’s many guys out there that won’t do this to me.\n",

She was freshly after a breakup with a guy she lived with, she was extremely emotional since they guy seemed not to have cared for her. He promised to visit her, but didn't and only like 2 months after their breakup he started relentlessly calling her. Nudging her to go to therapy etc. He even joined her friend groups discord server and that made her so emotional she quit the internet for a week and only talked to me through phone. I helped her through this period, i was always calling her and wanted to spend every minute of my time with her. First off it was good. We talked, we played games, we watched movies. She had her weird habits but i got used to them. Eventually we started arguing, a lot. I mean I really did all i could for her. She was my priority all of the time. I called off parties to want to spend time with her. I went on a 10 hour train ride just to see her and comfort her in a place she didn't really have a lot to do. But the thing is, she never really cared for me the way I did for her. I reserved time for us during new year's eve just so I could see her and she had a mood swing or something and called it off since she thought I was getting attached to quickly. We were to meet about 2 weeks ago but she called it off too since our conversations wasn't good. I am not going to lie, It was not a pleasant conversation but a honest one, nothing to get offended by. Just us talking about us in a slightly sadder tone. I get really emotional and jealous, like she was talking to her friend that he has to watch something and that she's willing to watch the entirety of it with him. I just thought, well, why doesn't she want to watch things with me? Why does she want to visit him, not me? I was her girlfried at the end of the day and that guy called everything she recommended \"crappy\". It's like I gave her all this attention and she didn't even care enough to visit me. This morning she wrote me an ominious message \"Would you still want to be around me if I had kissed someone else in the past month\", I replied that if she would give someone a kiss on a cheek or something, which is kind of normal in my part of the world, I'd be okay with it but if it was romantic, something that could be classified as cheating I would leave. She then said that it is going to happen and that she would have done it a long time ago if it hadn't been for that that she doesn't go out much and is pretty asocial. I mean that kind of broke me. I never had any meaningful relationship, I was always hiding a part of myself and when a person that accepted me came along they stab me in the back in such a heinous manner. I already got cheated on once. I know how it ends, there is no redemption, no coming back to what once was. I really loved her, gave her everything I could but that still wasn't enough.",

        "selftext": "My boyfriends of a year is only my 3rd sexual partner. When we met he told me he hated getting oral but loved giving it.\n\nWhen we first started having sex it was really good. I was worried he told me he was a porn addict previously but the sex was very focused on my pleasure and I was pleased.  I did try to give him oral but he would stop it after a couple of minutes and move on to me. During those attempts I could tell what he didn’t like and did so I stopped doing the things he didn’t enjoy when I would go down.\n\nAbout a month into sex he one day pulled my hair and started face fucking me. After he asked me if I liked having him control me when down there or if I preferred being in control. I told him I was really uncomfortable being held down there and I was really uncomfortable being face fucked. He claimed he liked me being in control.\n\nLast 2 months or so sex has completely shifted. He hasn’t gone down on me. I feel like a rag doll he uses. He grabs my legs and moves me where he wants me and grabs my head and pushes me into giving him oral often while holding me down there.\n\nThen last weekend happened.  I said I wanted to try anal but have been scared. We tried it once before but it hurt and I cried out and he stopped. It wasn’t off the table to try again.\n\nHe woke me in the middle of the night while I was asleep on my side by entering me from behind (on his side too). It felt good and he and I have an agreement to “wake up sex” when we spend the night together even middle of the night.\n\nA few minutes in he pulls out and aims at my ass. He pushed in a little I cried out and pulled away (no lube used and he has a big dick).  He put his hand over my mouth and grabbed my waist and pulled me hard back onto his cock. I started crying from the pain but he just held me there while he finished with his hand on my mouth. When he was done I told him it hurt and all he said was I never said no and rolled over and went to sleep. Then he woke me up again a few hours later and repeated the whole thing so I was super sore and have been since.\n\nI love him but I don’t love feeling like his sex toy.\n\nEdit:\n\nI’m sitting here crying. I felt used but never really thought about the fact I was violated. I grew up in an abusive household and sometimes boundaries and normal things don’t feel normal and abuse and bad things do.  I’ve been really emotionally numb to this all and I guess I needed a wake up call to see this isn’t okay behavior.",

You’re probably wondering why I’m still with them. I don’t really know, I’m starting to hate them and I’m starting to feel deep resentment towards them. I honestly thought we were going to get married and have kids and idk why I thought that when they have fought me at every step. I’ve realized I wouldn’t want to have kids with them as I wouldn’t want them exposed to my partners bouts of explosive anger. I wouldn’t want them thinking the way I’m treated is acceptable and I wouldn’t want them thinking that not wanting to be a better person is okay. \nI say all that but I am deeply in love with them, I don’t really know what to do because leaving is hard for me and for them but I can tell at this point that’s what’s needed. They are very clear with their actions in showing me they don’t care for me the way I care for them and my self esteem is shot to hell. Sometimes I envy they’re ability to treat me poorly and still feel like they’re a good person, but then I remember there’s a reason every person they’ve ever been with has left, and I need to follow suit because everyday I fall deeper into the cycle of nonsense and bullshit. \nI love them deeply, like I’ve never loved before but maybe that’s bc we’re addicted to each other’s toxicity.\nI want to be with someone who shows me through action they want me and love me and all they’re capable of is pretty words, they lie over and over and promise things they can’t give..\nI want to leave I promise I know I need to for my mental health and for theirs, I just don’t know how…I just wanted to get it off my chest. I’m having a really hard time coming to terms with this relationship failing for some reason and I’d honestly do anything to go back in time and figure out how to make it work but I can’t so this is just how it has to be ig.",

Once I arrived at the location I saw a building that fitted the description. I couldn't find something that seemed like an entrance, but I noticed a gate and door that were open because someone was talking out the trash and walked in trough there. I had taken notice that inside the compound there were two luxury cars parked, one with Russian licence plates and one with diplomatic plates. \n\nOnce inside it took me a while to find a person but after searching a bit I found a man who didn't speak dutch and was looking at me with confusion. I explained I had an appointment at the school and he simply pointed out to me that the Jewish school was the building next door and directed me out of the building.  \n\nAt the school they couldn't tell me what was in that building, there was noting indicated there on google maps. And for years I have wondered about what it was because it had a vibe as if I had just stumbled into a secret Russian base that I wasn't supposed to find. \n\nI was reminded of this incident earlier today and finally decided to do some research into the building located at the Veluwelaan in Amsterdam. And as it turns out; the building was indeed closed a couple of years ago because it was a base for the Russian secret service... Holy cow, I literally walked into a Russian spy base 5 years ago.

        "selftext": "I (17M) am a Filipino, and have been living in Canada for about 6 months now. Just last month did I finally land a job at the deli in a supermarket after months of seemingly endless jobhunting. \n\nHowever, my manager at the deli is... lets just say, a not very nice person. Shes very condescending, and pretty much just has something against the students that work in the deli (me included).\n\nHer very obvious and not well hidden hatred towards the students finally came to a full fruition when she scheduled ALL the students for the rest of the month just less than 10 hour shifts a week. In fact, one of us was even getting just 4 HOURS in a week.\n\nIts not like we were being greedy or anything. All of us need the money. One of us needs it to buy insurance for his new car, and another one of us needs it to buy a new car. I need it to pay the internet bills in my house, help my parents with their payments, and maybe soon buy a PC for myself.\n\nWhen I saw my schedule for the rest of the month, as expected, I was pissed. I mean, seriously? We haven't really been slacking off either, all of us even do our jobs arguably well.\n\nWhen we went to ask our manager about it (she was supposed to STILL be at work) another one of the employees at the deli said she already TOOK OFF.\n\nOf course, we are planning to ask her about the schedules tomorrow.\n\nBut when I told my parents about it, they were not happy.\n\nThey thought I was asking for too much.\n\nOf course, I was once again pissed. For someone who works as a STUDENT and earning MINIMUM WAGE helping his OWN PARENTS PAY THEIR BILLS, I think I should atleast have SOME right to extend my hours, no? But no, of course not. When I told them it should be MY RIGHT to ask my manager for those few extra hours, they then went to comparing me to protesters.\n\nNo joke, heres how the conversation went:\n\nDad: \"What if the next time I start seeing you on the streets holding a placard? What if you end up like those pink protesters back home?\" (Referring to what happened back in the Philippine presidential elections)\"\n\nMe: \"I don't think it will go THAT far. Besides, even if it does, I think protesting about our hours should also be a part of our rights, no?\" \n\nMom: \"What are you thinking? The way you're thinking now, you're gonna end up a member of the NPA!\" (A Philippine communist terrorist organization)\n\nNow, this made me even more pissed. But to my parent's credit, they DID try to diffuse the situation.\n\nHow did they do that? Why, by insulting the way I do my chores at home, of course.\n\nThey said I needed to \"Prove myself at home\" first. \"Do the chores well first\". Like huh? I already do my job/s to the best of my ability as far as I know, I don't really know what else I need to prove at home. I mean, I guess fair enough??? I suppose theres still a few things to work on I guess??\n\nJust so yall know, I DID consider telling them that my manager was a not-so-nice person. But considering they already called me a communist for wanting more hours, I don't even wanna KNOW what they would wanna call me if I complained about my manager. \"Just do your job and bow down to your bosses\", thats their motto, after all. (Not even joking).\n\nHonestly, my brainrotted side thinks this is pretty funny, but it kinda made me feel bad at the time. My parents would literally rather compare their own child to a bunch of terrorists rather than siding with them! Amazing!\n\nTLDR: Manager is an asshole, gave me bad hours, and when I told my parents I was gonna ask for more hours, they compared me to communist terrorists\n",

        "selftext": "Things have been rough at home. Im '30M', wife is '27F'. Fighting virtually every day. I take my lumps for escalating in certain situations, but I feel it's primarily my wife that breaks the peace and gets upset and acts over the top angry. Then I'm angry at her for how she acted in her anger, then she's angry at me for being upset by it all.  It's a vicious cycle. Anyways, her dad offered to pay for us to go to therapy. Therapist was a 70 year old guy that's been doing it for 50 years. Seems very wise. Is all about accountability. Doesn't want to hear what the other person did to you, he only wants to know how you contributed to the situation. \n\nMy wife has missed the last two sessions. Which hurt me alot, as things have been so bad I've been desperately wanting the help to break the cycle. The first time she was angry and didn't want to come. The second time she said she forgot the appointment. \n\nI vented out alot of our problems when I was alone this last session, and was grilled for my part of it. I talked about things I've done, she's done, and things that are affecting the children. He said we will plan to get her side of things when we come back together.\n\nWe both showed up yesterday, and he wanted her side of the issues I talked about. Every time she went to talk about something, she prefaced it by saying \"I only did this because he did this first\" etc... even an issue i had with how mean she was to our daughter recently. Our daughter is 6. But the story still started out with \"well she yelled at my sister, so I did this.\" He became irritated and impatient with her. Told her that he wouldn't keep trying to beat the issues out of her and that she needs to stop blaming other people and just admit to what she did. She stammered and couldn't talk without trying to shift some guilt first. It went back and forth between them for a minute, with me sitting silently to the side. She couldn't get any kind of admission out without having someone else to blame first. Eventually she started reading out some horrible texts she had sent me out loud on her phone. It was painful to hear her read it off so robotically, but to me it seemed like a step in the right direction because the things she said were awful and she was technically admitting to it by reading it out loud. She got towards the end, but threw in one more \"then he did this, so I did this.\"\n\nHe said \"Both of you need to get out. This sessions is over.\" As soon as she finished reading. We both left silently. As I went to leave the building, I had the urge to go back. I knocked on his door and asked for a few more seconds of his time, which he obliged. I asked why he ended it at that point, because in my mind she seemed to be cooperating. He said that it's a combination of things. Firstly, her not showing up to appointments. He helps us outside of his normal office hours as a favor to her dad, who he knows from a rehab program. Her not showing up is disrespectful at best. Secondly, it was the combination of the horrible things she said via text, the robotic way she read them, and her inability to take accountability. I said I understood and thanked him for his time. \n\nI don't know where to go from here. Things have been so awful. She's been fighting with me and other people nonstop over the smallest things. After that appointment, she has flipped a switch that's been engaged for weeks now and is acting as sweet as possible. I feel like it's a love bombing facade. I don't know what advice I'm really looking for. I'm just sad and afraid I know what I have to do. Anyone have any advice towards something like this?\n\n",

        "selftext": "Back story I’m (F28) and my (M30) wants to be married. We were on and off from the years I was 19-20 and when I turned 21 we got together offically and I was convinced by him and his mom to move in since I was living alone and my parents are retired in a different country. \n\nFrom the years 19-22 he was just not nice very rude and he would always choose his friends over me and his friends were always females. In the early stages his friends or family will tell him to leave me and he would do it and then be adamant on staying friends when I would say no. He also kept crying to me about his ex and how much she hurt him and he hid the fact he would talk to her mom like once a week. When I found out he stood his ground and said no to cutting her off. He only agreed to cut her off because I was pregnant with his child. \n\nWhen I turned 23 during Covid we fell pregnant although I took Plan B I didn’t realize I was ovulating so it didn’t work. We kept our son but he was just so rude during my pregnancy he took it upon himself to be there for a female friend all because she was dating a guy and needed “help” and instead of her going to her female friends my bf was always available. He went as far as to stay out all night and get drunk with her and their other friends and the guy she was dating when I didn’t want him to and when he returned home he cursed me and his mother out because I held him back in life. I also had told him for years how important marriage was to me and he was just so whatever about it. I told him while I was pregnant just ask with a ring pop since we didn’t have too much money and I wanted to be married before having a kid and he came home a few days later and as I was lying on the couch he threw the ring pop and said “ you going to say yes right “ I said no because he made it seem like a chore or obligation rather than him wanting to. He also spend all my pregnancy mad at me because I didn’t want to name our son after him. When I’ve told him since I was 19 and even before when we were sort of friends at 16 that I do not want to name my son after their father name. \n\nFast forward our son is born and he is currently 4 and throughout these 4 years he keeps wanting to be married and I told him unless he has a career were he can  care of the home expenses what is the point. Since our son been born I’ve made almost all the money paid our rent our bills he’s has jobs here and there.  He just made one year at his current job and he does pay his part but even before our son and now I’m also paying like 60/70% and he pays the rest and theirs been times I’ve paid 100%. I told him if he becomes a police officer id feel okay and comfortable marrying him since it’s a good paying job and he can support us and he wants to and he’s doing it for him and for us to be married. But I also feel so indifferent like I don’t see the excitement in calling him my husband since we skipped over the step. Sometimes I feel like it’s my fault and I should of ignored that he threw a ring pop at me and other times I feel like if I would of accepted it I would be open to constant disrespect from him in the future. \n\nHim as a father: super good and kind he takes our son to school and picks him up he lets me sleep in and sleep whenever. He tries to pay for dates when we are out our son and him have a strong bond. He gets me flowers offers to cook even it it doesn’t taste the greatest. Overall him as a dad and a partner is nice I do feel spoiled. But because I can’t let go of how he treated me I’m always going to have this fever he’s going to revert back. ",

        "selftext": "It's almost been a year, and I made a mistake.In June I broke up with my girlfriend of almost four years because we were going away for college and we were both going out of state on opposite  sides of the country. I thought it would be the best thing for us, but it's been the opposite.\n\nI really hurt her when we broke up. The first few days I thought this was going to be the best thing for me, and I just tried to push her out of my mind as much as I could, but I just kept feeling like an asshole. She loved me so much, and I took it for granted. She would do things for me all the time just because and never expect anything in return. She would constantly put me ahead of her and also just loved me no matter what I was going through.\n\nI couldn't stop thinking about her, and during my first week of college, I was so excited about what was going on in my life, and I wanted nothing more than to just text her and let her know what was going on.\n\nIt bothered me that in the almost 3 months we had been broken up at that point, she never once reached out to me. I wanted to know how college was going for her; I wanted to know how she was doing. How could the girl who I once had this amazing love with not try to reach out to me once? I texted her, letting her know that I had been thinking about her and that I hoped she was doing well. She kept things super brief and said she hoped I was doing well, but I wanted to talk to her so much more, so I poked about what she had been doing, and in two months she had done so much, and she was going to this great huge school and was doing all of this without me.\n\nI know I should've been happy for her, but it just made me sad and angry. We didn't talk for a month after that until she sent me a picture of a tattoo she had gotten. I was so excited that she finally reached out to me. This was the first time since we had broken up that she initiated the conversation.\n\nWe talked for a little bit, and it felt so great. We fell back into conversation like back when we were dating. It felt so good to talk to her again, but at the same time, it made me feel sick that I knew so little about what was going on in her life now, and I was only hearing so little about it. I sent her a text telling her how happy I was for her and how what she's doing seems like such a great experience for her, and she never responded. That hurt a lot.\n\nI looked at her TikTok and Instagram for the first time in months, and I just wanted to throw up. She is living this whole life without me. She looks happy and, most of all, beautiful. Like, how dare she be so beautiful and smile at people with smiles that were once mine?  I would go to her Spotify, and I would be so paranoid that one of those playlists was dedicated to someone that wasn't me.\n\nI felt so selfish and angry and mad at the world and at myself. I had to push her out of my mind, so I started seeing someone. I wasn't even really interested in them. Looks-wise, they were nothing compared to my ex-girlfriend. Their personality was so dull and boring compared to my ex, and in the end, I ended up just feeling like this huge dick for stringing someone along for months just to get over my ex-girlfriend.\n\nI went home for my Christmas break from my college, and it got even worse. Knowing that we were in the same town and just a drive away from each other's houses made me feel insane. I got so nervous that I was going to run into her any time I left the house. I thought about going Christmas shopping in the mall she worked at so I could \"accidentally run into her\" and then would just get sad because I was becoming this huge creep. I wanted to text her every day asking if she wanted to get coffee, and I never did because nothing would hurt more than knowing she didn't want to see me. I texted her Merry Christmas, and she was nice about it, but she didn't want to talk to me anymore after that.\n\nAnd then I saw she went back to her college before me, and it was painful seeing her with all her friends having so much fun and having so much fun without me. Seeing her cozied up with a girl on her Instagram makes me feel like I'm going to throw up. I see them post together all the time, and I just want to know if they're dating. How could she date someone so soon after 3, almost 4 years? How could she be so brazen and post her and that girl getting coffee and going on dates together? Does she not think I'll see it? I think I would feel worse if it was a man. The thought of some man looking at her the way I used to and touching her and being intimate with her makes me angry and sad and violent all at the same time.\n\nI would stalk her pages all day while I was still in our hometown, waiting for her to post something and getting nervous when she would. How could she be having so much fun and be so happy all without me?  We were each other's first love, first kiss, first everything. And now I don't know if she's doing that with other people.\n\nThings got a little bit better when I went back for my second semester of college, but I still just can't get her out of my mind. I'm starting to see another girl now to try and get over my ex, and she's, again, nothing like my ex-girlfriend, and I don't think there will ever be anyone like her.When I first broke up with her, I didn't think it would hurt this much. I guess in the back of my mind I thought she would've fought for us. I thought she would've texted me more when we were broken up; I thought she and I honestly would've gotten back together at this point. I'm so insanely in love with her still, and I brought this on myself, but I thought I was doing what's best for the both of us. I guess I didn't appreciate or realize the things that she did for me while we were together.",

His laugh could light up a room with minimal effort. That is, when he's not in a depressive episode. He grew up in an extremely abusive home and has since been diagnosed with eating disorders, anxiety and severe depression and bpd. Ive been friends with him around 2 years ago and holy fish paste has it been a ride. I dont even know how we got to this point in the friendship but he just vents to me. No warning no nothing. I'll ask him where he is after ditching classes for weeks on end and he'll go \"oh im at home\"___\" im kind of losing it right now. I'm smashing my head on the wall\". Or something like that and it makes my stomach turn. Because I know he's gonna tell me some gut wrenching reason as to why he's not there and its like. So draining. He has so many problems that could be simply fixed by putting in effort and making active choices to better his situation but he refuses to. I twll him he needs to move in with family that offered to house him? He stalls until the offer is no longer available. I tell him his teachers aren't praying on his downfall, that he's just a serial truant? He continues skipping class and let's his grade slip. I tell him his equally mentally ill boyfriend is making his mental worse with endless lies and manipulation? He'll skip classes and then post with his boyfriend later on. Its just like. Im so tired of being scared to check his messages because im gonna have to talk him off of the ledge for the third time this week. Im scared to answer unknown numbers because he has me down as his emergency contact if he ever gets put in the ward again. I'm scared to talk to him about the things he does that genuinely pisses me off because I think he'll kill himself. I'm so scared that he's just consistently on the verge of ending it all that I never go against him. Even on the little things because if he ends it and that note comes out noting things I did wrong I won't be able to live with myself. So I dont do anything. I just let him vent despite it making me feel so hopeless. I let him do shit that pisses me off because im scared. Im a huge fucking pussy and a horrible friend and my worst fear is that he'll do it anyway and I'll have to apologize to everyone he loved because I didn't do enough. And before you try to tell me to tell him to get help he already has a therapist and is medicated so there's not much else I can do except be there even if I don't want to even if I don't want to babysit him and then shit my pants when he takes too long to respond to a text.. And I never ever vent to him about anything because im scared ill be the straw to break the camels back. I dont really need any help because I wouldn't kms but Jesus christ I feel crazy and dirty and so evil. I shouldn't hate him for things he can't control but a part of me,that grows every time he impromptu texts me asking if I hate him, beleives that he's in full control, he's just comfortable being where he is. \n\nSorry for the run on sentences and bad grammar and general doodoowater backgrounds and explanations Im just typing my thoughts at this point I don't know.",

To make a long story short, it was a whole 2 hours afterward that the police were called and something was done about it.\n\nNow this alone is devastating and disturbed my mom, but what made me call my post this was this detail of the story.\n\nThe kid tried this around 11 am. The administration was only made aware at 1 pm. The kids knew this and said nothing. Now you may think that it's because he's a bully or disliked, but he was a smart kid who played football at his school and was generally well-liked. The chilling part was that most kids were just indifferent to the whole thing. They felt bad, but nobody was particularly emotional. My brother said that everybody was silent but only a few who he knew feared death. The kid who went to check on the victim got texts from the victim with suicidal thoughts, and he said nothing at first. And that's why I named this post what I did.\n\nMy mom is one of those people who believes that suicide is cowardly and that there are always options for those who feel that way, but hearing how a group of kids witnessed one of their try that and then everyone not go talk to grown-ups was shocking for her. Even worse, since they have, the school has not made anything public yet about this incident and probably is just going to sweep it under the rug.\nNow I might have exaggerated the title a bit, my mom is a very resilient woman. But I fear that the way this story played out will affect her for a long time.\n\nAlso normally I would talk to friends and people in school about this, but the victim's older sister attends and probably doesn't want anybody to know, so I ranted here.",

She was in a bad marriage and wanted to emotional support. This was my first relationship and the last. I provided here the emotional support and was like a father to her kids. One of her kid had adhd so needed the extra care. I was the emotional kind so thought this would last forever. She fed me thoughts of they being my own kids and i simply believed it. i imagined my entire life with here. even planing to shift to Canada to be able to be with her. I had to move to a different city before covid and thats when things started changing. She messaged less and called less. didn want to speak to me stating she couldnt get a chance. I Kept begging her to give me time to speak to me. Then she said something to the kids so even tey started speaking less to me. In the meanwhile my marriage got fixed and she just stopped talking me me altogether. I still wanted to be in touch with her, moreso with the kids but she took everythibg away from me. She conviniently said that she dosent thinks its right. for 10 years she felt it was ok. Its been 4 years and i still feel the anger. I feel she used me and i want to take revenge. Ohh yes my wife knows about it. Today is her 25th wedding anniversary and I want to send our old chats and some pictures to her and the family.

I turned on my bedside light and it was blood. By the time I made it to the bathroom I was pouring blood everywhere. After about 45 secs of pressure and some TP it seemed to stop.

I haven't had a nose bleed since I was a kid.\n\nI spent my morning cleaning up the blood I got everywhere and now I'm at work, but everything feels a little off.

Sorry!\n\n\nI (25f) always have disputes with my (59f) mother.\n\nWhenever I don't do something the same as she wants, she gets pretty acidic and even if I do it the same way as she wants, she somehow always has something to complain about.\n\n\nExample of today:\n\nBecause of the beautiful weather, I should hang my duvet out of my window, but the problem is that the winter garden roof is right in front of my window and I can't hang it out because it is a more or less flat level. So I decided to hang the blanket over the edge of the winter garden roof, mind you at one point that was quite clean (in my opinion) at least)\n\nAnd if I had hung the blanket directly out of the window, she would have been dirty or even dirty anyway.\n\nI also had planned (and also discussed with my mother) that I would wash the blanket this weekend anyway.\n\n\nNevertheless, she then sniffed me about half an hour later and she also found it very shit that I sucked at the same time as I was sucking.\n\nWe have a solar system that produces a very nice amount of electricity in very sunny weather and I thought that it would already be finished with sucking because I hadn't heard her vacuum cleaner anymore and then started sucking my room.\n\n\nHowever, she still has a problem with it because she apparently continued to suck again after a moment (which I couldn't hear because of my loud sucker) and also ran the washing machine (which I didn't know anything about because I couldn't see or hear her from my room on the first floor and that I was not explicitly told that it would be hired)\n\n\nIn addition, she also complained because I took a break when sucking (I have a cold and don't have enough endurance to create everything at once)\n\n(My room consists of two adjacent rooms of which I usually only do one because I am more in this, but this time I wanted to do both and only took a break in between)\n\n\nAfter I had explained Mama that, she told me that I always had an excuse.\n\n\nI then started crying (no idea why, sometimes happens during such confrontations) and Mama asked in a rather aggressive tone why I would cry now even though there is no reason for it and that we would only have a reasonable discussion.\n\n\n(Incidentally, the howling is nothing that I have an influence, I don't because it is to cry afterwards or something, I have zero control about whether or when this happens)\n\n\nIn the surplus, she also titled such moments as \"psycho shit\" and attempted manipulation.\n\n(Not today, but in other similar situation)\n\n\nIncidentally, she mostly teemers my attempts to explain and or counter arguments or ignores them entirely.\n\n\nI often have the feeling of being shouted at in these moments, even though she only \"talks to me very quietly\" (her words)\n\n\nI don't even want to do something in the household anymore because it is almost always wrong or not right.\n\nAnd almost every interaction with her consists that she tells me something what to do, or indicate that something is wrong/dirty or somehow not correct.\n\n\nThat would be okay, but everything is just too much, I don't want to come down to her or talk to her.\n\nWhen I come home and your car is not there, I'm already relieved.\n\nIs probably not your fault, I'm probably just over -sensitive or overreact or something.\n\n\nAlso, i haven't stopped crying the whole time while writing/translating this and my mom came in and asked me in a really passive aggressive tone what was up and why i am still crying.\nI told her to leave and she left.\n\nIdk what to do..\n\nI feel like she truly hates me and idk why she does all of this like that.\nMaybe it makes her happy?\nWhen asked she always says that she doesn't, but Idk if i can believe that ",

        "selftext": " I (19F) work with this girl, Genly (25F).  At work, she plays the sweet, quiet girl, and everyone thinks she’s so nice and understanding. But behind the scenes? She’s a two-faced gossip who talks shit about everyone, including the people she claims to be close to.\n\nAt first, we were pretty close, but the more I got to know her, the more I noticed how fake she was. She’d backstab people she said she liked, and I realized she was probably doing the same to me. So, I decided I was done. No warning, no explanation  I just blocked her on everything and moved on.\n\nThe second she found out, she ran to Facebook and posted some weird, fake-intellectual quote about people being “obsessed with psychology and personality traits,” my coworker told me clearly trying to make it seem like she’s above the drama. She even told people I blocked her, which is just petty. Like, just admit you’re mad and move on.\n\nBefore all this, Genly used to be super close with another coworker, Joanna (24F). I asked Joanna about something that made her realized that Genly was saying behind her back, and that opened Joanna’s eyes. Their friendship ended after that. So now, Genly has no one left except two other coworkers, Maribeth (22F) and Kenneth (20M), who are just as fake as she is.\n\nThe crazy thing? The day after I blocked her, Maribeth and Kenneth almost got attacked by a dog on their way to work. I passed the same dog later, and it didn’t even look at me. Then, Genly didn’t show up to work that day, claiming she had a “stomach ache.” The timing is insane, like the moment I cut her off, her whole vibe got thrown off.\n\nI know some people are saying I should’ve talked to her before blocking her, but I honestly don’t owe her an explanation. She was fake, I removed her from my space, and that’s it. I’m done with her.\n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "Just couple months ago I(23F) and my husband (24M) decided to move in with my husbands family till we’re able to afford to buy a house. It’s just his parents, his sister and her son. Recently his sister (19F) has been using my clothes and shoes without asking. If I leave it in the living room or anywhere else that’s not our room she’ll use it. I left my jacket and a bunch of clutter from the car in the garage cause we were cleaning the cars out and I kept putting off when I’d put everything away. Next thing I know my jacket is upstairs and it’s clear she wore it cause it reeked of her perfume and her bag was on top of it, whatever not a big deal I take it to our room. But this continues to happen with a bunch of other shirts, jackets, whatever. \n\nNext instance, she broke her one pair of sandals and started using mines which I honestly didn’t mind cause I have at least 5 pairs and it was peak summer time. Next thing you know I don’t see my one pair I usually wear and I just start wearing a different one, eventually I find it in MIL car with the strap broken. My MIL doesn’t wear my stuff and his sister uses her car constantly. Clearly SIL broke it and never mentioned it to me but okay cool whatever. Then another pair go missing, okay cool she probably got hungry or something idk but whatever I can get new ones so I let it slide.\n\nIt’s now colder out now so I go out and buy some ugg tasman slippers and she starts wearing that. This is where I start to get a little annoyed cause I’d get dressed according to what shoes I’m gonna wear and when we’d head out to the garage my shoes aren’t there and she’s gone. Okay moving on. My husband bought me a pair of pandas that I rarely wear, I wore it out one time and switched to sandals so I kept the shoes in the garage next thing I know they’re upstairs and SIL had just came from somewhere. Okay now I’m definitely annoyed cause literally sandals are fine but sharing shoes is gross. \n\nAnd that brings us to today. I’ve been looking everywhere for my black leather ankle boots I last wore on Christmas and haven’t seen since. For some reason I decide to stalk her Facebook and I see a picture that she posted from 2 months ago from a trip she took to Vegas and I could see the top of her shoes and it literally looks like my boots. Same dent, same scratch. She doesn’t own any shoes like that either. I’m not confrontational so I ask my husband to ask her if she has my boots and she says she doesn’t know and that she “doesn’t wear boots”. So now I look like the crazy person and my husband thinks maybe I misplaced it. It’s literally no where else in the house or the car. He’s been aware of her taking my stuff and never says anything to her and the one time I ask him to ask her, he gives in and sides with her like she hasn’t been taking my stuff for months now. This seems so stupid and petty to get mad over cause she’s younger than me but literally just ask. She’s the youngest and grew up with all brothers so I understand the entitlement but I grew up with all sisters and it’s not hard to just ask. ",

        "selftext": "**After spending 15 years building a life here, I never imagined I would end up with nothing, forced to start over from zero again. I have updated this post to clarify a few things based on feedback.**  \n  \nI take full responsibility for my situation. I made many mistakes along the way, whether it was not staying on top of deadlines, assuming I had more time than I did, or not making the best choices. I have struggled with severe ADHD my entire life, and since I choose to manage it without medication, I often leave things until the last minute. That habit has hurt me in more ways than I can count, and this situation is no exception.  \n  \nAt the same time, the immigration system has changed significantly over the years, making it much harder for someone in my position to qualify. In the end, it was a mix of bad timing, personal missteps, and an immigration system that has only grown tougher for people like me.  \n  \nI moved to Canada as an international student a little over 15 years ago. I started from nothing, learning English from scratch, completing my academic English education, and then going to university and college. I worked multiple jobs as a developer while paying my taxes and contributing to the country I wanted to call home.  \n  \nDespite all that, I lost everything when my work permit expired a few months ago. I did not qualify for enough points under the ever-changing immigration system, so as soon as my permit expired, my job was gone. Because my work permit expired, I was not eligible for unemployment benefits, had no options, just the expectation to pack up and leave like I never existed.  \n  \nThe worst part is that this is not just about money or survival. I genuinely loved my job. I had amazing coworkers, a great team, and what I believed to be the perfect job in the perfect country. I was lucky enough to have made meaningful contributions and had so much more to offer as a 32-year-old with a bright future ahead of me. That is why I have so many regrets about how things turned out, and I know they will stay with me for a lifetime. I would give anything to go back and keep doing what I love. But because I wanted to do things the right way, legally and honorably, there just do not seem to be any options left.  \n  \nLosing my job did not just mean losing income. It meant losing my ability to stay afloat in the country I call home. Even when I had a good income, I was living paycheck to paycheck, covering expenses for two people. A large portion of my money went toward taxes, rent, and paying off debts that piled up after I lost my previous job during the pandemic. Now, with no work permit, not even under-the-table cash jobs would be enough to cover my expenses, and those would not be legal for me anyway.  \n  \nOver the years, Canada’s immigration system has become increasingly strict. The requirements kept changing, the point thresholds kept rising, and options like employer-specific work permits, which could have been a lifeline for people like me, were removed in Ontario. By the time I finally became eligible or was just about to, things had already shifted again. I know people who moved to other provinces because obtaining permanent residency was easier there, but even that became riskier when some pathways suddenly disappeared.  \n  \nGoing back to Turkey is not just about starting over. It is a nightmare waiting to happen. My brother and I are both considered army escapees, which means we would be forced into mandatory military service soon after arriving. The Turkish army is notorious for its brutal conditions. As ethical vegans and atheists, we would be in an impossible position. The army does not accommodate veganism, and being openly atheist is frowned upon both socially and institutionally. I know our time there would be unbearable in every way.  \n  \nThe system does not account for people like me, those who have given everything to this country, only to be left with no way to stay.  \n  \nIs this how the system treats people who dedicate their youth, education, and labor to this country?  \n  \nI do not want to sound ungrateful. I have always loved this country, and I still do. I love its people, and I consider Toronto my real home. Leaving would feel like losing a part of myself forever. But after all these years, not having a viable pathway to stay just does not feel fair to me.  \n  \nAfter more than two days without sleep, with stress piling up and rent due while I have no income, my mind is all over the place while writing this.  \n  \nI also recorded myself talking about all of this for about half an hour right before writing this, crying the whole time. It felt like therapy in a way, just letting it all out. Now, writing this feels like another form of that release.  \n  \nI do not know what comes next, but I needed to get this off my chest. If nothing else, I hope sharing my story highlights how the system fails people who follow all the rules and still end up with nothing. I truly hope it will somehow help future people like me.  \n  \nThank you for reading. I truly appreciate anyone who takes the time to respond with feedback, suggestions, or criticism.",

We were so tired of waiting and I told (lets call him Mateo) mateo to volunteer us. \n\n\nHe was reluctant cause no one had spoken up and we couldn’t see the cart, but I told him to please accept cause I was tired. \nWhen he raised his hand I saw a lot of people turn to us with a mocking expression, I started to get scared. \n\n\nIn our cart there were two morbidly obese people who shouldn’t have been allowed. The security lady came to secure us (it was a long bar that gets pulled from up and secures all the people in the cart from the hip idk how to explain) and she started pulling down the bar when she reached the gigantic stomach of the man. She tried going lower but his belly wouldn’t let her. \n\nI was scared cause i wasnt secured at all. Mind you i was a fucking lanky teenager and the ride started and i felt myself slipping down. I started crying saying to mateo that i was gonna die and he realized what was happening. He tried to grab me as best as he could cause he also wasn’t really secured but he was way bigger than me. I was crying so hard trying to hold on with all my strength (it wasnt much lmao) my brother trying to help me, when suddenly i felt myself go up and almost over the security bar. \n\nI don’t know how but mateo found the strength to pull me back down and I was panicking so hard. The ride ended and i couldn’t calm down, mateo picked me up and carried me all the way back to our parents, only then did we both realize i peed myself at 13 years old. \n\nIt was so scared, so embarrassed, top 5 worse  experiences of my life would not recommend. Being in a park with roller coasters rn made me remember that horrible feeling. \n\nEdit: my bad at the title i meant peed, english is not first language \n\n",

La quercia offre segretamente conforto ai suoi numerosi coinquilini che la abitano ed ignora coloro che le crescono affianco e che cercano di non interferire con la sua quiete.\n\nLe radici che prima estraevano solo preoccupazioni dai propri simili ora ricavano solo nettare puro e paradisiaco, ricco dei più naturali ed immediati piaceri: la pace del canto degli uccelli, la tranquillità di un bosco che come unica imposizione segue le stagioni con le bellezze che ognuna di essa gli porta, il rintocco lontano di una campana di qualche paese vicino. Le preoccupazioni inutili lasciano spazio solo a presa di coscienza ed accettazione.\n\nGuardare al bosco e avere nostalgia di paesaggi passati che solo la quercia ha avuto capacità di comprendere. Voltare le spalle alla città che invece di nutrirsi di ricordi campagnoli e pensieri ciclici, senza neccessità di crearne frettolosamente di nuovi, si alimenta con la scomodità ed il rumore del futuro obbligo non naturale, non favorendo una vita vissuta unicamente sul filare dei pensieri e l'evoluzione dell'umore.\n\nVivere senza un'obbiettivo od un peso sulle spalle, vivere essendo nessuno, vivere solo di artifici umani e fenomeni naturali, solo la salute conta, null'altro, tutto ciò di cui ho sempre vissuto e tutto ciò che ho conosciuto: natura, relax, ricordi, solitudine ed isolamento. Così come fa la stessa quercia che ho sempre ammirato, vivrò questa vita spoglia e silenziosa, senza più incappare in tumulti di pianto ed ansia paralizzante, accettando il vento che tra gli spazzi vuoti ed isolati soffia e che ricorda all'animo la dimenticata arte dell'accettare ciò che razionalmente odiamo ma che inconsciamente amiamo, la pigrizia. L'esistenza terrena è di per sé mortale, quindi perchè rincorrere la fatica e l'ansia quando si può semplicemente accettare l'inerzia?",

        "selftext": "When I was 17(F), I met someone. A woman. Online. I never met her in real life, even years later. We only spoke on the phone once for an hour (years later). It was basically a purely texting relationship. \n\nIt was a blogging site, one of those where you just wrote an online diary, basically. We hit it off as conversation partners, but it wasn’t more than that for around a year. We didn’t even talk that often, but when we did it was magical. She was much older than me, and I knew it from the beginning. She was 31 when we met. It was weird for me to talk to someone older, but it just worked, and I didn’t think about it much, so I rolled with it. We talked almost exclusively about a shared hobby. \n\nA year later I was having a complete breakdown. It was my first major mental health breakdown. I think I was just lost in transitioning from school life to college life. I suffered alone for a year (I didn’t really have a support system), and after that, I decided to open up about it in my online diary. I didn’t know what I expected, if I expected anyone to care. But she suddenly supported me. She talked to me a lot. She said she had been through the same things, so she understood what I was feeling. And that’s how it started: she explained to me A LOT about how mental health works. When I was a teenager, I didn’t “believe in mental health”. Till it bit me in the ass: I mean, I had this major breakdown, and suddenly, my “nonexistent” mental health incapacitated me. I had severe fatigue, panic attacks, even diarrhea. So, the woman basically taught me some basic concepts, explained some basic things to me. I started to read up on therapy, psychology, we’d discuss issues. \n\nIt was also magical: she just got me. I’d never had the privilege of having anyone in my life who understood me, gave me a manual to myself. I internalized my family’s approach of ‘you’re just a lost cause hysterical little shit, and there’s nothing left to do with you but ignore you when you get difficult’. And with her, I suddenly understood that I wasn’t hysterical. That my feelings had a cause. That I could actually fulfill my needs, and there would be no breakdown. So, she taught me how to relate to myself in a healthier way, how to be on my side, always. And the best part? She never actually lectured me on anything, never made me do anything, never got mad at me for not trying anything. And she was always respectful to me despite the age difference. She never played the ‘I’m older and I know better’ card, even though she was definitely older and knew better. She just explained how things work (for her, and how she thought it worked for me, too because we’re so similar), and I could take it or leave it. She just treated me the way that I understood how to treat myself. Like, she’d do or tell me things that’d calm me down, or help me get out of despair, or a panic attack, and I made a mental note ‘oh, that’s what I need when I’m having a panic attack. Yes, this works for me when I’m overwhelmed. Ok, that’s what I’ll ask for when I need support next time’. \n\nI think I was going through this very major and life-changing breakdown for about a year. My health was never the same after that (still isn’t, 13 years later), but I was slowly learning to live with this new version of myself. I felt more stable, but I still needed a lot of support. And she was there. I don’t think I’d be alive or (relatively) sane right now if it wasn’t for her during that first year, if it wasn’t for her guidance and gentleness. I really had no one, especially no one who understood me like she did. She’s the one who made me try therapy. Not by talking about it (she never went to therapy herself), but a couple of months after we started talking about my mental health, I was reading some posts about therapy, and understood that what I felt with her, I could find in therapy. And I got really interested in it: with her, I couldn’t ask for more or for a more stable presence. With a therapist, I could get that presence for an hour a week on a regular basis. Well, I never found that therapist with whom I had this magic. Never found anyone even remotely not hurtful, actually (I have a bad trauma from therapy by now, tried 20 therapists). The woman was really the only person in the world who got me to relax and listen to her without fighting and rejecting right away. Others would just trigger me hard, trigger a defensive response and then hurt me when I couldn’t accept what they were saying, even though I was fighting myself hard not to push them away. With her, it felt like she was going through the minefield of my psyche, knowing exactly where to go and where not to go and how to neutralize at least some of the mines without setting an explosion off. And the most awesome effect was that the neutralization usually had ripple effect: she’d make one small thing feel slightly better, and I could feel the chain reaction of things correcting themselves months later, things that were unrelated to the first conversation.  \n\nIt went on for years. I mean, she wasn’t my therapist, but… We talked about our lives, hobbies, mental health. It was always the older-younger dynamics, but not in a bad patronizing way: she’d just explain things, but she never pushed. She never said that because I’m younger I don’t get to have a different opinion. Never laughed at me. Never tried to make me respect her. She didn’t need to: I’ve never respected anyone like this in my life. She doesn’t have a conventional successful life: never married, never moved out of her family’s apartment, she didn’t even work most of her thirties (for reasons I didn’t fully understand but never pushed her to share). But I respected her more than anyone who had all those. She was very smart, driven, understood things deeply, always treated people with respect, everyone, she had this quality of attracting people to her, like, she didn’t wait for anyone to start talking to her (like I did), if she saw someone she found interesting, she’d just initiate. And she treated vulnerability with care. Doesn’t matter what happened between us, doesn’t matter if I hurt her (unintentionally. I’d never do anything bad to her intentionally), doesn’t matter what was happening — she never used any one of my open wounds, never chose to set any of the mines just to hurt me back. And she could do it at any moment. She spoke my language, she knew how to put things exactly in a way that her words would have the most effect, so she could destroy me. She never ever even tried in all those years. Not even when the relationship went sour and she was annoyed with me for years. She’d snap at the small things (once she started aggressively attacking me in a discussion about Harry Potter… Not me—my thought process. That’s when I knew it wasn’t just a rough patch but truly over), but she never went for my traumas. Not even when she didn’t enjoy me anymore. \n\nAs I said, the way she treated me had a ripple effect, fixing things without her even trying. Through the years, the way she treated me, talked to me, I developed that inner compass as I call it: basically, this feeling that in my life, I’m the one who always knows best. Even if I make mistakes, I’m still the one who knows best, and I’ll course correct if I make a mistake. I don’t mean that I feel that I’m always right about everything — just in my life, in things that concern me. It was very different from what my family told me: you’re incapable of anything, you should listen to us, you don’t have a brain. That inner compass made me finally start living my life. Not what my family thought was best — what I felt like doing. And the most beautiful part of it was that these things were not what the woman wanted either. They were truly mine. I moved to another country — something I always wanted. She clearly couldn’t understand my decision, but that didn’t matter. It was mine. I started speaking another language (English) more because that’s what I always wanted, and she couldn’t understand it either. And it didn’t matter. I knew what I wanted. And a thousand choices like that that she watched me make and kept her mouth shut enough. Because of this inner compass, I feel like there will always be a part of her in me, wherever I go. \n\nAs I’ve said, the relationship went sour. With years, I understood that this dynamics of her keeping me at arm’s length (I never knew much about her, her struggles, she never let me support her) doesn’t work for me anymore. And I wanted to actually talk on the phone, actually meet her. All I could get out of her was one phone call, and after that she was always “not in a good place” for a call. I finally was brave enough to admit to myself that I wanted more of her (and that I’m an equal in this relationship and an adult, too, so I have the right to pursue it), and wanted to have a relationship. She was vague about it. And then her reaction made me not sure about it, too. At some point she did try to rely on me more, and I didn’t get it, I guess, and it hurt her immensely (and when I understood that I hurt her, it was hard to forgive myself: she was someone I NEVER wanted to hurt. Not for any reason). And then we talked about everything — the dynamics, my feelings, our wants and desires — and just like that it was over, slowly, quietly, not really too painfully (and immensely painfully for me at the same time, but, I mean, she didn’t really hurt my feelings. I was just hurting because it ended). It was 7 years after we started talking. \n\nBut I could never forget her. I’d text her sometimes, just to know how she is. Nothing too personal — just to know if she was ok. She’d get annoyed at me for that. I couldn’t really understand why… She’d say something about me “trying to be a people-pleaser and showing that I still care when I don’t”. At some point, I asked her if I should stop texting her because I clearly annoy her. She said yes. I tried. I tried for two years. And then I texted her again and said that I’m not a child anymore (I was 28 at the time), and I don’t want to live in a world where we don’t talk. We didn’t have to be best friends, but I was certain we had to talk. Sometimes. About anything. At some point. And she agreed. It was weird, and I was the one texting her mostly. And then it fizzled out. \n\nI never talked to her about it. There was nothing left to talk about, nothing left to say. But I still think about her when something good happens in my life. When something bad happens, and I handle it like a capable adult without falling apart. When I manage to choose myself instead of caving in. \n\nYesterday was one of those days I couldn’t keep it in (the last one was a year ago, and she did acknowledge it, even if briefly). I texted: “Hey, it’s one of those days when I can’t help it but want to wish you the best. So, here I am, wishing you the best. You’re incredible, and I feel so lucky to happen to live on this Earth when you exist”. She read it immediately, and… left me on read. I’m not sure why. She used to tell me that she doesn’t know what to say when people tell her good things, and she used to do it with me, too. But she usually acknowledged it. Now she didn’t. Did she think I was weird for texting it? Did I make it awkward? Was it too much? I guess I’ll never know. But ChatGPT told me to try and write it in a journal, so, here I am, on this sub, trying not to bother the most magical connection of my life with my gratitude. \n\nI’ve been in love; I have parents; siblings (well, cousins); I’ve had best friends. And this connection was everything in one: an older sibling who’s almost like a parent who’s also my best friend and with whom I’m absolutely in love. She was my first adult love: the love when you don’t just fall for someone because you think they’re perfect, but the love when the more you see the imperfections, the more you respect and love the person. You understand how difficult their life is, and respect how beautifully they’re fighting and what a strong and capable person they are despite all their limitations. \n\nMy life (and mental health) are in no way perfect. I’ve made a lot of mistakes, some of which I won’t ever be able to fully correct. But the peaceful moments that I have, the good things, the authentic parts of my life, the parts where I feel like I’m living my life and not someone else’s, I owe to her. ",

I (19 M) have always been aware that my penis is very small (well below average) and It’s something I’ve been insecure about, but I’ve tried not to let it define me. Recently something happened that made me feel way more insecure than I’ve ever felt. \n\nI was with a girl I’ve been talking to recently and we decided to have sex but during she said “I don’t know how to say this but I can barely feel anything. I was expecting something else” The way they said it wasn’t outright mean, but it felt so dismissive and made me feel like I wasn’t enough. It really got to me and now I’m stuck thinking about it all the time.\n\nI’ve always known I’m smaller than most guys but hearing a comment like that from someone I was intimate with really knocked my confidence. I’ve only been with 1 other girl and I was self conscious about it with her but we both had a good time for the most part. But after that comment I’m constantly worrying that I’ll never be enough for a future partner and that my size will always be a problem.\n\nI really don’t want to let this comment affect me, but it’s hard to move on from.

She was loving caring and amazing and she would drop everything for me. If texted her she was there but today she was distant. And i know why. She told me she didn't have the same feelings and i know that and i have to be okay with that and I'm trying to. But it's really difficult to. She started talking to this new guy and I'm pretty sure they went out today because she looked so nice in the one snap i got from her. It was her going out look. And the only time she doesn't instantly respond to me is when she's out with someone like that. If it's one of her girlfriends she's normally really quick and talkitive with me still. And it sucks. It really hurts and she called today to say she had a birthday gift for me which is nice because i don't really celebrate my birthday i don't like making a day about me but it's such a kind gesture. And i could tell she was really happy in her voice. And she said she had a good day and wouldn't tell me why which means it's probably the guy. And it's not like she's hiding that fact i asked her not to tell me about him and those experiences because it made me feel bad and insecure but honestly i don't know if hurts worse not being told but it still feels bad. Anyways I'm really lonely feeling right now and just wanted a connection from someone and nobody is there to answer me it seems. All the people who i used to be able to pick up and talk to whenever whenever don't respond to me anymore and when i reach out in a time like this just to feel a small connection nobody is there. And i feel so alone and I've never felt this way. I've always been happy alone but it's so different this time and i don't like it.

I will admit tho, I am a late bloomer, I was bullied mercilessly as a child, was fat then skinny and now I’m in the middle which is nice.\n\n\nI know I need to put myself out there more but every time I do so I get burned rather quickly, in spectacular fashion I may add.

In a way this more just confirmed that he has cheated. I’ve also always been a sneaky person, when i was younger i would always listen through the doors and behind walls whenever my parents would fight, just so i can know everything and see how transparent they’d actually be with me.

When each of us transferred all of our information to our new devices some of the applications pop up. And at 13 i was the most chronically online emo loser who grew up in the 2000-2010s era so i recognize a grindr logo when i see one. That day my dad did look a bit like he knew that i saw but he probably thought i didn’t know what it was he had on his phone. I just told myself maybe i thought i had seen that logo, and left it alone, until now. Tonight after my nightly routine i forgot my hair ties in my parents room so i decided to sneak in there while my dad was asleep, and his phone was unlocked with a chat opened. Like i said….im nosy.

I was belittled by my GP who was like \"you've got nothing dude you're fine, in fact you're overreacting\". (I was willing to kill myself at the time because I had no hope I'd able to have a normal life)\nThen, I changed my GP, she gave my antidepressants, and it went slowly better. I finally recovered after like 8 months in hell. I was able later to enjoy my life.\n\nNow, as I am about to do something thrilling in my life for a few months, symptoms are back. It's been one month. I'm unable to eat, and I want to puke like a lot (like I have no appetite at all, I have dark thoughts, eructations...) Don't know why, might be after a COVID infection I had (but like I've had 6 of them till 2020 so I don't know). Or a changing environment. I left my city.\nIt's bad, but that time I got antidepressants quick, whereby I hope my symptoms will get better. I searched on the Internet, might be dyspexia. \n\nSi if anyone is experiencing something similar (or generally troubles with their intestines yk), you're not alone. We are a lot struggling with a society that does not understand us. I always had the feeling that, for people, when you don't have something killing you like cancer, it's no big deal you are overreacting and complaining for nothing.\nCancer is terrible, worse for most of them, but our troubles count. Especially when you can't enjoy a meal, a party, or just hanging out with friends because of that.\n\nGotta wait one week for the effects of my antidepressants, we'll see. The only good thing is that it disappeared one time, so it can disappear again.\n\nBless you guys, ",

        "selftext": "Just here to vent. \n\nI (29m) have never had any real friends. I've always just had people that I know. Now, I'm at the point where I realize that I don't have anyone at all. I thought that I had friends at various points in my life, but they never stuck around for one reason or another. They were only \"friends\" with me out of convenience, meaning that they didn't have any of their actual friends around and buddied up to me to pass the time. Then there were those who were only \"friends\" with me to get what they wanted out of me before ghosting me or flipping out when I stopped providing what they wanted and ditched me. Those \"friends\" who wanted rides or money or favors that monopolized my time and resources to the point where trying to tell them that they were asking too much of me made them lash out. Those \"friends\" who wanted everything from me, from a listening ear to a walking atm, but who wouldn't do nearly the same thing for me. Those \"friends\" were some of the worst, but, honestly, the worst ones were those who tried to buddy up to me because they \"felt bad that I was all by myself\" because friendships built out of pity have the least amount of respect for the one being pitied. \n\nHonestly, I'm tired of it. I'm tired of feeling and being alone in crowded rooms. I'm tired of not having anyone around who cares about me and actually wants me around. I'm tired of being made to feel like it's a chore for others to talk to me. I'm tired of caring more about others than they do for me. I'm tired of being so lonely. \n\nI haven't had any real social connections in years and it's, obviously, starting to get to me. I just want to have people to talk to about random, every day crap. Or, better yet, I want to have people to have serious conversations with about the universe and life or whatever over a bonfire or in a random spot in the middle of the desert on a clear, star filled night. I want to have people who don't look at me funny when I say we should go on a random adventure to a museum that I think looks cool or some gimmicky attraction that I found that looks like it would be fun. I like gimmicks and museums and want people around who aren't going to call me weird for liking them and wanting to go experience them. I want someone to go fishing with who isn't going to say they're bored every five minutes or tell me we should just go to a bar because \"it's the same thing.\" It's not the same thing and I don't drink. I just want to have people around who take as much interest in me as I do in them without calling me or my interests weird or creepy or boring or lame. \n\nI want to go to museums and attractions with people. I want to go on random adventures to random places; maybe go randonauting or urban exploring- there's plenty of places to see. I want to go fishing with people. I want to watch football and baseball with people; maybe even go to a local game together. I want to have people who'll play basketball or badminton or Pokémon Go with me. I want to go bowling and to the arcade and to the put-put spot with people. I want to play billiards with someone who isn't going to call me creepy for loving to play it. I want to drive around aimlessly listening to true crime podcasts or creepypastas (Creepsmcpasta specifically) or just with people who'll share music with me and not call my taste in music weird or old-fashioned. I want to go have lunch in my car in the Sonic stalls with someone (don't know why, it just sounds like it'd be fun). And on that note, I want to have someone who's willing to go try new food places with me. I want to have someone to talk to about anything and everything. I want to be able to talk to someone about who's the best Robin or how Anissa is the worst character in Invincible (even worse than Immortal). I want to have someone to talk to about some random occult things that I read about or saw on the internet. I think it'd be kinda fun to pull out the Ouija board or some tarot cards or something. I want someone to share random fun facts with me as much as I like to share with them. I want to be tagged in random posts on social media or actually have someone acknowledge that we did something together or, better yet, have people who'll want to take pictures with me without telling me that I ruined the picture by smiling weird or just telling me that they don't like taking pictures with me. I want to have a barbeque by the pool in the summer; maybe throw a football around in the street. Or maybe have some random potluck and I'll make some Currywurst for people to try. I want people to teach me some of the languages that they speak or maybe want to learn one with me or I'll teach them some German. \n\nHonestly, as long as I had someone around who would share with me what I share with them, then that would be enough. Looking back on what I've already written, none of that would actually matter in comparison to just knowing that I had a friend. But, writing this all out and venting just makes me feel pathetic. It makes me feel even worse than having my family question me when I go out because I don't have friends so why am I out. That hurts on it's own, but the vibe of desperation that this seems like feels worse than that. I don't know. I've gotten this far, but it feels like none of it even matters and there's no point regardless. I'm just that person who doesn't have friends and it's just one of those things that needs to be accepted even though it hurts. It is what it is. It's really not like it matters anyway because if the rest of this year plays out how I'm expecting it to, I won't be here by this time next year anyway, so that just makes it easier, I guess. So, why not vent and ruminate for a while and see how I feel later on? Maybe things will be different and I'll feel differently. Plus, thinking about everything makes me think that I'm just better off alone regardless, but, even then, it doesn't make the pain of that loneliness go away, so at least having some type of outlet helps in it's own way. It's better than nothing and just keeping all of this bottled up at least. ",

And im not going to get her to do something shes not comfortable with or doesnt want to do. We also spoke about how id like to see more effort and enthusiasm during sex from her as i felt a bit like my pleasure wasnt that important which isnt a great feeling let me tell you, and she hasnt really put any more effort into it minus the absolute bare minimum.\n\nIf im completely honest, im terrified. Im scared of what the future will be, scared that I wont find someone else, scared about hurting her which is the last thing I want to do is hurt her but I also need to take care of my own happiness. This is my first proper relationship and girlfriend, I've never had to break up with someone and im so scared.\n\nMy minds still a bit mad trying to process my decision so sorry if this doesnt read very well.\n\nEdit: more things to get off my chest jesus sorry. \nI do still love her, and this yoyo effect I'm feeling of wanting to break up then doubting has made me feel so numb scared and empty I feel so lost. Each time my girlfriend messages me today it hurts so much i really do care for her but, i just don't know if I'm doing what I did early on and ignoring things that obviously do bother me because I've got complacent.

        "selftext": "TLDR; I am a sex worker and I let a client get too obsessed. He threatened suicide when I ended things with him and I went to the police on the off chance he was serious. It turned out to just be another ploy to try and get me to talk to him. \n\nLet's preface this with I am an independent sex worker. I do in person sex work by the hour and it's my job because I enjoy it and it gives me a lot of financial security.\n\nMy best friend, \"Celia\", also does sex work and we share notes about the job, and even have the same clients on occasion. \n\nShe met \"John\" first. John is an obese 300lb man, early 30s, and a high maintenance client. He was very recently divorced because he cheated on his high school sweetheart wife with another friend from high school. He left his wife, only to have his new girlfriend leave him about a month later for another man. Why did he cheat on his wife? Because she had \"gained so much weight that he no longer found her attractive\" (I saw photos of her, she was barely overweight. He on the other hand nearly doubled his weight since they got married). \n\nJohn is a home inspector for an insurance company. He makes good money by inspecting a high volume of homes, but part of the job is using all the data collected to write personalized reports on each home inspection. When John was married, his wife did the reports for him (this was illegal because the information is supposed to be confidential, but he was able to get away with it because they lived together and she used his work PC to help him out).\n\nSo he left his wife, then his girlfriend of two months left him. He was desperate to get her back any which way, and knew she needed money, so he offered to pay her to do the reports for him (which worked out because his wife was no longer willing to do them). He figured out a way to log into his work from her PC, trained her up, and used his position as her boss to make her spend as much time with him as possible so he could potentially win her back (he would only ever pay her in person, for example, and coerce her into spending hours with him before he paid her the money). This isn't important to the story, it just gives background information on his history of inappropriate relationships and manipulating women. \n\nIn the meantime, he started seeing escorts to fill the sexual void. Eventually he met Celia and very quickly fell into limerance. For the first time since his ex girlfriend left him, John had a new woman to obsess over. He shared his whole life story with Celia, texted her all the time, and visited her more often than he could afford. She found him exhausting to see (he had strangled dick syndrome from a porn addiction, and struggled to get off, but would urge her to keep trying). He talked constantly about himself, overshared about his childhood trauma, and would stay longer than he paid for, forcing her to have to kick him out each time. She set boundaries about him texting her so much and taking so much of her emotional energy, but he kept breaking them. \n\nSo she enlisted my help. I have a few more years experience under my belt, and felt confident that I could handle his neediness. After she talked me up, he agreed to meet me. \n\nThe appointment was a success. I was able to work around his strangled dick problem and he began to see us both regularly. But it became obvious that he was obsessive and inappropriate. He talked about Celia non-stop and shared personal details about their time together with me. He also shared private details about his ex-wife and ex-girlfriend. \n\nWhen he saw Celia, he talked about me and overshared in a similar way.  It made her very uncomfortable and she set boundaries around it. He didn't abide by the boundaries, so she fired him. \n\nHe was devastated... But I was able to distract him and help him process the heartbreak. He felt betrayed by her, because she treated him as a client and he felt like he deserved better treatment. I gently defended her actions, but not so much that it would offend him.\n\nBy this point I was earning steady money seeing him, so I didn't want to risk jeopardizing that cash flow. \n\nI could see that he needed the full girlfriend experience, so I gave it to him. He was very insecure so I often needed to reassure him that he could count on me, that I would be a stable person in his life, so long as he kept paying my rates for time together. I allowed him to take me to dinner off the clock occasionally, and texted him back on occasion (I didn't get triggered by his incessant texting in the same way as Celia).\n\nIt worked out pretty decently for a few months. I felt like I was meeting his needs, and he seemed happier and more stable. Unfortunately, my carefully set boundaries started to erode. He didn't see me as an escort anymore, he saw me as a sugar baby... Then as a girlfriend. He told me he loved me. Often. He started celebrating \"anniversaries\" for us and booking me for holidays.\n\nI, too, found his company exhausting. The whining, the complaining, the bad decisions, the love bombing, the delusional thinking.... It started to be too much. I felt like I was wearing a thick mask while I was with him, forcing myself not to show my disgust. I hated the way he bragged about how much money he made, while breaking the rules to do it. I hated his \"nice guy\" syndrome and how entitled he felt to attention from women. I hated the way he would eat dairy despite being lactose intolerant. I hated the way he binged on McDonald's after eating a large dinner with bottomless cokes. I hated the way he touched me and kissed me. I hated the self obsession, and the victim mentality he had. \n\nI couldn't stand his inability to take any personal accountability in his life. I eventually learned that despite making over 300k a year he was completely maxed out in debt because he had a gambling addiction in addition to his sex addiction. He learned to count cards at the casino and managed to con a younger card counter (I think he was only 21) into lending him tens of thousands of dollars to \"invest\" into being an advantage player at the casino. Unfortunately John lacked discipline and lost everything on slot machines. To his credit, he is planning to pay the kid back, but learning about this made me incredibly nervous and I started to get the sense that I was in over my head. \n\n I hated the way that he would talk about being sexually abused as a child without warning in excruciating and disgusting detail. I hated that he would rather spend money he didn't have on escorts and gambling than see a therapist. \n\nI felt gross and drained for hours or even days after seeing him, and would sometimes have to turn down other work because I didn't feel up to it. \n\nThe last straw for me happened Feb 16. We were supposed to see each other on Valentine's day, but I fell ill with the flu a few days earlier. He complained every day while I was sick and pestered me, dangling the money for my overnight fee over my head. He wasn't able to schedule another overnight until March, so if I didn't see him by Sunday, I would lose out on the $2000. Also he just really really really needed to get laid, and if I didn't see him, he'd go see another escort. \n\nSo, still feverish and really fucking ill, I let him come see me. \n\nIt's important to note that the first time he booked me for an overnight, he touched me in my sleep. This is a hard NO for me, and I let him know. Subsequent overnights, he did not cross that boundary. But this night, I woke up again to him assaulting my body in my sleep. My heart was racing and I felt so violated that I wanted to cry. I didn't want major confrontation, so I just pushed his hands away and told him I was still trying to sleep. But I spent the rest of the night on high alert, only able to doze for short periods of time. \n\nAfter that, I knew it was time to stop seeing him. Because we planned our appointments for each month up to two months in advance, it did not seem appropriate to simply ghost him. I struggled to find the right way to end it. I knew he was obsessively attached to me and it would be chaotic no matter how gently I tried to let him go. \n\nThen an opportunity presented itself. He saw another escort and fell asleep in his car in her parking lot. He woke up to the police questioning him and searching his car and phone. He cracked under pressure and admitted to paying for sexual services. He told them about me and about her. They chose not to arrest him or press charges, but when he related all the information to me, I decided to seize this excuse to stop seeing him. I told him that for my safety I did not want him to ever contact me again. \n\nAt first he said he understood and said goodbye. And then for the next five days, he bombarded me with texts and emails. He also sent YouTube videos of him crying and begging, snot dripping. Or drunk and begging and crying. Then sober and matter of factly laying out the reasons why my fears about his interaction with the cops was unfounded. More texts, more emails from different accounts. \n\nI responded to none of it. It made me feel even more disgusted by him, honestly. I hoped that he would eventually tire and just go the fuck away. \n\nThen he emailed me a suicide note. I didn't receive it until nearly four hours after he sent it because I was busy working. It stated that by the time I received it, it was already too late to stop him. But then three hours after the email, he sent me a YouTube video suicide note, which seemed fishy. \n\nIt has my already frazzled nerves in shambles. I worried that I could somehow be found responsible if he was found dead and they traced the cause back to me. \n\nI eventually gave in and called the police. I posed as a girlfriend and I hoped it would be a one and done call, but they kept calling me back for more information (I knew his address and full name and vehicle) and they wanted copies of his suicide letters. \n\nThey tracked him down and it turned out he was absolutely fine. He just wanted me to talk to him, and was willing to do anything to make it happen.\n\nI guess the cop successfully conveyed to him that he needed to stop harassing me, because the emails, texts and videos stopped. He did message my friend, but she told him the same thing the cop did - that he had to stop harassing me through her or else we'd go to the police. \n\nI wish I had ignored his suicide note. I feel tricked and I'm still angry about it. ",

        "selftext": "My sister (f 30), has been with her baby daddy(m 30) for about 15 years now. He’s very much an abusive, manipulative, disgusting person that feeds off of people’s weaknesses. They’ve been together quite literally half her life, since she was in high school and at the time I was about 12 years old. At first he was an amazing brother in law and did all the cool stuff that comes with the brother territory. Then once I reached 14 all hell broke loose. I won’t go into too much detail but my sister’s baby daddy sexually assaulted me from from the ages of 14 until I was almost 17. Her and I had a huge falling out after the fact due to her denying it ever happened even though she was there for a few of the occurrences. He’s a very violent man and has even attempted to murder a misbehaving dog by strangulation that he had owned. I always had a sneaking suspicion that he had been laying his hands on my sister but after two days ago, my suspicions have been confirmed. A few days ago I got a call from my nana(f 71) stating that the baby daddy had beaten my sister pretty badly. He blackened her eye, busted her lip, attempted to strangle her(he left hand prints on her neck), and beat her in the stomach with a broom handle. In a panic, she managed to get away, escaping to a neighbor woman’s house a few blocks away. After he tried searching for her in his pickup truck, he then called my father and stated she was missing. He even tried filing a missing person report for her. Unfortunately for him, my sister had already contacted the authorities and notified them of the attempted murder. The cops escorted her the next day to get her two children from him and she’s currently in a women’s shelter until my nana can get to her. \n\nI don’t wish what she went through on anyone and I hate that she even had to endure any of that. I can only imagine the turmoil and sorrow she feels. Especially having been with someone for so very long. The problem I’m struggling with is setting aside my pride and being there for her in her time of need. We haven’t spoken in 5 years. At this point we’re two very different people.  I think back to me being that scared 14 year old that no one believed or cared to stand up for. I had messages and physical marks on me at the time and the adults failed me. I know she was a victim too, but it’s hard for me to forget her part as well. Any advice would be much appreciated, but please be kind. Thanks Reddit. ",

Depression has been a constant in my life, and I’m pretty sure there’s something seriously wrong with me mentally. I’ve never sought professional help never in my life. Instead, I’ve coped by abusing drugs like MDMA, LSD, and and ket, weed every single day since I was 14. It’s been my crutch, but it’s not working anymore.\nI’ve never had a real girlfriend, though that’s not even my main issue. The real problem is I can’t stay consistent with anything working out, holding a job, nothing. Today, I was supposed to get up and go to work, but I just couldn’t be bothered. I bailed. It feels like my brain is fighting against me. I’m suicidal 24/7. When I hit these lows, they last about three months, then I get a month of “normal” before it crashes again. Right now, I’m in one of those dark phases, and it’s so bad I’m genuinely debating whether to end my life today. I don’t know what to do anymore.\nMy body’s a mess too I go from fat to skinny and fat to skinny again, stuck in this weird in between because of how depression screws with me. I’ve felt like this my whole life, and I’m terrified it’ll never change. I’m getting older, life’s getting more harder and serious, and everything’s so damn expensive. I have no ambitions, no goals. I never went to school. I blow all my money, I’m in debt, and I live alone. I feel like a corrupt soul. I say I believe in God, but I don’t really. I’m a fake religious person, a fake human.\nMy friends are starting to ditch me because of how I am, and I don’t blame them. I’ve had enough. I feel like death is the only way out of this hell because I can’t imagine dragging this on until I’m 28, 35, or older. It’s already unbearable. My mom’s tried to help me so many times, but she’s given up too. I always end up back at square one, no matter what. I hate myself so much.\nI guess I’m posting this because I’m desperate.

It’s horrible, she has no sense of direction and I feel so stupid following her around.\n\nShe also talks in circles which makes me so angry. Like for an example yesterday she asked me, “do you want a burrito for dinner?” Then I replied we don’t have the ingredients for a burrito so I’m going to eat the food we have in the house. She then asks, “oh so you don’t want a burrito?” So I thought maybe she bought ingredients for a burrito so I said sure I’ll have a burrito. She then says, “ok but we don’t have the ingredients for a burrito”. Like YES I KNOW THAT.\n\nHer stupidity makes me treat her worse which I hate because I don’t want to be rude to people but sometimes the way she talks and acts just infuriates me. I also feel more slow and held down when I’m with her. Like when she makes a dumb decision I’m usually around her so I have to help her correct her mistake. \n\nAnytime I do something alone I feel a huge wave of happiness go through my body because I don’t feel held back from her behaviour. Overall she’s a good person but I honestly don’t think I can continue a relationship with her. Her misjudgments cause me so much financial loss and general stress. ",

        "selftext": "First of all, I want to apologize for my poor English since I’m doing this through a translator. I’m a 19-year-old guy who has had pectus carinatum his whole life. It has brought me a lot of teasing and stares, and even though I have the mildest case, I have a small banana-shaped protrusion on my sternum. I’ve wanted surgery since I was 14.\n\nAs a first option, they wanted me to wear a compression brace for a year, which is complete nonsense. I knew it wouldn’t fix what I have, and even the doctor said so. I fought for years to get surgery until one day they took me to the sub-capital to see a doctor. The doctor told me it was a very mild case and that the surgery was very simple: they would cut two cartilages, push the sternum inward, and that was it. This happened in June 2024. I was very excited about the idea of having a normal chest.\n\nMy experience with this condition has been horrible and has caused me a lot of insecurity. Every time I wear a t-shirt, the lump is noticeable, making me look much fatter than I actually am. I’ve been training for five years, and it’s horrible to see how I can’t make progress in my chest because this damn protrusion sticks out—it’s all I’ve seen in the mirror for five years.\n\nGoing back to what I was saying, my parents postponed the surgery until 2025. I got angry with them and gave them an ultimatum: “Either I get the surgery, or I leave the house.” I want to clarify that this was the only thing I was asking for, the only thing I wanted. I’m the youngest child, and I have a 29-year-old sister who is studying her second degree because she realized that the first one wouldn’t get her a job. My father has always helped her with her apartment and university expenses. I’ve always known she was the favorite, and I wasn’t asking for much—just this surgery.\n\nToday we went to see a doctor in our city, and instead of agreeing with the previous doctor, he said they would have to break my abdomen, cut all the cartilage, and insert a prosthesis. I suspect this was all planned because my father is a doctor, and I have a feeling he talked to this doctor to make me change my mind or to have an excuse to say no. I walked home because I was so angry at them. I’ve been fighting for this surgery for about five years, and they found the perfect excuse to deny it.\n\nTonight at dinner, I ate in my room. I’m so tired of them—they are the most vile, cruel, and arbitrary people I know. I hate them for making me go through my entire adolescence and now my adulthood with this lump in my chest just because they don’t want me to have surgery. They have no idea how much I’ve suffered or how much I wish with all my heart to die. I wish I could just wake up one day and no longer exist in this horrible world. I hate the parents I got, and I hate my sister for being the favorite. If I could, I’d take a gun and blow my brains out so I wouldn’t have to endure this anymore—but I will make them pay. As soon as I get a job, I’ll leave this place and never speak to them again. When they’re old, I’ll put them in a nursing home—and I’m being generous. I should let them rot in their own filth.\n\nI’ll update if there’s any news.",

No one actually cares in my life.\n\nI am so tired of waking up. My self esteem is shot so I don’t go out. Bullying from my dad, family, school, people I just care about and shit. Its so engrained in my bones. My friends never told me I was mean to them, I was teased at home. I thought it was normal.  But its just kinda settling in just how abused I was. I am broken. Theres no way out for me. The life I want to have is impossible. Nonexistent. And everyday I blame myself for it.\n\nI find myself thinking of death more often. Realizing the few friends I have shouldn’t have to deal with my messiness. I am suppose to be an adult, but Im so childish. Im a failure just like all my nothing ass brothers and sisters. I just  hope when I have the nerve to finally end it they are worse off than me.\nIm evil and Im bitter. They destroyed it. We could’ve been a family. But it was easier to hate and abuse instead of just getting rid of me and I just ended up hurting people I cared about most.\n\nIm sorry my friends whom have forgotten me. I didnt know I was being abused. I didnt realize I was hurting you so badly; but I wish you could’ve told me, but its also my fault for nor providing you a safe space . I hope when or if you see my missing posters; or obituary(tho I doubt I’ll have either) my demise makes you smile and alleviates and hatred you have for me.\nI never forget your faces or your voices.

This is the third time it’s happened, and I feel like it’s destroying me because, with the first two, I ended up pushing them away, and we eventually became strangers again.\n\nRight now, I’m obsessing over a really close friend in our small friend group of three. We’ve known each other for almost three years, give or take, and we’re so close we even refer to each other as “siblings.” But recently, something changed ad I've started obsessing once again. I can’t stop thinking about them. I always want to talk, hang out, or just spend time with them. And when they spend that time with someone else, I get jealous to the point where it physically hurts and I even feel betrayed in a way.\n\nBefore you think I’m completely nuts, I know this isn’t okay. I don’t start arguments, and I never tell them how I feel because I know I don’t have the right to control who they spend time with or talk to. I would never want to make them uncomfortable or make them feel like they owe me anything. But that doesn’t stop the thoughts from eating me alive. I cannot help but wish I had them all to myself.\n\nSometimes, instead of hanging out, I’ll say, “I’m tired” or “I don’t feel like going out,” when in reality, I do want to spend time with them—but I just can’t handle it mentally. So instead, I drive alone late at night, trying to escape the overwhelming thoughts.\nI don’t want to lose yet another person because of my own obsession.

I tried to show you love and you didn’t want it. There’s only so much I can do before I can’t anymore. \n\nYou say you miss me. But you never talked to me. You hid all your feelings from me. We’d go to therapy and it felt like an attack on everything I did. It felt like anything and everything I did was wrong. \n\nI was always the one in the wrong. \n\nBut what about the things you did that hurt me?\n\nYeah I’m good at compartmentalizing. I’m good at bottling up my feelings to make others comfortable. It didn’t feel like you cared that I was doing it since it gave more room for you to talk about how you were feeling. \n\nI gave so much of myself to you. \n\nDid you really love me?\n\nOr did you just love the idea of me?\n\nSomeone to listen to you and ask how your days were and what? Why didn’t you do that for me? I wore myself out trying to make you happy. Happy with me. Happy with you. Happy with literally anything. I couldn’t do it. \n\nI miss the days that we could sit and talk for hours. I miss the days that you would smile when you saw me. I miss the days that felt like you truly loved me. I miss the days that we were actually friends. \n\nBut maybe it wasn’t real. Maybe it was the attention I gave you? Or the gifts? Or maybe I was a distraction? Something shiny and new. Uncharted territory. I don’t know. \n\nI don’t know what you’re telling people. That I broke it off? That I did this and that and whatnot? You blocked me so it’s not like I can try to support you. Not that you were accepting of my support over the last year plus. I really tried. And it felt like you just didn’t care. \n\nI shouldn’t have looked you up on here. I noticed you blocked me days ago. You didn’t tell me where you were moving-not that it’s my business, but it really sucks being completely blocked out by someone who is saying they love me. \n\nLoved me. \n\nMy heart hurts. And I can’t even talk to my best friend about it. \n\nYou wanna know why I’ve been talking to her? Because my world revolved around you. I stopped talking to my friends. All of my friends. Because you were my world. But I was just a bother to you. An annoyance. A burden. \n\nI needed someone to talk to and she messaged me. She wasn’t a bad person so I don’t know where you got that from. If anything, I was the bad person in that situation. I let you be mean to her. I let you do what you wanted because I thought you were my forever. But you didn’t think I was your forever. You don’t treat your forever the way you treated me. How are you so okay with just disappearing on me?    \n\nI truly hope you can find happiness. I wasn’t the one for you and that’s okay. I hope you can show love to the next person you find. Not as a rarity, but strong and unwavering. Love them with everything you have, because you deserve love and to love. \n\nI just wasn’t enough. \n\nI wasn’t ever going to be enough. \n\nI just wish you’d have told me sooner. ",

I want to visit not in a tourist way but staying in the areas where it would make sense for me to live in. I will decide if it is a fit for me and if it is I will start going around and looking for jobs. I have an idea how to get a place there (finding a sublet for a few months and eventually trying to lease). I have lived in a similar city so I have an idea of how to go about it. I currently live with my dad and I have come up with a complete lie to tell to him I am visiting my college town to see friends for a birthday. I am going 1000 miles away from there 😭 I have lived with my dad for the last year and I’ve enjoyed it but I need to be alone, I feel like an adult and I want to act independently and be able to be myself. I just feel like he will be angry that I am going to this city when I live with him because if I can afford to do this then I should be helping out more. I will be honest I partially took a term off so I could focus on moving out because I find this more important at this point in my life. I do not think I can be open about it since the city seems “unrealistic” in his eyes. The last time I moved when I went to college he said “you’ll be back in a year” and when I had to move back due to tuition issues he said “I told you so.” I didn’t stay with him for long that time but I bounced back. This time when I move I wouldn’t have to worry about tuition, I would be focused on making sure I make 3x or more on rent (which is why IF I like it I will be looking at jobs) and be able to figure my life out as woman in my 20s.

I cant!\" i tried to move it even slightly in order to try obeying what she said but the pain was terrible, horrendous, unbearable, i cant think of words that can extensively describe how much pain i was in\n\ni dont quite remember it all but i think when i tried to use my left hand to write i was yelled at too, and my mom minimized my pain by saying smth along the lines of \"it isnt that bad\" and i was also condescendingly asked if i wanted to go the doctor which i again refused fearing surgery and also bc having my parents yell at me made me upset\n\nall this time i remember i still had that blue vet wrap on, my hand was shaking and in so much pain, i forget if my mom did the usual \"let me feel it\" thing but if she did i most definitely refused and probably yanked it away, based on the fact I still had that vet wrap on i think it was probably the next day\n\ni was allowed to write with my left hand but not without being scolded, i remember writing down things in notebooks for fun with my left hand, and i even decided that a character id made had my left hand's handwriting, i eventually got better writing with my left hand and honestly really had fun with it\n\nwhile i wrote and did things with my left hand i also did not use my right hand or bend my wrist, at least i did as little as possible, i kept on using the vet wrap to stablize it until it wouldn't stick no more, then i found some wrap i has gotten from when i sprained my leg and so i it instead, and remembered how i treated my sprained leg, used that was refrence for resting my hand and also didn't move it bc it was painful\n\ni dont remember much else abt the recovery, i think i stopped wrapping it and started using my right hand again as soon as the pain lessoned, which probably was after like a month or two perhaps? ik it takes longer for a broken bone to recover but the pain does go away pretty quickly honestly, i remember my mom expecting me to recover from my \"sprain\" in about a week and was upset i still refused to use it and instead write with my left hand\n\ni did keep on writing with my left hand sometimes for awhile after that just for fun, which ironically probably helped my right hand recover lol\n\ni dont quite know how long after it was but i think it was a decent chunk after but within the same year, i once again slipped and fell and i forget which handi landed on but based on the pain and how caught myself (the same way again) i think it was my right, which i once again assumed was a sprain, but only a minor one, so i again pulled out the wrap i had and i think for abt a day or 3 days wrapped my hand, i remember not having much pain and wondering if it still needed wrapped the next day, but i still ended up keeping it on i think\n\nand until i was a teen it never hit me that the pain i feltin my bones was not a normal sprain thing but probably a broken bone, and it really hit me after a horse broke my foot 2 years ago that yea, that probably wasnt a sprain... bc like it was while less pain, that pain i got from my broken foot felt literally like a lesser version of the pain i felt in my hand when i was a kid\n\ntbh im not completely sure if i did break my hand as ive never rly had it inspected for past breaks, unlike my foot it doesn't rly act up when the weather changes or from overuse etc, at least i think so? i never rly took notice of anything like thay as a kid because i was never aware or looking for anybpain related to broken bones, so im open to anyone suggesting its something else, not for legitimate medical advice as well, ik i shouldnt get it from here and its already healed, just out of curiosity, i wonder if it was like a pinched nerve maybe, but it didnt feel like one at all (ive unfortunately had and continue of have pinched nerves in my neck 🙃)",

The thing is that every guy I've been with since him hasn't measured up. He's the guy I compare every other man to. He's the only person in my 31 years of life that actually made an effort. He always respected me and my boundaries. He accepted everything about me. He's the only guy to actually plan a date with me rather than putting in the minimum effort of asking me which restaurant I want to go to. I broke up with him because I didn't feel like I was good enough for him. He was on the football team and I was an awkward emo kid. I blew him off at first because I had been asked out by another football player as a joke a couple weeks prior. So for our entire relationship I just kept waiting for him to reveal that it had all been a joke too. My first real kiss was an uncomfortable situation that felt pressured and forced, and I know that had it been with him it would have been so natural. I lost my virginity to someone who had zero respect for me who broke up with me because his dad said he should play the field. Itbshould have been him. I married someone abusive and ended up divorced by the time I was 27, and now I have a child with someone who I live with and still only see on weekends most of the time because he would rather play videogames all night and sleep all day than actually put in effort with me and our child. Hs bf and I hooked up years ago when we were between relationships and I psyched myself out again thinking I wasn't good enough and ended up blowing up on him over something that could have been easily talked through. I know that we are both adults and therefore totally different people now, but I find myself thinking quite often weather the new him would like who I've become. I'm so badly damaged by a string of toxic men when I had the perfect guy for me and screwed it up multiple times. He's my one that got away, and it's my fault because I pushed him away.",

We didn’t grow up close, we barely even knew each other. One summer, I was visiting extended family, and he invited me out. Things got wild, we blacked out, and when we blacked back in… well, let’s just say we were already mid-hookup.\n\nMorning-after panic set in. He was married, so we never spoke about it, and I went back to my city. End of story. Or so I thought.\n\nFast forward 10 years. Out of nowhere, I get a call from him. Turns out, his life imploded spectacularly—divorce, addiction, hitting rock bottom. I had no clue, since we live in different countries now. He needed a fresh start and asked if he could crash with me for a couple of months.\n\nAnd, well… we fell in love. Not drunk, not an accident this time—real, actual, “I-want-to-build-a-life-with-you” love. We’ve been together for two years now, still long distance, but talking about marriage.\n\nI want to come out to our friends and family but he thinks it’s not a good idea. We are not going to reproduce so I don’t see any logical problem with it.\n\nWhat even makes a relationship “normal”? We didn’t grow up as family and if we had matched on Hinge instead of a DNA test, nobody would care.\n\nAm I wrong?",

My grandma had three children, uncle A, uncle B, and my dad, and then grandpa had a child with another woman, uncle C. This is about uncle B.\n\nI don't like his current gf. She immediately trauma dumped on my grandma to gain sympathy, then proceeded to imply she was old and getting forgetful and clumsy (grandma's perfectly fine, she's as healthy as they come), then she brought along her son she had with another man, who I have no trouble with. She herself isn't bad, but the way she and her son behave is weird, because it's like they're not a part of our family, they just kinda live there, and I have the feeling that she wants to kick my grandma out and have the house to herself, which isn't possible because it's decided 50/50 between uncle A and uncle B, but she's tried to buy the other half to uncle A, who firmly refused, because once they both pass away, the house is mine.\n\nThe worst part about all this is my uncle's behavior since she arrived. He works with my mom at a local restaurant, nothing fancy, its main target are the broke college students nearby, but they get paid well. My mom had a cousin of hers working as a waiter there, and he wasn't the best, but hey, acceptable,  but uncle B decided to start saying that he was more trouble that its worth, and that his girlfriend's son should work there, my mom firmly refused. My grandma has anxiety of going out on her own for years now and since she only lives with uncle B and his girlfriend, she constantly relies on him to get medicine or to just go out, and he's been getting extremely rude with her for no reason whenever she asks to go out, yelling and saying \"he needs his own time too\". We threw a party for grandma's birthday a while ago, and you'd expect him to sit with his mother, but no, he went and sat with his gf's family, completely ignoring grandma. I fell and got hurt pretty badly a while ago, and everyone called me and asked of I was okay, but him? Not a peep. \n\nMy last straw came a few days ago, my mom suffers really bad anxiety/panic attacks sometimes and he caused her one. Long story short, he missed work without calling in advance and my mom had to cover his shift and then tried to reprehend him because she's the manager of the restaurant. He completely flipped out and said something along the lines of \"leave, it doesn't matter, (gf's name) can replace you\", and my mom got really mad, and said \"I don't want to have anything to do with you as work or as family, you're never stepping foot into my house again\". \n\nNow I love my uncle, but his gf has completely ruined everything, I don't like her, I see her and I feel angry, but I can't do anything because I'm forced to interact with her, and you'd think my lack of warmth would tell her to not talk to me, but she talks to me as if she was my aunt, SHE'S NOT, and I genuinely wish I could just make her go away and make things go back to normal.

        "selftext": "I've been doing some thinking about all the conversations I have had with people and I think I have a issue with coming off as \"authentic\" or \"comfortable\". I met this guy online he was really nice I gave him my phone number and we hit off, we have been talking for two days the second day we call I remember he said \"oh!, someone is calling me bye!\" and I didn't think anything of it but uhm I haven't really heard from him since I texted him and he kinda left me on read and I texted him again I don't think he bothered looking at the message and I think I don't want to believe that I had just got ghosted but I think I did? And I don't blame him really because I don't know how to talk to people. I've noticed that I overshare and I can be awkward and maybe I make people sad when I talk to them but at the sametime I don't know how to approach people, or how to really make connections so I just blurt things out and I can see why that would drive someone away that kind of thing is so tiring to deal with. I also noticed when we were talking to him he said now you sound more relaxes or more comfortable or you're not trying too hard and i've got that a lot, I don't know what that meana though because sometimes thats how I genuinely act, I guess because i'm so awkward some of the things I say come off as forced but I can't help it and I don't know what to say really and I don't want to interview people and be like, oh so you like this? and this? and that? how do you feel about this? asking a ton of questions. I also was talking to someone before this guy not ina romantic sense but I think I made things awkward with that person too, I think I made them sad and I didn't mean to but it just happens sorta and I don't notice until like a day later or so and its like damn I shouldve approached it like this or like that. And even when i'm trying to talk with new people I always overthink what I want to say, I LITERALLY WAS OVERTHINKING WHAT I WANTED TO SAY TO BOOK A HAIR STYLING APPOINTMENT LIKE COME ON, thats just pathetic that it took me 3 days to ask my stylist how much is this or how do I get to her studio because I was ovethinking what I wanted to say and because I felt embarrassed and ashamed. And I started to realize that even my bestfriends don't really know what to say to certain things I say so its an awkward silence before I have to be like so uhm ahaha sorry about that!! and I have to make a stupid joke or something because I know they don't know what the hell to say and I made the whole convo awkward. I haven't even spoken to my bestfriend of 5 years, in which I should be thr most comfortable speaking to in like 5 days because i'm trying to think of something to talk about, again this is so pathetic and I don't know why im like this, it shouldn't be hard to talk to people but for some reason for me it is and it just makes me kinda angry and kinda sad and jealous because everyone makes it seem so effortless to talk to people and have a regular convo where you're like \"AUGH I SHOULDNT HAVE SAID THAT IM GONNA PUT MY HEAD IN A WALL!!\".",

        "selftext": "So, towards the end of summer last year, my coworker (26m) and I (24f) went on a date and ended up fooling around a few times after that. I had had a huge crush on him for a while and was so excited to finally go out with him. The date was super nice, but the hookups were unexpectedly really good. I don’t have a lot of experience whereas he does, and he knew that, and he let me take control of the pace and the things we did which made me feel comfortable enough to try stuff with him I hadn’t done before. Unfortunately, life stuff happened all at once, and he ended things like two weeks after the first date. I was crushed. I was hurt, disappointed, confused, and quite honestly, very sexually frustrated. I really, really liked him, and we had gotten very intimate very quickly with the expectation that there would be a lot more to come, and then all of a sudden, it was over. I felt like I was left high and dry.\n\nThe thing is, a couple of months ago, we basically ended up confessing over text that we both still wanted each other in that way and almost made plans to meet up again, but more life stuff got in the way, and we both agreed that it would still be a bad idea to do anyway. But now every time I see him at work, I can’t help but think about the things we said and did, and how much I want to do it again. The fact that I know that a part of him still desires me in that way is kind of driving me crazy. I could torture myself overanalyzing every normal conversation, every glance, every little interaction.\n\nIt would very likely be a terrible idea to do it again, and it would probably end worse than it did the first time, but the feelings just won’t go away no matter how much I remind myself of these things. I am down so, so bad for this guy.",

        "selftext": "So I recently exposed a narcissist but my situation is very different and I can’t find anything online about this situation. So I came here for potential outcomes. \n\nSo back in 2023 of March I started talking to this guy and he knew me from my childhood (we were not best friends we just saw each other in passing during our middle school years) and it went well at first. (It only lasted two weeks) While we were getting to know each other I got on his IG and saw this girl constantly posting on his page but he never paid her any mind and of course I asked and he denies it. But he must have sensed that I was hot on his tail so he decided to end things but still wanted to be friends even though we were never friends but I just said ok. What he didn’t know is that I knew I was blocked after I questioned him about the girl on IG so I made a fake page to see what was up. And even though he said he wanted to end things he was still keeping in touch with me. Even though I’m blocked on his IG so in April 2023 I saw him with that girl and he she got him to move down there with her. He is originally from my city and this girl lives in the DMV area. And with me investigating I realized that it’s a money thing so basically this guy is a prostitute she buys him stuff and he agrees to be her bf. So of course I wanted revenge but I wanted to wait until it was unexpected so for a whole year I gathered information on this girl and realized she may be a narcissist. With my digging on this girl I got her phone number driver license address email you name it I got it. And I tucked it away. So in March of 2024 I made a fake number and pretended that I knew her from one of the colleges she went to but I told her that I wanted to stay anonymous. And she went for it and all I did was expose her bf for being with me. I also wanted to add that had I not been hot on his tail he would have continued to date me. And when I found out about the girl I cut all communication with him and he found a way to contact me and wanted me back and I told him no. He even told me he never wanted us to stop talking but he needed help from this girl and I had all that in the screenshots. And you best believe I sent them screenshots to her when I was hiding behind the fake number. This girl really wanted to know who I was so I decided to give her a call and actually reveal myself and we were on the phone for 27 mins. Mind you I recorded our conversation as well because I don’t trust this bitch. But while we were on the phone she talked bad about her bf and her bf family and I did defend the family because I actually know them. Because the city we are from is small. And at one point in time I was close with the guys cousin. She said really bad things about the bf mom too. And I didn’t like that so I spoke up and I think she could tell I wasn’t going for any of her lies because I knew she was lying. And I’m sure she didn’t like that. I actually got off the phone with her because she wouldn’t let me go. So the day after I spoke to the girl her bf called me screaming at me and accusing me of all these things I didn’t even say. I couldn’t even get a word in but I knew she was going to lie so I wasn’t tripping because in my head I was going to get my lick back. Fuck this hoe. The guy wasn’t even mad that I hurt gf feelings he was mad that I lied on his family and said bad things about him. Which I didn’t say anything bad about him or his family. So after I took a verbal beating from this guy I just said cool. But I wasn’t done yet. So I waited for about six months so now we are in September 2024 and from March of 2024 to September 2024 I kept my eye on them and I watched her crumble because she is very transparent on the internet and the bf broke up with her while she begged for him back because he realized that she lied on me and she must have found me on social media because she changed everything about herself to mimic me. Mind you when I spoke to her in March of 2024 she claims that he begs her but social media says otherwise. And between March of 2024 to September of 2024 this girl and her friends and her momma started to bother me because apparently I’m the reason why her bf won’t speak to her and I still keep calling her bf and pulling him away from her but I haven’t seen that man since March of 2023 nor have I spoke to him the only time I spoke to him was in March of 2024 and that’s because he yelled at me. So in September of 2024 I reached out to him I unblocked him on IG (in case you are wondering he did block me first on IG but unblocked me on IG to get in contact with me because I had him block on everything else then when he asked for a second chance and I told him no I blocked him on IG and he been on that list since September of 2024 and then I blocked him again because he is a dick) and sent him all the details of the conversation I had with the gf. I even revealed to him that I was behind the fake number but he told me to leave him alone so I said ok bet and changed my number and reblocked him on IG. But what I banked on was how much he liked me so I knew he was going to read and listen to all the things I sent and within three days he started calling my fake number (because he couldn’t get in contact with me because I changed my real number) so I deleted my fake number and got rid of my social media account because he had his family look for me too. He also offered to send me money to talk to him but I declined. And of course I’m still watching this all play out on my fake pages and again because she is so transparent on social media she is having a breakdown because he now knows the truth and she can no longer lie on me to him at least. But he is stupid anyway because why would you believe a liar with no proof but I guess because she is a narcissist and the guy isn’t good at setting boundaries. I never been involved with a narcissist well I don’t think I have been and I think it’s because I’m too outspoken and I have no problem getting into a fights. I promise you this is not what the fuck you want but overall I’m a pretty peaceful young lady if I do say so myself. Anywho, this girl is upset that not only is he furious with her but also his family is happy that someone was able to finally expose her for the liar and manipulator that she is (I didn’t know that his family didn’t like her) but apparently she plays victim and uses this guys insecurities and her money so she can get her way and this relationship was going on for years. I’m basically the hero. But I wasn’t done with this bitch yet so I got my black ass on Twitter and put her on blast so much so she lost a lot of followers on social media and her momma is off of social media completely because her momma was bothering me too. And I did this a few weeks ago me exposing this girl on Twitter. So now I’m satisfied. But I wanted to know what happens when you expose a narcissist? I wasn’t the one being manipulated but it was like I was the defender of someone who was being manipulated. And I came here to see if I could get any info because I couldn’t find anything. ",

I am now single :)",

        "selftext": "31F nurse in a very toxic environment.\n\nI’ve been denied a promotion twice in 6 years.\n\nI feel my growth has been stunted, no room for promotion, I’m not learning anything more. The staff are bullies. I’m being bullied by three seniors who are ganging up on me. Higher ups told me to be quiet basically when I reported it. \n\nI’ve been run down, chest infection after chest infection, extreme fatigue etc then I went off sick five weeks ago after being told to shut my mouth basically and I’ve been fine since. In a good head space, no fatigue etc. \n\nI’ve job searched every day. No suitable roles as I am specialised theatre nurse. All I keep seeing is clinical assessor/Pip roles and I’m at such a breaking point with my role that I am close to going for that one and it’s hated by people and run by private companies who can sack you at  any time. \n\nI have to return back to an environment where the people are nasty, where the seniors are out to get me (and they are) and where I no longer feel I am learning, improving or getting anywhere. No amount of effort I put in works there anymore, and I’ve tried my hardest. \n\nI’ve even contemplated leaving nursing entirely but no other role pays the same and I cannot afford to retrain for something. \n\nI have a mortgage, pets to feed, bills to pay and now I have to accept the fact that i have to stay in this place for longer until I find somewhere else and even then, work never let me leave for an interview. I have to stay in my work prison and serve a never ending sentence. \n\nThe last day before I went off sick I genuinely contemplated driving my car off the bridge on the way home. Now I have to go back. My doctor said he’d give me a paper for more time off as he understands the pressures. But I don’t know what’s the best thing to do.

        "selftext": "I worked at three of the biggest influencer marketing agencies over the last decade, and now that I don't, it's finally safe for me to speak the truth without risk to my career - I need to expose that whole industry as a scam and no one is talking about it..\n\n\"Influencer Marketting\" agencies make almost all their money NOT from sponsorships but from influencers paying them monthly fees to FIND them sponsorships that never happen. I was shocked each time I got a new job at a new \"influencer marketing agency\" to discover they all work the same way- colleagues who mentioned it were fired or made redundant. It's kind of like a pyramid scheme... Out of thousands of influencers paying monthly \"subscription fees\", almost no sponsorships actually happened in the years I was there. All of our workload was dedicated to finding more influencers to sign up rather than sponsorship companies.\n\nThink about it- why would we need sign ups in the first place if we can find sponsors? We'd obviously take a cut of sponsorship as that would make more money- right??!! What's going on is dishonest &amp; takin advantage of the poor.\n\nMost people think that a large following of 500K+ followers, makes that person wealthy. The reality is that 99% of people with 500k followers on insta and tiktok (and in many cases, youtube shorts), make nothing. I’ve worked with influencers sleeping in cars, couch-surfing, living below the poverty line for years, incredulous to the fact they aren't making anything, while my colleagues persuaded them to continue building a following and that sponsors were \"just around the corner\". We would be told to persuade these people to by dangling carrots like this. Many of them worked 20 hours a day to build a following- often from uplifting or positive content- and weren't narcissists- it is not a pleasant life, and I knew of so many like this.\n\nI don't like how the industry is taking advantage of these people. Websites like SocialBlade are hilarious - the number of times I've seen them claim people are making $500K+ per year but in reality, they're earning nothing... It happens all the time.\n\nThe key is that most audiences aren't monetisable no matter how big they are, and the ones that ARE monetisable (e.g. \"technical\" topics), are nigh on impossible to persuade sponsors to bite because they're all so stuck in the past (they think of social media as something \"free\" and will only pay to advertise on TV or via traditional routes).\n\nTo make things worse, 99% of companies reaching out just want free advertising. They offer “exposure” or a cheap free product and refuse to pay. They all think that someone with a large social media following is a philanthropist millionaire, or can eat \"free products\", didn't work full time to build that following, and doesn't need income.\n\nMeanwhile, marketing agencies exploit this situation by selling influencers false hope and taking their money with no return. It has to be biggest public perception vs. reality mismatch I’ve ever seen.. on such a grand scale.\n\nNo one is talking about this. Agencies won't talk about it because their income comes from maintaining the lie. Influencers themselves won't talk about it as they fear it might destroy their chances of getting a sponsor in future (which is never going to happen!!). So I had to get this off my chest, now that I don't work for them anymore. I'm frankly amazed these \"companies\" haven't been shut down.\n\nI'm sorry but I can't name myself or the companies for obvious reasons, but they're all the same (afaik), and I can't give examples of specific social media accounts for similar reasons unfortunately. Therefore, you don't have to believe me on this, but I speak the truth &amp; just happy to get this off my chest.\n\nMy advice to you if you're unable to find sponsors for social media following:  \n\\- Don't waste any more time on it. Views can't pay your bills. Don't waste your life..  \n\\- Don't trust any social media \"marketting agency\" that requires a monthly subscription fee from you (if they are genuine, they'll operate on a percentage of sponsorship deals that they obtain for you - NOT a monthly fee from you)  \n\\- Don't trust when anyone tells you \"you're just marketting wrong- it's impossible to have no income on 500k followers\" - they don't know what they're talking about unfortunately. Most influencers even in the 500k braket make NOTHING, but none will admit it for fear of it sabotaging their future chances.  \n\\- Spend your time re-skilling to do something else that will make a living, don't fall for this scam.  \n\\- Even monetisable accounts with monetizable topics are VERY HARD to get sponsors for, that's why so many don't have a sponsor for years.  \n\\- Don't fall for the \"if I get a big following I will automatically find ways to make an income\" trap\n\nThere.

For the past week, I had not thought about him once, I had not cried bout it anymore, I was healing, I think. But today I overheard someone talking bout him. \n\nActually, I heard them talking bout me. \n\nOne of my friends - that was in the party I was SA'd at - kind of has a crush on me and everyone knows it even tho he never told me upfront.

I was crying, I was asking him to stop. \n\nI didn't knew he saw it. I didn't knew any of them saw it. And now I feel dirtier than ever.

        "selftext": "Throw away account so no one sees this. \n\nI have been working really hard the last 5 years or so to improve my life. \n\nA little background about me- I come from a low-income, below poverty line house hold. Grew up in housing during my childhood. Majority of my family including cousins are either on social assistance, housing, drug addicts, alcoholic, ect. \n\n6 or 7 years ago, I was on social assistance myself. I didn't finish high-school. I was drinking daily. Ended up in an abusive relationship. Managed to get a cleaning job. \n\nSince then I've gotten my GED, partially went through college, ended up building a career before I completed college, am now a program manager on my way to making 90k a year in a field i love that feels like I'm making a difference in people's lives, in a happy loving fulfilling relationship where I live with my partner, we plan to buy a house soon and are thinking about marriage and kids. I have a car. I've essentially hit all of the life goal milestones I wanted to hit by the time I was 30 and more (I just turned 30 a few weeks ago). I've been to therapy, ive been on a good medication for my mental health, I've done the work.\n\nI feel like my life is finally on the right track. Because of this, I've finally been able to shift my focus to more \"shallow\" or less important things that have been kinda low on my radar. \n\nFirst let me say, I love myself - not in a self centered kind of way, but I appreciate that I'm resilient, goal oriented, determined, am empathetic to peoples experiences, and I have a lot of love to give. And I have a lot of respect and compassion for myself- just as I do for others. \n\nWith that being said, my appearance has always been something that's bothered me. I've always had bad skin, I gained quite a bit of weight over the last 4 years- and I'm just not in a place where I feel good about how I look. So I've decided, this year, that's what I'm going to work on. I've bought more professional clothes, started my skin journey to help with my skin texture and acne scars and redness. And planning on getting my teeth fixed. Getting a good hair regime. And controversial- i decided id try ozempic. My insurance is covering it so essentially it's like why not? Why wouldn't I give this thing a try to support me in losing weight and feeling better about my appearance. It's not that I think I'm UGLY I know I'm not- i just feel like I haven't really taken care of myself and I'm working on it. \n\nAnyway long story short- I feel like I'm getting some much push back randomly now. And the more I think of it the more I realize how much push back I've gotten generally on decisions I've made. \n\nMy dad once said how will you live on your own your on welfare (this was 7 years ago before I met my boyfriend and 3 months before I got a fulltime job as a cleaner and my own apartment)\n\nMany times as I've changed jobs to move up and learn more I've gotten aren't you scared? Are you sure you want to do this?\n\nAnd now from some family members and old friends its - wow that treatment is a lot of money, I've heard so many negatives about ozempic etc. My own mother has issues with me improving the way I look for some reason.\n\nI just don't understand it. I would never try to put someone down for bettering themselves in anyway. It's actually almost hurtful.\n\nOf course I realize I don't have to and won't listen to others on my life choices, because my choices have gotten me to where I am today. I guess I'm just venting because it feels like the people who don't even make decisions try to influence yours. \n\nAnyway thats all haha.",

The following month he flew out to see me and I spent that whole weekend with him. We had an instant connection and even nine months later things still feel really great. \n\nHim and I live only a few states apart so for the past nine months we have been traveling a lot just to see eachother. We have been traveling back and forth so much that this weekend is our 20th visit with eachother and we have spent roughly 100 days together in person! \n\nWhen we first started seeing each other I didn’t tell anyone because I was too afraid of the judgment people would say. I have no clue how people in my family or community might feel about our age gap. Overtime it just got more and more involved but I still did my best to hide my relationship from everyone.\n\nThis upcoming May I need to find a new place to live and I don’t really have many options. The best case scenario is for my partner to move to my state and for us to live together. That is a realistic plan for us but the only issue is that I don’t think I can hide that from my friends/family. I am also starting to think about just telling them since there are times where it is hard to have to hide my relationship, especially when it’s such a big part of my life. \n\nI am really worried about what my family might say. I am worried they will look at me in a negative light. I know that it’s just their opinions but it isn’t easy to feel judgment. I am really stressed and confused on what the right decision is. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated 🤍",

        "selftext": "I really don’t have anyone to talk about this to so I’m just gonna share this here. \n\nA year ago I (20M) was at a party with some of my friends. At the party there was this really pretty girl, I’m talking people’s heads were turning when she was walking by. We were alone at the snack table and started talking (I don’t remember much details), the conversation went really smoothly and at the end she invited me to go to a rap concert with her. I politely declined as it’s not my genre of music.\n\nThe party went on, everyone got slightly drunk and the girl invited me to dance with her. At some point the dance became kind of intimate (to the point she wanted me to „grab her ass” jokingly)… so  ofcourse I excused myself and went to get a drink. \n\nAt some point me and my friends went upstairs to chill on the couch, later in the evening the girl joined us and squeezed in right next to me. Some time passed and it was getting late so people began to fall asleep. I wanted to go find a bed for myself but it turned out the prettiest girl I’ve ever laid my eyes on fell asleep holding onto me, snug on the hoodie over my left ribcage. Being the awkward fuck that I am I just spent the night with one arm parallel to my body and the other on top of the couch as to not hug her without consent. \n\nMy memory has never been the greatest so I probably left out some details, but generally our chemistry when talking was great. \n\nIn hindsight it seems pretty obvious she could have been kinda into me (or she was jus being nice, guess we’ll never know) \n\n",

With no self esteem and severe social anxiety. \n\nMy life sucks. I ruin everything for everyone including myself. I drain the happiness and fun out of everything. I don’t know how to laugh, be myself or make jokes anymore. \n\nI take several medications.

I have too much guilt to leave her behind and go else where. \n\nI have no money, no license (bc I’m too much of a pussy to get behind the wheel), no car. Nothing. \n\nI’m not a normal girl. I hate dress clothes, don’t want children, no make up. Only video games, superheros and having a potty mouth worse than a sailor. I’m clingy, rude, no social skills, and can be loud.

Even my own fucking dog hates my guts.\n\nMy boyfriend dumped me, my soul cat of 17+ years just died, I knocked my front tooth out which won’t be fixed for another 2 months, I live in a shitty apartment with insanely loud neighbors to where I can’t sleep at night.

        "selftext": "I, (21 f)am dating my high school sweetheart again after years of not seeing or speaking to each other. \n\nWe met working a shitty fast food job in high school, and I fell in love with her almost immediately. She’s smart, so fun to be around, made me laugh and made me feel genuinely loved and appreciated for the first time in my life. I felt more confident, more comfortable around her. Not to mention she’s also the most gorgeous person i’ve ever seen. \n\nWe dated for a bit, and then she broke up with me towards the end of our senior year. I was heartbroken, and went off to college still processing and dealing with the breakup. As silly as it sounds and I know most people think this with their first love, but I really thought i was going to marry this girl. We chatted on and off throughout my freshman year, just normal shit like “hey how are you doing” and “we should catch up” before I finally decided it was finally time to fully move on and forget about her, so I blocked her on everything that summer, and deleted her number. \n\nWhile i still thought of her from time to time, I wasn’t angry or hurt about the breakup anymore, I had accepted that 17-year-olds know nothing about love, and all I can do with heartbreak is learn from it. \n\nFast forward to the beginning of my junior year of college, and I’ve dated on and off for years now and was in the process of trying to end a terrible long term relationship. I drove from college to my hometown, around 3 hours, to be with my friends after ending things while my new ex blew up my phone with calls and messages telling me what a horrible person i was for breaking up with her (I was not, she treated me terrible and refused to listen to me when I had an issue). \n\nMy friends and I decided to grab food and hangout in my car in one of the parking lots in our hometown. We pulled in, and I saw my first Ex’s car. It had a very distinctive bumper sticker, so I knew it was her. I didn’t get out or try to say anything, but my heart skipped a beat. I really truly believed I would never see this girl again. I debated reaching out, but in the end I unblocked her on snapchat and reached out with a simple “hey! were you at x lot the other night?” and we spent a few weeks catching up and then hung out for the first time in years. \n\nShe told me she missed me, and had always regretted the way things ended between us. I had no intention of trying to date again when I reached out, but I admit I did miss her too. That was about 9 months ago, and one thing led to another and now we are fully back together and it’s been amazing. \n\nI know it’s only been three years since we broke up originally, and I will say that I still don’t know anything about love. I’m a different person than I was in high school, and so is she. She makes me feel like the most beautiful person in the world, and i’ve never come close to feeling this way for anyone but her. All I do know is that as long as I’m able, I will do my best to love her the way she deserves, because as far as i’m concerned she does the same for me. I can’t help but wonder how my life would be different now if we hadn’t gone to that one parking lot that night. \n\nThank you for reading, xoxo",

I had no idea she was sick. she passed in july of last year, and the county I am in is so backed up that the medical examiner took 8 months to get back to us. we all assumed it was a fentanyl overdose that she may have come in contact with because one of her friends was an addict. it turns out that she had no drugs in her system.\n\ni’ve been waiting for 8 months. i’m only 20. my dad hasn’t been around at all for my whole life. my mom picked terrible men. her whole life has been around horrible men. she was raised being beaten by her father by anything and everything possible he could find. she married a man who got addicted to crack, my father. she then married another man who cheated on her the entire relationship with other men. the final man, a man who had stolen from her in a relationship prior and who has killed 2 of his previous partners indirectly, took her, too.\n\nthe only answer it could be is that the final man took her from us. he had never killed them exactly, but both of his previous wives were completely clean before they met him. 5 and 7 years later, they both died of a heroin overdose.\n\nI cut off my relationship with my mom in 2019 due to something I was a victim of when I was younger by the man who cheated on her with other men. he did some fucked up things. a lot of fucked up things. he let a lot of fucked up things happen to me under his supervision. I had caught a disease from what he did/let happen and decided to move in with my grandma because I did not like the man she was now with, the man who (may) have killed her, the final man. I had no contact with her after I got a restraining order.\n\nshe and I had started to get along for once in 4 years. I had hugged her (albeit halfassedly) for the first and last time. she cried and cried. I don’t know what I would have done if she were to have passed and I didn’t get on good terms with her again.\n\nI wanted to see her succeed in her life. she spent all of her life desperate to be shown that she was worthy of being loved. I tried to show her before she passed, a few months before, that the way I had loved her growing up was enough proof that she was worthy of love. that if she can say she isn’t worthy of it, then my love I showed her as a kid meant nothing. she finally started to understand.\n\nwe were going to go to college together. I wanted to help her get her GED. to start going to school. to make the loser of a boyfriend she has had for years go work instead of making her work 2 part time jobs being disabled and still not being able to make the rent. he did nothing for her other than steal from her and hurt her.\n\nI had to protect myself by moving out those years ago. she didn’t want to listen when I knew he was bad news. i’ve known since I was 14. I just wish I could have done something to save her. I wish he never met her. I wish I could have been there to stand up for her when he hit her.\n\ni’m terrified. i’m so scared of being angry. I don’t know how to deal with the fact that someone took her from me. she was my everything for years. someone so cruel took her from me and made her be in pain. no one knew he had hit her. no one knew her migraine was not just a migraine. she couldn’t tell anyone or go to the doctor because she would have to admit he hurt her. again.\n\ni thought I processed it all when she died. but being told today that she died due to blunt force trauma and brain bleeding makes me feel like I lost her this morning. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to feel.

I suffer from anxiety and depression and was diagnosed with Cyclothymic Disorder. So yes, I deal with body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria. I won't deny that it likely fuels a lot of my feelings. \n\nBut despite that, I am extremely self-conscious of my weight. And you'd think I'd be fine with it. I support body positivity heavily and would not ever judge others about their weight. Weight is not a proper scale of health, nor should it be tied to your self-worth; weight is weight. It only ever seems to be myself that I judge for my stomach. \n\nI have a potbelly. When I look in the mirror, all I see is my too-large stomach. And how it doesn't match the body that I'm SUPPOSED to have. And I do everything in my power to hide it because it causes me so much embarrassment. I wear high waisted skirts and pants, I'll tighten my belt just a little too much to tie it in, and I'll wear shape wear all so I don't have to acknowledge it. It makes me feel like less of a woman. Which I know is stupid. Women come in all shapes and sizes. Hell, my girlfriend is plus-sized and she's the most attractive woman I've ever laid eyes on. And yet, I still can't help but compare myself to other women, who have flat stomachs and small shoulders. \n\nI can never stick with exercise long enough to see any results. I like eating unhealthy, sugary foods. I eat a lot, in part to help my chest grow bigger, as HRT affects new fat distribution. I like to eat. And I live in the south, so you KNOW the food here is good. I'm terrible at forming habits. It feels like no matter what I do, I'll never have the body that I actually want.\n\nSo, sometimes, I wish I had an eating disorder. I've TRIED to give myself an eating disorder. I wish that I could go days without food and let my stomach shrink, just so I can finally look the way I want. I wish I could live on scraps of food. But I can't. Food is always there, mocking me until I finally give in.\n\nAnd the worst part is that I feel like I can't tell anybody. I can't talk to my girlfriend about it because it's a trigger for her own weight dysphoria. I have no friends I can talk to about it, and I'm terrified to talk to my parents about it. I hate the way my body looks and I wish I could just force it to look the way I want.",

I cannot talk about it with other people, and have instead just deflected any questions about my son in a light that makes it seem like my choice, even though nothing is further from the truth. \n\nI’ve tried professional help, but after being told to get better at eating shit by my last therapist…I guess I’ve just resigned myself to living a life of altered reality, where nothing makes any sense but hey at least I’m not homeless. \n",

        "selftext": "Basically, the title, here's some context.\n\nI (F19) and my best friend D(F19), have been close friends since elementary school. The summer before COVID me and my parents moved to South Florida for the start of high school, and still we talked everyday. We would talk on Facetime for hours, fall asleep on the phone, play multiplayer games, and watch movies through shared play together. We got through college app season together, first jobs, and she was the first person I came out to. I've never had a sibling, but I'll always call her my sister. Even though we've practically been 1000+ miles apart for almost 6 years, she's always my #1 call. I tell her I love her everytime we hang up. \n\nD is in college in New Jersey for nursing, and just recently started sessions with a psychiatrist. She is actively on medication for depression and sleep.  She's always been a very introverted person, but recently she has been telling me that she's been going to different club meetups and parties. I was excited for her because this was a chance for her to make some friends and get out more. We downloaded Life360 together and I told her to keep her phone charged, text me when she got back, and have fun.\n\nI'm not dumb, I know kids are drinking alcohol and smoking at college events. Personally, I've made a life choice to stay away from that crap, but I don't hold judgment to my friends and others partaking. However, D has skipped the little white claws and high noons and started drinking straight vodka and tequila whenever she goes out. At first, when she told me, I just assumed she was taking a little shot here and there and calling it a day. However, some of her friends who know me and our relationship have let me know via Insta that she's drinking to the point of blacking out and keeps multiple bottles of alcohol in her dorm room. I've called D and told her that she's turning into an alcoholic, that she should stop going out as much, and that drinking leads to more destructive behaviors. She brushed me off and called me judgemental and stuck up. She's even blown off our gaming nights to go smoke with her friends. \n\nLast night she texted and told me she had to call me about something serious. She told me that she was drinking alone last night to the point of wanting to kill herself.  Her roommates had found her called the police and she was brought to a psych ward. She told me that the police and her dad found out about the alcohol and that she ended up coming out to her dad unintentionally. She’s also been lying to her psychiatrist and has been skipping her meds. She said she's been admitted and was calling to let me know so I wouldn't worry. I just told her that I love her like always, and that I'm glad she's still here. \n\nBut after getting off that phone call, all I could think was “I fucking told you so. I told you the dangers of drinking and you ignored me.” I’ll I feel is anger. I feel angry that she would think that way about herself and want to leave me and her parents and her little sister. I’m angry at her on campus “friends” who observed this behavior and didn’t stop it. They let her get this bad and I wasn’t there to help her. It kills me that I’m halfway across the country and can’t afford to see her and make sure she’s okay. And most of all, I’m upset that if she ended up killing herself, I wouldn’t be able to do anything about it. I’m just her former middle school friend on FaceTime a million miles away.\n\nI haven’t cried or felt sad and I’m not sure if this is normal.",

        "selftext": "TW: Violence and threats\n\nI work at a care home for people with various physical and mental disabilities. The one thing I absolutely hate is how passive management is with the participants. They let them make any decision they want even if it ends up with someone falling down the stairs with little to no consequences.\n\nThe one guy they are horrible with and let him get away with anything. He is extremely violent and has hurt me and others on numerous occasions. The only consequence he faces is when he breaks things he just doesn't get to use it till it's fixed or replaced. Which is nothing, the worst part is this guy is smart and knows he can do whatever he wants and get away with it.\n\nThe worst time I experienced this was when me and another staff took him out to buy him candy with his own money. He wanted to buy a knife (it was a butter knife) and we said 'no'. It took alot just to get him away from the knifes and out the door. We managed to get him some of his candy and as protocol we gave him some. Still mad with us daring to say 'no' he threw the candy at me and tried to run back to the store to \"get the knife so I can stab you f*ckers\". I had to do a hold to stop him from going too far and hurting someone else. However the hold we are trained to do doesn't restrain both hands so they decided to scratch at my arm hard, to the point I was bleeding. It took a long time to calm him down and get him back in the car. The part that broke me was the fact he wanted me the one shaking and crying to apologize and my coworker who did nothing but call management to let them know what was going on also tried to get me to apologize. I couldn't cause I went completely non-verbal and just got in the car. I missed a week of work cause I was terrified of that participant and was locked up in my room. I filed a report for injuries, but nothing came of it.\n\nNow I just hate the participant. I'll never do anything to hurt or try and upset him, but I will always hate him and wish for his downfall.\n\nOne thing I want to note is that I understand alot of the people I work with can't control how they act. This one in particular also struggles to control their anger. However I've seen them handle 'no' from their parents and staff he likes and he was completely fine. He just doesn't like me and gets upset any time I ask him to do something or deter him away from dangerous things (I'm not rude about it I always ask very nicely I'm just not a guy or pretty enough so he hates me).\n\nTLDR: I despise a guy cause he can get away with anything he wants, including hurting others and he knows it.",

        "selftext": "Last year, I think I was sent an email in December saying that I \"needed to send proof of income\" effectively tomorrow. It was also a \"2nd notice.\" assuming the 1st one was lost in the mail. I was already gathering that for a different service, so I just made copies of the pay stubs, waited an hour, and turned in everything asked. That is when I was told that I had been Flagged for something involving income and needed to see a medicare insurance adjuster. I wondered if any were available and was told no and that I needed to come back tomorrow or call in.\n\nI asked if I could make an appointment but was told none were available, as \"due to holiday training and staff shortages, we are unable to fill requests for appointments at the moment.\" However, I would \"put a note in my file that it was a late notice.\"\n\nI asked if I could get an extraction as I never received proper notice. I was then told, \"Also, due to staffing shortages and holiday training, we cannot do extractions, nor can we, as we are not responsible for lost or delayed mail.\"\n\nShe then told me that the best option was to come in at 7 in the morning to be the first in line. I told them that I work tomorrow and can't come in. I was told I didn't have to, but it would be at the \"small penalty\" of losing my medical and dental through California. So I did that and was one of the first 15 people waiting in line for the doors to open in cold, rainy weather. I got a ticket and waited for about an hour, thinking I could make it to work on time at 1030am. I sat and told them I was there for a medical adjustment with a medicare insurance adjuster.\n\nI was told they were not one and that the hour's wait was to set an appointment. I was told I could have called or come in earlier to have a specialist set it up. I told them I tried yesterday, and there were none available. I was hit with, \"Well, it's not my fault you poorly planned this. Seeing as you had 2 weeks.\" I told them about the late notice and a note in the file. The man eye-rolled me and just scribed out the latter on my ticket. Telling me to expect my number to be called again in 2 hours and that in the future to be \"more mindful of prep and time management.\"\n\nI called my boss; he was surprised but was cool with me coming in later as long as I kept him updated. And so I waited as eight became 9 and 9 became 10. I checked in as it should be around time for the meeting and was told due to a lack of adjusters today, there will likely be unseen delays. So I had just to wait, and I skipped breakfast to get there, messing with my phone and eating some of the fruit offered there. I messaged my boss every half hour as he was skeptical that any department could wait this long.\n\nby the 11 or 12th hour of the day, they started giving out parking passes as the parking lot had a two-hour limit and needed one. There was a small argument between one of the managers and staff members about whether they should ask the ones here over the limit just to move their cars as they technically violate the parking code, and we shouldn't be encouraging that behavior. a 3rd staff member had to step in just to hand out the passes.\n\nSo, by the 13th hour and a half, when I was falling asleep and wondering how much of my shift I would have left, someone poked me in the face and told me to look up. A new number had popped up. It was mine.\n\nI go through the door with paperwork in hand to see the Ajestor about what the problem was. It turns out they wanted to know if I had SSI payments and asked why I didn't have any from SSI. I told her that I wasn't on SSI, and she told me that was the problem. When applying for Calcover, I marked down that I had a federally recognized disability, autism. So they wanted to see if I was making too much for the program; when I didn't show any SSI payouts, i was flagged for possible fraud and they tried to ask me in person if I had any other forms of assisted living payouts or financial aid. I told them i was disqualified due to being able to work.\n\nSo the adjustor told me that next time, I needed to uncheck that box as legally, for health care, I didn't have a federally recognized disability as it implies I'm getting federal aid. So I waited nearly 6 hours for a 15-minute meeting asking me not to say I have autism on a federal level.\n\nMy god, why do we put people through this?",

        "selftext": "I don't really know what to make of this, and I don't really have anyone to talk to about it. I (23F) started my master's this academic year and was brought in as a graduate assistant in one of the academic advising offices on campus. Our office has a new director who comes from a high school administration background and relatively new advisors (two of them, both have been here five years max).\n\nUntil yesterday, I didn't know why the previous GA left her role. She clearly left in a hurry because my office (her office) still had wall decorations, cork boards with posters and flyers, supplies, and cabinets chock-full of folders with papers, guides, flyers - you name it, it's here. It looked like the place was already in use is what I'm getting at. She created entire binders about our department's programs and even fully stocked the supply closet that we have. I knew she hadn't left due to graduation, it had to be either right before she graduated or she hadn't renewed her contract, but I didn't know why. It's not really my business, but I was curious and wanted to be sure it wasn't for something nefarious.\n\nSo, my suspicions rise when a classmate of mine, M, recognized the office that I said I'm a GA for (a handful of us are GAs, most of them for our college, but me in this advising office) and she brought up that she used to work there in undergrad until she graduated last year. M started asking about names from when she was there, and it became apparent we've had a lot of staff changes in less than a year. I thought, \"Interesting, I wonder why?\" She also did not like most of the people (advisors/director) who are/were here. I kind of shrugged it off, figuring that she probably just had some bad experiences or that the leadership prior to our current director was suboptimal, because I liked my coworkers. Naïveté on my part, I'll admit.\n\nBut something hasn't quite left me since that day: M said the previous director, let's call him Colin, resigned after being caught in a relationship with a student. I took this with a grain of salt because I hadn't heard that, not even from the other student workers who like to gossip, and M had made it clear that she didn't enjoy the office atmosphere.\n\nThings came to a head for me yesterday, when I met with the current director to discuss some issues with the website. Things progressed to how she doesn't like how disorganized the supply closet currently is, and her plans to clean it out with our administrative assistant over spring break. She mentioned having so much stuff left behind by the previous GA, like thick binders of who-knows-what, and not knowing what to do with them. They're multiple 5-inch binders stuffed to the brim.\n\nBringing up the GA snowballed until Director casually mentioned how my coworker, let's call him Andrew, one of the two advisors in our department, was the one caught making sexual advances - and *toward the previous GA.* They had gone out for drinks after-hours (unsure if it was with a group), and he had texted her inappropriately about hooking up. The then-director, Colin, received word of this but didn't want to do anything about it. He was promptly fired for his inaction once an actual, full-blown Title IX case opened against Andrew.\n\nThe GA left after this incident and no one has seen her since. She left everything behind. Her friends harassed the office to try and hold Colin accountable, but it wasn't until the case was opened that action was taken.\n\nI'm in shock and just don't know how to process these instances. *He* came onto my predecessor, yet she left, and he is still working here. I don't even know if she's graduated, but it makes sense now why her stuff was left behind and why nobody talks about her aside from the student workers who don't know the truth.",

But since last year, it has been a bit up and down between all the three of us. It all started when my ex suddenly showed up at my door wanting to talk. But this girl friend of mine got angry at me because I asked back the money I am owed back, and went and told my boyfriend that my ex showed up, we “talked” and some other stuff. This caused a major break in between our relationship, and I only knew about this recently that she was the one who ratted me out when it wasn’t her place. I would have told him, but she went ahead and told him adding unnecessary untrue details to it.\n\nWe had some misunderstandings, and we moved past that. But as of now, she seems to be becoming more possessive of him, though she has her own boyfriend. She expects him to take her out everywhere, doesn’t include me, and he seems to be doing it. But when I ask him, it’s always reasons and excuses. \n\nShe still owes me a little around $600, and I am honestly scared to ask her about it. They have been doing a lot of video calls, texting constantly and I know it may be nothing but I just cannot digest the fact. I know I need to be more trusting but I feel like a third wheel in my own relationship. He expects me to adjust to this, but why should I be adjusting in MY relationship.\n\nYesterday night, I questioned him about it and he came to hit me. I got shocked that he raised his hand on me when I asked why did he video call her. He keeps saying I am more important to him and I am his first priority but I just cannot understand why he would get so angry when I questioned about it. This was the third time in a row he raised his hand on me. But later consoled me. I asked him to choose between me or her, he said he is in a situation where she is his roommate and he cannot do anything. I hate the fact that she is so touchy around him, I just hate it. \n \nI trust him that he wouldn’t do anything behind my back like sleep with her, but I just cannot let it go. I am still in shock from yesterday night. I feel like I lost all my friends because of him, I don’t feel like I belong with anyone and I don’t even have anyone to talk about this that I have to vent it out on Reddit. \n\nTL;DR my boyfriend seems to be involving our mutual friend a lot into our relationship and seems to be choosing her over me.",

        "selftext": "I’ve always wanted to live life on my own terms, but my Muslim Arab parents make it feel impossible. Even though I’m an adult, they still try to control every aspect of my life my career, my choices, even how I spend my time. The moment I push back, I’m met with guilt-tripping and emotional manipulation: \"You’re disobedient.\" \"You’ve dishonored us.\" \"I will never forgive you until the Day of Judgment.\"\n\nAnd many of the things they react this way to aren’t even that big of a deal. For example, I’ve always wanted to cut my hair short, but my mother made it clear that if I ever did, she wouldn’t forgive me and that it would be a a sin hanging over my neck until Judgment Day. Even something as small as asking them to knock before walking into my bedroom turns into an argument, as if having basic privacy is an act of rebellion.\n\nAnd if not through words, they use threats. They tell me they’ll force me into marrying someone against my will or that they’d lock me in a room if I disobey them. Even if they don’t act on these threats, just hearing them is enough to make me feel powerless, like my life isn’t really mine to control.\n\nIt feels like their love is tied to control as if I can only be a \"good\" son or daughter if I follow everything they say without question. Their obsession with obedience and authority makes it impossible for them to see me as an independent person. It’s as if my life belongs to them, and any choice I make for myself is seen as betrayal.\n\nI know they believe they’re acting out of love, but it doesn’t feel like love. It feels like a cage. It’s exhausting to constantly be torn between my own happiness and their expectations. I’m tired of feeling like my worth is tied to how obedient I am. I just want to be allowed to make my own decisions without fear, guilt, or the weight of their disappointment crushing me.\n\nWhat hurts even more is that when I try to talk about this, I’m always met with the same dismissive responses: \"They’re your parents, you must obey them no matter what\" Society expects the owns who go through this to just accept it, as if their love should come with conditions and control. But I don’t want to spend my life suffocating under obligations I never agreed to. ",

        "selftext": "Writing from a throwaway.\n\nThree days ago, I met a guy. He found me on social media, and we talked on the phone for a few days. He seemed easygoing and respectful, so when he asked if I wanted to meet for a cigarette, not at my place, just somewhere outside in the neighborhood.\n\nWhen he arrived, we sat outside and talked for a bit. Then he suggested going to a nearby hotel. Only if I wanted to, of course, but it was cold and dark, and he said we could just sit inside, have a drink, and talk. He promised he wouldn’t try anything, that he didn’t want to be intimate either. He seemed harmless, trustworthy even. So I agreed, telling him I only had two hours anyway.\n\nAt first, he was still friendly. But as time passed, he started acting off. I kept my distance, positioning myself in a way that made it clear I wasn’t comfortable with any physical closeness. Then he went to the bathroom. When he came back, he was only in his boxers.\n\nI told him to put his clothes back on and that I was leaving. That was the moment I felt truly unsafe. I got up, heading for the door when he grabbed me by my ponytail and pulled me to the floor.\n\nI fought as hard as I could, but he knew exactly how to overpower me. At first, he didn’t rape me he *enjoyed* me fighting back. He hit me, yanked my hair, and choked me so hard I couldn’t even make a sound. He threw me all over the room. My body is covered in bruises, even on my throat. And then, at some point, he raped me. I pleaded for him to stop, but he just threatened me over and over again.\n\nEventually, my phone rang. I saw my chance and told him I had to answer it, that my friend would be suspicious if I didn’t call her back immediately, and that she had my location (she didn’t and it wasn’t a friend calling I was lying). I told him I’d just meet her quickly and then come back. He let me go and I left.\n\nIf this had happened to someone else, I would never blame them. But standing in my own shoes, I can’t stop thinking: What the fuck is wrong with me? Who goes to a hotel with a guy they just met? I’m almost 30. I should know better. I should have learned my lesson by now.\n\nBut I don’t feel scared. I don’t feel sad. I don’t even feel vulnerable. And that makes it hard to process what actually happened to me.",

        "selftext": "I (19M) am bisexual. About two years ago, I fell in love with my best friend, T (now 19M). I knew he wasn’t into men, so I tried—and succeeded—in getting over it. However, one night while I was drunk, he was taking me home, and I confessed. I told him that I had been in love with him but that I wasn’t anymore. I apologized sincerely and explained that I just felt he had a right to know.\n\nNaturally, he was uncomfortable, but we agreed to try and maintain our friendship. Things were never quite the same, but we remained close. I made every effort to respect his boundaries and avoid making him uncomfortable. I also felt guilty, as if I had hurt him and ruined our friendship. Though he never explicitly said so, that was the impression I got. Whenever I asked, he insisted that everything was fine.\n\nAbout a year and a half after that, due to circumstances beyond our control, we had to sleep in the same bed. I asked if he was okay with it or if we should switch rooms, and he said it was fine. Still, I did my best to stay on my side of the bed so he wouldn’t feel uncomfortable. Unfortunately, at some point during the night, I rolled over onto his arm in my sleep. He woke me up and asked me to move. The next night, he decided to sleep in a different room, saying it was because of the bed. I thought that was an excuse, but I didn’t press him—he had every right to make that choice. Instead, he slept in a room with two of our female friends, A (19F) and K (18F).\n\nAfter that, things mostly returned to normal, except I noticed that A and K became more aggressive toward T.\n\nFast forward to about a month ago: I was out for coffee with A, and we were discussing T. He had made an awful joke toward K, and I was defending him when A suddenly said she had to tell me something. She revealed that on the night he changed rooms, he had told them about what happened. He told them I had feelings for him, that he constantly felt uncomfortable around me, and even outed me as bisexual (I am closeted because I live in a very homophobic country). He also told them that he couldn’t wait to work abroad for the summer so he could get a break from me.\n\nAt first, I didn’t want to believe her, but she knew details only he and I had discussed, and I was sure I hadn’t told her. A said they hadn’t told me sooner because they thought I wouldn’t believe them.\n\nI was crushed. I confronted T over the phone, but he claimed he didn’t remember anything from that night and insisted A and K were just trying to ruin our friendship.\n\nWe’re meeting for drinks in a few days to talk face-to-face and hopefully resolve things. I don’t know what to think. Everything points to him betraying me, and his excuse isn’t convincing—but I don’t want to believe it. Any advice would be welcome.",

I told her I did have to do another one but the next placement is on the 20th of march. she got very mad screamed at me and threw things while yelling what a disappointment I had become. \n\nI have to add, the last couple of months have been hard on me, my boss had a big problem with my appearance( for understanding I worked at a high class gym in my city) because I am very muscular and outshine him in a lot of ways, I also have a buzzcut but that shouldn‘t matter. because of my boss bullying and nagging me the last 7 months( yes it started in august), I quit, today I handed in my letter of resignation, I couldn‘t do it anymore, working 50-60 hours a week for an ungrateful boss that hates me and wants to fire me anyways isn‘t my thing I don‘t take disrespect. I‘ve been into working out for a couple of years and got my personal trainer license in winter of 2023, my mom was so proud. Yet she didn‘t work, my first paycheck went entirely into her purse, I didn‘t mind because I like responsibility and do plan to have kids in the next few years, so I have to be able to provide for people, yet she blew all my money on cigarettes cheap alcohol and gas to drive my sister and me to school, oh and the rent and electricity bill of course, there are no gas bills because we heat with wood.\nI was and am fine with that nothing wrong there, but after almost a year of unemployment for her she started becoming unbearable, she started yelling at me daydrinking, at one point she tried to punch and fight me physically. \nI begged one of her friends to find her a job at their workplace so she could finally get some fresh air, she had a boyfriend whom I got along with very well, very intelligent man, but her stubborn attitude and her narcissistic behavior obviously drove him away, I couldn‘t even blame him, in the time of my mothers unemployment I raised my half-sister (13/ F)\ndrove her to practice on my bike,until I crashed it beyond repair, I made arrangements for her to be driven and picked up from everywhere. my mom started working, it is nice to see her happy and thriving, but she always had a bad temper and a lot of self hatred. I love my mother, I have always loved her for every sacrifice she made for me. but I stopped feeling anything towards her today.\n\n after a heated argument, me staying mostly calm because I‘m the type to shut down and become quiet once I‘m yelled at, and my mother yelling at me. She said, that I don‘t have money, I don‘t have assets, I don‘t even work anymore, and that all this bullshit that has been piling up was too much for her to handle. \nI asked her if she wants me to move out and she said I should fuck myself and go to hell or wherever else I wanna go, I‘m in tears. I‘ve been living in this house for 7 years, a comfortable life that I tried to sustain for as long as possible. I have a job offer in chicago, but I don‘t have the funds to go there, I don‘t have enough money to buy a one way ticket for me and my fiancée (18/F) and one month of rent+ a downpayment on an apartment. I could move there but it‘s 10000km away. I have had reasons to move out before but decided to stick around so my sister has a male influence growing up, now she‘s a teenager and I‘ll never stop being there for her. I have packed my bag, I have prepared to get away from my home which I‘ve lived in for so long. I‘m applying for jobs tomorrow, going to a jobcenter, getting all my documents, renewing my CV and just applying at every gym I know. I‘m crashing at my fiancées place tomorrow night and see how long it takes for me to find something to start over with in a proper manner. I‘m in shambles, I know I could live in this house for another month, another half a year too, but I lost my will to do so long ago. I‘ve always wanted to compete in bodybuilding, but I am scared that all the dreams I have such as: Building a beautiful healthy family, having a homestead, winning and receiving an IFBB pro card, retiring my future wife and building wealth for my family, I come from nothing but I need to do everything, I‘m hopeless scared and alone, I‘ll figure it out by myself though I‘m confident.\n\nif there is anyone who has advice for me, anyone who has been in a similar situation, please reply.\n\n",

        "selftext": "*!no names are real names!* For some context let me start by explains my family tree and giving some history. I 20 female am the oldest child. My parent we’ll call them Bob and Lynda (not real names) had three kids me and a set of boy/girl twins ( East and brook). Then my mom cheated and got with a guy (Tony) and had two half brothers (Timmy and tommy). She then cheated again with a new guy (Bret) who was also cheating on his wife. He had two kids with his ex wife (Kat and Sam) my now step sisters. And my mom Lynda and Bret had two more kids (spike and Leo). Meanwhile my dad and step mom (Molly) had one daughter (Katie). So there’s 9 kids  total with my mom, in order it’s: me, East and brook, Kat, Timmy, Tommy, Sam, Spike Leo. My parents had 50/50 custody of us given to them by the court. My dad tried reporting my mom for abuse and the court did nothing about it. It’s very pro mommy where we live. My mom Lynda and Bret are very abusive parents. They used to to things like hit us, throw us outside, make us stand on chairs for hours on end without being able to get down, put shock collars on us and starve us. I remember once that I missed a spot mopping the floor and they made me use my toothbrush to clean it ( no I didn’t get a new one). We were also very low income but my mom and Bret always found a way to take trips to Disney and have expensive date nights. Them being out often left me home alone with kids for hours if not days at a time. This went on from the time I was 11-16. At 16 I finally said enough was enough and made the decision to live with my dad. I got thearapy and have been doing much better. It’s been 4 years since I left. I have tried to fix things with my mom and Bret multiple times but my mom always falls short and blames me for leaving instead of herself for her actions. However when I left to stay with my dad my sister brook chose to stay with my mom without giving anyone an explanation. My dad wasn’t bad to her but they where never close. My sister brook is my moms golden Child, her favorite and her mini. My sister was a snake my whole childhood and could get away with murder. So she left my dad and never looked back. Well this year she turned 18 and on her birthday my mom had posted a video of her asking my step dad to adopt her and today was the day of her adoption. I found out through my moms ex baby daddy Tony that she was being adopted because Timmy messaged him about being taken out of school to witness it. He shared the messages with me and then I shared them to my step mom and other family. Not my dad because in these 4 years he has been grieving my sister leaving and finding this out will only hurt more.I’m devastated for my dad and have left it up to my step mom to tell him. I just cannot understand what there thoughts are and why my sister has done any of what she’s done in the last 4 years but I cannot say I’m happy for her. But I wanted to get this out and I just needed to vent it somewhere. I guess in the 4 years I’ve been gone I’ve really been holding in a lot of what happened to me and still cannot find it in myself to let go or forgive them. Thank you Reddit for listening. ",

It's actually been great, the first few days were hard but now I don't even really care about checking Facebook. On a conscious level, I feel like not being on Facebook is great. But I also noticed on Tuesday that I was feeling really low and didn't know why. Same yesterday, and today is even worse. It occurred to me that my brain isn't getting its usual constant dopamine supply throughout the day from checking Facebook and seeing that I have notifications or new info to read (even if it turns out to be nothing interesting). I know that social media is engineered to give you a hit of dopamine with every notification to keep you engaged and coming back for more. And I'm starting to think my brain is literally addicted and I'm going through withdrawal. I'm actually really proud of myself and given how awful I feel right now, I feel even more resolve to break this addiction and not go back to how I was. But man, I feel like shit. I just feel so depressed and want to do nothing but sleep. I keep wanting snacks even though I'm not hungry, and I think that's my brain desperately seeking other sources of dopamine. This sucks.

I went on a first date recently to try and meet someone new and I honestly was probably pretty bad company, not that I was a bad date, I paid for dinner and we had a good time. I just wasn’t there mentally, couldn’t really stay focused and afterwards she said that we didn’t need to meet again. \n\nBoys I’m done. I hope you guys can figure life out better than me.

Also not sure if this is the right platform but turning to here as I need to get this out of my system.\n\nAs the title says, I (21M) ended things off with my girlfriend (21F) last night and I feel awful. I had initially thought that I would feel relieved \nbut it’s tearing me apart. She was my first. We were together for 2 years and all of 5 mins it was just gone. Took everything in me to not lose it on the train ride home. Even though I initiated it, I hate myself for what hurt it has caused her and I haven’t been able to sleep or eat well. It’s really harder than I had imagined.\n\nOf course with any relationship, there were low moments but there were also some of the highest highs and I was so blessed to be with her. I broke things off because I haven’t been in a good place recently and I didn’t want to “bleed” on her due to whatever circumstances I may have. In hindsight, this was immature thinking as I chose the easy way out and I’m now dealing with immeasurable amounts of pain as a consequence.\n\nToday at work the events from the previous night replayed in my head over and over. I said what I had wanted to say but something still didn’t feel right. Thing is, I do not think this is a “take time to heal” situation. Part of me feels like it was poor judgement to not fight off my thoughts of leaving.\n\nI really miss her terribly. \n\nNot looking for any sympathy here. Just wanted to pen down my thoughts that clearly aren’t very cohesive with no fear of judgement. \n\nIf you’re reading this, thank you for everything. I’m sorry for the small things we bickered about that escalated unnecessarily. Thank you for our fun dates that brought me so much joy. I’m sorry for all the tears you shed because of me and my actions. Thank you for the past two years.\n",

        "selftext": "In my younger years, I’ve struggled with drugs. I’ve done everything you can think of, but the only drug that scared me to my core was meth. The first time I smoked it, my brain said , “This is what you’ve been looking for your whole life,” so I was a functional meth addict for 3 years (would go on week-long benders every 4-5 months), then I quit, cold turkey with all substances, for 5 years, started getting muscular at the gym, got my life stable and manageable. \n\nNow I own my own landscaping company and I flip homes; life is good. But it was getting overwhelming. The paperwork that comes with self-employment is the bane of my existence. Especially because I was diagnosed with severe ADHD as a child. \n\nSo about a year and a half ago, I went to my doctor to get diagnosed again so I can get prescribed some kind of medication. I knew I was going to need something to keep my business growing without completely crumbling it under my lack of focus.\n\nI went through the long process and got denied because by divine providence I smoked weed for the first time in years about 5 days prior. I was infuriated. So I finally said fuck it and looked up old contacts and bought 3 grams of meth the next day. I still remember holding that bag like I was Sméagol with the One Ring lol. The deep whisper that calls to all addicts beckoned me to go all in, to smoke that shit right up.  But by that point I had already realized the simple joy of living a true, peaceful life and I knew I would throw it all away if I started back up again. \n\nI bought a milligram scale and started off with 25 milligrams. The realization of seeing what 25 milligrams of meth looked like made me understand the sheer power of amphetamines. For years, people were smoking grams of this shit. Consuming it like candy, yet all you ever need is a crystal the size of a grain of sand.\n\nI put them into individual pill cases and started to take one a day. If I haven’t taken a dose before 10am then I would skip taking it altogether. \n\nI’ve tried Adderall in high school from friends, and I really enjoyed how it made me focus, meth felt cleaner, more aggressive. Over time, I started to remember my appointments without having to write them down. My sleep schedule became predictable as I never sleep during the day anymore. And my willingness to work harder is becoming effortless. Sex is always amazing, and I stopped drinking again because I’ve become sociable without the need for alcohol. \n\nThe best thing that has happened is that I’m more aggressive with business negotiations. I’m less nervous and I’m not afraid to assert my dominance when I feel it is necessary. \n\nNow, I can never think of ever smoking this stuff again. I know I’m the exception and I’m not telling you to use drugs. Meth is powerful and will destroy your life before you realize what’s going on. But I just needed to tell someone. Ask me anything you want. Btw I still haven’t finished the 3 grams I first purchased a year ago. It’ll probably last me another year before I have to go back out on the streets for more.",

And it’s a relief that, to the best of my knowledge, he didn’t hurt any children or consume any content that hurt actual children.

        "selftext": "\nI (20F) just went through my boyfriend (21M) of seven months phone for the first time. I have my face in his phone, and he’s told me multiple times that I can. However what I found has hurt me and hit my confidence in myself and my relationship.\n\nI know that some girls have felt it too, that little nagging feeling that something is wrong. When I looked, I went straight for the girl best friend. And that is exactly where I found messages between them, Sexting. \n\nIt was about a year ago at this point that these messages were sent, however, they were saved in chat. He is still best friends with this girl and did not tell me about this because he said that he didn’t wanna lose her.\n\nTo give a little context, I have been cheated on with the girl best friend before, twice. So this immediately raised some red flags for me. To top it off too, recently the amount of times we are intimate has severely decreased(once a week or sometimes less) \n\nI cried for a bit, and then I woke him up to talk to him about it. He apologized, and I was very mature and tried not to let my jealousy show. I told him it’s OK that he is still friends with her. I just wish she had told me.\n\nHowever, a couple days later here we are, I can’t stop thinking about it, and how she’s everything I’m not. She’s skinny with blonde hair, he sexted with her and never does with me, and he seemed to be way more attracted to her than me.\nI can’t help but overthink and be jealous.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nthank you for all of the advice. I talked to my boyfriend and we have started to work it out, and set some boundaries so we can move forward. I am a firm believer of not having friends of the opposite sex but I also would never want to make him choose between us. He is an amazing guy and hopefully this just ends up being something we look back on. We have some growing to do of course, we’re young and new to this relationship, but we want to work it out together.\n\nTo clear some things up, no he did not cheat, just saying I have experience that issue with girl best friends in the past, and saying that I invaded is privacy is wrong. He put my face in him phone and told me I can look through it if I needed to. Yes, I’m crazy jealous, yeah I have some self doubt, but I was just venting about something that was bothering me, so then I could put words to paper and evaluate how I wanted to go about handling this.\n\nJust want to remind some people that everyone is different, along with their relationships.\nI hope you have the day you deserve &lt;3",

        "selftext": "Not an English speaker.\n\nSo i'm actually walking back home from the park where i was and i can't stop smiling and laughing alone like a crazy person.\n\nSo after a long walk i stopped in a bar in the park and ordered a coffe and sitted outside thinking and thinking. After like 5 minutes i heard a couple starting to argue pretty loudly.\n\nI don't know who they are but just listened a bit. They were arguing about a possible break up after he caught her kissing another guy and she wasn't apologetic or something like this but was arguing back that everyone make mistakes and after 3 years of relathionship for her this wasn't a major reason to break up cause she was drunk and don't remember anything about it.\n\nI'm gonna say the exact piece of conversation that i heard: her \"are you serious? You wanna break up with me for a kiss that didn't meant anything? Are you insane?\" him \"of course, what else would you expect? Me cheering you up for another? Or maybe more?\" her \"but this insane, it's not cheating. It was just a kiss when i was drunk. It meant nothing\" him \"to you maybe not but to me yes. It's called taking responsabilities of our own actions. I can't believe i'm even here to argue about this\" her \"me too cause this insane, it was just a damn kiss while i was drunk that meant nothing\" him \"well this ends here, i'm tired of you and your excuses\" her \"you know right that if you break up with me you will never find anyone like me right?\" him \"well honestly i hope so\" pause and then she \"do you think you are funny? Should i laugh?\" him \"do what you want but i really hope to never find someone like you\" her \"i was way out of your league anyway so it's your loss and not mine\" him \"whatever you say ex gf now i wanna go home and text your sister. She is hell hotter than you\" her \"don't you dare. I will ruin you if you only try\" him \"well this is funny cause a few days ago she texted me first so let's see how things goes\".\n\nBelieve me i almost chocked myself from not laughing at this.

        "selftext": "TLDR: Wife’s family felt entitled to my money to help with their mother’s retirement, and none of them have ever expressed one word of gratitude.  Not looking for advice, just venting.\n\nBackstory: I’m 65M, wife is 61F.  Married 36 years.  Wife has three siblings: one older brother, one older sister, one younger sister.  We were very close with all of her siblings and their spouses for many years; we went on dozens of vacations with all of them, always had gatherings at holidays, spent weekends at each other’s homes, etc.\n\nHer brother and I were as close as we could be, always hanging out, playing music, and having a great time.  I loved him more than my own brothers.  He began to hate me in 2020 because I had the gall to disagree with his political views.  When he found out I voted for Biden, he screamed at me “WE’RE FUCKING DONE” at a family gathering.  He’s barely said two words to me since then.\n\nHer older sister and her husband have had a simmering ill-will towards my wife and I for many years.  Back in the 80’s and 90’s, I was earning great money, and we used to take them and their kids on vacations that were 99 percent paid by me, because they didn’t have two nickels to rub together.  If we bought a new piece of furniture or TV or whatever, we would offer them our barely used stuff, for free, which they (seemingly) gladly accepted.  We did these things because we loved them. Evidently, they took our generosity as “treating them like a charity case”.  Now that they are both in high-earning careers and don’t need anything from us, they basically hate us for “treating them that way”, and now simply look down their noses, sneer, and snub us.\n\nHer younger sister and her husband have always been “good Christians” but have become more fervent (“Evangelical” Southern Baptist) over the years.  I made the mistake of having a discussion about religious beliefs (I am an atheist) with the husband several years ago.  I know a thousand times more about his “Holy Bible” than he does, and the discussion did not go well for him.  Ever since then, they have done their best to ostracize us from the family at every opportunity.\n\nFast forward: My wife’s 80-year-old father passed away a couple of years ago, leaving his wife (my MIL, also 80) widowed.  They relied almost exclusively on Social Security for their retirement income.  After his death, there was a “shortfall” in the MIL’s monthly SS income.  My wife’s three siblings had a meeting and decided that the shortfall would be made up by the four siblings, split evenly.  Each “share” came to $2,500 annually to make up the MIL’s “shortfall”.  All three of the other couples are fairly wealthy, with annual incomes in the $250-350K range, and all have 401(k) accounts over $1 million, which they brag about.  My wife does not work.  I own a small business, which has slowed dramatically since covid; I make around $75k in a good year.  I would like to retire at some point, so I am trying to save every dollar that I can in order to do so.  I will rely heavily on Social Security for retirement income.\n\nThe long and short of it is that I had to funnel $2,500 per year into MIL’s “retirement needs” that would have otherwise gone towards my own retirement savings.  The way the siblings view it is: “your money is your wife’s money, therefore she needs to chip in to help her mom”.  Fortunately, two years into that arrangement, the MIL sold her house (she moved in with one of the siblings) and netted around $200k.  She told my wife that with that money, plus her SS income, AND the $50,000 she “already had in savings”, I would no longer need to contribute to her income, especially since her expenses were now basically zero.   So thankfully, I only had to “donate” $5,000 of my retirement money to the MIL.\n\nThe shitty part is that not one of the siblings, or the MIL, have ever expressed one word of thanks or gratitude to me even though they are well aware that the money we contributed came 100% from my earnings.  We still have to see them every now and then at weddings or funerals or whatever, and they have never even acknowledged my contribution and sacrifice. Their sense of entitlement is appalling, especially in light of the fact that they all have a great disdain for me and consider me to be “their asshole brother-in-law”.",

        "selftext": "I don’t even know where to start, but I need to get this off my chest. My ex (26F) and I (26M) were together for a long time and have a 4-year-old son together. I was completely loyal to her, but she put me through hell.\n\nBefore we were evicted from our home last year, she was already actively cheating on me—first with a guy named Liam. She would stay at his place while I was home taking care of our two stepkids (5 and 8) and our son (4). I was struggling financially because she was out drinking all the time with her friends, spending money we didn’t have, while I stayed home looking after the kids.\n\nThen, in December 2022, she started cheating on me with a different guy—Mark. She promised over and over that she’d stop, but she never did. We ended up getting evicted in April 2023, and she moved in with her brother. I was staying elsewhere, and she had our son and her two kids. During this time, she kept lying to me about where she was living. She said she was at her brother’s, but in reality, she had secretly moved in with Mark. I found out when I logged into her accounts—yeah, I know I shouldn’t have, but it was the only way to get the truth because she compulsively lies. (She was living at her brothers for a couple months then after the wedding she moved in with him)\n\nShe even took Mark to her sister’s wedding, bought him clothes for it, and kept telling me we were going to fix things. She made dozens of promises—saying she’d visit me with the kids, bake me cakes, buy me gifts—but she never showed.\n\nEven after I found out everything in October, she still asked me for money in December, saying Mark wouldn’t help her. And I gave it to her, like an idiot. In total, I’ve given her around £3,000 because she made it seem like we’d work things out. I even paid for the carpets in her new house because she told me she’d cut Mark off once she moved. But now I know that was just another lie.\n\nThroughout all of last summer, she was constantly gaslighting me. I caught her sending nudes to Mark while playing Stardew Valley with him late at night while I was asleep. She’d go out every night with him, and whenever I confronted her, she’d call me crazy and make me feel like I was the one in the wrong. At one point, she and Mark even tried to get me to be friends with him—we all played games together, and I had no idea what was actually going on behind my back.\n\nEven now, when I ignore her, she acts upset and says \"there's still something there.\" But all she ever does is use me. She sends me explicit pictures and videos while claiming she “just wants to be friends.” And when I tell her she’s confusing me, she shuts down the conversation because it's “too stressful” for her. Meanwhile, I’ve been the one supporting her, giving her money, and being there for her when she needed help.\n\nI also hate her friend Emily because she covered for her constantly. she’s cousins with Mark and was helping her lie to me the whole time.\n\nOne of the worst moments was when I visited her brother’s place while she was staying there. I found used tissues under the bed, and she swore up and down they weren’t what I thought they were—but come on, it was obvious. It was disgusting. And yet she still called me crazy. (She actually made out they were snot cause she had a cold but there was like 50 tissues under the bed lmao)\n\nWhenever I ask her what she wants, she just says, \"I don't know. I need to live alone and figure things out because I’m not well mentally or physically.\" But if that were true, why is she still stringing me along, keeping me as a backup plan while she’s with him?\n\nShe tells me I’m “stalkative” and that I’m the bad guy, but I only ever found out the truth by logging into her stuff—because without doing that, I’d still be believing her lies. I know I should’ve just walked away, but I love her. I actually cared.\n\nMaybe I’m just too nice, or maybe I’m an idiot. But a part of me always thought this was just a rough patch, that we could fix things and go back to how we were before all of this. Maybe she’s sick mentally, or maybe she’s just a terrible person. I don’t know.\n\nThe one thing I do know is I feel used, betrayed, and like I’ve wasted so much time and money on someone who never really cared about me the same way. And the worst part? She still wants me to keep all of this quiet.\n\nAt this point, I feel like I should just tell Mark everything and ruin things for her, because I don't think it's fair that after everything she got it all.\n\n\n(This is actually typed by me)\n\nLike I'm currently on my parents sofa, I barely see my son, I keep trying to find private or council places but I'm getting nowhere. My depression is genuinely awful like I feel like after everything I have nothing I've just lost it all and no matter how much I try it won't get better. I used to be depressed at uni, even tried to kill myself on my birthday but my flat mates actually got me a birthday cake and stuff and it put me off for a bit, like it was genuinely heartbreaking.\n\nThing is my credit score is completely fucked as well cause I let her use my credit card and my very account and stuff and my credit score is tanked to hell because of it.\n\nLike I am genuinely screwed and it's like trying to claw myself out of quicksand, struggling is just making me sink further into it.\n\nI don't know what do you guys think? Is there a chance do I give an ultimatum or just do I give into everything\n\n[I've ran this through chatgpt because originally I was just trying to get this off my chest through it and get some advice but I figured here would be a good place to get some Human advice and it'd help get rid of all the identifying details\n\nIf anything doesn't make sense just comment it and I'll elaborate on it cause I've noticed a few details are wrong but  I mostly wanted to get it off my chest anyway]\n",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account.\n\nSorry if the story is too long because the details are a bit fresh.\n\nI  have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for a couple of years.\nI am finishing up university, but since I major in Humanities, my career prospects seem bleak. Also, I had problems with with uni so I had to repeat a few semesters. Both of these things are a source of my anxiety and depression.\n\nI have friends and family members, but not a significant other or a person with whom I can talk about my problems.\n\nFor the past several months, I have been looking for a job without too much success. At the same time, I was trying to find help for my depression, insecurities and suicidal thoughts. Since I'm broke and cannot afford a therapist, I found an organization that offers free counseling. After filling out their application, they told me I should go to the hospital because they are not qualified to handle patients experiencing suicidal thoughts.\n\nI had my reservations about doing that since public healthcare, especially regarding mental health, albeit free, is pretty bad in my country.\n\nFast forward one month, I managed to get two job offers, one in a translation company, which is a 9 to 5, and an evening teaching job.\n\nI was pretty excited about the success in getting not one, but two job offers so I decided to take it easy and not exaust myself with work. I thought that the best course of action for me was to start doing both jobs until I figured out which one I liked more so I could focus on that job or even quit the other one.\n\nMonday was my first day on the translation job. In short, it went pretty horribly. The \"translation\" job turned out to be a regular office job, where I had to scan documents and edit Word files, and it did not involve any sort of translation or useful skill that could help me further my career. Bear in mind, I have had several translation jobs and I am not a complete beginner.\n\nAfter coming back home, I just started crying and felt desperate because that unpleasant experience on my first day on the job brought up all my repressed emotions to the surface, uncertainty about my career, loneliness, and the fact that all people my age have accomplished something in their lives except me.\n\nTherefore, I gathered my courage and took a taxi to the hospital, hoping to find a therapist with whom I can talk about my problems.\nI went to the ER and talked to the nurse working at the reception, who was very compassionate and patient. Then, she led me to talk to a psychiatrist, who after listening to my woes politely informed me that I would be transferred to a psychiatric hospital (or a mental asylum if you like) since the hospital is full and they can't take me. He also told me that I should not try and leave the hospital otherwise they would be required by law to call the police since I said that I sufferred from suicidal thoughts.\n\nThen, I waited for two hours until the ambulance arrived and an ambulance crew member escorted me to the car, holding me by my arm so that I would not try to escape, completely ignoring the fact that I came looking for help and did not try to hurt myself.\n\nFast forward to the insane asylum, I was interviewd by a middle-aged psychiatrist, who gave an impression as if he wanted to be literally anywhere else but in that room talking to me. After the interview, he told me that I would have to be committed either involumtarily, which would last for 48 hours, or voluntarily, in which case I would have to talk to a different doctor and stay in the insane asylum until she decided what is to be done with me. I tried patiently explaining to the psychiatrist that I only wanted to find help for my anxiety and suicidal thoughts and that I did not want to be committed to this institution. Moreover, I stressed that my emotional issues are connected to my career and that I had to go to work on the following day. I tried reasoning that missing the second day of my job and possibly losing both of the job offers is hardly productive for my mental health. He shrugged it off saying that it wasn't the end of the world.\n\nThe nurses then marched me off to the psych ward, gave me different clothes, and showed me to my room. The room had three beds and the furthermost one from the door had a heavily-sedated patient, whose arms and legs were tied to the bed. The nurse, in all seriousness, even asked me if I would prefer to sleep next to the sedated patient or I would choose the first bed.\n\nThe lights went out and I took the sleeping pills that the nurse offered and slept peacefully... until at least my roommate woke from his sedative-induced stupor and started cursing, swearing and yelling at the top of his lungs, demanding to be released from the restraints.\n\nTwo days have passed since then. I have not showered, brushed my teeth or shaved since I wasn't prepared to be committed to an insane asylum and had not prepared any of my things when I initially went to the hospital to get help.\n\nA lot of thoughts have gone through my mind in the past few days so I hoped that writing it all down and sharing with strangers would help me make some sense of it.\n\nTLDR: Tried to ask for help and find a therapist. Got committed to an insane asylum instead.\n\n",

        "selftext": "I'm 27M and life is so weird to me. I see people seemingly caring and loving each other but I struggle to feel that at all for anyone. I know my parents and family love me and I had a great environment growing up. But I'm just... detached. Like, I gained the ability to cry on command to feign sadness when something bad happens, but in reality, I don't feel anything at all. When my mother died, I know I was supposed to feel sad. I know I was supposed to love her as she did me, very much... but I failed at both. I really tried.\n\nI've had relationships in the past where my partners would tell me they love me, but I couldn't feel the same way. They treated me amazing and I try my best to be a good partner, but I could never get attached to someone or care for someone in that way. \n\nI know it sounds cruel, but I just can't seem to love anyone nor care for anyone no matter how hard I try.\n\nI find it hard to feel what others feel. For example, when my friend's dad died, I knew I needed to feel sad, but I just didn't. I didn't understand what he was feeling so I just tried my best to be there for him and take care of him. Even though I couldn't relate to him at all. It's just, I know this is the action that should be done, but I have no emotions attached to it. \n\nWhen I got a perfect GPA in college, and my cousin who was in the same college as me, in the same course did worse, I knew she didn't feel good, but I cant describe what that would feel like, if that makes sense. I mean, I've been bad or failed at things before and I just felt indifferent. So when my family was praising me and comforting my cousin, I was so confused because I had to feign being happy and sad at the same time. \n\nIt's so frustrating because I want to feel for people, but I can't look at people as anything else other than just... people. I can't relate to their struggles even though I try. I know I'm supposed to but I can't. I've been acting this whole time but I have no idea what's wrong. \n\nI know how I'm supposed to feel but I can't feel it. Everything is just monotone for me and things that happen just happen. I know what emotions are and it's so hard for me to feel them or relate to anyone else's. Idk I just wanted to put it out there and maybe find out what's wrong with me...",

        "selftext": "I just want to say thank you for all the replies. Honestly, it’s really opened my eyes. I think I was very lost in my feelings, and I truly appreciate everyone encouraging me to go for it, as well as those who reminded me to be careful and respect her boundaries. That’s really important to me. The last thing I want to do is make her feel uncomfortable or like I’ve overstepped, so I want to be very mindful of that.\n\nI also just want to say thank you for all your love and support. I'm a bit shocked. You guys are incredible people. \n\nSomeone suggested a book for me to read, and someone else suggested that I HEAL... Yes. I do think this is the crux of the matter. Thank you for that. I looked into the book and honestly, I think it's exactly my current experience. \n\nI got a lot of DMs asking for my personal experience and also, how to become a male escort. I thought I'd give a tiny update on what I plan to do, and then my story, in case people might be interested. \n\nSorry of its long and jumbled. I've only ever really spoken about some of these things with my current client. \n\nOkay so my idea: I don’t know if it’s going to work, but I think it allows me to put the idea there in a careful way. Based on how she reacts, I might then make the decision to drop her as a client because I don’t think this situation is healthy for me. Some people have pointed out that this isn’t a great way to do business as an escort, and I completely agree. \n\nHonestly, if I’m being real, I don’t think I'm a good escort anyway 😄 businesses wise.\n\nSo, here’s my plan. My birthday is later this month, and there’s a company in our area that specializes in theatrical productions. They have a live performance at a restaurant where you get dinner and a show all in one. From what she and I have talked about, this is exactly the kind of thing she values. She loves theater, singing, opera, she’s very cultured in that way. And it’s something that appeals to me, too, for my own reasons, which I’ll write in my back story, in case someone is interested.  She also knows this is something personally meaningful to me.\n\nSo, I’m going to buy two tickets, but I won’t invite her outright. Instead, I’ll reach out and jokingly reference the terms of the boyfriend experience she paid for, something like, “You know, technically part of the package is me checking in on you, and I haven’t heard from you in a while (haha)\". Depending on how she responds, I might then say something like, “I was actually given two tickets to this event, but I don’t have anyone who would really appreciate it. Would you maybe want to come with me?” She knows that’s true. I really don’t have anyone else for something like this.\n\nThe reason I thought this might be a good approach is because a lot of people pointed out that her paying puts her in control of the dynamic, which I completely agree with. But in this scenario, there’s a disconnect from that. It’s something separate... What do you think? \n\nHere's my story: \n\nI grew up in a small rural town, close to where I currently am. My home life wasn’t ideal, a bit of a mix of financial instability and neglect. I didn't finish school and by the time I was around 16, I was doing odd jobs, mainly in auto repair. \n\nI learned from the older men in town, working informally in backyard garages. I guess I figured this would be my future. Everyone in this town was kind of like that. Grew up there. Married someone who lived there. Never left... Everyone has dated everyone, kind of thing. I was never really interested in dating. \n\nThere was a girl a bit older who only showed up on weekends and during school holidays. She was visiting from somewhere bigger. She went to school in the city. We weren’t close or anything, but just knowing someone like that existed, that could... Leave the town? I don't know. I think it gave me hope or something. \n\nLater on, I got an opportunity to work as a farm laborer in the area. The farmer was an older man, past retirement age but still running around and working. He had a wife and two adult children. I was fixing fences and machinery, driving tractors, hauling feed, digging in the dirt with spades, but eventually the farmer saw, I don't know, potential? In me. He gave me more responsibilities, and a few years later, I had some kind of a foreman role. \n\nOne day, I was about to go into the farmer’s office when I overheard him and his son talking about me. I ended up eavesdropping, probably shouldn’t have, but I did. His son is more 10 years older than me, I'm not exactly how much older, and he was basically saying that me and my whole family were low class. \n\nAnd honestly? It hurt. But also because I felt like he wasn’t wrong. We were low class. But my mom was trying her best. She wasn’t around much, but that was because she was working constantly to make ends meet. And I have my own complicated feelings about her, but I also recognize that she was doing what she thought was best for us.\n\nWhat really got to me, though, was the son has had every opportunity handed to him... His family is wealthy, he can travel wherever he wants, study whatever he wants, never worry about money. And yet, he does nothing. I don’t want to sit here and judge someone else’s life, but he sleeps until 10am every day, barely does anything, then goes out drinking every night. \n\nHalf the time, he’s passed out on a couch, sometimes puking from drinking too much. And that’s the person calling me low class?Someone who’s never had to fight for anything, never had to struggle to survive?\n\nBut maybe he has his own demons he’s dealing with. Maybe this is just his way of coping. I don’t know. What I do know is that comments like that stick with me. And I do know that I’m not that guy passed out on the couch. I’m out here trying.\n\nEventually the farmer offered to pay for a GED for me. I took the opportunity and I'm so grateful for that man. I took a GED course that was offered by the university in the next town over. The \"big city\". But it was actually just a bigger town 😂\n\nIt opened my eyes. Suddenly, the world felt bigger. I had savings from working on the farm, and I wanted to go further, get a degree, but I needed a way to make some more money.\n\nThat's when I kind of considered escort work. I don't really have some dramatic story. I just Googled \"Male escort agencies near me\" 😅\n\nI was surprised by how many results popped up. At first, it was just research, out of curiosity more than anything. But found a website that seemed legit (or at least, more polished than the sketchy looking ones). I sent an email, attached a couple of photos. And then a few weeks later I got a call and I met up for coffee with two men. One was the \"manager\", the other was an escort himself. They explained the business was small, just a handful (lol) of guys. Their clients are men and women. They weren’t high-end, but they aimed for discretion and professionalism.\n\nAt first I wasn't sure. But I did like these men and the way they carried themselves. They were confident, polished, almost like businessmen who just happened to be in a very unconventional business. They made it seem... professional. I decided to just give it a go. Why not...\n\nThey provided me with a handbook of some sorts. It had information on how to conduct one self as an escort. How to negotiate with clients. Self defence... Information on drug use. How to identify and avoid STDs. Things I always need to take with me when seeing clients. How to dress yourself. Some legal aspects that might arise. Honestly it was all very helpful. \n\nMy first client was a woman in the middle of her PhD. I didn’t know what I expected... But I guess it was not was I was expecting? She was blunt, straightforward, and treated the encounter like a business transaction. There was no awkwardness, no false pretenses. It was surprisingly easy. She was my client for a long time. I saw her maybe twice a week. \n\nOver the next two or three years, the agency changed. More men joined, some left, and eventually, the guy managing it moved on to other things. The few of us who remained started working more independently but still using the agency’s reputation, but mostly managing our own profiles.\n\nThat brings me to the current situation, I guess. \n\nSome people have asked about my future plans, whether I’m thinking about a different job or what happens if things pan out with my client. So I thought I’d write something about that here.\n\nFrom the beginning, my business as an escort was always slow. It seems like the escorts who take both male and female clients get more work, but I was only comfortable working with female clients, so maybe that played a role. Either way, it was never something that fully supported me. There were times, especially over the last year and a half, when I didn’t get any work at all. It was really just a side hustle, something that sometimes worked out and sometimes didn’t.\n\nI'm trying to focus on getting my degree. I’m older than most of my classmates, of course. \n\nIn my second year, I got the opportunity to work as a pharmacy assistant. The pharmacy was close to my university, so I could walk over after class. I’m really grateful for that job because it helped me a lot financially. Then, from there, I landed an internship at a company in my field. It’s part-time, but they’re paying me to work there, and there’s an understanding that once I graduate (which, if all goes well, should be by the end of this year), they’ll offer me a full-time position.\n\nSo, escorting was something I turned to as a way to earn extra income, and for a while, it did help. But I always knew it wasn’t sustainable, and I’ve been slowly stepping away from it. In fact, before this specific client, I hadn’t taken on anyone in quite a while. I had a few once off clients here and there. \n\nSome of the comments suggested that I should let my client know that I’m quitting escorting and that if she still wants to stay in touch, we could. That’s something I’ve been thinking about too. Because the truth is, I am stepping away. The agency doesn’t really exist anymore and it’s basically just a bunch of us still lingering. But I think I’d like to make this official. It feels like the right time to close that chapter and fully focus on what’s next.\n\nAs for why this event that I want to ask her to is special to me:\n\nIt ties back to something from my childhood. When I was growing up, there was an old lady in town who played the organ at the church. My home life wasn’t great, as I've said. But to give more context, my mom was raising me, my sister, and my sister’s baby, my niece, who was unfortunately born addicted to heroin. My dad was... somewhere, but not in the picture.\n\nI had a cheap bicycle and used to ride around town a lot. One day, I rode past this lady’s house and saw that she had a dog. I don’t know why, but I just went inside her yard and started playing with her dog. I was about eight or nine at the time. She invited me in for tea and cookies. She was a retired music teacher. She actually called my mom to let her know I was there, and my mom was absolutely livid, telling me how inappropriate that was. And yeah, maybe it was. But the old lady seemed to like me.\n\nI ended up going back a few times, I guess I helped her around the house and in the garden sometimes. She was a widow and her son was living overseas. She tried to teach me how to play the piano. I never really got good at it, but it became something special to me. I sometimes go to concerts when I can, sometimes there are music concerts at my university. \n\nSo this specific even that I want to invite her to, really resonates with me. I don't know if it's the right thing or not. I guess we'll see. \n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you for time. I think I really needed this and I needed all of you. ",

        "selftext": "Hello, it is my first time ever posting on reddit and english is not my native language so sorry if I am screwing stuff up.\n\nQuick context: I am a 26 year old male with a partner of 5 year (28F) that I love very much together in our house with cats. My friend called \"V\" is a great person to be around, really soscial and funny. We met at university and were good friends from the moment we met and although life has lowered our time together, we still meet for DnD once a month at least and chat when time allows!\n\nAnyway,last year V told our close group of friends that they are transitioning but we can still use male pronouns and everything around him for now. We all accepted it and told him that we are here if he needs help.A couple of months went by and he started the hormone treatment, grew out his hair and starting dressing and acting more feminine. I started to find it a bit interesting to witness the transformation and my GF talked with him about his feelings and some tips and tricks regarding clothing and make-up. \n\nThe first \"feeling\" came when he was going to a dress-up party where he asked my GF to help to dress as a proper women for the first time with a wig, make-up and everything. She was happy to help and went over to his place where he and his roommates live (all girls) to work her magic. All went well according to my GF's text and she send me a picture when he was done. He looked so good! Cute but also sexy and most importantly, happy! That is when I first felt \"something\" and I was a bit shocked, I kinda pushed it away as a reaction to seeing the guy I know for 7 years suddenly as a beautiful women.\n\n The next feeling came later on the evening when I got a message from him (drunk) that was a picture of him blowing me a kiss and saying \"I love yooouuuu\" and some other stuff that he is happy to have me and my GF in his life. This gave me a butterfly in the stomach feeling but I thought it was just a corny message that some people send to friends when drunk (I remember plenty of instances where other friends told me they love me after a night of drinking as I am dropping them of at home and vice versa). I showed the message to my GF and she jokingly asked if I am going to leave her for him. I told here no because I really love her and this is just a random drunk text plus he mentioned her also in the text that followed so it was not only aimed at me.\n\nThat leaves me with the situation right now where I am 90% convinced that this is all just a temporary feeling and will blow over as they complete their transition and I move on with my GF in the meantime.\n\nWhat the hell should I do if the other 10% turns out and I cannot stop thinking about him/her when he starts looking for surgery etc? I really love my GF and I also don't want to ruin a great friendship. Do just thug it out or try to talk with V about it? Thanks in advance",

You have a dishwasher you can fill and let it do the work if you don't feel like standing and doing the dishes. You actually enjoy cooking, I hate it. I wish it was that easy to just get it done.

I was once waiting to take an exam, there were so many people in line and the invigilators were late setting up, so I walked through this door in the hall where j was waiting, into this random break room where I probably wasn’t allowed to be, but I just couldn’t stand there. \n\nI spend a lot of time on how I look, how I dress, because I don’t want to stand out. If I look sharp and nondescript, I’m that much closer to invisible. Or at least that’s the rationale I’ve come up with, it’s sort of a subconscious behaviour.\n\nI can also barely leave my house without headphones. Maybe it’s some sort of protection, some defense mechanism that disconnects me from the world around me. \n\nI know my fears and anxieties are extremely exaggerated, logically there’s no reason for me to be nervous. Maybe there’s some underlying psychological disorder that’s causing it, I do have ADHD and autism, but I can’t afford therapy or any sort of treatment so I really just have to deal with it for now, until I graduate. But it mostly hurts because I know that it won’t just get better with time, I need to do something about it, the future won’t be brighter just because the present is so dark. But I’m trapped like this for now.",

I've been minimizing contact with her recently though and it sucks because I know that I would never act on these feelings. The reason I haven't been talking to her as much is because I don't want James to feel like something would happen between us. I was spending much more time with Sarah than James because we are both into the same stuff right now.\n\nI'm glad Sarah doesn't feel the same way toward me as I do her, but it sucks knowing that she wouldn't feel the same even had she never met James.

But when you're me, that can lead to some serious problems. Showing up to the hospital with a severe nosebleed, two puffy, black eyes and a bump on my forehead that puts comic books to shame, I absolutely understand they're worried. And especially when the explanation is \"I walked into a door\".\n\nHere's the thing though: I ACTUALLY WALKED INTO A DOOR!!!\nNot only that, I was wearing crocs. And yes, I know: ewww crocs! But my mum bought them for me and they're really practical when I just need to put some shoes on to run to the mailbox. \n\nIn case you're unfamiliar with crocs, they're like bouncy rubber balls when you wear them and hit your foot on, let's say, a door! \nSo here I am, in a bit of a rush, shoving my feet into said crocs and then attempting to run out the door. Only, I somehow misjudged the distance to or the size of the door? Maybe? Whatever the reason, when I pulled the door open while simultaneously rushing at it, my foot hit the corner of the door. So the door stopped instantly, but my body didn't, resulting in my face smacking straight into the side edge of the door. Impact no 1. As if that wasn't bad enough, my leading foot was between the door and doorframe, so when the door bounced off my back croc, it hit my front croc, bounced back and smacked me in the face again. Impact no 2. It then bounced into the front croc, and back again. Impact no 3. I'm pretty sure that's when my nose got squished. I'm not sure how many more times it happened, but it sounded like a machingun was going off! I was so disoriented, seeing double, blood flooding out of my nose, my eyes rapidly swelling shut, and it felt like my forehead was splitting down the middle.\n\nSo yeah, I don't blame the hospital for thinking my \"I walked into a door\" was a lie...",

What?\n\nI stared at him, confused. \"We never had sex in a bathroom at Asda.\"\n\nHe insisted we did—back when he was living with his brother and I was staying with my aunt. He even painted the scene: our son was asleep, so we snuck off to the bathroom.\n\nOnly… our son wasn’t even born yet. I was pregnant at the time. And I am absolutely sure I would remember having sex in a supermarket bathroom. That kind of adrenaline rush would have stayed with me forever.\n\nYet, he kept insisting it happened.\n\nAnd that’s when it hit me.\n\nDid he cheat on me and forget that the person he was with wasn’t even me?\n\nThis was 10 or 11 years ago, but still, I would not have forgotten this. And I know this because I remember every place I’ve ever had sex in public, even from before I was with him. So this made absolutely no sense to me.\n\nSo yeah, there you have it—the truth off my chest.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nEdit or update whatever you want to call it \n\nI didn't expect this post to get so much attention.

He's never seen us argue, all he sees is what we let him see. Apart from the things I mentioned, we've had a very loving relationship the cheating 5 years ago I forgave and I dont regret that, we have been happy trust is still hard sometimes, but at the moment in the present he has not given me reasons to think that he has cheated or though about it. I understand what people are saying, that he might be abusive or mentally manipulating me but I dont really see it that way maybe when we argue but I don't think he does that on purpose or maybe I'm just blind .\nRight now, I’m thinking this might be something he's confusing with a dream, or something like some people have said.\nThinking back, I have mentally blocked out a lot from that time, I had a very stressful and traumatic pregnancy, and it's not something I want to get into or talk about.\nI posted this just to get it off my chest. \n\nPlease don't offend me in the comments that's just mean, and don't bring my son into it he has nothing to do with this! \n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons, his initial is changed for safety, and I’ll try not to include too many specific details, but this is a long one. Here goes:\n\nI started dating D after meeting at a bar, and things were amazing at first, as they usually are with narcissistic abusers. After a short period, his mask started to slip. He would sext me about his far out fantasies, some weird but benign, others dark and twisted. Sometimes I said no, but often I played along because some of the things he was suggesting I was fine experimenting with or could see myself potentially liking. And he was crazy hot, and the most charming person I’d ever met. And I knew he had been a player, but I didn’t mind. So had I, so it felt like a good match. I was falling in love with him and he (so he said) with me. We became official, and things immediately took a turn for the worse. \n\nThe first night he beat me up and raped me, I was on psychedelics that he encouraged me to take, and he convinced me afterwards that I had consented to the whole thing. That it was BDSM. That anything I didn’t like was fine but wasn’t his fault. (Mind you, BDSM requires specific, lucid, ongoing, and enthusiastic consent, and a safeword, which we did not have.) I think my brain chemistry was permanently changed that night because I sobbed in his arms and allowed myself to believe him. The gaslighting, heavy swings between silent treatment and intense attention, casual cruelty in our conversations, and lovebombing increased from there. \n\nLater on, D coerced me into group sex within which I was sexually assaulted by a stranger multiple times at his direction, before he assaulted me, damaged property, and ran before the police were called. He convinced me again that he thought I had consented to everything. He masterfully gaslit and lied and manipulated me and my memories felt untrustworthy. He convinced me I was going to ruin his life if I pressed charges. Under the trauma bond that had formed that I mistook for love, he convinced me to rescind my statement to the police. And we “made up”. \n\nThe last time I saw him was the worst night of my life and the last time he raped me. I had been drinking all night at his direction, and once we started, he did not stop. Not when I was choking and struggling under him, not when I was crying and begging him to stop, not when I went limp, not when I had lost a pint of blood, not when I passed out. I am lucky to be alive. \n\nBut in the morning, the trauma had taken most of my memories. I pretended I was okay, but he knew what he had done. When I realized I had to seek medical attention the next day, he told me I was overreacting and ignored my pleas for aftercare. I begged him for compassion and promised he’d done nothing wrong, but he refused. As the days passed, my memories started to return. As they did, I started to try to hold him accountable. But as I’m sure many of you know, narcissism does not allow for accountability. Every attempt of mine to break up with him was foiled, until he finally decided to “break up” with me. \n\nMy horrific memories continued to return to me, and so I went to the police. Anyone want to guess how that went?\n\nWhen they closed my case citing insufficient evidence, I was devastated. But I felt more than anything that I needed to warn the next woman. I posted my experience anonymously, and a woman came forward that he had drugged and SA’d years prior. More second-hand stories started coming out of the woodwork. So I posted him again. My case was closed, but my experience was real, and I realized people needed to know he was going to do it again and had probably done it before. \n\nYeah, not probably. Definitely. Dozens of women in a weekend in my extended circle of mutuals, and more outside of that, started sharing their experiences of abuse at D’s hand. Everything vile under the sun—sexual harassment, druggings, assault, blackmail, theft, manipulation, coercion, violence, and rape. Over MANY years. \n\nD is a true serial rapist, abuser, and predator. His disarming charm and looks and fake feminism and subsequent manipulation and gaslighting had not just worked on me, but friends and roommates and coworkers and romantic partners. It has been overwhelming, and heartbreaking, and sickening. But when I went to the cops, I thought I was alone. When I shared my experience, I thought I was alone. And now I know I’m the farthest thing from alone. And you bet litigation and a reopened case are incoming.\n\nBut I’m writing this post because I learned tonight about some of the things he did to another ex-girlfriend. Worse than he did to me, worse than you can imagine. For a lot longer. My body has been shaking non stop and I am livid after seeing photo evidence and hearing her story. Every time I think this whole situation can’t get worse, it does. \n\nI am so beyond angry at him. I am so disgusted with myself that I allowed him into my bed and into my life—that I stayed after he showed me his true colors. My belief system is so deeply rocked to my core, that a human being can be this consistently evil and on top of that, not get caught for a decade. I am terrified that he is going to come after me for exposing him to the larger community. And I am furious at all of the people around him who had to have enabled his horrific behavior. His family members who know of his history of abusing women, his male friends who listened to female friends try to share their experiences and brushed them off or gaslit them. His roommates who participated in or witnessed his crimes and kept quiet. The fucking POLICE who have done nothing to keep my city safe from this man or take my reports seriously or compassionately, despite him having multiple prior arrests and restraining orders against him. And most of all heartbroken at all the women before me who felt so alone and like they couldn’t come forward. And I feel guilty that I’m just a little bit angry at all of them too, because I wish just one of them had felt like I did, that I had to stop this from happening to the next girl. Because I was the next girl. And I’m forever changed.\n\nI don’t know where to go from here other than to a courtroom, but so much work lies ahead of me. Of us. I’m in therapy and taking each day as it comes. Several of the other survivors who’ve had years to heal are standing behind me and helping holding the pieces together, but it’s hard. And after what I heard today, I feel broken. \n\nBut I’m also spiritually wound tighter than I ever have been. Maybe the universe somehow connected us to give him one last chance to learn empathy and be a good person and partner, and give me one last chance to step away from men who disrespect my boundaries the first time. And we both failed. But the result of those failures is broken cycles—I will never let a man disrespect me again for the rest of my life, and D will not be able to continue his pattern of abuse. Perhaps our paths crossed for me to be my own savior whilst being his undoing. All I know for sure is that I am not fucking alone anymore. None of us are alone anymore. And I’m hopeful that our power in numbers will deliver him the consequences he deserves. \n\nThank you for reading. Please, MEN, and women, and everyone in between, believe. women. when they come forward. Believe them the first time. This incredibly fucked up situation should never ever happen again. And to survivors everywhere: you are not alone. ",

We have gone on many friendly dates to restaurants and coffee shops and we have made that a routine thing. We share so many interest like our music, taste in films, food, and fashion sense. We have even gotten matching tattoos together. Whenever either of us has something happen to us we immediately share it to each other. She has only been in two relationships and in both relationships she was only used for sex and her body. I have been in a similar situation where someone will be with me just for sex. But I don’t care at all about her body, don’t get me wrong she has an incredible one but it’s not what I’m into. I’m into the way that she talks with me and the way that we share jokes. I know that If I was in a relationship and we never had any sex or I never even saw her naked I would still be incredibly in love with her because I’m in love with her soul and her being more than her physical body. I feel that I could give her anything she wants or needs in a relationship and I wanna tell her about my feelings, but I’m so afraid that if I do that I’ll lose and if I do lose her than there’s no point in me being in this existence.

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nFor the second consecutive year, I stayed at Great Wolf Lodge from 6/23-6/27. I visited the park, Kings Island, on 6/25 &amp; 6/27. In a perfect world, I’d love to tell you about everything I did, and the people I met. But unfortunately, the sense of joy, rejuvenation, and fulfillment I get by being there was tarnished by an incident that took place at the end of the trip, and at park closing on the 27th.\n\nThis post is as long as it is to make sure I cover all the details of what happened as specifically as I can. It's now been eight months since this took place, so I needed some time before I went public about this. What I hope to accomplish with this is to have a better understanding of the world from a unique perspective, and to use this as a learning tool to learn from someone else's misjudgements. I'm posting this with the complete acceptance, understanding that this story may bring some type of criticism in my direction, and honestly, to achieve some type of closure on this particular incident. With all that being said, I'll begin...\n\nOn the night of June 27th, I was in the Fast Lane Queue for “Orion” to get a Post-Fireworks Night Ride. That day, I was wearing a white Ross Chastain \"Gone Fishing\" Busch Light Car T-Shirt, Wrangler Jean Shorts, and All-Black Under Armour Men's Charged Rogue 4 Running Shoes. I was at the top of the steps and happened to introduce myself to two young ladies who were sitting against the fence in the station. To best describe it as many of you know, there’s a 3-4 foot gap between the station and the stairs before you actually enter the station. If I was to guess, I originally thought these two females were in their early 20’s, I’m 28 for context, but they ask me…\n\n “Are you gonna be our new besties???” \n\nNo girl has ever asked me a question like that. So I’m of the impression that they’re attracted, to me, and assumed they’re of legal age, so I jokingly responded…\n\n“Well, I’m gonna be leaving tonight, unless you had something else in mind…”\n\nAnd even if things worked out, I wouldn’t have bothered because I have a 2 +/- Hour Drive in front of me back home to Louisville after I do this Night Ride. But the girls then look at each other very awkwardly and say something along the lines of…\n\n“Dude WE’RE 16!”\n\nI profusely try to apologize, but they begin to overreact and make a scene in the station, escalating the situation, and start running down the steps of the normal queue. And I apologize to the greeter and to a ride attendant, because I didn’t know that they were underage. As I’ll explain later in more detail, that part of the situation, like all parts of this situation could’ve been resolved with an apology, and life could’ve went on. As this was misunderstanding.\n\nSome may ask why I didn’t just ask how old they were. I’ve been raised on the idea that asking women how old they are is inappropriate.\n\nSo I finished my ride which while it was spectacular, I’m kinda nervous about what happened beforehand as I head to my locker to retrieve my belongings. Mine was on the section closest to the On-Ride Photo Desk and I’m not able to open it, probably because the park is now closed, so the rental by default has expired. So while I’m about to get someone to help me get this locker opened, two teenage boys confront me very aggressively on the situation before the ride saying something in the realm of…\n\n“What are you doing touching up on these little girls!!! You should know better!!!”\n\n“You wear that cross on your neck and do something like that?! How would god feel about that?”\n\n*For context, I regularly wear either black or silver cross necklace. I've had many people make conversation about that.*\n\n“I’m disappointed in you.”\n\n“You’re not going anywhere, until you apologize.”\n\nThey also asked if I was at Soak City earlier, which I was to check it out for the first time and look through some of the shops. But they claimed I made inappropriate physical contact with someone there to. Which I didn’t.\n\nI know that isn’t exactly what these two gentlemen said, but it’s what I remember as my anxiety ramped wondering how do I get outta this dilemma that just got handed to me on a silver platter. But a couple of things, I never groped these women. The park has security cameras everywhere, including in the coaster’s stations, so there’s proof that didn’t happen, and I also attempted to explain to these two gentleman that I had no clue they were 16. Again, I thought they were in their early 20’s, college age. But they weren’t buying it as both told me…\n\n“BRO, YOU COULD TELL!”\n\nMany women look older than they actually are. So you really can’t sometimes.\n\nBut they both proceed to exercise public humiliation on me by shouting how I was, “Touching up on little girls!” to everyone who was leaving Area 72 that evening. Like they’re the men from “Dads Against Predators” on Locals.\n\nFinally, security steps in to figure out what was going on, and by the request of these young men. One guard originally begins to interview me, but then attends to the younger gentleman who initiated the confrontation, so another guard interviews me and I explain everything as detailed as I can, and as calm as I can l which in the moment, was pretty impossible to accomplish. I finally got my things outta my locker, then this guard escorts me to the front of the park to see what his supervisor or coworkers had to say on the matter, and they told me…\n\n“You’re good to go sir, nothing else is gonna happen.”\n\n“Next time when you’re having small talk, just be more careful.”\n\nSo I walk the path back over to Great Wolf where my car was parked. I checked out from there that morning and was granted permission to keep my car parked there. But as I’m then at the North-End of the parking lot, in the small section that walks Southeast-to-Northwest, what appears to be a Black 2014 Honda Civic pulls up, and it’s the teenagers again. The gentleman in the passenger side ask for my name, number, address, and zip-code. Which I like this whole time, cooperate and disclose it. And many of you may ask, why would you give your information to them? They aren’t police or security. I thought that being honest, and cooperative would salvage my reputation in this situation. And what if they can tell that I’m lying. So after doing so, he says to me…\n\n“We just got banned for a month. This is my favorite place to go to. Have a good night, I love you.”\n\nThen they take off into the night.\n\nTo be honest, I should’ve walked down Columbia Road instead of the walk path to avoid the possibility of further encounters. But at that point, I thought the teens left at that point. Or ask security to escort me to my car, if they’re allowed to do that.\n\nAfter filling up my car at the GoCo on Kings Mills Road, I began my drive home. I look over to my left on Southbound I-71 to look at the park one last time, despite it looking so spectacular in person at night, I was unable to enjoy it because of what all just happened.\n\nHere’s how this situation should’ve been resolved…\n\nIf I were the girls, I’d peacefully, and politely inform me, “Sorry to tell you, but we’re actually 16.” \n\nThen I’d have responded, “My apologies, I didn’t know that. I’ll back off, I apologize.” \n\nThen the girls should’ve said, “You’re fine. It’s all good”. Then life would’ve moved on and the situation would’ve never escalated to the point it did.\n\nBut to begin with, if the girls never asked that question, none of this would have ever happened to begin with...\n\nIf I were either of the boys, I would have started with professionally and calmly said, “Excuse me sir, you gotta minute to talk?”\n\nAnd I would’ve said, “Sure. No problem.”\n\nThey could’ve have offered to buy me a Dasani, then said, “Do you know why we’re wanting to speak with you??? Okay, there was an incident involving several young ladies in the station a few minutes ago, would you mind sharing your side of the story?”\n\nAnd I would’ve done just that. So they have both sides of the story and develop a conclusion and they finished the meeting by stating, “Okay, we believe you did make a mistake, you didn’t know their age, just be more careful next time. Thank You for talking with us and have a good night.”\n\nThere’s a reason for the saying, “Cooler heads prevail.” You gotta assure everyone’s calm in order to then get to the bottom of any situation. That never happened.\n\nThere also has to be a presumption of innocence established in the investigation process as well. That’s why in the legal system, “All suspects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.” Which thanks to security for helping with this incident and siding with me on this.\n\nOn June 28th, one of the male parties in the incident made a post to this group that afternoon, which was a motive to making this post in response. I waited til’ now to conduct this post so I made sure I could tell my side in the most detailed and comprehensive way possible. But prior to the post either being deleted, or taken down, I monitored it by reading all the comments throughout the time that post remained up. To start, I read that I was reported to Mason Police. I was waiting to see if either they would call me for an interview, I never did. I thought about calling them myself, but when talking to someone about the matter, they recommended I didn’t. This individual also claimed in the comments…\n\n “I watched him do what he did.”\n\nBut in the post, he states…\n\n“2 girls came running down the stairs”\n\nWhich implies that he was either at the bottom of the stairs or still at ground-level. And in addition to the wall that divides the Fast-Lane queue to the regular queue after the show building, there would be no possibility for him to have seen the incident unfold. So it seems very contradicting.\n\nAlso, another user had stated…\n\n“the girls wouldn’t of lied about something like that”\n\nThis where I channel my inner Alex Jones and become a tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist…\n\nIn retrospect, hindsight is always 20/20, I believe the possibility that those girls asked me that question, “Are you gonna be our new besties???” to bait me. I’ll even go a step further, that I’m of the belief that they might’ve been of legal age, but claimed they were 16 as a convenient excuse to cause a problem. I’m not saying that’s the case, it’s complete speculation. In today’s society, select people love to cause and/or escalate issues to play the victim card because it gets them attention. On top of that, they also delivered misinformation by stating I had groped them. Like I mentioned earlier, there was a 4ft gap between us, that would’ve been impossible. And security cameras are everywhere, and if footage was pulled up, it shows I never did that. So they lied about that to artificially make the situation look worse to garner more attention and spark more outrage. This is why you have to hear both sides to the story, then develop the conclusion. Not just hear one side and ride with it. Again, what other reason would these two girls ask me that question?\n\nIn the minutes, hours, and days following, this has greatly &amp; negatively affected my mental health as I’ve had many thoughts rush through my head. I thought maybe it was best I should wait a couple years before visiting again. I’m worried about the people around who witnessed what happened, how will they think of me? What’s the ride attendants at Orion gonna think of me? What’s gonna happen if these teens see me again? Are they gonna forget about what happened, or will they try to engage in some type of conflict? How will I be able to pick myself up from this? And am I sure I’ll still be a positive asset to society? Thankfully, I didn’t have to wait too long to answer that last question. On July 3rd, I visited Ark Encounter, and it felt therapeutic to be on I-71 again, then be around people again. While there, I’d happen to see a mom try taking a family photo, but she wouldn’t be in it, so I’d ask… \n\n“Excuse me ma'am, if you wanna be in the shot, I’ll take the photo.”\n\nAnd that situation happened 4 or 5 times that day, and to see the sense of joy, appreciation, and thankfulness expressed by these families to me reassured that I was good person, and a positive asset to society.\n\nI’ve talked to many people about this for advice and support. While at the Goco/Popeyes/Dunkin Donuts on Kings Mills Road to fill up, and I talked to the guy working there about this and mentioned it was teens just looking to cause issues. When I woke up Friday afternoon, I talked to my parents immediately about this, if I didn’t, they’d notice something was bothering me. I also talked to select people at Work, on XBOX, and to other friends of mine, and everyone unanimously have said that I did nothing wrong, and agreed it was a misunderstanding. I wanna thank everyone who I’ve reached out to for support, as this has been a difficult time. I’m surprised everyone has sided with me on this, they didn’t have to, but I’m grateful for helping me get through this.\n\nI can only imagine the stress and anxiety women, especially attractive women feel in public. To go to any Zoo, Bar, Restaurant, Bowling Alley, Amusement Park, Movie Theater, etc. has to be sometimes unbearable. To always be looked at, or to have someone always making advances towards you has to feel vulnerable and invasive. With that in consideration, I do what’s necessary to respect women’s boundaries when out in public. So to even claim that I’m a Predator is absolutely inaccurate. As mentioned earlier, this was a misunderstanding. These girls asked a question that led me to assume they were attracted to me, and of age. I responded based off that, then they blew it out of proportion and caused a huge mess at the end of what was supposed to be another fun and memorable multi-day trip up there.\n\nIn conclusion, the last, absolute last things I’d want to do is make enemies inside the gates of Kings Island. Not within Mason, Ohio, not within Warren County, not within the Cincinnati Tri-State Area, and not within the State of Ohio period. And the other last thing I wanted is to be on the radar of the City of Mason Police Department. I imagine a day where I can call Mason, Ohio home, so I want to be on good terms with everyone I encounter. To the other parties involved if they read this post, I hope we can mutually apologize come to a better understanding of what took place so we can be on good terms with each other, achieve closure, and move forward on a positive note. I’m gonna be visiting the park again this year, so I don’t want us to cross paths and have any further conflict or sense of animosity or discomfort. While I’m not wishing ill will on anyone, these four people possibly will be faced with a situation that’s a misunderstanding as well. If so, I’d want their situation to be handled calmly and smoothened out as well and as quickly as possible so they don’t face any hate or animosity from the opposing parties of whatever situation faces them. And I apologize to the two young men for getting banned. Y’all unfortunately, were denied the opportunity to see the Fourth of July Celebration fireworks display, and more valuable time to ride “Orion”, “The Beast”, or whatever y’all’s favorite coaster might be. While I understand they were trying to stand up for what's right, it still wasn't the correct way to do so, and hopefully they learn from this as well. For me, I just use it as a learning experience to be extra careful on who I'm talking to, and not make decisions off assumptions. Which I apologize to the young ladies for doing so. I’m someone who’s very respectful to people’s boundaries, and wouldn’t wanna make decisions about that makes someone feel uncomfortable. But I do hope they apologize for asking a question that expresses attraction, only to turnaround and cause a scene that could’ve been resolved with a simple apology. Nobody would’ve gotten banned, and security wouldn’t have gotten involved. I'm gonna be presented with 1,000 different situations and scenarios, and I'll be fine in 925 of them. Nobody is perfect. Also, it's been important for me to allow time to heal the wounds as the situation shrinks farther in the past. I come to Kings Island for peace and serenity, not drama and distress. And this sadly, was drama and distress. I've met many people in my now four visits to the park and had wonderful converstations and engagements with those people, both fellow guests, and employees. It's very unfortunate this all happened, and was more heartbreaking that it happened at the very end of this trip I took. I refuse to allow that to be the last memory I have of the park this year.\n\nThank you to everyone who took time outta their day to read this and whether or not you’re going to the park today, have a great day everyone…",

I was even born with some of these issues, I've been in pain for forever and I get sick a lot which makes everything worse.\nI hate being a burden on people, most of the time I hide my pain. I am good at that up to a point. Probably most people who technically know me have no idea how sick I actually am while the people who really know me are unfortunately, more exposed to how bad it is for me. \n\nYesterday morning I was in PAIN, like absurd pain, like the worst pain I have ever felt. I've felt that exact pain exactly 3 other times in my life. All 3 times I was rushed to the ER under the assumption that my appendix was having kittens or something. No appendix issues were found and eventually, after about 12 hours of hell, the pain goes away. This time was no different, except this time I knew there was no reason to go to the hospital, at aprox 11 hours in it finally subsided and I was able to crash.\n\n My best friend/roommate (M24) was in the house for the first half of this. Mind you I was moaning, scream crying and begging the universe for help most of the morning. I told him the about going to the hospital each time before and receiving no help and no answers. He seemed concerned but that was it. He didn't even check on me before leaving for the day. (I was supposed to be puppy sitting while he was at work. \n\nMy bf (M36) came over about two hours after the pain subsided. He was very informed about how the day had gone for me as I had been texting him all day while he was stuck at work and school. He barely acknowledged my condition when he came in, still glued to his phone even though I started bawling like a baby as soon as he came in. I know his day wasn't easy, I ended up massaging his arm, and even skipping the snuggs and cry session I had requested via text, to hold space for how he was doing emotionally. We went to bed. He did ask how my pain was and spent a moment checking for classic appendicitis symptoms. But he was a million miles away...... \n\nI know that I am always in pain and I don't want people to dote on me but I felt so invisible and neglected today I could almost blow away in the wind. I don't think anyone did anything wrong. My whole family does the same thing (remember I've been in pain my whole life). I'm just kind of devastated. I had one of the hardest most painful days of my life, and I did it alone, I still need to cry, I still need to be held.......",

He wasnt very active in recent years, in fact he was terribly sick for most of my (f20) life and id either see him at the hospital or on the couch barely breathing.\nSo tell me why my grandma (whos a bit of a oversharer) told me about the family drama aka my grandpa took out thousands of dollars in cash from their bank account. My grandma found out shortly before he died when she found a bag full of cash and had their kid (my father) investigate. They planned on having a family intervention and question him on where the money has gone but then he just died!\nIt wasnt a surprise for anyone that he died but like goddamn what could this old man use all that money for??\nLike he would barely get out of bed he was so sick. I got his old car and its bittersweet, and im just so genuinely confused as to what he couldve blown all this money on and also terrified that there might be more in the car or other places.\nAnyway i just had to tell someone cause its driving my insane thanks random reddit user!",

        "selftext": "# How I Started a Bag Store and What Went Wrong\n\n# 📢 Why I’m Writing This Post\n\nI want to share my story about how I started a business from scratch, faced unexpected challenges, and now find myself at a crossroads. This isn’t just about bags—it’s about resilience, risks, and the struggle to keep going when everything seems to work against you.\n\nI genuinely want to hear your thoughts because, honestly, I don't know what to do next.\n\n# 🏠 Life Before Everything Changed\n\nBefore all of this, my family and I had stable jobs, and life was fairly predictable. But then, everything shifted. My parents lost their jobs, and I had to step up to support them. I also had to make the tough decision to send my wife and child abroad to ensure their safety while I stayed behind and worked.\n\nI took a job as the head of security for a wealthy businessman. Every cent I made went to supporting my family. I lived on the bare minimum, just making sure I could keep going physically and mentally.\n\n# 👜 How the Idea of the Store Was Born\n\nMy mother, after months of being unable to work, started looking for a way to do something productive. She remembered the small bag-making business that my wife and I had started before the pandemic, which we had to shut down due to COVID-19.\n\nShe decided to try reviving it, and we applied for a small business grant. The process was slow, and after waiting nearly a year, we were approved—but for much less money than we had originally planned for. We had to decide whether to take the risk and move forward or let the idea go.\n\n# 💡 Why We Decided to Start the Business Anyway\n\nMy mother had no prior experience in fashion or sewing—she had worked in an office her entire life. But she was determined to learn. I helped her enroll in **bag design and sewing courses**, and she began developing the first models.\n\nMeanwhile, in my free time, I worked on setting up our **Etsy store**. We put everything we had into making this business work.\n\n# ✈️ A New Opportunity… and Another Setback\n\nWhile all of this was happening, my employer decided to relocate to **Valencia, Spain**, and offered me a job there. It seemed like a great opportunity, so I moved my family and followed him.\n\nOver several months, I:\n\n* Helped relocate his family and others.\n* Assisted in finding and purchasing a new business (a plywood factory for investment purposes).\n\nBut after everything was set up, he **fired me** without warning, leaving me unemployed in a foreign country with no backup plan.\n\n# 🤷‍♂️ Where Are We Now?\n\nRight now, my family and I are living in Spain, relying on **our last savings (enough for about 4–5 months)**. Meanwhile, our **Etsy store has not generated a single sale**, and my mother is struggling to keep up with rent for the workshop.\n\n# ❓ What Are We Doing Wrong? I Need Your Advice!\n\n* **Our bags are high-quality, handcrafted leather pieces.** We set the price range at **X–Y$**, but we haven’t made a single sale.\n* We tried advertising on **Etsy and Instagram**, but conversion is extremely low.\n* Maybe we’ve chosen the wrong target audience, or our product descriptions aren’t engaging enough?\n\n🔎 **Please check out our store and give honest feedback!** Maybe you’ll see mistakes that we’re not noticing? Any advice or critique would help us understand what needs to change to keep this business alive.\n\n**I’m attaching the store link and a video of our production process. I’d be grateful for any input!** 🙏",

        "selftext": "Sometimes I just want to choke myself to death.\n\nTheoretically, I can't; it is the given nature of humans to respond to threats, so instead, I just smash objects and choke my pillow. I got angry and aggressive even with the slightest trigger, but I didn't want to hurt anyone around me, so I tried to keep my mouth shut and lock myself up whenever I felt crazy.\n\nA little bit of background. I was terribly sucks at social interaction, and during work, I was feeling useless. My boss was kind as they explained to me that I have to show more passion and that they cannot offer to extend my contract, which I agree with. However, I was somehow irritated with some of my seniors' words, and I kept replaying those words in my head to the point that it hurt my chest and exploded my head.\n\nWhenever I recall that conversation, I just slapped myself really hard multiple times, and I got addicted to that; I just stopped slapping because I knew I could not die, and dealing with a dizzy head after torturing myself was not a good idea. \n\nI don't want to blame anyone, as it is my choice after all, but having these unhealthy behaviors has taken a toll on my mental health and affects my job hunting. Now I dream every night about people speaking ill of me.\n\nAs I am writing this, I no longer understand why I was having that kind of thought during my rant; most of the time after the burst out, my mind just blacked out and proceeded with anything I was doing previously like nothing ever happened. But thoughts like this keep coming randomly, and I'm afraid that I could eventually hurt myself or someone. ",

        "selftext": "Let me explain—\n\nI get really bothered when I make plans or I am a part of plans where I am the driver and someone invites someone unexpectedly. Aka gives them a seat in my car without asking me.\n\nFor context my car seats 5 people including the driver, so 4 seats for passengers. Also, I’m the only one in my immediate friend group with a car. \n\nUsually if my friends and I have plans, we’re taking my car. I don’t have an issue with that as we fit in my car and I’d rather do that than spend unnecessary money on an uber. If we’re planning something as a group I make sure to communicate with my group and tell them who I’ve personally invited so that way no one’s surprised. I get really bothered when I show up to pick people up and they have someone extra that they didn’t tell me about. I get especially annoyed if it’s someone I dont know and they just expect me to give a ride..\n\nThis really annoys me because:\n\n1. Usually my car is full because as i said, im the only one in my immediate friend group with a car. So if im offering to give you a ride, thats not an invitation to invite other people. ESPECIALLY people i dont know. You dont know who else ive offered a ride to and its not your car to offer !!!!\n\n2. To me it seems extremely rude and entitled. I dont care how close of friends we are, at least give me the heads up that you’re bringing someone else. Im not a bitch, i wont say no just bc idk them or like bc it was unexpected. I just get extremely annoyed when you dont even give me the courtesy of asking???? Again its not your car to offer spots in. And if its a group plan, you dont know if im giving other people rides !! If you would have asked me “hey, i invited x person, can you give them a ride too?” I can have the chance to say “oh sorry my car is full im sorry!” \n\nBut no, u just show up with them and then im in the awkward position of turning them away bc theres no space and then i look like a bitch\n\nI just want the courtesy yk??? And ive communicated to my friends how it bothers me and how if they plan on inviting someone else and they are expecting ME to give them a ride, ASK ME !\n\nI literally just let one of my friends know yesterday privately how much it bothered me and he said ok. He proceeded to do it again today so instead of waiting till we were in private, i just told him in front of his guest i said “im sorry my car is full. I have to go pick up my friend so theres no extra seats. if you wouldve let me know then maybe i couldve saved her a seat but i didnt know she was coming.” And he claimed to “not know” that his guest was gonna come but he literally invited her … -_-. And again I literally would not have had a problem saving her a seat!! He just NEVER told me he invited her so i offered rides to other people!!!! Wtf\n\nThis is rational right? Or am i just being mean. I definitely couldve worded it better bc in the end i did make his guest feel a bit bad but i was just so frustrated! Especially since i had JUST talked to him about this yesterday!!!!! It lowkey makes me feel taken advantage of like why cant u just give me the courtesy of telling me who u plan to bring into MY car. Im literally not even stingy with giving rides either, 95% of the time i say yes unless i absolutely cant. So WHY NOT JUST ASK ME. Cause now i look mean and like a bitch. \n\nWould this bother you too? ",

        "selftext": "Hi. I when I was 12 I was playing in an arcade on the slot machines and a guy came up to me and started feeding my machine with cash.   I went back every week and he paid whilst I played.  This happended over a period which I cannot remember and then one day he started to stroke my penis.   Nobody had ever touched me here before so naturally my body reacted and I got erect even though i was scared as hell.\n\nI continued to go back for six months then one day he took me to a cafe on the pier and bought me dinner. Burger chips etc.  He undid my zip on my trousers and got my cock out and jerked me off and I came my first ever ejaculation.  I keep blaming myself because I kept going back to get jerked off and fed. My mom was single parent and dad moved away. I was left alone for hours when she was working.\n\nI now realise I was groomed and sexually assaulted .  I still have these feelings of excitement when I remember this first time which then turn immediately to disgust at myself for saying nothing and letting it continue.\n\nI have had therapy when i was 16. Long story but I was addicted to the machines by now and another guy started doing the same and pay me £40 for the privilege.  The money just went back on the machines.   \n\nThis second guy groomed me so much I ended up going to his flat to see his spectrum computer and he continued there which turned to blowing me and paying me 40.   The last time i went he raped me.   I ran away after and stayed out late and the police were out looking for me.  I was scared to go home as much bottom was so painful.\n\nThe police found me hiding under the pier and took me home.  I told them and mum that I had realised I was late home and rather than face the music stayed out as I was scared of getting into trouble. So naturally I was in a vicious circle the later it became.   \n\nThe accepted it and nothing was said about the assault.   I don't remember how I dealt with the pain but my brain has blocked some stuff out.\n\nFF three years and the police turned up at myself home and said I had been exposing my penis to the public. I seriously honestly have no recollection of this at all. They cautioned me and my mum shouted and screamed when they went asking why until I broke down after she said 'has someone hurt you\".\n\nShe got the police back and I made a statement.    To this day I've never been told what happened the guy. Whethery they caught him or not but I never had to go to court.   For years I thought they  filed it nfa as I was just a dirty rent boy who deserved what he got.   I feel let down by the police as I know now that I was a child and it was grooming secual assault and rape.\n\nI am a gay man and have never been able to \" take it\" (sorry for the crudeness) due to the memory.  I know it's not everything but I know I'm a disappointment for not being a real gay man.  When I have these feelings of not being good enough for anyone or deserving of anything I struggle and want to run away. As i am a let down to others for not getting over it.  I've been in a relationship for 28nyesrs and my partner he knows everything but I still regularly have these days of being not enoug, people pleasing and feeling like everyone would be better without me.\n\nFor some reason I just had my first nightmare in over 35 years and it started with the first day of being touched at 12 and ended with the rape and police.   I woke up [to my disgust] with an erection which soon went down when i was awake.   I feel sick and can't believer my body reacted in this way to a traumatic memory. I have felt guilty all these years that the guys who assaulted me made me erect and ejaculate but the therapist said it was just a natural reaction to being touched down there.  And I've accepted it wasn't my fault.  Until now.   That dream has taken me back over 40 years and to wake up erect makes me wanna kill myself. What sick fuck am i?  Or was it my 12 year old inner person that made me.erect.   I am due at work in a cople of hours and can't face the world. I am disgusted with myself again after all the years of counselling and accepting i was a child and they we're adults and as such I took no blame whatsoever.\n\nBut this fucking nightmare has moved the goalposts.   Why the fuck would I wake up sexually excited over something so traumatic?\n\nThe only thing I can think of is yesterday my partner and I and his sister found out their dad, my dad in law has secondary cancer and metastatic cancer which is obious a traumatic.  Could this trigger earlier trauma?  But the sick feeling of waking up with an erection makes me feel so low i can't tell anyone.  I won't kill myself dw.  I am a people pleaser and would never put my friends and family through that.  I have cptsd as 8 years ago my best mate took his life and I found him.   So I could never put others through what I have\n So in not killing myself I am a failure to me twice.  As I am pleasing others instead of me.   I just wanna go back to the day before yesterday when I felt a normal person. Instead a funked up freak of nature.",

Seems like no matter what I do nothing gets through to him about finding help, speaking with someone far more qualified than I am or even admitting he needs to get things under control before he puts himself in even worse health. I constantly have to hear him complaining about how everything is everyone else's fault, the world turned its back on him and how nothing matters since nothing goes right for him anyway. \n\nIt's wearing me down. Hard. \n\nI try so hard to see things on the other side and keep suggesting that he sees someone about this because I can only do so much but now it's to the point where I want to slap the **shit** out of him and try to literally knock some sense into him before having him committed against his will so someone can drug him enough to where he's far less annoying. Only thing is I love him so much that I can't do anything but go along with it because i'm petrified of waking up one day after being honest with him and finding out he did himself in. \n\nI have no one to talk to about this. My friends keep telling me to leave him and they see how tired I am from dating him and constantly trying to keep his spirits up. I know we're heading down that road if this keeps up, but I also know that if we do end things I'll always be dreading *that* phone call letting me know he took his own life. I also know that once this is over, i'll never date again because i'll never be able to open myself up to potentially dating another selfish, suicidal asshole who only thinks about themselves. \n\nI also know that without him, i'll likely be so stressed and lonely i'll have a broken heart to deal with and that'll do me in. I'm finding my own therapist to talk to about all of this, but goddamn it I can't handle another night of him being brutally honest about wanting to die and I just sit here and quietly take hearing about it. \n\nMy love life hasn't ever been perfect but I was hoping *so badly* this would be the one relationship to finally break my streak of finding someone to be with that wasn't me clinging on to the first person who gave me some sort of genuine attention. I should have known finding love that would stick around was never meant for me. I don't even know why I bothered in this relationship, I should have known the happiest i've ever been in life with someone by my side would also be the most miserable i've ever been.\n\nI don't know what else to do.

I was meant to go to a concert with her and one of her friends. Everything was fine until a few hours before when she decided to started making long messages and voice notes about how everything was just going to crazy and chaos. I was informed last minute that her friend has problems being at concerts and around any people due to social anxiety. I said I understood as I had suffered with it (still do at times) and had only really gotten over it recently. And then it just gets worse and worse “can’t pick you up anymore” “my friend isn’t calming down, she’s been freaking out about this since we bought the tickets months ago.” “We probably won’t talk to you much you might just had to stand a hit away from us.” “You can be there just do your own thing” I told her to just tell me if I can’t come and she told me it’s probably best if I don’t. 11 year friendship, just treated like an ant on the ground stepped in on and killed. I asked her why she didn’t just tell me MONTHS ago if her friend was uncomfortable with me there. I could have made other plans or tried to message her friend, help her know that I won’t judge her and she doesn’t have to interact with me if she’s uncomfortable. But I was left with 4 hours to get other plans. Thankfully sold my ticket last minute but lost lots of money from it. I got mad at her but I don’t know if I feel sorry. A friend of mine that knows her too, but it’s not like we’d ever all hung out or even mention eachother to eachother, said maybe I should have been more considerate and just left it because her sister had passed away a few years ago and she still struggles. I told her I understand that, I don’t expect her to not ever be affected my that again. But I also told her that I won’t be excusing her if she treats me badly. When I’ve grieved I’ve never used it as an excuse to treat people badly. I’ve heard other stories about her not treating people the best, and I feel like she now hides behind this and uses grief as her excuse. I never got an actual apology, just a “idk what to say”. I’m not putting this up to grief, even if it was it doesn’t excuse what she did. She had months of time to inform me that the situation may not have been appropriate, as her friend is uncomfortable around anyone  new and had been “anxious for months leading up to this” (her words) I don’t need the full diagnosis and pry into her friends life because I’m not entitled to that. But if I had just been told months before that she was feeling anxious about going to a a concert with an unfamiliar person, I could have seen if the friend wanted to meet in a quiet place with the mutual friend or meet over text. Or I could have made other plans. It’s fine now,  it’s been a little bit of time since then.

Dumb little game, I know. \n\n\nSo, this weekend we went on this trip together, since he doesn't know his way around I had to be on top of the booking. I booked two separate bedrooms. My plan was to have a nice weekend with him and NOT GET ATTACHED, because tbh he's way too handsome and I don't think I could manage all the jealousy that comes with having someone like him as a partner. \n\nThe getaway went ok, We couldn't get our hands of each other, but my poor planning skills ruined some parts of the trip and he was noticably irritated, but didn't blame it on me. I ended up knowing him better, we had long talks, he was very sweet to me. He showed me some of his work unedited. We talked about our childhoods and  all. \n\n\nAt some point he said something like \"I know that for you this is something superficial\" , and when I asked him what he meant he said that he knew I was there for the sex and that I only used guys for pleasure. I told him that I actually had admired him for years and that I wasn't at all interested in sleeping with him when we first met, I was just so glad to meet one of my favorite artists. And I did tell him I cared deeply about him, but I knew that I wasn't special for him at all either, and I had no reason to believe he wanted anything else than just having a good time with me, as he is surrounded by beautiful woman all the time, I was just the flavor of the week. He seemed a bit offended by that comment , he said he doesn't  see girls that way and that he only opens up to someone special. We agreed that we both like each other and we both café for each other , so that the best thing would be to take advantage of the time together, and maybe do physical stuff while we still can when we have the chance, but remain good friends until we're old. \n\nI don't know, it was a weird conversation and i can't shake the feeling that he was just trying to make me say that I was in love with him or something because of his narcissistic nature. I have shielded my heart from guys like him years ago because I know falling for them doesn't ever end well. \n\nAnyway, at the end of the trip we couldn't get a bus back to our city and he got pretty mad. I felt awful and I wasn't looking forward to spend the next 3 hours next to him being mad. But he explained to me that it was just his survival skills, nothing personal. He went back to being all touchy feely and even told me he had referred to me as \"his wife\" to some lady who asked him who I was to him. I told him he was full of it, I knew he was just trying to manipulate me. He fell asleep on my lap for most of the trip , holding my hand while I caressed his hair. He drooled on my pants and he was so embarrassed haha so sweet.\n\nAnd then.... Once we arrived and left the bus, he just asked me if I could get a bus to my place from where we were. Plain and cold. I said yeah , so he just turned around and said see ya then! No kiss, no hug, nothing. I called him out on it, he turned around, gave me a small peck kiss and then went away. \n\nI was just in awe about how he could just shift from being so sweet to basically abandoning me there like as I was some stranger. \n\nI think thats what really bothers me. We shared some good moments, and I opened up about my feelings for him. I told him that maybe we couldn't be good as a couple because neither one of us is willing to settle down, but that I did want him in my life as a friend as I admired him too much. And he agreed! But the way he left me there just made me feel like he never really cared. \n\nAnd I am here now as a 36 yo woman crying like a teenager because I feel I lost someone I was really starting to care about. \n\nI know I can't get his heart , I'm not special, I'm not as pretty , and I am old, so I don't even entertain the idea of him ever falling for me, and I know, I knew since we started this whole thing to prevent myself from getting hurt.  but I did want to be able to maybe go out with him for coffee and talk about art for years. I wanted a friendship. \n\nI'm so confused. \n\nI guess I just wanted to write about it and get it off my chest so that it doesn't eat me anymore.  I don't want to, and I also can't tell my friends because he is kind of famous in our circles (and one of my best friends told me he was a major player so I should stay away from him), and I'm kind of embarrassed of how it played out. \n\nI miss him. I messaged him a few hours after I got home back from our trip, he just put a heart react on my message and that was it. I don't think I can push it anymore, I should wait for him to write me, and I'm dying thinking he might never write again. Ah well, I ended up being hurt despite all my efforts not to. \n\nThanks for reading. If you have any advice about how to handle this,  it would be highly appreciated. ",

        "selftext": "\n\nWhat is the actual contribution of entertainers and influencers to society?\n\nGrowing up, I always thought about what my contribution to society would be. I believed that a meaningful life should involve helping others in a tangible way—whether it’s building bridges, being a doctor who treats patients, a teacher who educates, or even a wedding planner who helps people organize one of the most important days of their lives. Even a makeup artist contributes by helping people feel comfortable in their own skin through skillful techniques.\n\nBut when I look at idols, entertainers, and influencers, I can’t help but wonder: What is their actual purpose beyond surface-level happiness? Sure, they make people feel entertained, maybe even inspired, but does that really compare to professions that create real change?\n\nAnd yet, these are the people society worships the most. They get millions, live in luxury, and are treated like they’ve accomplished something great—while doctors, engineers, teachers, and everyday workers struggle for recognition or financial stability. It feels unfair that popularity is more valuable than actual contribution.\n\nI know entertainment is a part of life, and I’m not saying it’s useless. But on a deeper level, I wonder… what even is their life purpose? If your whole job is just singing, dancing, or making videos, what’s the end goal? It’s not like they’re solving world problems, creating lasting change, or advancing society.\n\nDoes anyone else ever think about this? Or am I just overanalyzing it?\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "tldr - got a call from a hospital stating that my grandma is in a catatonic state and is using the bathroom on herself in jail.\n\nMy (19F) grandma (58F) is severely mentally unstable. She can’t hold a job due to her mental issues she is bipolar and i suspect maybe she might have schizophrenia. I noticed within the past year that she was going down a mental decline. In september things blew up. I get a call one day from her and she started yelling and screaming that somebody put a bomb in the trucks gas tank. She told me to take everyone’s names to which i did so she would calm down. i was not taking her seriously because this has happened before just not to this extent. She immediately starts screaming “Do you want me to die???” So i took names. Which was consisted of people that didnt like her.\n\nHer roommate who she does not get along with was pounding on the door and the cops were circling around her windows according to her. she ended up taking her barricade down that she had up and went to the hospital. She gets out the hospital and proceeds to go back to the hospital 3 days after getting released. Her roommate told us he got an eviction notice for her (it’s his house). My mom (35F) tried to cool the situation down and we didn’t hear about it again. Okay, then she gets out a second time. She goes back to her house, she calls me for a couple days and then its radio silent. Time passed and we went to see her and her roommate tells us she went to jail. Okay wtf happened. She dumped his urine containers for the hospital on him and broke a window. \n\nNovember passes by. I haven’t gotten a call from jail. I go put money on her card. Still nothing. I contacted the police multiple times to get in contact with her. “You gotta call this department” “We will tell an officer” Well fuck you because its been weeks and i haven’t heard jack shit. One day in mid december i get a call. The jail transferred her to the hospital so now she is going to the psych ward. She takes the phone and we started talking and she told me that people died and how they died in jail and how the jail straight jacked her. Sent her to a psych ward. She calls me everyday and cries and screams at me to get her out and that they discharged her. She spends her birthday in jail and I wasnt allowed to see her. She gets out on new years eve. My mom and I know she is getting evicted but we don’t know if she knows yet. I barely know whats going on. We go back to her house.\n\nThey greet each other and i catch their conversation and he tells her to get her stuff out. We take her back to our house. I give her my room and i stay by my boyfriends house. She stayed in bed for 3 days. Just sleeping. She ends up getting in contact with another one of her old roommates and he said she can stay with him. My grandma had gotten an injury 2 years ago and won a case for it, and was waiting to get her money. I have no idea how legal stuff and money work. She stays by friend for a couple days and then her roommate called me and told me she went to jail. This was 2 in the morning. She got out December 31st and went back to jail January 5th. I look up her charges and she had 4 counts of breaking a restraining order and unauthorized entry of a dwelling. Bond at $19,000. February passes. We have not heard anything and we got mail from her lawyer. We learn she was carrying $1,000 when she went to jail. \n\nI just now get a call from another hospital. Nurse says she is discharged. Huh?? I call my mom and she doesnt want to go get her, same case with my uncle. And im trying to figure out what to do when the nurse calls again and proceeds to tell me there was a miscommunication between nurse and officer. Grandma was going back to jail. “Why did they bring her back” I asked. Nurse said she had an ankle monitor on and the officers left her. But turns out they came back for her. Wtf!!? “Well, may I ask why she’s there?” The nurse tells me everything came out negative and that she didn’t have paralysis or anything. Yeah well turns out my grandma has been in a catatonic state and was using the bathroom on herself. Nurse said it’s not physical it’s psychiatric. They took her back to jail Nobody seems to care. My mom is fed up with her and my uncle doesn’t do a damn for her. Im so upset. What do I do? They changed her medicine and she broke. She isn’t moving. She is using it on herself. What do I do?? What can I do? Im sorry for making such a long post and that everything is everywhere. Im so stressed. Is there a way to get in contact with her? Her lawyers? What do I even do.\n",

I found the confession sub tonight but the rules didn’t seem right for this, but I kinda felt like talking about it. \n\nI have never talked about this once in my life. Ever. This is so weird. \n\nWhen I was 7 my 12-year old cousin asked if I wanted to practice kissing while my dad had put us down for a nap. (My dad putting us down for a nap at that age is also weird to me now as an adult but anyway, that’s what happened)\n\nWell basically what happened was it went a bit further but the way I remember it is her shutting me down after I was cool with it after. I don’t want to get too into the details. \n\nIt’s one of those things where I have never been upset with her about it at all. In my mind we were both children. Even as an adult, I wonder… what happened to her? But I think I’ve also never really seen it as abuse or whatever. Is there a way to reconcile it without demonize the perpetrator? Because I don’t think she deserves that. \n\nI should probably saying this to a therapist and not Reddit but it’s kind of one of those things I tend to feel like it out of my mind but obviously it’s probably not. \n\nAnyway. I’m honestly nervous posting something so vulnerable on the internet but it’s a throwaway and I can delete so. But. I’ve never said this to a single soul. ",

Just wanted to make some sense of the night. \n\nThe chances of it happening is just so little since he doesn’t even live close to that neighborhood and it’s not close to mine either. Somehow I ended up seeing him with another girl. \n\nImmediately made me remember the last time we spent time together. To paint the picture, he kept rationalizing being not ready for monogamy with me. A lil context - he already talked about him only being/wanting to be in monogamy. He admitted to me that he was seeing other people while he was with me (context: we saw each other every other day-ish). Lastly, after trying to rationalize, he started talking about all things that his ex did to him that hurt him for an hour. \n\nDuring that bit I didn’t say a word and I just had my eyes down low, listening. He didn’t even caring if I’m feeling anything in that moment. Not even checking in on me. Rambling about all details of why he called off the wedding for an hour. Which just reflects how unhealed he was. \n\nHe got up to use the washroom and mentioning returning and before he came back, my Uber was booked and already waiting for me.\n\nI chose myself.\n\nA bit more context - I’m not trying to paint him as the bad guy, he was nice to me but people can be flawed and unhealed. He was the one to start talking about future/plans/trips and we even started doing exercise together. He proudly showed me to his family and also was the one mentioning proudly that he’s dating me \n\nI admit though I’m happy for him to be going to dates, I felt a bit sad. Part of the sadness is some dysphoria. Seeing him with a cis girl made me feel gender dysphoria, I felt like I’m not as feminine as cis girls (which is partly true). Even thought that he must have left me because I’m trans - could be the truth but with a very little possibility, he’s bi. \n\nThe past bunch of months, I have been thinking about it enjoying the happy return to singlehood and having nothing to do with dating.\n\n I’m choosing peace of singlehood and enjoying company of the ones I love, giving them more time 🤍 ",

        "selftext": "This started years ago now and I’ve pretty much let it go, but I never talked about it fully with people (out of trying to not pull people into it) when it was happening so here goes. Warning-It’s long lol \n\nI met this friend through another friend, and we quickly became close. We ended up working together as well (for my parents, another area of my life I needed to have boundaries but I was 19 and thought it would be fine), would hang out after work… we called each other “twin” because we had a lot in common. We got hired for a creative project together as we were both into photography. We worked on personal creative projects together… we were together CONSTANTLY. \n\nWe were teenagers, and as teenage girls often are, we were constantly talking about different guys we were interested in, and I found out she was interested in my brother. They went on a date and my brother very quickly realized they were not compatible. This is where I can pinpoint a change in our friendship. \n\nShe stopped asking me to hang out. I would ask her to hang out and she would be busy. She would constantly hang out with our mutual friends. At the time, I thought reaching out and asking if I had done anything wrong to warrant not being invited places I had previously been invited to was the right choice, and got told “don’t worry about it, everything is good.” I was getting married at the time and had already asked her to be my maid of honor, so I assumed that maybe it was a rough patch, I was stressed, etc. (tip: don’t assume everything is fine, she’s in all my wedding photos now lol)\n\nThe REAL switch to trying to ruin my life was after I got married. I have been photographing for years, and decided to try to pursue it as a business as my parent’s business had closed. She HATED that because she did photography too, and suddenly any similarities we had were me “copying her”. I posted a story on IG about prices, she posted “the original is always better than the copy.” One of her friends (that I didn’t know was her friend at the time) modeled for me, and she posted that “people always try to undercut your business.” At one point, I posted something (I don’t even remember what it was at this point) and she posted within 5 minutes and said “Okay, she’s obviously copying me right?”\n\nNow, full transparency- I did not handle this well. I tried to talk it out with her, tried everything I knew, and she would smile to my face and tell me everything was okay and then continue to do this. I found myself looking at her posts constantly because she would never say what I had done to hurt her to my face but would post consistently, so I felt like at least I could try to piece together what had gone wrong (and also, if she felt I had been copying her, I wanted to make sure I didn’t post anything similar to her because I genuinely just wanted it to stop.) We talked a couple times, tried to make amends, but she still would post about me often. \n\nA couple years later, I did a photoshoot with another photographer modeling for me for a concept around a pregnancy loss. I have chronic health issues and so does this photographer, and I decided to center it around healing. It was a beautiful project. The DAY I posted about it, she posted a video on TikTok that said “if you want to be me just say that.” I didn’t follow her, but with her being a contact in my phone sometimes her videos would still pop up. That was it. After all the posts and all the years of just dealing with it, I was done. She had tried to isolate me from members of my husband’s family, she had deleted texts and then posted screenshots of our “conversations” and I had just turned the other cheek… but if she could somehow take a photoshoot about MY pregnancy loss and make it about her, I was done. I blocked her on everything. And then I started seeing friends of hers looking at my posts, so I blocked several of them as well. \n\nI’m 28 now and have a wonderful life with my husband and our son. I do photography part time now so I can stay home and take care of him. I have talked to her once since, and I asked her why she did all of that. She told me that it was because she had a hard time with her dynamic with my brother and my family after working for my parents. I asked her specifically what I did, and all she said was that I was “clingy and she wanted other friends”. I personally have let a lot of it go, but there’s always little reminders of it because our circles are so intertwined and tonight I feel like it’s okay to talk about to strangers on the internet because I never said anything to anyone else when it was happening except for my husband and a few friends, never did anything about it and just prayed she would stop. \n\nSo there’s that. Just a big ol’ “get it off my chest”. The biggest thing I learned from it is friends that aren’t willing to talk through it are not friends I want to have, and that sometimes you just need to block and walk. ",

I live with my parents while I go to college full-time and work part time.\n\nMe and my dad have a great relationship while my mom is strained to say the lest, my mom is still treating like a child and getting severely angry when I do anything adult like. A few days ago me and my (22 m) boyfriend (of 2 months) went on a date and on the way back to my place, we had to pull over on the side of the road because a few cows escaping.\n\nAs we wait in the car, we just sat there talking and my mom sent me a text asking when I'm getting home and not even 5 minutes before I could answer her, she called me and spoke in a angry tone asking why I haven't moved from that spot (I forgot I gave her my GPS tracking).\n\n I told her what happened and she got even more angry and pretty much demanded me to come home. The next morning as I was getting ready to leave I tried speaking to my mom and she just gave me the cold shoulder and the silence treatment (something she does all the time when she's upset at me or siblings and thinks it gets us to feel bad), my dad told me she thinks me and my boyfriend we're doing \"things\" and doesn't believe a thing I say because I'm turning into my sister (my sister is no contact with her).\n\nMy mom is still really not talking to me because I'm not giving in, my boyfriend is inviting me to live with him but I dont know if I'm being to butt hurt or not.\n\nI'm sorry for the long post.",

Within two years she was dead. She'd been diagnosed with terminal cancer, didn't tell me and left because she didn't want me to deal with that, I found out from mutual friends years later after the funeral.\n\nIt hurt, confusing and I got real cynical about life. Relationships. All that. It was bad for a while, but I worked thru it.\n\nSince then I've been mostly single. Sort of a loner. Dated,  nothing serious. Closed myself off, from friends too. Life moves forward. Career takes off. My job requires a lot of moving. \n\nEnter my lesbian friend, who is honestly funny and so good hearted that it's made the craziness of the world bearable. I'm a male. We became quick friends both being new and looking for things to do.\n\nShe's refilled my faith in humanity. She's got hobbies, independent ideas and cares about people she doesn't know. She has sympathy for people that hate her. She's willing to be the butt of the joke and then dish it out.\n\nI want to make clear that this isn't about a secret love or desire to date her to get over my ex fiancé. She's just a good person and friend. I just like her. She's helped me realize how much I've shut myself off from the world.\n\nAnd she's reminded me of why it's so important to have connections and friends.\n\nShe's a bit of an introvert, and I'm too so we've been helping each other with that. Feels good, which I need in the world today.\n\nShe has a girl she's trying to get the courage to ask out. I'm trying to convince her to do it, like my friends did with my ex-fiancé a long time ago. She deserves a shot at happiness.\n\nBut I wouldn't have thought that for myself six months ago. This excellent lesbian friend has helped me rediscover the part of me that loves human connection. And it means so much.\n\nSince our friendship started, I feel the first genuine desire in years to try snd do things and date. To make friends and connect with others. To be part of the world, deeply and meaningfully.\n\nI'm so thankful to her for being just such an awesome friend, by just being herself, she's helped me in so many ways she'll never know.\n\nI think my ex-fiancé would've liked her a lot.\n\nAnd I hope all of you will have the chance to have a really great lesbian friend who will help give you faith in humanity too.\n\nWe need that.",

        "selftext": "I'm not sure where to post this, but I really need advice, that's why I made an account just fot this, because I'm starting to question my sanity. \n\nI recently started living alone in my first apartment. I'm extremely careful, I always lock the doors and windows at night, and I don't have any pets. I used to have occasional bouts of sleep paralysis during a stressful phase, but they were relatively \"harmless\" dark figures just staring at me, hearing weird noises etc.. But since I've lived here, it's different. \n\nNow I wake up several times a week in the middle of the night, completely paralyzed. I can only move my eyes, hear and feel. And every time I see this big, dark shadowy figure in my room. But it doesn't just stand in the corner. It slowly comes towards me. It pulls my blanket away, then my pants - and then it starts touching me in a way that feels far too real. \n\nIt starts touching me with its mouth.  It licks me, sucks me, as if it is completely obsessed with my vagina. And the most disturbing thing is: I feel EVERYTHING. Every detail. Much more intensely than any real, human contact I have ever had. It brings me to orgasm over and over until the sensations are so overwhelming that I pass out. And when I wake up in the morning, my blanket is actually at the foot of the bed or on the floor, my pants exactly where \"it\" threw them. \n\nFor the ones who wants to imagine it, the figure is black, shadowy, with glowing white eyes but sometimes they look red, and it is very large. It has a somewhat human shape, but also somehow not. There is a dark aura around it, like black smoke. The hands are very large, and the fingers are extremely long. The only thing I remember is that in one of my earlier sleep paralyses, years ago, I saw these hands or very similar looking hands, trying to grab me. But I was able to free myself from the paralysis in time, bec my sister suddenly came in my room and turned the lights on. Its mouth is not visible, but when it begins with the act, I can make out the outline of the mouth, and it has a very long tongue. You can then imagine where the tongue goes. It doesnt say anything or even talk to me.\n\nI know it might feel like a particularly realistic sleep paralysis, but how can things be moving in my room? I'm scared. It happens almost every night, and although it doesn't hurt, the thought that \"it\" might do more at some point scares me. What if it's not just a hallucination? \n\nAnd before anyone asks: No, I'm not desperate or lonely. I'm single right now, but I'm happy with it.  I don't miss anyone, feel \"untouched\" or crave closeness. I've had relationships in the past, but right now I'm enjoying my own life, so I understand even less why this is happening. But my biggest concern is that, deep down, I'm starting to enjoy it. There are moments when I catch myself thinking: Don't stop. Keep going. And that terrifies me even more. \n\nI have a disturbing theory: What if it isn't just a sleep paralysis? I know its not a dream, bec I'm fully awake, I'm just unable to move or make a sound. What if it is some kind of entity or demon that possessed me? I know how crazy this sounds, but if you were in my shoes… would you really rule it out? \n\nI feel like I can't talk to anyone about this. It's so humiliating, and the worst part is… what if it keeps coming to me every night until the day I die, bec I don’t do anything about it? I'm desperate and conflicted because, as terrifying as it is, it also feels good. And I'm starting to crave it.  I don’t think a real man could ever satisfy me again like this. \n\nI've tried to relax before sleep and I don't have any stress in life at the moment, but it still visits me almost every night. And like i said, I'm extremely embarrassed to talk to other people in real life because I've started to enjoy it and I don't have any money for fancy therapies. What if this continues for years? I feel everything and when I wake up in the morning my intimate area feels a bit numb and tingly as if someone had been fiddling with it, so it's not fake, it's really happening to me. I almost always pass out from all the orgasms. Being satisfied so intensely every night can be dangerous, right? Idk.\n\nHave any of you ever experienced something like this? Am I just crazy or is something going on here that I can’t explain?",

        "selftext": "I (19M) hate women approaching me. Throughout my life, I was considered to be “ugly”. I was told by multiple people and girls would treat me like dirt and constantly remind me I’m ugly throughout my life. Over the past 2 years, I made a decision after being insulted brutally on a “friend” app called Wizz (more like a dating app). I was really skinny and hence I decided to eat more and bulk up to gain some muscle mass as well as starting skincare and hopping on minoxidil for better hair quality for my facial hair, scalp hair and eyebrows too along with multiple other changes. Anyway, these 2 years increased my looks considerably to the point where I almost looked like a different human being. During this however my self esteem was still incredibly low. For the past few months, I noticed a girl that was constantly staring at me and I first thought oh she must think I’m ugly hence she’s staring. Later on she started laughing with her friend group while looking at me so I thought wow she must think I’m extremely ugly. This was not new to me. More recently, she added me over Snapchat which she got from a friend of mine as I’ve found out recently and she had a little conversation with me (I’ll call her J). J sent a snap of herself and told me she had seen me around and that she really liked me. This however triggered me and I remembered the treatment I had received up until now, especially the treatment on Wizz. In that moment, I snapped and insulted the mole on her cheek as well as her forehead and told her I’d have to be blind or in a coma for her to ever have a chance with me. This was quite recent. More recently, I’ve had a female cashier give me a discount on some shopping I was doing to make a milk cake because I’m “handsome”. It honestly disgusted me and I genuinely just left the shop without any of the ingredients. It hasn’t been long since I’ve become apparently “attractive” and I’m getting a whole lot more attention from girls and I hate it. Fuck these girls. They treated me like shit for all these years when I was ugly and now they think they have a chance when I’m “attractive”. Makes me want to punch them all in the face. I notice a lot of little changes in my daily interactions even with my family. It’s revolting. ",

        "selftext": "For complete transparency I wrote this out first on wordpad (can post the original if requested) but since my grammar and wording is never great (learning disability) I ran it thru a AI grammar editor. The message and feelings are still mine as I re-read it to be 100% sure. Just thought you all should no.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI’m writing this because it’s been weighing on my mind for a long time. It keeps happening, and I can’t shake the feeling that I’m the common factor.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I’ve wanted to make a difference in someone’s life. In high school, I dreamed of becoming a teacher to help kids. At one point, I even considered becoming a doctor or a nurse to be there for people in their worst moments. But over the years, those dreams faded—because every time I’ve tried to help, things have ended the same way.\n\nIt seems like whenever someone needs emergency medical care and I step in to help, they don’t make it.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# The Moments That Haunt Me\n\nOne of the first times this happened, I was around 18-20 years old. I was walking home from Walmart when I heard a crash. Looking over, I saw a motorcycle had been t-boned by a car, and the driver was on the ground. Without thinking, I ran toward him, weaving through traffic. I took his hand and spoke to him, trying to keep him calm while others applied pressure to his wounds. He handed me his phone and asked me to call a family member to let them know he was going to the hospital. I did exactly that, then gave the phone back to him. Soon after, paramedics arrived and took him away. Later, I read that he had died from his injuries. At the time, I didn’t think much of it beyond the tragedy of the accident.\n\nA few years later, I was at home when my stepfather suddenly jumped up and said, “Call an ambulance.” We did, and while waiting, I ran upstairs to grab him a shirt as asked. I helped him put it on, talking to him, reassuring him that everything would be okay. The paramedics arrived and took him away. Shortly after, he went into heart failure and died.\n\nThen, a few years after that, I was living in an apartment building. One day, I glanced out the window out of boredom and saw my neighbors unloading groceries. Out of nowhere, the wife collapsed, and her husband barely caught her in time. I didn’t hesitate—I bolted out of my apartment without even locking the door, ran down the hallway, hit the elevator button, and after a few seconds of waiting, said, “Fuck it,” and took the stairs. I got to them as fast as I could. Her husband was on the phone with paramedics while I held her, trying to comfort her as he gathered her meds and health cards. The building superintendent came out, just standing there, saying, “She’s going to be okay.” Just being completely useless . It took the paramedics over 30 minutes to arrive. The moment I stepped back to let them work, they had to use a defibrillator— there heart had stopped. She didn’t make it.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# The Fear That Lingers\n\nThese are just a few of the moments that have left me feeling this way. I may add more as I remember them. But because of them, I feel like I can’t help people—because when I do, it only seems to end badly. I honestly have never had someone survive going to the hospital after I 'help'.\n\nIt’s been about three years since I last experienced something like this, and I hope I never do again. But I’m scared that if it happens again, I’ll freeze up. That fear eats at me—the fear that I won’t be able to help, that I’ll hesitate, that I’ll fail someone when they need me most.\n\nI’m shaking as I write this, scared of being judged, of being called a coward. But I needed to get this off my chest because it’s been haunting me for far too long. I am shaking trying to hit the post button",

        "selftext": "Warning: slightly sexually explicit. Probably NSFW.\n\nI don't really know how to say any of this but I know I need to write it somewhere. I'll probably delete this at some point after. \n\nI'm 27M and I'm a \"rent man\". Another term for what I do, is \"male escort\". But I live in a small, sleepy town, and we just don't call ourselves escorts.\n\nI decided to get into this because I needed some money to help me finish my degree. I'm also in good shape so I thought it would be an easy side hustle. I didn't/ don't have a partner and I haven't been interested in dating.\n\nBusiness is generally very slow. When I first started, I only had 1 client who I would visit every week. After that, she moved away and I had two more clients that I would see periodically. It was always a very clinical and mechanical experience (Get in, do what needs to be done, get out). \n\nThings were quiet for about a year and a half. I wasn't really providing services anymore. But a few months ago, I got a message on my profile from a lady who was interested in my services. She was just reaching out, asking how it works.\n\nWe spoke for a bit and we decided to meet up. My services are customisable and she selected a variation of the \"boyfriend experience\". \n\nI went to her house and I was... Surprised? She had a really nice place. In a rich neighbourhood. I'm sure this might not be out of the ordinary for other male escorts but my previous clients weren't situated in rich neighbourhoods. I didn't grow up rich. \n\nShe was very welcoming. She was a few years older than me. She seemed to have a successful career. We sat in the living room and just talked. She told me that she's had sex for her whole adult life, and she's enjoyed it for the most part. But she's had some kind of sexual awakening recently and she's looking for someone to explore this with. She said she doesn't even care if we didn't have sex that night. She wanted to talk to make sure that we would be a good fit for what she had in mind, and if I was okay with it. That was also a first for me. My previous clients didn't really care what I was okay with. \n\nAnyway. Lots has happened since then. I see her maybe once every two weeks. And it's always an incredible experience. I can't explain it. Sometimes we have sex. Sometimes we dont. Sometimes we eat pizza and watch movies, sometimes we drink and have sex. It's so passionate. Sometimes it's primal. Sometimes it's lazy and intense. It's not the mechanical sex that I'm used to. She truly turns me on. She likes it when I'm satisfied. \n\nSometimes we just talk and nothing else. I've opened up to her about my life. She pays me every time. I've even started insisting that she doesn't need to. But she believes in me and my future and wants to support me in finishing my degree. \n\nThe problem is, I no longer see this as a professional relationship. I really like her. And she seems to really care about me, as a person.  We know so much about each other but I feel so weird to say that we're friends... She pays me for my time so are we really friends? \n\nAnd sometimes I let my mind wander... What if we were more?\n\nShe's quite an incredible woman. And we've had many deep conversations. She's been through a lot. \n\nOne of the topics that came up was her previous relationships. Because I was wondering why she would approach a service, instead of exploring this with perhaps, a romantic partner? And I guess, long story short, she was in a relationship with a man who absolutely destroyed her. She no longer trusts people enough to share her life with. \n\nShe wants to be alone. Forever. But she desperately wants to explore her sexual side. I guess that's where I come in. \n\nBy the way. I know who this man is. It's a small town. F*ck you for what you did. You had such a great woman. What's wrong with you?\n\nI haven't heard from her in a while. And I desperately want to reach out to her. I'm trying not to lose myself in this situation. I keep telling myself, she's just my client and nothing more. This is just me doing my job. But I know that I feel a certain way. Unfortunately, I don't think she'll ever see me as anything more. ",

It's most likely my fault given that I: A) have talked to them about it already, B) Am somewhat aware that I probably sucked at some point in time (that I don't entirely remember) .\n\n\nIt started around 3-4 months ago when all my friends made plans to hangout together out of town, a few don't show up because of curfew, although they didnt make any real attempt to meet with any of us or let us know where they were until leaving to go home. \n\nThey argued they told us about curfew beforehand, we mentioned how we deliberately shifted the schedule up by a few hours to accommodate that, they then said we didn't even agree on a meeting place (we did), they apologize and swear it won't happen again. \n\n\nAfter this, I was upset for quite a while with one of them (whom I was closer to) and gave them the cold shoulder for a while. We don't talk for ages since I don't speak much with others in lessons and they kept wandering off with my other friend. Meanwhile another one of my friends who organised the hangout trip is slowly losing patience with friend A and B because they keep ditching her when leaving to buy lunch which also kinda ticks me off because Its getting hard not to see a pattern forming\n\n Distance grows, I dont do much about it since I attributed it to something else entirely and wanted to give them space (this is around 2 months back). We still don't talk properly. They ghost me starting from around a month ago and don't talk to me in person or respond to my texts. \n\nEventually I ask to meet up and talk about it and they agree. When asking them, they say the reason why is that I don't really talk to them, kept moving away whenever they sat near, compared their skills to another person's even though they're the same grade, made snide comments, people who're friends with me aren't nice to them etc.\n\nI don't remember a ton of this and while some of it is probably coincidence (moving away from them), there's a solid chance that some of it IS stuff I've done. I can be pretty horrible sometimes, especially when I'm not doing so well mentally and I'm so angry with myself that I crashed a friendship with someone I cared about over crap communication and my own assholery. I wish I could say that I atleast know where I went wrong, but I *can't* since I don't remember the whole bloody thing happening. Another of my friends has distanced themselves from my current group to join another group with this person and I can't tell whether they actually want to remain friends with me, or if it's just because they can't bring themselves to stop talking with me entirely. There's also the chance that their negative impression of me is creating a negative impression of everyone associated with me AND that I'm 90% sure their new friends keep talking shit about me since they all go quiet whenever I get too close (although there could be any random thing they're talking about). To top this all off, I'm not even sure if my own friends enjoy my presence and I feel myself drifting from them (although this part is probably in my head and a reflection of current circumstances)\n\nTLDR: I hate myself, my friend hates me, their new friends hate me, I can't tell if another friend hates me and my current friends might hate me.

I had yo write several suicide letters for them to agree.\n\nThe second therapist paid attention and had me sign No Suicide contracts and one psychiatrist attempted to talk to me telling me to think of how other people would feel after a final diagnosis of MDD. I tried to keep busy with extra courses after graduating and looking for jobs. I even tried spirituality and manifesting to get my mind to a better position.\n\nI have no interest in anything. I don't want to do anything. I have no job, no money, no friends, no one to talk to. I was a foodie and now I eat because it has been a routine. Music is just filling a void when it gave dopamine. Colours are turning to black and white. I have slowly turned into a shell of a human being. I don't know if I want help any more. I don't even know what I want.\n\nI can't make attempts anymore. I fear could get arrested if it failed, or be called an attention seeker or worse, watch my younger siblings suffer for my sake. If I did it when I had the chance I wouldn't be here being a burden.",

        "selftext": "Yup you read the title.\n\nSo my birthday was a little while ago, it was my 20th and honestly I was pretty damn depressed for it. Didn't have a lot of friends to celebrate with and was basically alone, and it felt(still feels) really weird not being a 'kid' anymore. \n\nI decided to treat myself to a beach day, both to go romp around and also cause I needed some driftwood for an aquarium I was setting up. I have no car though, so had to take the bus to get up which had a very inconvenient schedule. \n\nSo I got to the beach, found some sticks and got so distracted that I unfortunately missed the bus pick up. \n\nNow there was another bus coming in a couple hours, and I could always call a ride too if needed. So I decided that, now that I was here for at least a couple hours, I might as well do some more exploring. This particular beach stretched for 3 miles north up to another beach, where on the other side there was a small resturant. I was pretty hungry at this point, so thought it'd be fun to walk up there and catch  bus later that evening at that spot instead. \n\nSo I cruised up the beach, and got some really great views of the clouds and sinking sun along the way. I eventually got to the cutoff to where the other beach started; however, while the map only portrayed a small stream separating them, by now the ride had come in and that tiny stream was basically a river. \n\nAfter scouring the area for a bridge or easier way across, I stupidly chose to wade through a shallower point, which worked and I made it to the other side of the beach, soggy but triumphant. I had no change of clothes in my pack. \n\nSo after drying off a tiny bit I walked up to the resturant, and when I got inside I realized this wasn't just some little beach shack, it was a full on fancy ass resturant. My belly was roaring though, so I decided to give it a try. \n\n I asked for outdoor seating for obvious reasons, and was really surprised to see them setting the table with fancy cloths and a bunch of different forks and silverware and shit. I ordered crabcakes and some jumbo shrimp which were the cheapest things there, but combined still cost a whopping $70. They eventually bring out two tiny, barely palm sized, pencil-thin crab patties and 5 individual finger length shrimp, both elaborately decorated in the middle of these giant white plates. For the cost of it all I was half convinced I'd be able to keep the plates too. \n\nI kept getting odd looks from the other diners, who were almost all either in pairs or groups. I was the only lone person there. Not to mention still pretty soggy, dressed like a casual vagabond and with my backpack as my only companion in the opposite chair. Yeah, I stuck out like a giddamned giraffe in a horse ranch. \n\nEventually I finished up and caught the bus back home, where I promptly went to sleep. \n\nHappy 20th birthday bud, there's $70 bucks you ain't getting back and an experience you'll cherish for all the wrong reasons. \n\n",

        "selftext": "I’m 23 years old and I work in Mental Health. My life is mental health. I don’t leave the house often, I am on anti-depressants and I work way too much. Life has actually gotten way better recently. From not knowing what I want to do with my life to being so close to going to a world renowned university to train in to become a Nurse in two specialities. I’m finally getting where I need to be. I’m finally getting sleep, I leave the house a little bit more and I am well liked at work and seen as an asset. My anti depressants have solved a life long period of uncontrollable lows and self-neglect yet I am not fully there where I can begin improving myself.\n\nI’m still obese, I’m still balding and I’m still ugly objectively. But I’m proud of myself I am on cusp of greatness and yet at night I still question what I’m even doing this for, yeah my ego is now bloated but my family are no longer In this swirl of poverty, I will not be able to lift them out of it. My brother and sister are in good places in life and my mother is no longer struggling. There are times I find myself truly at peace. \n\nBut there is this deep loneliness within me. It’s a weakness, I can’t help it and it’s selfish but I want someone to love, and to love me. I can’t help it I thought losing weight might help which it didn’t, neither didn’t overwhelming myself with hobbies and spending time with friends and family. I think truly after so many years I can’t ignore my minds call to want someone to not just see me as a good friend. I want to be more than just needed. I’m needed at work I’m great at what I do but that is. I thing on the feeling of truly being wanted, laying upon eyes of someone who sees you for who you really are. I want someone to share little secrets with, to spend time with and devote myself to.\n\nI want to leave work one day knowing that I’m not just coming to an empty house. It’s so selfish to think I’m entitled this but why not me? Is my personality screwed, it’s my looks, my mannerisms? I get along fine with everyone I’m really social at work and even outside of work barring my current situation but that for another reason.\n\nDo I just reek desperation? Am I unlovable? The answer is no I was loved once maybe even two more times but those relationships could not hold it bring questions to my head once more.\n\nI’m going work my ass off it’s just what I do. I’ll spend my life helping others and caring for the vulnerable, being the person I wish I had in my life when I struggled. But at the end of the day I just don’t know what I’m doing this for? The further my career goes forward I am scared that I’ll become the guy who says I’m married to work when I damn well know I want a family. \n\nEitherway I wish something changes soon. I don’t want to be alone forever. \n\n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "Good morning yall! A couple days ago I made a post at 3 in the morning to confess to doing my roommates dishes because I secretly love to watch her do a happy dance when she sees her favorite mug is clean for her to use again. That post changed our lives and I'm only being a little dramatic by saying that.\n\nI gotta say thanks to everyone who upvoted and commented on my original post, I'm still shook at just how many people read about me and my mug happy best friend. The amount of people saying my post made them smile or reminded them of their own friendships or significant others has kept me smiling for days. I'm kind of into making people happy, if that wasnt already obvious, so the fact that so many people had even a moment of positivity because of me has been awesome.\n\nWhen I made that original post it was because I just wanted to tell someone about the mug dancing but I knew Gwen wouldn't like it if I told anyone we knew so I came to reddit to shout to the void and oh boy, did the void shout back. There were so many comments asking if I really thought we were just friends, and I'll be honest when I made that post we absolutely were just friends. We had never talked about being more than friends and I was happy being friends because we have an amazing friendship. I hadn't really thought about there being a possibility for more because dating was always something I planned to do when I had my life together or when I had more money. I never let myself consider what I was missing out on by waiting for the \"right time.\" Her finding my post opened up the chance for Gwen and I to talk about things that we hadn't before and over breakfast that morning we found where we stood with each other and what we thought things could look like moving forward depending on what we both agreed was the best course. We didn't make any solid plans or decisions and didn't want to rush into something that would ruin the good we already had going for us, but I'll admit I was hoping for a specific outcome.\n\nThere was one comment on that first post that had really caught my attention. To paraphrase, they told me to think about how I would feel if someone else got to see Gwen do her happy mug dance instead of me and it hit me so hard. I didn't mind the idea of someone else seeing her so happy. I just dont know if anyone she dates would notice what I did and decide to do what I did. What if they didn't care or didn't think it was that important or any of the other things I do to make her laugh or smile. I really didn't like the thought of not being there to make sure she has that extra reason to smile in the morning. (Gwen wants me to admit that I'm a sappy moron because I teared up writing this. Im a sensitive man in touch with my emotions and you know you love it so shut it you 😝.)\n\nTo all the people saying it's possible for platonic relationships to be like ours you are absolutely correct. Our friend group is very open with physical and verbal affection and we help each other all time with big and small things. We all say I love you to each other, it's just normal communication for us as a group, not just between Gwen and I. Honestly, if I hadn't made my original post I'm not sure when or if we would have gotten to the point we are now. Maybe we would have continued as we were and that would have been just as happy of an outcome, just a different one, like a choose your own adventure with multiple options for a good resolution.\n\nWhich brings me to the actual update. Gwen and I agreed we want to try dating. We aren't putting a new label on our relationship yet, but our first date is next week. I'm making it all a surprise. Gwen helped write this post and will be reading the comments so I can't give any details, but it's going to be the best first date she has ever been on, or I'll eat my candy corn patterned socks. I think she might be the one for me and I'm going to take every chance I can to make sure she thinks the same about me.\n\nYall are the best and we love you. Do something kind for your loved ones for us and everyone can and should find something to happy dance about, it makes life more fun.\n\nLove Gwen and Peter 🩷🕸",

I felt we had a positive and productive conversation, but it all started because she got mad that I washed the rice for a certain dish.\n\nShe's also recently got upset with me over a project she asked me to tackle, just assembling a lamp we bought at the store. I made the mistake of trying to screw in a screw that had a defect and got stuck. She wasn't screaming or anything, but she was upset that I tried to use it anyway. I got it out and replaced it and the lamp turned out well.\n\nShe has childhood trauma to do with strict parents who would severely punish her if she didn't do things the exact way they wanted and so I think she gets stressed when something isn't going to plan.\n\nI feel like an idiot when these sort of things happen. They're such simple mistakes, easily avoided and yet I make them.\n\nShe's also been stressed with her kitten that still needs to get spayed, she's been in heat alot and she yells at the cat when she won't be quiet. I think this isn't right and have tried gently mentioning that her cat is just doing what cats do and she needs to try and ignore her.\n\nI made a larger mistake the other day when I asked to try her THC vape. She said that beginners should always be in a safe place and try to relax. I asked in jest \"do I feel safe here?\" And she asked the same. I thought about it a bit and promptly got distracted by other thoughts. I have ADHD and sometimes this sort of thing happens. I'm still ashamed of it because when I realized I trailed off and said \"I do feel safe here\" She made a a comment stating \"That took a long time for you to figure out\" I didn't respond, I knew I got distracted and I started silently panicking thinking, \"I do feel safe here but nothing I say now will convince her. I wouldn't have tried the THC if I didn't, I wouldn't leave my knife at home if I didn't, I wouldn't be with her if I didn't\" but I gave some lame excuse about thinking too deeply about it and tried to laugh it off.\n\nI feel like an idiot. She makes me happy. She's important to me. I'm worried that her trauma will drive us apart. I don't know what to do to work through this.",

I realized that the behavior I had to endure was way more off the charts than I thought.   \nI am transgender (ftm) and autistic. In my old class was another autistic kid whose autism presented diffrently from mine. Funny enough I was always excluded and people didnt like me for being weird and missing out on social clues. But when I got diagnosed and received accommodations that was me getting favors and faking autism for attention. I know of some rumors that were spread about me but I have no clue how or who started those. Apperently I was a lesbian (never was) and some were convinced that I would get mad and loud when I get missgenderd. I dont know why anyone believed that since I did get missgendered quite often and literally only corrected the people with a hey sorry it is actually him or sth.   \nOne kid in particular seemed to have it out for and said some homphobic stuff though he only did it when I wasnt present (others snithed) or he thought I wouldnt hear him. He actually once ran up to me while carrying a knife. A joke. surrrreeee My class loved jokes. They would act as if they were jerking off in the back of the room or say something rather loudly etc when I held presentations. I always went to the teachers and asked for help. No one ever helped me. Some wanted to but had to catch them in the act which wasnt that easy and the other teachers didnt seem to care enough. Though every adult always reassured me that I would be fine and nothing would happen to me.   \nI wasnt the easiest kid to be around since I literally learned how to be nice in 10th grade and sucked a great deal before and during that learning. But I was always willing to reflect and talk about my misstakes. \n\nI am now in a much better place. Everyone respects me and I feel comfortable learning again. Though I am starting to feel angry that this extreme behaviuor was ever permitted and given space at that school. I love some of my teachers they were the kindest people I ever met and helped me greatly. Others not so much. Bullying really sucks and I needed to get this off my chest",

When she does, she immediately reciprocates my energy and the conversation returns to being wonderful.\n\nThis isn’t an attempt of mine to gripe, all things considered.

        "selftext": "I still wish he would come back, don't get me wrong... That hasn't disappeared just yet and I suspect it won't for a little bit.\n\n\nI started doing dance classes again and my first couple of classes were hard. I hadn't danced in awhile, and the emotions were still heavy. In fact, I went home and bawled in my roommates arms because I was just hit with memories of my favorite routine of chatting with you after class, and looking forward to being with you online when I got home. But the drive was hard, and not quiet since I had a comfort song blasting and me just yelling into the car how much I loved you and what an idiot you are to walk away.\n\n\nI had another class just yesterday and I felt incredibly good doing it since it was a familiar choreo. I smiled. I was proud of myself. I laughed with my friends. And when I got out, I felt angry...\n\n\nI was angry because I disliked how you made me feel hurt, unseen, invalidated,  and frightened during our breakup. Angry that you decided to give up. I'm not going to try to convince you to stay, so okay, I'll go. Especially since you'd do that explosive reaction again with the justification being you had no choice to in order to be heard. Ya know, my counselor said that's what people who do the abuse in abusive relationships say. \n\"If only she didn't do [trigger], then I wouldn't of [hit/screamed/throw/etc.] her.\" I know you're not abusive though. I know you're flawed and that response is something you can work on if you recognize it to be. I wanted to do that with you. I wanted to work me. On us. But no, you gave up and walked away.\n\n\nAnd although I know we had good times, I now notice a lot more things in our relationship that weren't that great. Things I wish a partner would do for me. The slow roll into complacency. How I feel fooled being charmed by you. That I tell you how I feel when I'm in some mood is not your responsibility to fix, and to please let me figure out how to make myself feel better and I'll tell you. But no, you make yourself take responsibility anyways and feel bad about yourself and frustrated at me when you can't \"solve it\" right away. What the hell?! Don't you listen?! And I tell you my love language is words of affirmation and I barely hear any compliments from you. I don't remember the last time you called me beautiful or cute. I don't ever remember you telling me you appreciate me unless I ASK or do it first by giving you all my words of praise. If you're proud of me or happy I'm yours. I said those things to you all the time! The random \"I Love You\"'s because I feel it in that moment. Things I brought up I'd like to do but it gets overlooked and forgotten, and then you get mad at me when I try to remind you, and more angry when I'm sad you don't remember. And how I see you were also not telling me things that made you irritated and let build up, but fault me for being the only one who does it.\n\n\nI also told you I'm scared you'd talk to me like you talk to your parents. You gave me that \"wtf\" face like you'd never. And yet there you were screaming at me, assaulting me with words trying to blame me and all your \"what about you?!\" arguments. Also how we agreed to disagree early on in a convo before our fight that giving someone the same energy they give you is a choice and can be potentially hazardous in a relationship. Especially during an argument. Communication is important, but what's the point when you assume your partner is intentionally attacking you when it's anything but?! I should've known better. I should've known when I saw those signs. \n\n\nYou're so frustrating. How did I deal with all that?!\nAnd you know what's more frustrating?! IT'S ALL SOLVABLE. They were things we could work on. Things we could put out onto the table, talk about our grievances, and set out a plan to address them. I think at one time I said maybe we should see a Couple's counselor to better understand  each other, but that was swept aside. \n\n\n\nI know I can be frustrating too. I know it do things that make you mad. But no one deserves to be treated the way you treat me during arguments. You once brought out something in me that made me hate myself in an argument. All because it was so heightened and just not healthy because I was trying to match your energy. I hated it. I dont like being so angry I'd say things I regret and would hate myself for later, along with the fact I'm sure it hurts you! Why would you want that dynamic?! Why are you okay with that?! It's unhealthy! How did it feel when I said I felt hurt, attacked, and frustrated like you but didn't want to scream or escalate things so I cried instead?! You probably thought I was pathetic...\n\n\nAnd so fine... Go find someone else who can match your energy without feeling shitty about themselves and about hurting you. Find someone who argues the same way you do and see how disrespectful, exhausting, and hurtful it is. Because that's not what I want. ",

        "selftext": "I’m not sure if this is the right sub, but i need an outlet to post this anonymously \n\n\n\nwhen i was 14, my brother passed away suddenly. he was born with HLHS -Hypoplastic left heart syndrome which is a rare congenital heart defect in which the left side of the heart is severely underdeveloped. He had many surgeries as a child, which i won’t get in to, but the important thing to note is that from the ages of 7-18 he was physically fine. sure, he sweat a lot, and slept more the most teens,  but nothing extreme. \n\nin February 2020 he got sick, his livers started failing, he would faint randomly, and when they got it checked out it turn out he was in heart failure. \nhowever, he started taking new meds and was seemingly improving.\n\none night at the beginning of March, he and my sister had a baking contest, and both made desserts. we tasted them and ranked them, his chocolate mousse won by a landslide. \ni had the grand idea of putting whipped cream on the back of my hand and hitting it into the air and the trying to catch it in my mouth. me and my siblings all tried it and my brother laughed so hard his face turned blue. it was a night filled of laughter and jokes. that’s the last time i saw him…alive. \n\nthe next morning both of my parents went out to work, which was unusual because my mother works from home and was my brothers primary caregiver, i stayed home from school for a reason i can’t remember now. \n\nat around 10am my father called me to check on my brother who wasn’t answering his phone, and to make sure he takes his meds. while still on the phone with my dad, i go to my brothers room, when i walk the smell hits me like a ton of bricks, but my father was rushing me, so I tiptoe over to his bed and i see him with his eyes rolled back and mouth slightly agape, i tried to shake him but his skin was cold and that’s what i noticed his arms were a deep shade bluish purple- i told my dad to call the EMTs because my brother was not waking up. i remember drinking water, unlocking the door, and waiting in the living room. \nemts burst through the door, professional looking people running in and out of our small apartment. and then the rush slowed down i wasn’t informed on much and i was nervous to interfere. now there are more professional people running in and out with my small apartment , although now some were patiently waiting for my father to arrive , and since my mum wasn’t answering her phone, oblivious to her only sons passing, all i could do is wait.\ni remember feeling awkward and unsure of what to do with all these personnel in my home, so i just kept offering everyone water and snacks- but they would just look at me with sad eyes and politely decline. \n\nI was only 14 so there were some issues of them telling me things but after about an hour, while My Father was on his way, a kind  man with a thick southern drawl sat me down. he informed me that my brother had passed away by the looks of it he had already been gone for quite some time.\n\nI responded with an understanding nod. \ni didn’t cry.\nI remember when My Father came home, hearing the news and holding back tears, I let the professionals do the talking while I sat in my room, my Father joined me, and I held his hands while the police questioned us. \n \nI’ll never forget the whale of agony my sister let out when she got home and heard the news. \n\nthe rest of the day is a blur. his funeral was the next day and rained and hailed so hard, my shoes were soaked through to my socks.\n\nI had a complicated relationship with my brother, but at the very least, I’m glad that he died at home in the comfort of his own bed and not in a hospital bed hooked up to machines and wires - he hated the hospital.\n\nit’s so incredibly hard and painful especially \nsince five years ago was a different world. He passed away right before Covid lockdown started happening. it feels like i knew him a lifetime ago.\n sometimes I forget his face and struggle remember what he looks like and it scares me because it’s only been five years and ,statistically speaking, I have around 70 more years to go . \nevery family event is painful, all days of celebration and holidays are surrounded with this dark cloud -that feeling that there’s someone that isn’t here ,that should be here. \n\n\nI hope this post is coherent -i’m after a long day at work.\nfeel free to ask anything in the comment if anything needs clarification.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account because my brother follows my main account and I don't want him finding this. Sorta long post, so beware. And English isn't my first language - I hope it's not too bad.\n\nSo recently, my parents passed away, both my mom and dad. it's still kinda hard to believe that they are really gone. I'm 17 years old, so it's been a bit rough for me.\n\nMy parent's relationship had never been good. My dad was a serial cheater, I don't know the full details but I know he had a bunch of mistresses and constantly slept with other younger women, he might even have other children... My mom always knew this apparently, but never left because she was only a high-school graduate with no prospects for a job to provide for us. \n\nI had told her to leave, but I knew it was fruitless.\n\nRecently, they'd been fighting so much, to the point where it was unbearable. In the entirety last year and even this year there was constant arguments in my home. They would have screaming matches and fights, I would always hear banging and yelling, I could barely sleep at night because of their fights. They've broken so much stuff in the house, doors, the TV, I've stepped on glass shattered glass before after a bad fight.\n\nThere was not much I could do but to just endure it and try to focus on my studies, i couldn't intervene, and i was forbidden from telling anyone. We also had a bunch of financial problems. I'm at a point in my life where I need to focus heavily on my education and make sure to get good grades, but the stress of it all was making it impossible. My mom would constantly pressure me to get good grades and I really tried to get good grades but I just can't, i really tried my best.\n\nI was mentally and physically exhausted. I was under alot of stress because of all of this, I literally just wanted to die so i didn't have to deal with it anymore. it felt like my own home wasn't home anymore and that I couldn't find peace anywhere. They would try to rope me into their fights and it just stressed me out more, I really couldn't do a thing about it. My physical health was depleting rapidly, I was gaining weight, I was always sick, always tired, I wasn't getting enough sleep.\n\nAlso my brother lives abroad, he has a job and a house and everything, and my mum for some reason doesn't wanna tell him ALL the details (he knew some stuff, but not to the extent that I did) so I was all alone in this. \n\nAnyway, almost 2 months ago I remember my parents had a huge fight, they broke the TV again, and it literally lasted all night, I couldn't sleep AT ALL. After that my dad went to work in the morning and didn't come home till like 12am. that same night my mom had come to my room and talked to me and told me that she knows how much I suffer, and she told me to study hard so that I can get out of here, and she gave me a hug, she hasn't hugged me or touched me since idk so I was just sorta stiff and didn't say anything.\n\nIn the morning I had school, so I went, I was really tired and slept through my entire econ class... at some point, during another class, the supervisor called me to her office, and when I went there, my homeroom teacher, the principal, and my aunt (my dad's sister) were there.. I knew what happened immediately.\n\nMy parents had gotten into a car accident and died in the hospital during surgery. The police think it was a suicide, but I don't really wanna know.\n\nSince I'm a minor, and still in school (I still have a year left, I'll be in 12th grade soon), my dad's sister took me in but his other siblings also visit me often, I don't have any contact with my mum's side. Living with my aunt and uncle has been okay, though I don't feel much at home. After I'm done with school and my A-levels (no i am not from the UK), I'll be moving to the US, where my brother lives. I already have a visa and scholarship.\n \nI recently went to a psychiatrist where I was told that I have severe depression and anxiety and BPD.\n\nI didn't see their dead bodies because I didn't have the courage, and I couldn't cry at the funeral, because I felt so... numb? after all that happened, I didn't know how to feel at all. I cried after I came home, all of it felt like overwhelming. I feel like a horrible person for not grieving enough, but idk what else to feel, I don't want to tell my brother yet.\n\nI've just been trying to study for my final exams soon, it's this year and I need to finish revising. I try to play games too, but I don't really have much energy. My friends from school have been very supportive and kind.\n\nAnyway, that's all I guess, I know it's really long, but I just wanted to ramble, because other than my really close online friend, I haven't told anyone.

I have a best friend (I'll call them muffin for anonymity purposes) who lives three hours away so I don't see her often anymore.

I feel like I'm a bad listener or that I ignore her or that I don't rech out often enough to her and that I'm a bad friend and a bad person for that. She also almost always never reaches out to me. I know it's not my fault but I blame myself. I'm scared she might become or is suicidal like my sister was. My sister was in the hospital for mental health a few times and this first started when I was younger. She threatened to cut her hand off the night I was supposed to sleep in hee room. (BTW she is 5 years older than me). I blame myself for that too. I am not suicidal or do self harm or depressed. I don't have a therapist but I used to due to bullying which I no longer deal with. I Don t have many friends that's something I've always had in life. I have I tight group of friends but I feel like I'm a bad friend. I feel like my classmates don't like me because I smell bad due to me not showing enough even tho I try too or am weird and I consider English as my first language but I've lived in a French speaking countrie my entire life and I feel like my speaking in French isn't good but they don't know that so they just think I'm a weirdo who can't speak or even read properly ( I'm dyslexic). My parents aren't abusive in any way shape or form. I just want someone to love me. I feel like I live day to day trying to repese these feelings and live life and tell myself everything is going to be fine but I m scared for the future. I know that my adulthood is in years but I'm still scared. I feel like I'm not good at anything everyday i just go home and watch videos on my phone. I'm very self conscious of my athleticism, I'm not at all flexible or strong or fast and my stamina is horrible. I feel like people would think I'm over-exaggerating if I tell them this. \n\nI feel like monster and I just want someone anyone to tell me that s not true. I know that the person reading this will probably see this feel bad for a bit or just don't care at all and forget about it. I know this is probably just a scream in to the void but I just want to be heard and loved. My family loves me but I feel like it's not enough.\n\nPlease just tell me I'm not a bad person. And if I am, just tell me.\n\n This is just something I needed to get off my chest. Thank you so much for reading my useless vent.\n\nThis is a repost from my main account I deleted the original post because my mom wanted to follow me on reddit and I didn't want her to see this.",

        "selftext": "tldr: My mom's friend helped me through a tough time and get into college. We got really close and we've been hooking up since. No one knows.\n\nShe worked with my mom. They grew close over the years and became even closer the summer before I left for college because my parents were going through a nasty divorce. She threw me a birthday party when my parents were too busy fighting in court to remember. She made a big effort to be there for my mom and by proxy she was also there for me. We grew close because she would bring over dinner (and eat with me), drive me places, pick me up and bring me home, and even helped me with school. My mom picked up another job to help pay for the divorce lawyer so she was gone a lot. She helped me prepare for my college interviews, wrote me references, and connected me with people she knew. Most nights she'd feed me dinner, clean up, and make sure I was home instead of out partying, then lock up our house and sometimes sleep there on the couch or my moms bed until my mom got home.\n\nI always was attracted to her since she was younger than my mom, but still had that fit work out milf type of look. I would check her out often and even use her as the focal point of my masturbation. It got to the point where I snuck into her laundry basket a few times to check out her used lingerie.\n\nWe grew closer and talked about sex. It started from her giving me advice on navigating the dating world and a \"girls\" perspective. I felt comfortable with her helping me figure out these social situations since she is young and attractive, I just figured she understood. I complained about girls, friends, anxiety. She was a great listener and I would love receiving comforting hugs from. her. I would always get aroused from talking with her about things. One night when we hugged she felt my hard arousal accidentally press up against her, but nothing happened.\n\nMy fantasy was just that, a fantasy until I went to college. My parents were still dragging the divorce out so she graciously helped me shop, pack, and even dropped me off. It was only 45 mins away from home, I wanted to go further away, but I'm just lucky to even get into college with all the stress. Her texts were often and short, so it wasn't unusual for us to be casual with each other. One night I got really drunk and texted her pretty late thinking she wouldn't get it until later in the morning. I mentioned how I thought about her during random hook ups or masturbation. Well to my surprise she replied and we engaged in a little back and forth. This happened a few times over the course of my first semester and I did try to push the flirting boundaries when we talked about intimate things. It usually started with reminders for me to practice safe sex and then lead to talking about sex in general. I could tell she was really careful about being intimate with me. A few times it slipped into flirty territory.\n\nThere was a blizzard as everyone was leaving for winter break. I could have taken the train, but I texted her that I didn't have a ride home because I wanted to spend time with her. It was late and the storm was pretty bad by the time she dropped me off. She insisted that she'd come in and make me dinner. At some point a bottle of wine was consumed. She mentioned that my mom was working until 10pm that night so she stayed up with me to watch a movie. We ended up talking about all the things that happened that semester and I admitted to her her my lack of confidence with girls. I joked that if only I could get some practice in real life instead of watching porn I could find the clit.\n\nWell one thing led to another and we spent a lot of break together. Since coming back to school, she's been driving here and getting a hotel for us once a week. I'm afraid that I won't like girls my age anymore after this and that she's making it so fun and easy that I'm not making an effort to meet girls my age. Not really sure what to do, but needed to get this off my chest. It's just nice having someone to have sex with so easily instead of putting in effort to flirt, play games, go out drinking and risking being with a random girl.",

        "selftext": "I’ve worked with this woman for about 4 years. We’ve traveled together on business several times. I’ve always been a pretty shy guy, but am especially cautious when socializing with women I work with. I try to be myself but not act in a manner such that they could feel uncomfortable (basically I’m afraid of flirting because I want to be a good human being and also keep my job). \n\nWhen I’m with this woman it’s pretty chill. We chat about our travels and places we want to go. She occasionally tells me very personal things, one time she randomly told me she had an IUD after we were just sitting in silence for a few seconds. \n\nAnyway I think she’s great. She’s very smart and successful. We both make 140k+ at basically the same job. She owns her own house but I’m not quite there yet. She’s funny, cute, and very fashionable. The little things like the way she paints her nails (neat like a professional does them for her on the daily) and wears her hair are so unique and attractive. \n\nSometimes things feel fantasy like when we’re traveling together. We might both reach for the temperature controls in the car at the same time because the AC is too cold and touch hands. We say the same things at the same time and have the same thoughts when a random event happens in front of us. \n\nSometimes she would say interesting things like “if it was appropriate I’d invite you to stay at my house” because the office is far for me and close to her. Or if I talked about moving she’d get excited and joke that I could be her neighbor. I always wondered if she was attracted to me, but she shows mixed signals. She’s a very smart woman so it’s possible she thinks the same way I do and doesn’t want to jeopardize her career. She’s had boyfriends on and off and I’m not even sure what her current status is. \n\nI feel like in an alternate reality we would be the perfect couple. But in this reality we’ll just be coworkers who live a couple hours apart. It’s frustrating. I’ve never been sexually active before because I’m waiting for someone who electrifies me as much as she does to truly desire me, and to be in the right situation for it. That’s hard to find. \n\nTLDR; just a dumb man crushing on a coworker \n\nUpdate: I don’t think I can ask her out. Messaged her at work today to ask how things have been and the conversation felt one sided. I can’t deal with the humiliation, embarrassment, and fear of her getting freaked out by me doing so ",

        "selftext": "Over the past few months, I've had talking stages and situationships with six guys. After a while, they all asked for nudes, and some even threatened to leave me if I didn’t send them. I knew it wasn’t right, but I kept sending them anyway, without really thinking about the consequences. I kept convincing myself that maybe it would be different this time, that maybe they would care about me, but deep down I knew I was making a mistake. Once I sent them, I immediately felt disgusted with myself. The shame hit me hard, and I couldn’t stop thinking about what I’d done. I felt like I had given away something of myself, something I couldn’t get back, and it made me feel empty and worthless. I just wanted to feel wanted and loved, but now it feels like I’ve only been used. Long story short, they all left me—some blocked me, others ghosted me without a word. I know I should have stopped after the first guy, but I was so desperate for affection that I ignored my own worth and let myself get caught up in it. I feel so small and discarded now. Looking back, I’m filled with regret, and I can't shake the feeling that I was taken advantage of. The shame eats me alive, and I’m constantly terrified that my pictures are out there somewhere, being shared without my consent. It haunts me. I sent nudes to all six guys, and each time, I convinced myself it would lead to something real, but in the end, they all left, and I feel like I've only given pieces of myself away for nothing. Am I the only one who’s gone through this? I feel like I’ll never be able to undo the damage I've done to myself. Also, I’m still a virgin—can I still be considered a virgin if I’ve sent nudes?

        "selftext": "Update from [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1j1tw8a/update_i_met_my_husband_that_i_divorced_3_years/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\nMy (35M) ex-husband (36M) and I recently reconnected. I won't go over the details of why we split or our reconciliation since I'm sure the average redditor can click buttons and most likely read. He was the one taking me out, and promised that it would, in his words, \"knock my socks off\" to make up for his neglect of me. He sure as hell delivered.\n\nA little backstory, we've been together since we were 15 and 16 respectively, and have never moved out of our hometown. This year would have been our 20th anniversary (of getting together, not marriage). We were dating secretly for about five years before our parents caught us one day during summer break. The fallout from finding out their son was gay actually made his parents split. His dad wanted to send him away to conversion therapy. He's seen his father maybe once per year on average, and every time he's incredibly cold towards me. Would never refer to me as his son-in-law, only my husband's \"pal.\" I wonder why. Anyway, not what you're here to read. I'll get on with the lore.\n\nHe picked me up from the house and wouldn't tell me where we were going, but told me to dress warmly. He ended up taking me to the place where we met: a run down ice skating rink in our town. He used to do hockey, and I spent some time trying to learn figure skating until people started beating me up for it. Both sports would practice at the same time and I remember barely being able to keep my eyes off him. We went skating, I tried to pull off a few of the moves I remembered (he only had to catch me from falling on my ass once or twice, and I won't complain about an attractive man that I love hooking his arm around my waist), and we spent an hour or so there until our feet hurt. At one point I said that my face was getting cold, so he skated around in front of me and placed his gloved hands on my cheeks to warm me up. I just about burned a hole in the ice from how hard I was blushing, I swear to God.\n\nHe wasn't done then. We left and went to dinner, specifically the restaurant where we had our first date. It's a cheap hole-in-the-wall place, seeing as we were poor teenagers when we first met. We chatted and ate food that probably took 5 years off our lives, he was an incorrigible flirt, and even held my hand underneath the table like he did all those years ago. I know I said I never stopped loving him, and I stand by that, but I think I somehow fell in love with him a thousand times over again during that meal.\n\nAt the end of dinner, he asked if I had energy for one more simple thing, to which I agreed. He took me a while out of town to a dark sky zone park, specifically the one where he proposed to me ten years ago. He set out a blanket to sit on and another to cuddle under, and we went stargazing all bundled up together. You never know how much you miss the sound of someone's heartbeat until you haven't heard it for so long. We shared a bottle of sparkling grape juice in plastic champagne flutes and dumb, giggly kisses. It felt so similar yet so different. He told me in a moment of quiet that he loved me, and oh, God. It took everything I had not to cry. I barely hesitated before asking if he wanted to change venues. He seemed surprised, but eagerly accepted.\n\nI ended up at his place, as some of you may have seen from my edit on my second post yesterday. I wanted to take it slower than this, but it was so hard to. I was so starved of affection and hadn't been intimate with anyone for just about six years. I'm gonna keep what happened at his between us, but all I'll say is that his medication was no issue and all of you should be jealous. I woke up in his bed this morning, reached over for him, and pulled him close just like I used to do. I haven't been this happy in a long time. We had a sleepy discussion and decided to get back together, but we're not using the term boyfriends. It just feels weird after all this time. So he's my partner, or my lover. He's mine.\n\nThank you, reddit. Wouldn't have done it without a little push from the internet. Let's see where all this goes.",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone I (20m) miss my (19f) exgf so much. When we first met eachother 2 years ago everything was perfect. We were in love and having good times no matter what. We were long distance (about an hour and 30 minutes from each other) and we hated it, but it never mattered. The more days that went by the more in love we were. \n\nAt the time I was struggling with really bad paranoia and I quit my job and ran away to go live with her. I left my family and most importantly my grandmother behind. I wanted to show her everything I wanted was with her and her only, but I think that was one of the worst decisions we made during our relationship. We were only together for 2-3 months at the time and I stayed with her brother while she lived with her mom and step dad. \n\nWe started spending every second together and it was just getting even better, but we started getting aggravated with eachother more. I eventually got a job 1-2 months after moving in with her brother. Then things started to pick up again, probably because of the motivation of going to work and getting money to spend on her. She never cared about the money. I did, it’s the only way I knew how to prove my love. \n\nHer mom and step dad were both alcoholics and abused eachother quite often and they really weren’t a fan of me for some reason. They got in a fight one night and started treating my ex wrong so I stepped in and pulled her out of that situation before she got hurt and I took her to taco bell at 3am. \n\nAfter that we started fighting a whole lot more because money was getting tight and it was the only thing that made me feel stable. I wasn’t comfortable living with her brother at all and was starting to wish I never moved in. We started getting more and more distant until the day she got me a cat. A beautiful baby and I named her Honey. She was the sweetest thing ever and it brought me and my ex closer than ever. \n\nThen I got kicked out of her brothers for unknown reasons. I just had to be out by the weekend, so I called up my family for some help and me and my ex moved into a camper with some of my distant relatives. We were still arguing and growing more distant but we worked out some of the problems but it just wasn’t enough. We ended up moving back in with our families separately and only seeing eachother on the weekends, but going from living with eachother for over a year and then all of a sudden splitting apart again brought some issues. My trust issues got very very bad and I started with my outbursts and starting arguments for no reason. We both did and we would blame eachother for everything. \n\nI broke up with her and got back with her multiple times. I started running from our problems and coming back expecting it to be the way it was when we first got together, but it never turned out that way. I started focusing on myself and what I could do to be better for her. I tried so many things and so many ways but I could never find a way that worked and made us both happy. I wanted it to work out so much but she got fed up with me and blocked me on everything. I broke her heart so many times and lied to her because I didn’t wanna admit I was wrong. I miss her so god damn much and wish I could go back in time to fix things. I want to hold her one more time. I want to give her all the affection she deserves. I wish I payed a little bit more attention to her and put myself to the side for once. \n\nMy only regret so far in life I wish I treated you a little bit better Peyton. If by any chance you find this and read it, just know I’m still trying my best and not giving up just for the chance I get to love you like I should have. Honey was the best thing we ever had and you’re the only other person that I share those memories with. You have her kitten and I miss getting to see her. You’re my fucking soulmate Peyton and I will never love anyone else like I love you. If my life ends with you not by my side then it was all a waste. My life will have no meaning. \n ",

If you did, I'm sorry, and I'm glad you're still here.\n\nI'll get to the point. I prepared to commit suicide, something that has been on my mind every day for the past year and a half. Approximately. I decided to finally do it in January, I think. Ghosted all my friends, ruined every relationship within my family, completely neglected my schoolwork to the point that it's not salvageable anymore and that I'd have to drop out if I didn't die (though, honestly, I gave up on that much earlier).\n\nI wrote the letters. I bought the rope. I chose the place.\n\nBut I am *scared.* I'm fucking terrified. I don't want to die anymore, but now it feels like I don't have a choice. That I already made this decision, and I have to follow through. It's not that I want to live... I don't. At least not the life I have now. It's not even something worth being called a life. I do realize that it is only myself who can save me, that it is in my hands to turn my life around, that I am the only one responsible for my own happiness. I know things can change, theoretically, but I know myself, and I know that I am too weak to try and face the consequences of my own actions in an attempt to fix this. To rebuild the last bridge I burned. I'm not sure I want to.\n\nI don't know what I want. The idea of living is dreadful. The idea of death, although once so comforting, is terrifying. I want nothing, but I *don't* want to die.\n\nI have tried to kill myself before, when I was a teenager. Multiple times. Never before have I experienced this crippling horror at the idea of dying, not even when I thought I succeeded. The thought now makes me nauseous with fear, and I don't know what to do, because I *have to* die.\n\nThank you for reading. I'm sorry if this post doesn't fit the subreddit, or if I don't make much sense, and I'm sorry if I sound pretentious. I'm really not trying to be. I'm not sure *what* I'm trying to go for with this post, in all honesty, or what I'm looking for. I'm just lost, and I don't understand why I'm suddenly so afraid of something I ruined my life for.

He’s never liked drinking, but after so much time, he feels completely trapped in a cycle of addiction. On top of that, he has significant mental health issues, and he lost his mother a while ago, dad left him, which has only deepened his struggles.\n\nToday, his behavior was really concerning. He was talking constantly, repeating words over and over, and even making a song out of them. He was jumping around in the bathroom, laughing uncontrollably—though it was forced, almost like a nervous laughter. He was narrating random, nonsensical stories, smiling in a way that didn’t feel normal. This isn’t the way he usually behaves. He’s normally very calm and thoughtful, even shy but today he was completely out of character.\n\nHe’s been becoming more antisocial lately, and despite me being the only one visiting him, he still feels incredibly lonely. He’s tried therapy, but it hasn’t helped much, and he often feels like he’s beyond saving. He has also mentioned feeling like he might end it all, though not directly. I’m really scared for him, but I don’t know what to do anymore.\n\nI love him deeply, and I’m doing everything I can to support him, but I can’t fix this alone.

I’ve moved on from him in the sense that I don’t want him back, but I feel like the emotional and psychological abuse I went through changed me in ways I can’t undo.\n\nWhenever a potential new partner comes into my life, I can’t seem to accept them. The moment I see something I don’t agree with, even if it’s small, I start emotionally distancing myself to avoid getting hurt. I don’t even know what a healthy relationship looks like.\n\nOn top of that, I live in a Middle Eastern country where everyone constantly pressures me to get married before I become “too old.” It just makes me feel worse—like the manipulation and mistreatment I faced really broke something in me, and I don’t know how to fix it.\n\nWhat my ex did to me\n\nTo summarize: he cheated on me multiple times, and I only found out about all of them at once. He never got me gifts—only things he wanted me to have so he could show off his status. He never initiated intimacy; it was always up to me. He didn’t want kids, but the moment he felt like I was pulling away, he suddenly wanted them—basically trying to baby trap me even though it was obvious our relationship was already over.\n\nWhen I needed help—like when my car wouldn’t start or the faucets were bursting—he never answered my calls. I had to handle everything myself. He claimed he had OCD about cleanliness but would leave trash and dirty clothes everywhere, expecting me to clean up after him just because I was a stay-at-home wife at the time.\n\nFinancially, he cut me off (except for food and clothes) when I got a part-time job and started making more than him for like three months. In my culture, the husband is supposed to provide for his wife, but as soon as I had my own income (which was around 4k a year, yes a year), he refused to spend a single cent on me unless it was food or clothes (had to pay my own cell-service, gas, etc… which he previously paid for).\n\nWhen we traveled, it was never about me—it was just because he wanted to see the world, and his friends couldn’t afford to go with him. When I put effort into our relationship—planning picnics, buying games so we could play together, setting up dates, booking hotels—he ignored it all, (yes I slept in a hotel by myself which is a huge NO-NO in my culture because he wanted to hang out with his boys instead). I tried everything to make it work, and the only complaint he had about me was that I “didn’t clean enough.” He would literally swipe his finger over a light switch, show me the dust, and act like that was a real issue.\n\nOur last conversation? He told me I was perfect, that he was sorry he cheated, and that was it. Only when he realized that I was really leaving him, that he started crying in the corner of the apartment we had like a 3-year-old toddler. 2 days later he was like I did everything for you and it’s all your fault I cheated… :)\n\nWhere I’m at now\n\nThe cheating destroyed me. I never even checked his phone because I respected his privacy, and in return, I got blindsided. I lost myself completely. People see me as this cheerful, bubbly person, but it’s just a facade so my parents don’t worry about me.\n\nAfter the divorce, I moved back in with them (which is normal in my culture). My dad even built me a small studio flat upstairs, so I have my own space. But I stopped working, so I have no income. Even if I got a full-time job, the salaries here are terrible—around $15,500 USD a year, even though I have nine years of experience in marketing and content. Realistically, I should be making $20K–$30K, but that’s a whole other issue.\n\nI just feel like I have nothing to live for. My biggest dream in life is to have a family and kids, but the dating scene is discouraging. I do have hobbies—I love reading, drawing, playing video games, watching anime/TV/movies, taking walks, and doing at-home pilates. So it’s not like I do nothing with my life, but inside, I feel completely empty.\n\nMy struggle with marriage \n\nI’m very traditional—not because of my family, but because I truly believe a husband should take care of his wife. That doesn’t mean I expect to be spoiled and contribute nothing, but I don’t think it should be my responsibility to cook, clean, and do everything 24/7.\n\nMost men here, though, want a wife to take care of them. I keep getting set up with men through my family, and it’s always the same story—they expect a woman to be a maid, not a partner. I feel like I’m running out of time to get married, and it’s making me anxious because I really want to build a family.\n\nMy thoughts are all over the place, and I don’t know what to do.\n\nPS: This is the first time I’ve ever shared something this personal. I don’t even know if this makes sense. English isn’t my first language, so sorry if it’s messy.\n",

I asked him out for coffee again and he simply didn't answer/ shoved it under the rug and didn't really interact anymore. \n\nI have adhd and I wish I could just stop having this crush as he obviously doesn't like me that way because he's had plenty of opportunity to respond favorably. \n\nHe's everything I'd like to have in a partner, kind, attentive, intelligent, helpful and very sensitive a bit mysterious. He's also my type in terms of dark hair etc.\n\nIdk how to get over the feelings for good as I've never been good at just stopping to think about stuff like this due to my hyperfocus. \n\n\nI just had to get this off my chest as I admire him a lot as a person and respect him. \nAnd it's okay that he doesn't like me back but I would've liked some closure. \n\nThanks for reading this!

        "selftext": "This also gon be long (i cant help it, i am literally crying as i typed this)...\n\nTLDR: I’m leaving for college soon, and while I’m excited, I’m struggling with the thought of leaving my mom behind. We’ve always been close since my dad works overseas, but lately, I’ve been unintentionally pulling away, getting irritable, and saying things I regret. I thought distancing myself would make leaving easier, but it only hurts more. Seeing how much my mom will miss me—made me realize I don’t want to leave things on a sour note. I keep having vivid dreams about my departure, and the guilt of how I’ve treated her is overwhelming. I want to fix things before I go, but I don’t know how.\n\nI’m moving away for college in a few months, and as excited as I am for this new chapter, I can’t stop thinking about how much I’m going to miss my mom. She’s been my biggest source of comfort my whole life, and since my dad works overseas, we’ve always had a strong bond. But now that I’m getting closer to leaving, I feel this huge mix of emotions that I don’t know how to deal with.\n\nLately, I’ve noticed myself pulling away a little—not intentionally, but I think it’s my way of trying to make leaving easier. Instead, it’s just making me feel worse. I’ve been more irritable, and I hate that I’ve raised my voice at times when I never used to, I always used to listen to her life stories even if I had heard them countless times, her rants too, whenever she shouted for reasons I wasn't even wrong... But now I am talking back to her, get angry on her and say awful things, when she tells her stories I say they are boring and please shut up, I don't know why I am doing this... I still want to listen to her rants and yapping but I am not able to, I am going into that angry zone and I have done many mistakes. I haven’t even apologized properly, and that weighs on me. It’s like I’m watching myself act this way but can’t stop.\n\nI know this is all part of growing up, but the thought of leaving her behind, even temporarily, is really hard. I don’t have many close friends, so my mom has always been the one I could talk to. But over time, I started keeping things to myself, thinking I shouldn’t burden her with my problems. I used to be able to just rest my head in her lap and cry when things got hard—when I got bullied, when I felt alone—but I haven’t done that in years. It makes me sad because I feel like I’ve lost that connection a bit, and I don’t want to leave things this way And now, when I probably need it the most, I feel like I can’t show her the weak side of me that I have long pretended to have erased.\n\nThe other day, something happened that really got to me. My mom was taking a nap, and before sleeping, she had asked me to grab some groceries. While she was resting, my little sister was joking around and said, \"He left for college,\" and my mom suddenly started crying in sleep. She thought I had already gone. I was still at home, but seeing that broke me. I rushed to get the groceries, but I was tearing up the whole time. It made me realize just how hard this is going to be—for both of us, and precisely the reason I was trying to distance myself from her that she doesn't grieve much but no, now I feel that she will cry more that I left and our relation were sour and not mended, I genuinely want to say sorry right now but I am stuck and I am going crazy.\n\nAt night, I keep having vivid dreams about the day I leave, and they feel so real (I do have genetic hyperphantasia (from my mom that too)) that I wake up feeling broken. Every time, it’s like I’m reliving the moment before it even happens (I know mom must be having those dreams too). It makes me feel so helpless because no matter what I do, that day is still coming. I was going to leave this January, but postponed it to August, because in January we were close to ripping each other off, that level of arguments... But now things are settling down, but still it isn't back to what it was last year...\n\nI know I have to go, and I know my mom wants the best for me. She always encourages me, and I’m so grateful for everything she’s done—raising me, taking care of me, making sure I don't feel alone (I do feel, but I pretend I don't to not hurt her, I do have suicidal thoughts sometimes, but I hold back that it will all fall into place soon, however indefinite the \"soon\" is). I just want to spend these last few months showing her how much she means to me and making good memories before I leave. I just want to do the right thing, but I feel so lost. I thought distancing myself would help, but it only hurts more... Idk how to leave without hurting my mom... How do I say goodbye without breaking her heart... All of these are constantly revolving in my mind and I'm going crazy... I still have a few months but I don't know how I'll manage... I want to mend things... But I am thrown into my guilt...\n\nFor those who’ve gone through something similar, how did you make the transition easier? How did you make sure your mom knew how much you appreciated her before you left? I don’t want to take this time for granted, and I’d love to hear any advice on how to make these last few months meaningful for both of us. I know now that pushing my mom away won’t make leaving any easier—if anything, it’ll only make it worse. I tried to make her love me less so she wouldn't hurt when I leave, but all I did was create more pain for both of us. I don’t want her to remember our last months together with regret. I just want to fix things before it’s too late\n\nAnd lastly, Just to clarify, this is about my bond with my mom as a parent, nothing else. We’re Asian—if I ever even thought otherwise, she’d personally set me straight with a slipper and more ultimate weapons. My dad works overseas but is always present, calling daily morning and night and supporting her even more than I do, listening to her rants and all. I love my mom because she’s always been there for me, and I’ve supported her in return. She doesn’t rely on me for happiness—I rely on her. I know I have to leave one day, but I just want to make things right before I go.",

        "selftext": "Guys, I am sorry, but this is a bit long, but I dont know who else to tell this to... (dont tell me about diaries, i suck at writing) and\n\nTLDR: Before COVID, I was social and talkative, but after the pandemic, I lost that ability. My friendships faded, and now I barely talk at all. Conversations feel forced, and I overthink everything. I keep things to myself because I have no one to truly open up to. Even online, my attempts to connect go unanswered. I miss the version of me that could talk freely, without hesitation. I don’t know how to fix it, and I just wish someone understood.  \n  \nBefore COVID, I was a completely different person. I wasn’t exactly an extrovert, but I talked a lot—so much that teachers had to tell me to quiet down in class. I had a normal social life, and conversations came naturally. But after the pandemic, something changed. I used to have a few friends, and talking felt effortless. But when everything went online, I realized something: those connections were weaker than I thought. Conversations faded, and soon, I was just... alone.\n\nNow, I barely talk at all. I don’t have close friends, and I find myself avoiding conversations altogether. It’s not that I hate people—I just don’t know how to talk anymore. It feels like I lost the ability somewhere along the way. Even when I try, it feels forced, like I don’t belong in the conversation. I started keeping things to myself—not because I wanted to, but because I had to. There was no one to talk to. If I spoke up in online classes, I’d either get ignored, get shut down by teachers, or feel like I was saying something dumb. Friends who I thought were there just… weren’t. And slowly, I just stopped trying.\n\nEven now, in person, I can’t bring myself to talk like I used to. I hold back. I overthink. I don’t have friends anymore. I’ve never had a girlfriend, and honestly, I don’t need one for the reasons most of my classmates seem to. I just wish I had someone to talk to—someone I could open up to about things I can’t even tell my mom anymore (see this post). She’s been my only real friend for years, but as I grew older, I started holding back. I don’t want to worry her, and I don’t want to burden her with my thoughts. But that means I end up keeping everything inside, with no one to really share it with.\n\nI don’t know how I ended up like this. I miss the version of me that could just talk without hesitation. I miss feeling like I had people to talk to at all. People say it's just a phase, but how long does a phase last? It’s been 5-6 years, and I’m still waiting to snap out of it—feeling like a tether floating in space, cut off from its base, holding onto nothing but a fragile strand of hope that maybe, just maybe, something will push me back.\n\nI overthink at the silliest of times. Even now, as I type, I am overthinking. It’s been two hours since I started writing this small post, but my mind is stuck in a loop—how to write, what to write, how much to write, is this sentence wrong, what if I’m misunderstood, what if the post gets removed, what if there’s no reply? My mind just doesn’t stop.\n\nI don’t know if anyone else has experienced this—going from talkative and social to completely silent and disconnected. I don’t know how to fix it either. I miss being able to just talk without overthinking everything. I miss having someone to truly connect with. I miss the part of me that could engage in conversations without second-guessing every word. Back then, I could even talk to girls without feeling like I was just spouting nonsense. Not that I ever got much of a response, but at least I was able to talk. Now, I hesitate for so long that by the time I figure out what to say, the moment has already passed. The person has already walked away.\n\nWhenever I see friends posting on Instagram, I reach out—\"What’s up?\" \"Nice!\" \"Cool!\" \"How have you been?\" But most of the time, there’s no reply. And if there is, it’s a dry \"okay\" or \"cool,\" like they don’t want to engage in a conversation no matter how hard I try. I don’t have any social skills anymore. I don’t have humor. I don’t know how to flirt or even start a normal conversation. I have to ask ChatGPT just to figure out how to say something.\n\nHas anyone else gone through this? How did you handle it?  \nI just wish someone understood. I am tired of being alone, and reaching out isn't helping anymore",

She looked at me like I mattered, and for the first time in a long time, I felt seen. We worked in the same company but had never noticed each other before that night.\n\nFrom that moment on, my life revolved around her. We weren’t officially together, but we acted like we were. She’d come over almost every night, we’d talk for hours, fall asleep in each other’s arms. It felt real. It felt worth fighting for.\n\nBut she kept saying she wasn’t ready for a relationship.\n\nI told myself to be patient, to wait until she healed from her past. But months passed, and nothing changed. Every time I tried to define what we were, she pulled away. And yet, she always came back.\n\nShe had a drinking problem. I picked her up from bars when she was too wasted to get home. I held her hair back when she was sick, tucked her into bed, made sure she was okay. I cleaned up the messes she made—literally and figuratively.\n\nAnd still, I wasn’t enough.\n\nShe had a kid, and I got along with her so well.

Throughout my life, she always seemed \"embarrassed\" or \"ashamed\" of me for one reason or another. We hadn't spoken in three years, though deep down, part of me still longed for the kind of mother-daughter relationship I never had.\n\nThen, three weeks ago, I received a message on Facebook from my cousin, saying they had \"heard\" about my mother and hoped things got better. My heart sank. No matter what had happened between us, she was still my mom. I immediately started reaching out to family—her siblings, my aunts and uncles—only to be told they couldn’t say anything and that I needed to call my stepdad.\n\nLong story short, my mother was dying. Stage 4 cancer. ICU. When I asked if I could see her, I was told she wasn’t sure if she wanted to see me. That *hurt* in a way I can't even explain. By the time I finally made it to her home, she was in hospice care and could no longer speak. Her husband made it clear that she hadn't wanted me to know she was sick—she didn’t think I would care. *WTF.* I got to say goodbye, but only to the shell of the woman she once was. And now, I don't know how to process any of it.\n\nThe only time I ever really stood up to her—never in a disrespectful way—was when I asked her to stop belittling me in front of others and to show me some respect. I am college-educated, have never been arrested, and earn four times what she did. But in her eyes, none of that mattered. I was overweight. I had a teenage pregnancy many, *many* years ago. That was all she ever saw. This drove anxiety, depression and a few failed attempts...well, you know. \n\nShe never had a relationship with her only grandson, either. He wasn’t told she was sick. He never got to say goodbye.\n\nIt’s just... frustrating. Heartbreaking. Infuriating.\n\nThank you for letting me vent.",

Last summer, I (18) went to visit my boyfriend (21), who lived over 400 miles away. I was given an ultimatum: if I didn't go see him, he would dump me. So, the naive me, hopelessly in love, agreed to take two weeks off my well-paying job to meet him.\n\nAfter a 14-hour train ride, I was enveloped in his embrace, and I felt so happy, thinking, \"This is it; he’s the one.\" I was exhausted from the long day and immediately fell asleep in his bed. However, I woke up to a strange feeling and found myself unable to breathe. He was having sex with me and choking me. When I opened my eyes in shock, all he said was, “You like that? you fucking slut.” I felt so stupid and used, I couldn’t look at him the same way again.\n\nI stayed there for the rest of the two weeks, but all we did was argue. I wanted love and to spend time with him, while he just wanted to play games, use me, and sleep. Once the two weeks were over i got the train home to encounter a 7 hour delay, I spent a total of 21 hours on a train, only to be raped by a man in an alley at 3 a.m. on my way to the hotel.\n\nI called my boyfriend, crying and upset, as my face had been bashed in. He called me a whore, saying I shouldn’t dress the way I did in public and that it was my own fault. Then he dumped me. I had a mental breakdown of sorts lost my job, self harmed almost daily never allowing my skin to be clean and overdosed twice. The worst part is no one believed me accusing me of being an attention seeker and dramatic and those who did believe me played it off as no big deal. Although it has been five months, I still feel unloved. I have always craved affection, and I genuinely do not believe anyone could ever love me for who I am without wanting to use me although i hope one day im proven to be wrong :)",

        "selftext": "I have been trying to process and work through what I saw yesterday, but it has been really hard. The event itself was a lot but now I’m dealing with the “why’s” which make me feel guilty since what happened has nothing to do with me. I was just a witness. I tried writing through it, but it hasn’t been enough so I’m trying again, thinking that if I get it in front of others I can start to live past it. \n\nYesterday evening, I was sitting on this big rock while I was waiting for the bus. A little ways down the road there was a taxi van. He was either backing out or adjusting his U-turn, but obviously reversing and not moving super fast. From where I was sitting, I didn’t see how fast the bike courier was going when he hit the front side of the van. And the biker immediately went under the front wheel of the van and I could hear him and his bicycle crunch under the tire. \n\nThe position the biker was on the ground was how he stayed for the whole 20 minutes that he was out there. He never moved. So, I’m almost positive he died during the collision or if there was some way he survived, he could have been fully paralyzed. \n\nBut there weren’t many people to see the accident head on like I did. A man in his Jeep came out and a few security from the booth around (my stop is near a campus) came out to help. They checked for signs of life and directed traffic around him and had someone call 911. Police came and did much of the same. The fire department came and started doing CPR but they didn’t take off the man’s helmet. The ambulance came and I didn’t see any defibrillator or adrenaline unless they did those things in the back once they loaded him on the gurney and took the man away. But even after they put him in the ambulance, it didn’t leave or take off. There wasn’t a rush. \n\nIt felt like I was out there for two hours but it all happened in about 20 minutes. And, it’s hard to think about the collision and how if the biker hasn’t passed away I’m sure the injuries will last a lifetime. And I think about the taxi driver who just sat in the van with his head down and how he will most likely lose almost everything because of an accident. \n\nI don’t know why I had to see it but I did and I don’t know what to do with it if anything at all.

However, there are times when my mom feels a bit smothered by my dad, and this has led to arguments in the past, but I would say that overall she enjoys spending most of her time with him.  I've even tried inviting her to different events but she would often turn me down to spend time with my dad. I feel like this has led me to create an unrealistic expectation that my partner and I should be spending a lot of our time together.  A few of my partners have told me that they felt smothered, or that I was never satisfied with them. Was it a matter of different needs, or was I truly doing/expecting too much? Or is it a little bit of both?  People say a relationship is supposed to feel \"easy\" or \"natural\" in the beginning, but it's never felt that way for me.  I have to be doing something wrong-whether it's not communicating well enough, expecting too much from my partner, or not setting firm enough boundaries for myself, or maybe all of the above. ",

        "selftext": "I (22F) broke up with my boyfriend (20M) of 6 months on new years of 2024. I broke up with him for a plethora of reasons including him accusing me of stealing $500, him accusing me of cheating, him proposing, how he treated me, him telling me he was going to commit suicide and it was my fault, and much more. For the record, I didn’t do any of the things he accused me of. Well it didn’t end at the breakup. This specific individual is in the military and most of our relationship was long distance. He sent me death threats after the initial break up which I did contact the police and his commanding officer about. I told him to leave me alone and blocked him. However for the year of 2024, he had his friends that live where I live follow me and threaten any guy I was seeing into breaking up with me, he constantly messaged me on different numbers saying words coated in honey to try to get me back and he even showed up to my house when he was on leave. One of the many reasons I broke up with him was that he was home for Christmas of 2023 and refused to see me and I got really upset because I still “loved him” at that time. I have now learned through therapy that it wasn’t love, I was just caught in the web. Well Christmas of 2024 came around and he was back on leave and he had his mom message me telling me that he was going to commit suicide if I didn’t show up. I told her to leave me alone and it was of course an empty threat (maybe even a test). He left after that and apparently, according to his mom he was deployed. Well I got a text on my birthday (February 4th) saying that he still loved me and yada yada which went ignored and then I got a call from his military base. Apparently he had went missing in action and I was his beneficiary. I haven’t heard anything from him since but I feel free finally. I have a date this week and I’m going to see if anyone threatens my date into ending it with me. I kinda feel bad that I was so harsh but I also think it was survival. I think that if I was any less harsh, it would’ve been a lifetime of pain for me. ",

Bland, so bland that eating a meal that would take me ten minutes takes up to an hour.\n\nI swear, any dish they make is outperformed, and I do not exaggarate here, by a fucking piece of bread with some salt and pepper sprinkled over it. I wish I was joking.\n\nWhich is fucking abysmal because the food actually looks good! It looks like it something that you'd want seconds for but when you actually bite into it, you wish to be put away for ten years in jail just so you don't have to eat it again.\n\nThe taste of my family households cooking is what I imagine slop to taste like.\nYou know those cartoons where the lunch lady always gave this grey slop in the cafeteria? I'm pretty sure my parents eat that on the daily, just with a different look each day.\n\nIt's amazing, no matter what they make, be it soup, sandwiches, schnitzel, literally any fucking thing they make is just akin to the taste of a rock.\n\nI just finished dinner and wish I didn't.\nThankfully I have money of my own so I can just say that I'm not hungry and then go out on the town later.\nBut still, I am amazed how they eat that... Stuff. I can't even call it shit cause at least shit tastes awful.\n\nIf their food was a person it would be this puny, dresses always like he's going to work, overly friendly and unopinionated guy at the party that talks to you when you contemplate jumping out of the building just so you can avoid his dribble about the fucking idk, how much he likes MHA.\n\nYou'd probably love my parents cooking if you enjoy the taste of water.\n\nTheir food reminds me of the food bodybuilders eat, you know?\nCooked chicken and rice, with no spices, sauce or additions, only that chicken and rice.\nMy parents make food with all manners of ingredients yet they still taste like... Fucking chicken and rice.\n\nIt's amazing I was able to eat that stuff for 18 years without consuming bleach, which, ironically, would have more taste than their cooking and give me my will to live back.\n\nOk, I'm better now, see ya.",

        "selftext": "My, f29, boss, m late 40s, kept the camera feed of me on his computer screen at all times. Obligatory throw away account cause the details in this might be easy for some of my coworkers to find this and I don't want to give up my main account. Also I was posting this on am I over reacting but my update actually came as I was typing this on that sub so now I'm switching it to here that everything seems to be wrapped up.\n\nSo I work in a mostly male dominated field in a CNC machine shop as a brake operator. I am the only woman at my company that works on the shop floor. About a year ago there was a fist fight between 2 other operators and there were no cameras inside to show who started the fight so both operators had to be let go. To prevent this from happening again the cameras went up all over the shop. Absolutely no blind spots, crystal clear HD camers, we know this because our boss has a TV screen above his desk now where he can watch all the cameras. He can have up to 8 of the camera feeds on his screen at one time and it has the ability to cycle though all of the feeds, switching feeds every few minutes. \n\nThe problem came about a week ago when a coworker of mine came up to me and told me there was only one feed on the screen. Me at my machine. I have never been written up or even talked to about problems with my work so I was very thrown off by this. When I had the opportunity where I could think of a reason to go into his office to see for myself when I walked in his office sure enough I saw my empty station on the screen. I pretended not to notice and just asked a question about a part I was working on that could be a reasonable question and went back to my work like nothing was wrong. Over the next week or so I tried to put it out of my mind but I couldn't get past it and more coworkers approached me and said they saw me on the screen. \n\nSo late last week I went to HR and asked if I was in trouble for anything. The HR guy looked surprised and asked me what I was referring to and I told him how closely I'm being watched and it seems to be just me singled out. He said he would look into it and get back to me but as far as he knew there was nothing wrong. About an hour later I get called into the managers office with HR, screens are back to normal showing 8 different work areas. I'm happy for a second until I am asked why I'm spreading misinformation. I ask what they're talking about and I proceed to be gaslighted for the next 5 or so minutes about how the cameras have always been this way and I'm seeking attention. I say multiple coworkers have mentioned to me about seeing it and we can bring them in to ask. They threaten to write me up if I keep bringing up this \"blatant lie\" and that I'm slandering the manager to my fellow coworkers.\n\nI contact a lawyer cause at this point I'm like fuck it I'm going to quit this job anyway might as well raise a little hell but then part of me decides it's just not worth it and with everything I've been through lately its just not worth it. I decided to contact my ex who I've been broken up with for a year and fill him in. We we're together for 5 years and he's the love of my life, about a year ago he was offered his dream job across the country and asked me to go with him. My mother was dying of cancer at the time and I was the only one she had left to take care of her. He planned on turning down the job to stay with ne but I told him I'd never forgive myself if he passed on his dream job for me. About 6 months ago my mother passed and idk why I didn't contact him but it kinda felt like my whole world fell apart so I just accepted this was my life now.\n\nWhen I told him what was going on he said \"why don't you come move in with me?\" I didn't know it but he hadn't dated anyone since we broke up (and neither had i) because he had always planned on us reuniting after my mother passed and when she did he didn't want to rush me cause he wanted to wait until I was ready. I wasn't ready at all until he asked me that question but without hesitation I said yes. I put in an application that day at a CNC shop near where he lives and that was yesterday. So that's where this post was going to end on am I over reacting for picking up and moving across the country. And then the phone rang.\n\nApparently the place I was hiring was impressed with my years of experience and they're a newer shop so I actually have more experience running a brake then most of their employees. They offered my about a 25% raise of what I'm currently making and I accepted on the spot. They asked when I could start and I said next week. Immediately called my boss and told him he's a fucking creep and that I quit. HR has been calling me nonstop begging for me to reconsider but that ship has sailed. Ex bf or possibly just bf again said he's excited for me to move in but will be setting me up in a separate bedroom at first just so we can take things slow and figure things out which I think is very smart of him and I'm glad cause I think we need that time too.\n\nMy current landlady is an absolute sweetheart and knows how rough this year has been for me so she's letting me break my lease with no penalties and she already has someone lined up to take my apartment. I asked if they wanted to buy some of my furniture since I'm only taking what I can fit in my truck and they offered me a thousand buck for my living room set and all my drawers and dressers. Not having to worry about all that I can fir the rest of my stuff in my truck easily and I'm starting my cross country trek tonight. Fuck creeps and if you're thinking about putting up with that bullshit, don't. There's always another option, maybe even one youd.never thought possible.\n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hey guys. Throwaway account here—I (20F) just want to vent after a trip to the mall recently that legitimately made me realize just how much my body has changed. I tried on a dress in the size I was last year, and after I tried to force the zipper and it didn't work, I felt so disgusted with myself. \n\nI weighed myself on my scale for the first time in a while and realized I'd gained about 50 pounds in less than a year. I'd just started college, and a healthy eating and exercise routine I'd gotten into in my senior year of high school went down the drain during my first year as I began drinking more, getting takeout and eating out at least 4+ times a week, and not exercising (trying to balance a crazy social life with academics was just not something I was cut out for). \n\nThis year, I'm getting more into home cooking, exercising, and staying away from junk foods, but whenever I feel like I'm making progress I end up relapsing for some reason. For example, I made excuses during exam season and ended up getting a lot of takeout again, ruining my progress. Whenever I go out with friends or am with family, I feel too embarrassed to mention I'm trying to diet because I'd always been the chubby kid growing up, and I wanted to continue living as the \"thinner, glowed up\" person I'd become when that isn't who I am anymore. As a result, I end up eating a lot during hangouts or just giving in to temptations. I also sometimes have the bad mentality of \"I ate something unhealthy today already, might as well just use today as a cheat day\" way too often. \n\nOverall, this isn't just about the weight gain itself: I feel like I've lost the discipline I once had and my self-confidence just keeps slipping away. It's been a week or so after a stressful life season, and I'm attempting to start this process again. I'm now 3 days into my new routine of encouraging myself to get out more as well as eating healthier and reducing portions, and I've been seeing some good calorie deficits without even feeling too worn out. I hope I can keep up the progress this time. I need to do this for myself, not only for my physical appearance, but my mindset and to re-instill discipline. I'm not trying to make excuses, just ranting about everything here to get it off my chest. If anyone sees this, thanks for reading! ",

        "selftext": "I (14M) and my friend (14F) have been friends since childhood. People say that we are both attractive for our ages and because of that we often get shipped as a couple by our other friends. It doesn't bother me that much because I am used to hearing stuff like this. My father, however, gave me some requirements for marriage and they are odd. One of the requirements is my partner can't be the same age or older than me. The thing is, when we started talking over text, things escalated. Now we call each other romantic names. And the topic of us having children came up more than once. And there is also my friend (2 years older than me. Let's call him WILLIAM) and WILLIAM has feelings for my friend (F). But the guilt is eating me out. My parents gave me freedom and I am misusing it. Though we read in different schools, our friends and mutual friends know about us. Her friends often flirt with me for being very handsome. Though my face is one of my biggest insecurities. Yesterday I was in the bathroom of our community hall. And I saw her. She said hello, I said too. We talked and she started flirting with me. I didn't find it weird since she has done it more than once, so we were in the bathroom and she suddenly asked me \"Will you kiss me?\" I paused. And when I did, she came over and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I blushed so hard that when my mom noticed she said \"what happened, why are you blushing?\" I couldn't tell her the real reason, so I made one up. Next day she messaged me to meet in the same place. I went thinking she surely couldn't do it again. When I met her we talked for a few mins and she asked if I could kiss her as well. I didn't wanna hurt her but at the same time I am afraid of my parents. So I kissed her on her hand. She was happy, I was too, but deep down, I was dying. Now I am sitting in my room thinking, should I confess my feelings for her or should i tell abt my feelings to WILLIAM. I have to make a decision quick because this secret is something I cant hide forever.",

        "selftext": "I (14f) dress in a more alternative style (I'm goth but when trying to be comfortable switch over to grunge). As we all know, A LOT of alternative music is very 'depressing' if you can call it that, I think everyone understands. A large portion of alternative teens is also.., severely depressed. \n\nI met most of my alternative friends in the psych ward, or through friends of friends. I love them, they're fun and I used to feel like they understood me. I was in said psych ward for self harm and suicide about a year and a bit ago and yes, I still have my moments but I have learnt to manage my emotions, weaned off self harm and am no longer suicidal. I have been taking meds for depression and anxiety, but I got taken off a while ago and I am doing fine. I no longer have that 'what's the point of anything' outlook on life. I look forward to graduating, getting married, becoming independent and having children. I still have my fleeting problems with anxiety but as mentioned, in the long run I'm FINE. \n\nA lot of those friends have not gotten better. But not in the sense that they haven't been able to. I have been speaking to them and they have expressed that they don't want to get better. They are content being depressed. They also consume sad media constantly, like movies and music, and they're OKAY with that. \n\nI, though, have grown not so fond of it. I love them but I feel like I can't be around people that don't want to get better. I don't think it's a good influence to hang out with severe addicts. I don't want it to seem like I am abandoning them because they're too hard to deal with, but I don't want to put myself in friendgroups with alcoholics, people who are severely depressed and people who are constantly NEGATIVE. \n\nI came to this conclusion when one of my friends reccomeneded smoking to get rid of my problem, and I think that's when I knew that this is not the enviorment I want to be in. I just can't keep listening to the same problems over and over again when they don't want or care to fix them. \n\nI'm also starting to grow out of the alternative style. I'd rather wear bright colours and make myself look as colourful, joyful and feminine as possible. The goth make up is something I'm not into either anymore, I just don't like having people stare. \n\nNow, I recently turned to God and my friends have been.. not accepting. I told my best friend I wanted to try religion again and she got mad. She said I was abandoning her in atheism and \"Who will we hate on Christians with now?\" She doesn't like the idea of me going to church or ordering a Bible. We have had multiple arguments about this. She also recently did something controversial that I won't get into. I said I was reconsidering our friendship because of it and when she asked why I stated my reasons and added that I don't think her actions align with the type of people I should be surrounding myself with according to scripture. She got mad and blocked me. \n\nI'm sick of being misreable, sick of acting like nobody understands and sick of acting like I'm some tortured poet. I'm not. They're not.",

        "selftext": "This happened two years ago and I still cry when I think about this. I had a coworker at one point who had very thin boundaries - she would consistently causally trauma dump at work without regard to how it affected others and mostly coped with her trauma through drinking. I’m fairly certain she was drinking at work, but never saw her take swigs. Just saw her acting intoxicated and smelling like alcohol. I grew up with an alcoholic parent, so her behavior was fairly uncomfortable for me to be around, meaning I did not get close to her even though she shared many very private things with me. I almost wish I had invested in her more just so I would know more about her family - maybe I would have had enough information to intervene if I had befriended her. \n\nOne day, her niece came in to work with her. This little girl was probably about 5. When she walked in the door, she had her hands cupped around the sides of her face so she could only see the ground in front of her. She made no eye contact and would not verbally respond to anyone, including her aunt. \n\nThis was the angriest child I have ever seen. She glared at everyone, held her hands in fists for almost the entire time she was there, stayed completely silent, and kept her back to the wall for the majority of the time she was in the shop. I’ve been through a lot of trauma therapy and it was very obvious to me that this child was hyper-vigilant if not in fight or flight. \n\nAfter the child was picked up by another family member, I stepped outside for a smoke. My coworker, the aunt of the child, was already outside smoking. \n\nI sat down next to her and she casually said to me “my niece told her friend that someone licked her hooha.” It was like cold water had been dumped over my head as she told me more about it. I felt so sick for so many reasons. A FIVE YEAR OLD told their friend that someone licked their private parts, that friend told her mom, who told my coworker’s niece’s parents. And no one was doing anything actionable. No therapy, no intervention, no questions. Just shrugs and “hope that’s not actually happening”. \n\nAfter my shift I called child services and went to the police station by my work. I tried everything I could to get a report filed, a welfare check done, literally anything. Because I didn’t have the name of the child’s parents, the police AND child services told me I didn’t have enough information to complete a report. I called so many times with different ideas of how I could make a legitimate report, but I simply didn’t have enough information. \n\nI think about this multiple times a week, sometimes every day for the entire day. I myself am someone who survived CSA. I have complex trauma and I know what it’s like to be a child in a setting where no adults are protecting you, even when they know what’s going on. \n\nOur boss commit suicide that same week, so everything at that work place became even more chaotic very quickly. I left because I could not cope with the instability. Part of me wishes I had stayed just to garner more information, but that work place was so toxic that I started to experience suicidal ideation. I had to leave for my safety. Now that I’m farther removed from the experience, I feel like I could have pulled myself up by my bootstraps and stayed long enough to get more info for the sake of this little girl. \n\nI’m not sure why I’m sharing this. Yesterday this popped up in my head for the millionth time and I had such a strong reaction to the memory that I vomited. I will never be able to get the image of that little child’s angry face out of my head. I don’t think I’ll ever forget her and I will always wonder if there is something I could have done to help. ",

        "selftext": "20 years ago, I was a stupid teenager in love. My boyfriend was 23 and I was 16. Things started out great, but they progressively worsened as he introduced me to drugs. By the end of it all, I was working for an escort agency, giving the boyfriend my money. I was bullied and forced into fucking old men and I was scared to leave my relationship. My parents finally found me (I had run away) and managed to get me help. I turned things around and ended up doing well in life. I never told anyone what had happened and I had planned to take it to my grave.\n\nFast forward 15 years (5 years ago), a detective knocks on my door. He wanted to know about my ex and the sex trafficking. I reluctantly spoke with him and agreed to do some recorded phone calls at the police station in order to get a confession. I also turned over my high school journals that detailed the abuse and rapes. We recorded a two-hour confession that detailed everything. It felt like a slam dunk. That was 2 years ago.\n\nGuys, it's been 5 years and I am tired. I am tired of waiting 3-6 months to hear back from the detective. I'm tired of having to tell and retell my story to different detectives. The further I get away from it, the less I remember, and the less credible I sound. I'm tired of worrying about my safety, and if people will even believe me. And I'm tired of getting my hopes up, only to hear back from the DA that they're working on more pressing matters. I get that my case is \"old news\" and not a priority. I don't begrudge the detectives for prioritizing more current, relevant cases. But I'm tired of advocating for a win that I don't think I'll ever see.\n\nSo today, I will be emailing the detective and asking them to drop the case. I wanted to hang on because I wanted to get this dude on the sex offender registry, so that other girls wouldn't have to go through what I did. But I can't be a martyr and sacrifice myself any longer for this cause.\n\nI have no one to talk to about this. And I just need to say that I'm sorry, and I tried :(",

I think that my mental health has been plummeting really bad and I just don’t know who I can talk to anymore. \n\nIt started when I have been having chest pain for the last two months or so then about three weeks ago I was hospitalised due to that chest pain. The diagnosis given was due to GERD and I have really severe case of GERD. Hospitals in general has always been very depressing for me and while I was stuck there, it definitely feels lonely. \n\nMy loneliness amplifies when the people I am surrounded with doesn’t acknowledge me as much anymore. I am in college and I have a group of friends including me there’s 5 of us. While I was not with them, the 4 of them did stuff together and went on to have sleepovers. I think what hit the most was that none of them says they wished I was there. It was simply a thing they did between them and then it was never brought up again. \n\nIt becomes more evident how used they are already without having me around. They made plans without including me. Even though, I was there. It would be nice just to get an invitation. I assumed they didn’t ask because I might not be able to make it due to transportation issues. \n\nI wish I was a little more seen. \n\nI’m sorry if this is all over the place, I just need to let it out somewhere.

They deserve a happy one that doesn’t constantly fight with anxiety and depressing thoughts. Maybe that’s why he cheated? Maybe that’s why he went out of his way again to look for more women… to find someone who is everything he wants cause clearly I am not that someone. I am nothing and he just reminded me of that. I hate myself for being so weak. I am so scared. I am terrified of confronting him when he gets home from work. I am so afraid of tearing apart my family all because he can’t be loyal.

What is so wrong with me that he just can’t be loyal to?\n\nMaybe it’s because I’m a stay at home mom? \nI don’t have a career and that’s the women he chases. Everything I own, he bought for me.

I could’ve braved any storm with him by my side… and now I have to go at it alone. I don’t know what to do. Someone please help me. I don’t want to kill myself, but I want to die.

The problem is, whenever I get a call, my 4G+ drops to H+ and my game starts lagging, which is a huge deal in a game like MLBB where being AFK can ruin everything. So, I hung up. He called again, and I hung up again.\n\nNow, for some reason, both he and another friend are acting weird toward me—like they’re purposely cutting me off. They avoid me, walk ahead of me but constantly look back to check if I’m gone, and just overall act distant.\n\nThe part that really got me was when I asked for a cigarette. They claimed they didn’t have any, but they were literally heading to our usual smoking spot. Another friend (who isn’t aware of what’s going on) also asked for a cigarette, and I saw them looking back at me, almost like they were waiting for me to leave before giving him one.\n\nAt that moment, I knew they were avoiding me. So, I walked up to them quickly and made an excuse that I needed to go cook. One of them realized that I had caught on and started feeling bad. As I was leaving, he suddenly said, “Wait, maybe he has some.” It was like he was trying to make up for it, but it just confirmed that they were avoiding me in the first place.\n\nWhat bothers me the most is that I’ve always been there whenever they called or asked me to hang out. But the one time I decline, they start treating me like this? I don’t get it. If they were upset that I didn’t answer, why not just say something instead of acting all passive-aggressive?\n\nAm I wrong for feeling betrayed by this?\n",

Now I think about it every day and have panic attacks because of it.\n\nBack then, we weren’t together yet, but he knew that I was in love with him. One evening, we were at his best friend’s place, and the two of them were smoking a bong. They wanted me to smoke as well. I asked what it was, and they said weed. Being stupid, I took a hit, but whatever it was, it definitely wasn’t weed. At first, I got extremely dizzy, then I couldn’t move anymore, and I started panicking inside because I couldn’t speak or even breathe.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, his best friend told him to check if I was still breathing, which he did. When he confirmed that I was still breathing, the other guy left the room to go to sleep. That’s when my ex started undressing me and then had sex with me. It must have lasted for several hours, and towards the end, I was somewhat conscious again and could have said something. But I didn’t—I just couldn’t.\n\nAt some point, he stopped, and I went home. I had never felt as horrible lying in my own bed as I did after that night. Afterward, I desperately wanted to be with him—probably because I thought it would somehow undo what had happened. About a year later, we actually got together.\n\nBut maybe I’m overinterpreting the situation. After all, he knew I loved him, so maybe he thought I wanted it too. \n\n\nI’ll probably talk to my therapist about it, but I’m afraid I’m making it into something bigger than it actually was. Besides, it was my fault too. I don’t know, I just wanted to get it off my chest.\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "I posted on here about four months ago.(you can go read my other post before this one if you want) My dad had Cirrhosis of the liver due to years of alcohol abuse. He was diagnosed with it back in September of 2024 and has been in and out of the hospital since then. It started off with his liver failing and slowly went to his kidneys starting to fail. His feet, legs and stomach were pretty much always full of fluid that he was constantly needing to go get drained and he was always in pain. He went into to hospice about a week ago and one of his last wishes were to be at home so my grandparents had the hospital bed and all the equipment set up at there house. Once he was at home In hospice he went down hill really fast. He was confused most of the time, and the rest of the time he was sleeping. \n\nI got a call from my grandfather around 8:30am on Monday that I needed to get over there as fast as I can because they didn’t think he wasn’t going to make it much longer. I got over there around 10:30am and honest to god wasn’t prepared for how horrible he looked. He went down hill so fast. His oxygen levels were at 30% and his heart rate was 45bpm. My grandma cranked up his oxygen and was able to get it back up to 94%. His eyes were open but you could tell he really wasn’t seeing anything. He could hear us but couldn’t talk, he could hardly breathe,every breath he took was a gasp and then nothing for a second and then a gasp again. All the immediate family was there, talking to him to let him know that we were there and that we loved him. It got to the point where we couldn’t even get a BP reading on him and his finger monitor for his O2 and HR weren’t getting readings as well. He passed away about four hours after I got there on Monday, March 3rd at 2:02pm. Him taking his last breath will forever be stuck in my head. \n\nThank you to whoever decided to read this, I just really needed somewhere to write down what happened. It still doesn’t feel real. ",

        "selftext": "\nFor the context, our love felt more beautiful than anything I’d read in books or seen in movies, deeper and more real in a way that’s hard to explain. Part of it was because we both had real trauma growing up, which made us so similar. We bonded so purely and beautifully, expressing our truest selves to each other. It was more than I ever could’ve dreamed of. Even our first kiss, after nearly a year of waiting, was unlike anything else, the world didn’t just feel like it stopped, it did. We were also overwhelmed, and he cried like babies as he kissed me. That’s the kind of bond we had.\n\nI never wanted long distance, so he promised he’d move to my city, but he never did, mentioning financial reasons. Still, he visited every few months, and we always looked forward to those moments. He even deactivated his socials on his own, though I never had any problem or concern with them. \n\nOf course, not everything was perfect. His one toxic trait: whenever things didn’t go his way, or we argued, he’d start disrespecting and insulting me. It was a dealbreaker, but I still tried to be understanding. He had no real human connections all his life. He never even got to talk much to his family because of it being dysfunctional, no close friends, zero experience in relationships. I told myself he just can’t do any better, or could be because BPD runs in his family, or maybe because of the traumatic environment he grew up in. \n\nBut now, for the last four months, things were rough. We even broke up for a few days, ironically after our first intimate experience. I felt insecure or anxious afterward (he was my first boyfriend, and I have a bit of sexual trauma too), but he misunderstood it, assuming I didn’t like it or didn’t want it again. After that, he changed, became indifferent, stopped reassuring me, and didn’t seem to care about the relationship at all or even if we break up. It reinforced my fear that he didn’t feel the same anymore, trapping us in a cycle of blame and misunderstandings. I had spent so many nights crying during that time. \n\nHe eventually felt sorry and we fixed things, but I had already noticed a red flag: he seemed to care about physical intimacy more than anything; and shut down when he thought he wouldn’t get it. So then I started noticing more. During this rough phase, he reactivated his accounts, made new ones and never mentioned even after we patched up, and tried to hide them when asked. It also started needling me for the first time that why had he never added me on his instagram and its been so long we’re together, and I once saw a text from a coworker that felt off.\n\nI couldn’t ignore it all anymore. So, I decided to have a sudden, intense conversation with him, hoping his reactions would reveal the truth. \n\nThen his reactions did reveal. A lot. Not just cheating or anything, but about his whole identity. \n\nI started asking, he was so confident with his grand words and said that I can have his passwords and his phone (because he knew I’d never do that I don’t believe in invading privacy in a relationship). He kept manipulating me into believing there was nothing, and I almost fell for it, he was that good. But then, we stumbled upon the conversation with his coworker. He initially refused to let me see it, then tried to manipulate the situation. When I finally read it, I noticed he had tampered with it. The last text had originally been 12 weeks ago, but now it showed 17 weeks ago. And then, the part that made my heart sink: them talking about how fun it would be when he will move to Germany, and how she would be waiting for him.\n\nThat explains why he was so excited and obsessed about moving there, it didn’t make sense to me. But I believed it could be because he’s travelling alone for the first time. Those texts were from months ago, right after he started that job. Now, five months in, i believe they must have something concrete going on. It’s pretty clear from the way he provided no further clarifications when I saw that and refused to show anything else (they converse usually on discord he could’ve shown that if he was real). \n\n\nBut what struck me even more than the cheating was seeing in real time, how good he is at manipulation. My friends warned me, but I never believed it. He seemed too pure-hearted. But that day, I saw it: how effortlessly he lies. I’ve never seen anyone lie that efficiently. Even when I was trying to ask, he turned down all of my questions with so great replies that I started feeling like “What am I even thinking?”\n\n\nHe was even at that time making a grand gift for my birthday. It included multiple handmade beautiful gifts including a scrapbook, different boxes each with different kinds of letters and tapes in it for different situations. He was even better with words, the things he said, and the way he made me feel. It’s driving me insane. How can someone be that person (and) be cheating at the same time?? It’s giving me a complete identity crisis. If he’s really this good at manipulation, like I saw yesterday, then none of his words were real. His entire personality was fake.\n\nHe was standing there so willing, so confident about giving me passwords or proving his loyalty. But the moment I “actually asked”, he changed completely. He stalled, started arguing and gaslighting, clearly, anything to buy time. He tried deleting chats right in front of me, thinking I wouldn’t notice, thinking he could gaslight me again. Maybe he was too frantic to cover his tracks this time, but it was so obvious. This time he was maybe too much in a panic to realise how evident his manipulation is or to control what I’m thinking. And I know the coworker thing is just the one thing I happened to catch. The way he deleted other chats before giving me a bit of an access, it all proves there was so much more happening, in those months. Until now. \n\nThis has traumatized me to the point where I feel like nothing is real. Like I’ll wake up and everything around me will be gone, like everything is in my head. I know this is just the trauma speaking, and hopefully, I’ll be okay soon. But it has shaken me to my core. If this is true, then everything—he—was a lie.\n\nHow can someone be so convincing, so manipulative? For the first time in my life, I’ve seen deception on this scale, and it’s terrifying.\n\nIn a nutshell I observed so big of a contradiction between what he is portraying so confidently and the real truth. And now I don’t know who he is.",

She's the most intelligent (it's actually incredible), she's sweet as pie, with a sense of humour as good as silver, and she's gorgeous. She's objectively the best. She's in a league that's hers alone. But what *actually* makes her special is the sense of bliss and hope her presence creates.\n\nIn June 2024, my then-best friend started talking to her—intimately—just two weeks after he stopped begging his ex (who he'd been super manipulative &amp; toxic to) to take him back. I trusted him when he insisted I was just being paranoid. Then, two weeks in, he became her first boyfriend. She had once hated him but dismissed his past behaviour as “just alcohol and family problems.” She believes he's the only one who understands her. He lied repeatedly, told her I liked her just before asking her out, and even lied that I had slapped him. I was humiliated. Looking back, he was always a sleazy friend.\n\nIt's been 9 months since. I've become increasingly lonely as I have to avoid most hangouts because for the sakes of my mental stability I cannot bear to be around my ex friend. The rest of my friend group seems unbothered. Neutrality is king.\n\nI feel I've been unremorsefully abandoned by everyone close to me in favour of some weasel who solely acts in self-interest with no regard for morality or empathy. I feel so disposable. It feel purposeless and as if the world were mocking all which I believe in. It's killing me. Every breath is exhausting. Living like this makes life itself unbearable.\n\nThe worst part is it's all my fault. I hate myself for it. I had so much time to be the one to connect with her, or even to just admit my feelings, but I never did. I promise it wasn't a lack of will but one of wit. I would've done anything, but I didn't know anything to do. I still don't really get the whole emotional connection thing. Maybe that's why I'm disposable.\n\nI don't know what to do with myself anymore, I'd appreciate any advice.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway acc. \n\nI F29 feel stuck in my life and feel sad. I’ve felt like this for a number of years. In fact it started when I started my current role in healthcare after qualifying form university. I’ve thought about a career change so many times and have dabbled in a few things but haven’t fully dove into anything bc as much as I dislike my job, I’m good at it and earn a decent salary. It’s also a safe job. \n\nLong story short, I come from a poor working class background, mum with mental health issues, parents divorced and live separately. Mum is on benefits and dad works a minimum wage job. I come from a background where we don’t just abandon our parents and I love them and want to help them. I’m however an only child. \n\nI’ve been married to an amazing person a number of years ago and as amazing as he is, he too is burdened with family issues. We also live with the in-laws. His mother became disabled last year and a lot of her care is depended on him. He also holds responsibility for his disabled sister as well. He does a lot for everyone; he’s practically had to be the dad of the family since his dad wasn’t around much when they were younger. But now I see it taking a toll on him and he won’t admit it, only in snippets he says ‘I sleep so much bc I’m so stressed’. I try to support him as much as I can, but he’s doesn’t want me to get more stressed with my family stress too.\n\nI believe my stress comes from having a poor relationship with money. But let’s not deny that you need money to survive in this world. However, I feel this huge financial burden that I need to provide for my parents, especially as they near to pensioning ages and I really don’t want their financial stress when we have children bc no doubt it will happen. \n\nI had a plan of my job role for this year and it was going to allow me to be in a higher position and earn more money. However, this now is either not going to happen or will be delayed. Then I questioned myself, do I even want it? Or am I doing it to save my family from poverty. \n\nThe problem is that I don’t want know what I want to do. I went into this career path when I was younger but I regretted it so much. Due to stress I’ve developed PCOS and I’m 2st heavier than my previous baseline. I’m always tired, my husband is always tired and I feel that we don’t enjoy life as much bc of all responsibilities and we don’t even have children yet!!! Adding children onto this will just cause misery I’m sure of it \n\nI just don’t know what to do. We’re all trying our best but before being married, even in a relationship; when I felt stuck I would change my environment and look for things to do. I can’t do it as much anymore bc it’s not a me decision anymore it’s a we decision and although we have plans to move out, we’re saving up and you know what the housing market is like, so it will take a while.\n\nAnyways thanks for reading this if you got to the end 🫶🏽",

When it was the 5 of us and I was having troubles keeping up with the older ones, we would run around each town we lived in and just have fun. We'd walk to stores and parks, we even lived in a rural hot valley area (basically a desert) and would roam around and tell each other stories. \n\nWe'd have hang out spots with other kids and play until sundown. Then we'd sprint home because Mom told us to be home by the time the street lights are on and they were already on. \n\nI miss when my brothers were into drawing so we would all sit at the table and draw together. We'd also play board games, card games  (even poker lol) all day and have a blast. When we got a console we would sit and watch my brothers play games like Skyrim, Fall Out or we would play Halo 4 together. \n\nI hold all of these moments so close to me even though i don't talk to any of my siblings anymore. I can't bring myself to, not after the trauma we all went through. My mother was terribly abusive. It was always us against her. Then it became her against me because my older siblings moved out all at once and i became the focal point for her negative emotions. I'd be lying if i said i wasn't a little resentful about that. But i understand it now.\n\nI don't have any emotional connections to my siblings anymore, last time i was around all of them they all felt like strangers. I guess im \"emotionally estranged\". \n\nMy family is just really broken. I miss how it was before we all realized it. I think it was the realization that made everyone leave. \n\nI know the abuse was happening my entire childhood, but i miss what it's like having a sibling. \n\nI crave familial connections, it's why i'm so desperate to have my own family, but not with my mother and siblings. I guess I feel as if things are too fucked up to try to start over with them. \n\nI feel bad about it tho. I tried getting involved when my younger sibling went through horrific abuse but there was only so much i could do. Being able to do nothing except watch it unfold broke me again and gave me an even bigger reason to never talk to my mom again. \n\nBut i can't even bring myself to contact that sibling.\n\nAnytime something bad happens to one of us it makes it harder for me to reach out. I'm not sure why but i know it's not normal \n\nI just miss being a kid and having people to depend on. it used to be us against the world but now it's just me.\n\nIt just gets lonely sometimes.",

Yesterday, my friend revealed to me that he's absolutely sure that my ex had a girlfriend he has been with for a variable time span (it could be three months, but also ten, surely less than a year though). This girl was the classic friend \"I didn't have to worry about\" and she's absolutely beautiful and also a really kind person.

I keep comparing my life to her and saying I wish I had her life to her, which puts a strain on our relationship she said she finds me less attractive when I’m like that but I can’t stop thinking about how much better her life is to mine. \n\nEdit: thank you for all the responses, I’ve already spoken to a school counsellor and she gave me the bare bones “don’t compare yourself to anyone” advice which is easier said than done. Secondly by success and recognition I mean that she won an art competition on national tv at a young age and is currently working on art piece that will be displayed in a museum. In recent times I’ve been feeling hopeless about my own future because I don’t think I enjoy maths as much as I used to and she made me realise that life would be a lot better if I enjoyed what I did, I just feel really depressed right now about it all",

But then I had to move to my real home with my father, mother, and brother. I joined a new school, and everything changed. I struggled to keep up with the new environment, and my schooling started falling apart. I became depressed.\n\nSomehow, I managed to pass my 10th through NIOS open school. Then I joined a government school for my 11th, but I fell into the wrong friendships. That led to me being sent off from school.\n\nHere comes the plot twist...\n\nAfter that, I was just sitting idle at home while my brother was doing his BTech in Biomedical Engineering from a well-known government college. My father had passed away by then, and I started feeling like a burden to my mother. I wanted to help her financially, so I started looking for jobs.\n\nFor two years, I worked multiple jobs—petrol pump operator, hospital attender, security guard—just trying to earn something.\n\nThen, in November 2019, after quitting my exhausting job as a hospital attender at the age of 19, I joined Delhivery as a courier delivery person. The job was insanely tough—at least 30 deliveries per day for a salary of ₹8,000 per month. I lasted two weeks before quitting and joining Swiggy as a delivery rider.\n\nSwiggy was fun at first. I was earning daily, spending recklessly on food and cigarettes, just living in the moment without thinking about the future.\n\nThen, two weeks later, everything changed.\n\nOne late night, around 11 PM, on my way back home, I met with a horrific accident. A truck carrying a full load of wood logs crashed into my bike.\n\nThat moment destroyed my life and shattered my mother’s hopes.\n\nI was bedridden for 4 years. My injuries were severe—multiple fractures, permanent damage to my hip and leg. The hospital treatment was not good enough, and recovery was extremely difficult.\n\nBut I didn’t give up.\n\nAfter years of suffering, I finally started walking again. And now, I’ve joined BCA online at Manipal University Jaipur to build a better future for myself. I’m learning to code, and I want to use this opportunity to change my life.\n\nI don’t know where this journey will take me, but I’m not giving up.\n\nThanks for reading.

        "selftext": "Edit: i forgot the obligatory Click meniton  \nI (16M) have a mother who loves birds, especially cockateils, she has three in total, until about 2 months ago. two of them ended up getting a little too close and WHAM. babies. Now my mother is overall not very good at parenting, she messed up me and my sister pretty bad. But when it comes to her pets she at least acts like she loves them.\n\nNow when these babies hatched, two survived, and they were looking really nice and healthy, that was until a couple weeks ago. my mother was starting to get annoyed at their constant screaming (you know... as babies do) and decided that they were eating enough seed, it wouldnt matter if they were seperated or not from their parents (they were still being fed by their mother and father occasionally throughout the day). so cue her forcibly taking them, cramming them into a small cage, and not letting them see their parents anymore so they \"wouldnt scream again\".\n\ni was going to say something, but due to being too scared to say anything (if anyone disagrees with her on something big, she gets explosive) i kept my mouth shut. i mainly helped her with them when we had to hand feed them when they were infants, so i wasnt as worried as checking on them as i should have been, becuase i thought she could handle it. aparently i was wrong, she cant, and her decision to seperate them ended up being fatal for the youngest. in heindsight i think he was stressed from being seperated from his mom so suddenly, and so he stopped eating. according to my mom, he haddent really been eating too much over the past two weeks or so (ie, since she seperated them). i could be wrong though. (i have some experience with birds and i at least do my reserch.)\n\nthe youngest couldnt stand up. just trying to walk resulted in him just stumbling and falling over. i asked my mom why dont we take them to an avian vet, to see if something was wrong, and her words were \"i dont want to deal with some sick bird, its too stressful. if they die they die. and plus the vet bill will probably be 200 dollars and i dont want to spend that much\" so cue me flabbergasted, i try and hand feed the bird, at least a little bit. and it works, he's eating some, and putting him on his mother's cage floor, and hes slowly eating some seeds. im estatic, and i think, \"oh, ill check up on him in an hour.\"\n\ncue me falling asleep for a few hours instead, and  i wake up to check on him, and he's already passed away. i tell her, and what does she say? \"oh well, i'll bury him tomorrow put him in a plastic bag until then\" (not really relevent, she buried all our previous pets in plastic ziplock bags and such so thats going to be a nice supprise for the next owner. i recommended that she stop doing that but she still does anyway)\n\ni cant belive im related to her, how can one person be so heartless. she loves all her pets until they get sick, then theyre just another burden to her, talk about unconditinal. and worst thing is, i bet she wont even listen and pretend like it died from some illness. again, it could have been something else but im pretty confident she killed it.\n\ntldr: my mom shouldnt have birds, and especially never should have tried to hatch and raise baby cockateils if she really gets annoyed that easily. birds will be noisey (i know from experience).",

        "selftext": "I definitely need to see a therapist about this one :\n(TW: CA, SA, and self-harm)\n\nI (21F) had this life-altering experience when I was around 15 or 16, during high school. At the time, the friend group was fairly large and a friend of mine started dating a new student, we all had gotten close pretty quick since we all hung out together and that was the dynamic then.\n\nDuring class one day he sent me a Snapchat asking if I could step out to talk about my friend—his girlfriend. Thinking something was wrong, I asked the teacher if I could be excused (which she allowed because we were just making valentine’s day cards and class would be over shortly.) What started as an innocent conversation about childish relationship drama suddenly shifted.\n\n(TW) I was choked to the point where I lost focus in my eyes, and what felt like blood circulation being cut off, I’d been sa’d and I froze... while I was panicking internally I kept thinking it wouldn’t go any farther knowing we were LITERALLY in a main hallway with a camera right above us. So it felt impossible that something like this could be happening in such a visible place... clearly i was wrong and naive.\n\nAt the time, I didn’t fully understand what had happened, but the bell had rung and our friend group met as usual, walking each other to our next period. That’s when I had a panic attack. A friend noticed and as I’m trying to explain what happened she notices our vice principal, of course my friend tells her, to which I’m immediately sent to the principal’s office.\n\nI explained everything. They told me they would “conduct an investigation” and sent me home. I was never given the opportunity to write a report. I ended up missing a month+ of school with no updates on the situation. My parents would constantly call the school wondering when I’ll be able to go back, how i’m going to catch up on my work etc. we eventually were called in for a meeting. Most of the meeting now is a blur, besides the infamous hurtful quote of all time “It seems like you wanted to,”  my heart drops and I shut down, I remember the same unable to breathe  feeling and was in complete shock as my parents scolded me. \n\nI was still sent home after this as they would figure out our next steps. From when the situation first began to the conclusion we’d gotten (TW) I endured physical, verbal, and emotional abuse from my parents. Over time, I started believing it was my fault—something I still struggle with today. That belief led to years of severe self exiting ideations and harm.\n\n(Note the both of us were eventually allowed back in school, but I had be isolated in a office and he’d been in ISD (in school detention, eventually he moved))\n\nFast forward to years of no contact, he reached out with an apology. By then, I had already let go and forgiven the situation. If I’m honest, I hold far more resentment toward my parents than him—at least he apologized….\n\nMore recently, we crossed paths on social media. We caught up through texts, he would apologized again, I’d make dark humor jokes out of it, called, etc., it felt like the old friends we were before the bad. And for a moment, I thought he had changed. I felt relieved—happy even—to know he had grown into a better person. As time passed I stopped hearing from him… and out of curiosity I ask his roommate if everything was okay with him.\n\nI found out he had been arrested.\n(TW) Domestic assault and battery plus Domestic assault and battery by strangulation.\n(Note: He’s now released and there were no charges from the plaintiff)\n\nGuys — It feels like I’m subconsciously reliving that nightmare that once was. I don’t know why, and I can’t shake it. The scariest part is I can’t stop thinking about the woman he hurt… I don’t even know her, but I’m fixated on her. And for him… I don’t know where to begin on how I feel.. I feel stupid, guilt, naive to thinking he was a good person… I feel empathy, concern, and curiosity… I feel angry, condemnation, and to shame him… I feel like I need to do something but I don’t know what to do.\n\nWhat is wrong with me?! Why is this effecting me so heavily?!?!",

        "selftext": "(Mobile User, idk if that still matters lol)\n\nOkay so, I (19nb afab) am in love with my best friend, let’s call him Eren (18m afab). \nMe and Eren met in college when we were both 16 and have been practically inseparable for the past year, he’s funny, honest, kind, thoughtful and absolutely everything wonderful that a person can be and as I’ve said, we are closer than ever. \n\nNow Eren has a fun habit of playfully, platonically flirting with me it’s always been our dynamic, he jokingly flirts with me, I jokingly flirt back and we’ve always found it funny. However, for the past few months I’ve been finding myself growing more and more flustered by his flirting, but in a good way? To the point where I’m starting to overcompensate by making it very VERY clear that it’s all in good fun, afraid of him finding out I like him. I don’t want to ruin our friendship with this, I can’t lose him. \n\nAnother thing is, I’m fully not his type. He loves tall, masculine, strong men, and I’m none of that. I’m 5’2, not strong and feminine leaning in my appearance, I’m the complete opposite of his type and it kills me to know that. \n\nI’m just so lost, I want to tell him how I feel, but I don’t want to ruin things. I’m trying so hard to be there for him as a friend, but my heart shatters every time he talks about some guy he’s talking to and knowing I will never be that person. \n\nBut yeah, that it all, any advice would be appreciated but isn’t expected, thank you for reading.\n\nTLDR: I’m in love with my best friend but I’m not his type and I don’t want to ruin our friendship by telling him how I feel.

She might be nothing special to your run-off-the-mill Chad, with her stretch marks and mom-bod and all. But she’s everything to me, and that’s inevitable.

They’re inseparable to me. I crave to make love to her personality and her tired smile, and I wish to be able to do even more for her than I already do. She’s so dedicated to our children and to myself, I wish upon the fucking star there was some way I could let her feel exactly how immense her beneficial impact is on me as well as the kids. I wish I could mind-meld with her so I won’t struggle this much to express it.\n\nShe is the love of my life. And I can’t tell her right now the way I want to, because she’s finally asleep.

        "selftext": "My best friend since we were in middle school has had a rough few years since he knocked up his girlfriend. Mostly about money. They went in debt for a shot gun wedding, and they went into debt to get a mortgage, and it's been gradually getting worse over the last 4 years. \n\n He's been in panic mode about it for a while, and he's overwhelmed having to work 60-hour weeks on top of child care, errands, and housework. His wife also has a spending problem that he just can't seem to shake because she gets what she wants. \n\n They just got their tax money, and he was saying that all of it needed to go to debt or they'd start having collections come. His wife wanted to go to Florida for her friends wedding. He protested, but ultimately, he agreed to go for the weekend. He told me he didn't really have the PTO or money, but they can't go on vacation this year otherwise, so it's something. \n\n They got down there and did the wedding, and instead of coming back, they decided to go to Disney World for two weeks. I didn't even bother asking about the money or anything. I just told him to have fun. This immediately worried me because he's been talking a lot lately about suicidal feelings and he refuses to seek help because he \"don't have the time or money\" and insist he'd never do anything, just saying hoping he dies in a accident so his family would be taken care of. \n\n Everyone has heard of those Disney trips that are before divorce, abandonment, or suicide and I'm really worried that's what this is. His debt is well over 6 figures, not including his mortgage, and he's suddenly spending like there is no tomorrow and not worried about it not worried about it He seems extremely happy but I'm worried about him. I asked about his situation, and he left me on read. I hope he won the lottery or something down there. ",

Who I knew was an alcoholic but I didn't realize was a drug addict. (meth and cocaine, apparently)\n Boy, that was a doozy when I figured that out. So naive on my part. \n\n Until therapy. Therapy was great for me. I didn't even know I was being abused until my therapist was basically like, \"Hey. None of this is normal. This is not okay.\" Even though my family and friends were worried for me and tried to get me to see it, I continued to stand up for my ex and cover for them until therapy. \n\nWherever you are Therapist Jas, you helped me start to save myself. \n\nWhen I decided I wanted out, all i wanted were my things and my dogs. No smear campaign. No fights. Just my items and to disappear into the void. Things did not work out like that, actually. \n\nThey didn't allow me to take most of my things, most of which were given to me by my great grandma and grandma.\n\n I left with two duffel bags and a tote. \n\nOn the day they were \"nice enough\" to let me get more of my things, all i ended up with was my great grandmas table (which was a win to me) and some lovely boxes of actual garbage can trash that they put together for me. Including but not limited to old food wrappers, contents from multiple ash trays, a sex toy I'd never seen, and most of my photos ripped into tiny shreds. They would not let me have my dogs. \n\nLike a buffoon, for weeks I attempted to get my dogs back. They couldn't afford to feed the dogs much less themselves so I offered to buy the food, cover upcoming vet bills, allow visits.\n \nThey kept my dogs. I never got to see them again. I never even got to go inside the home and say goodbye. \n\nIt's been a few years but I found out recently that my ex lost their house. And then another. So satisfying for me to hear honestly, But what threw me off the most was when I found out what happened to my dogs, thanks to One of my exes family members. \n\nOne \"ran away\". This particular dog never left the yard. Never left my side. She was a very good girl. In the 10 years I'd had her, not once was she ever lost or missing. \n\nOne \"we don't know\" what happened. So a dog just disappeared into thin air. Got it. \n\nAnd the last one...\n\nWas neglected and malnourished and treated so badly he went blind. He was so bad that by the time one of my \"exes friends\" took him to the vet there was nothing they could do but put him down. \n\nThe family member said it wasn't two weeks later and the ex got a new dog. \n\nI was devastated. That particular family member no longer has dealings of any kind with my ex, but found me to let me know about what happened. I appreciated that, even though I was heartbroken. He knew i fought hard for those babies and I would have kept fighting but i couldn't because I ended up getting a well deserved order of protection for a multitude of other reasons. \n\nIt's been a few years. I'm married and a mom now. I live a very safe, comfortable, happy life with a man that is extremely good to me. I'm still working to rewire my brain from the years of chaos and abuse. I'm still pretty triggered by certain things and I still have nightmares from time to time. \n\n\nBut most of all, I'm still grieving my dogs. I wanted to save them. I wanted to fight for them. I wanted them with me. To live happy, free lives. I miss them. And I hope they didn't think they did anything wrong when I left. I hope they know I cry everytime their pictures come up on my photo memories. I hope they know I did my best and I never forgot them. I hope they knew I loved them and that I still do. \n\n\nAnd I hope that my ex never has a moment of peace or fortune or anything close to good for what they did to my dogs. Not even what they did to me. But to my innocent, sweet, loyal, amazing dogs. ",

        "selftext": "tw for rape/abuse/controlling behaviour\n\nhi guys i am very nervous to post this as it is my first post on reddit and i couldn't figure out how to go anonymous without making a new email but here it is. \n\ni (f19) have known my boyfriend (m19) since april 2023 and have been with him officially since june 2023, he previously had a girlfriend 'polly' (f19) from january 2021 to around december 2022, she broke up with him at this point but he said that after a few weeks of her ignoring him they rekindled but issues were still arising so they officially split in march 2023 and he hasn't been in contact with her since.\n\nhe has expressed to me that she had issues with her mother and often stayed at his house for extended periods of time, was a big smoker at the time and would often steal from his older brother when she had no money, and that she was depressed/depressive throughout the relationship and was also prescribed medication towards the end of their relationship which he said was changing her behaviour and attitude negatively, he believes this is why she left him in december 2022 because of their differing views. he also told me that she has history of making accusations, before she had reported him i was asking him questions about her and their relationship and he said that in the beginning he got a message from a boy who had been previously accused of rape by her saying that she was a liar, he obviously believed her as they were together but in hindsight this should've been a red flag he also said that they didn't have much of a sexual relationship and she was very paranoid with protection which obviously would make sense if she was a victim of rape so i guess that's how he thought of it but later on down the line she denied that she was raped and said that it was consensual.\n\nin september 2023 his ex accused him of coercive and controlling behaviour (we didnt know when she first filed the report until months later) and he was taken into police custody in october 2023 for a few hours. initially she had reported that he was abusive towards her but quickly dropped the gbh charges, i assume she didn't have enough evidence - his solicitor stated that the evidence she saw for the gbh charges consisted of 2 photos of grazes and bruises she had. she initially said that he had punched her 100 times in one period of time, also in one of her statements she said that she had taken photos of bruises on her arm that he had given her as she was sat in his bed next to him this alone is baffling to me as if he was 'so controlling' i don't believe he would let her do this especially if he was the cause.\n\ni completely believe him when he says that he did not do it as i have been with him for about the same amount of time they were together and have had none of the same issues with him, also i have read/heard multiple of her and her family's claims and the written ones just don't match up - for example, her brother said he saw my boyfriend strangling her and her face was purple and her mother said that on the same day and time he only had her pinned on the bed. this instantly gives me red flags.\n\nmy first thought was obviously that since they broke up and got back together multiple times throughout their relationship she was hoping that the same would happen but he met me and moved on instead (her friend had messaged her when she was not speaking to him and told her that 'polly' had advised him to move on). also it is very possible that she was aware that he was with me and not just having time to himself as his mother frequently posts on facebook and had made a post in july 2023 that she was picking him up from the city that i live in and mentioned me in the post, my boyfriend's mother has proof that she has been frequenting her profile as she accidentally requested to be her friend one day. the only piece of evidence that i have seen that i am aware she has kept (evidence she had of bruises from an injury have been thrown out with the gbh charge) is a clipped screenshot of him texting her saying 'i'll find another girl to abuse' obviously i have defended this as a retaliation to her emotional manipulation/abuse his solicitor also requested that the police access her phone to retrieve all of their iMessage conversation for context. personally i believe that him saying that is not an omission but an inappropriate joke of some sort.\n\nshe claimed that while they were together he would tell her what she could and couldn't wear, wouldn't let her see her friends or family, wouldn't let her take her pills, wouldn't let her attend school, etc. i have seen photos of her in his phone of them together with his friends, i also met his friends and they brought her up casually before he knew she had reported him so no mal intent there in my opinion, i have also seen photos of her school work.\n\ni do not believe a word that she said in her statements she said that she was so badly affected by him that she cannot sleep comfortably, walk for long periods, sit comfortably in a car or travel by airplane but she continues to post herself at clubs in the city that i live in (him and her don't), she has gone on multiple holidays since reporting him, one she showed on instagram just shy of 2 months after she made her original report, etc.\n\nof course when they were together he was also between the ages of 15 and 17 so i am honestly surprised that it is even been taken to crown court and gone of for so long it seems so menial to me.\n\ni am just nervous as it seems that in court he will be judged by a jury and i know they are to be unbiased but it is still nerve wracking to know that his fate lies in the hands of strangers, he has made it known to me that he would like a restraining order to be put in place, i would prefer a protection order as from what i know they are longer lasting, i think that he could also charge her with deformation of character as she was telling his friends that he was abusive to her during the first summer that we were together (june/july 2023). \n\nplease don't suggest that i leave him often when i share this with friends they say i should just leave him to avoid the stress but it is not about me, i love him and want to be there and support him the best that i can but i honestly don't know what i would do if he was found guilty and sentenced for a long period of time, we having been talking about saving up for a deposit on a house, getting married and having a baby in the coming years.\n\ni don't really know what i'm expecting from this in all honesty but just wanted to share without feeling like a burden, i'm sure there is more information that i have missed as this is just a late night rant of sorts so i may make some edits at a different time but feel free to ask any questions or give any advice.",

        "selftext": "I (26F) had been feeling like a caretaker for most of my relationship with my ex-partner (39M) who is an alcoholic. He would be sober for a long time, and then relapse. The more I thought about the relapses, the timing seemed way too convenient. He would relapse during times, when I went to see family, when I got a new job, when I got my graduate school qualifying exams, when I went to travel abroad alone for the first time in several years. It started feeling like he was punishing me for having a life of my own.\n\nThroughout the relationship, I had financially supported him. Even when he was sober, it was not uncommon that rent was late, he was in medical debt because of avoiding to get a good insurance plan, he never paid taxes, etc. I was always \"borrowing\" him money that I ended up realizing I will never get back. \n\nEnough was enough.\n\nHe asked me to quit my job and move to a new location with him, which I did. I gave up EVERYTHING only for him to relapse. \n\nThat's when I decided that I am done, and that I need to live my own life. I knew that he had taken money from our mutual savings (so 90% mine, 10% his) without asking me before, so I \"forgot\" my credit and debit cards on to the kitchen table while starting to move my stuff out, and took his wallet from his pocket, placing it on the bottom of his bedside drawer. He was going to hit withdrawals if he didn't have money for booze, so I knew he was going to steal my cards. It was not until a day later that they \"disappeared\" and I saw charges made. Booze. Sex club(?), Casinos. Lots of takeout. Impulsive purchases online.\n\nI called the police, reported the cards missing, and said that my ex was the suspect, and that he is currently trying to drink himself to death (which he always is when he relapses and doesn't hesitate to say it). They came over immediately, I was there too, and they found the cards in his possession, and as he turned violent towards them yelling I set him up, he was arrested him on the spot. I've come clean to the police about his tax avoidance as well, along with illegal threats against me from 2-3 years ago (that I have screenshots of), as the statute of limitations has not run out. \n\nHe's looking at several charges now, including resisting arrest,  illegal threats, stealing, potential tax evasion and negligence, several fines, and isn't a first-time offender. I don't know how he's doing, whether he's sober, I don't care. I have my own life to live. \n\nSince then, I've begun making more money, and traveling the world, and I am finally starting to feel like myself again. I've even made new friends, which I haven't for years, as all of my old friends made me choose between them and him, and I foolishly chose him. ",

This isn’t just her story—it’s mine too.\n\nHer Story: How She Was Trapped\n\nShe met him thinking he was just a good friend. He never acted inappropriate, never said anything with double meaning. He built trust first, slowly making her believe he was a safe person.\n\nThen one day, they went on a trip together. She tried to refuse weed, but he kept pushing until she gave in. Once she was intoxicated, everything changed. He made her believe he liked her, even loved her. And in that manipulated state, he took what he wanted.\n\nThe next day, she still couldn’t process what happened. She even wore a skirt for him, as if she was trying to convince herself that it was something real, something meaningful. But when the trip ended, so did his act. He turned cold—immediately, like she never mattered.\n\nIt took time for her to accept it. First, she blamed herself. Then, she started questioning reality. Finally, she realized—she was just another toy to him.\n\nShe told me:\n\n\"I didn’t know it was all his plan. I was just a toy for him.\"\n\n\"I feel dirty. I feel like I’m not clean anymore.\"\n\n\"Why did he act like he cared, only to throw me away?\"\n\n\nThis wasn’t a love affair.\nThis was grooming.\n\nHe conditioned her trust, intoxicated her, used her, then discarded her. And even after realizing everything, she still blamed herself.\n\n\n---\n\nMy Story: Why This Hurts Me Too\n\nShe told me everything. And I believed her. I still do. But the hardest part? Other people don’t.\n\nEven my own uncle dismissed it. He refused to believe the evidence, called her a liar, and even defended the abuser. That’s what broke me the most—if people can so easily ignore her pain, then what about mine?\n\nBecause this isn’t just about her story—it’s about what this has done to me.\n\nI wake up angry every day. Not just at the abuser, but at the world that lets people like him exist without consequences. I want to protect the next victim. I want him to feel the fear she felt.\n\n\n\nSo I need to ask:\nDo you think she was having an affair to which she alwys said that he was just a good friend whom she trusted ?\nOR\nDO YOU THINK SHE WAS GROOMED...?\n\n\nI WANT REVENGE NOT JUST FOR HER BUT FROM MY ABUSER TOO...

When I was about 4 years old she full on raped me but I don’t like to think about it as that is the most gut trenching memory I have. My parents don’t know that it happened and in all honesty I don’t want to put the burden of what happened to me on them. My “sister’s” bio mom was an abusive drug addict and I know that in order to know what she knew she probably went through her own sexual abuse but at the same time I hate her with every ounce of my being as I blame her for why I can’t remember anything before the age of 9 or the fact that I had a fucked up childhood. I guess I just wanted to get what happened off my chest as literally no one knows and it’s something I’ve been hanging onto for close to 12 years.",

I texted the freshman gc &amp; see if anyone wanted to be friends. Angela responded, we met up, and she introduced me to her friends and we've all been hanging out since. Yesterday, I'm getting texts in the gc but I'm not really reading them until I see Angela says my name. I respond how did my name get brought up. Angela says when we all were hanging out yesterday I didn't engage with anyone or say anything and it took her a minute to realize I was there. Then Angela, Randi, &amp; Kasey are all basically saying I don't talk when I'm with them, all I just follow them around, force them to sign me in their dorm to \"hangout\" with them, &amp; they know nothing about me. I texted back saying \"I do talk sometimes its just sometimes I don't talk bc of social anxiety or bc I have nothing to say. The other day only asked yall to sign me bc it was raining hard and I didn't want to walk across campus to my dorm in the rain. I wasn't going to hangout yesterday but then after we left the dining hall Brigitte said she would sign me in and I felt bad asking her to sign me out after she just signed me in. If yall don't wanna hangout with me I won't come around anymore.\" Angela, Randi, &amp; Kasey said we do want to hangout with you we just want you to talk and engage with us instead of sitting there and being a wallflower and something must be wrong with us since you been with us since last semester. I tell them nothing is wrong is them its me and I'll feel like I'm not anyone's friend in the gc and it's my fault bc I don't talk enough but I'm trying more now that I'm in college and I'll still eat with yall and try to more but idk abt hangout rn. About 5 min after I send that message I was walking to class with my I was walking to class with my headphones on and passed Angela. I didn't feel like talking so I didn't say anything. She responds to me in the gc saying I said hi to you and you literally just ignored me. how can we get to know you if when we give you the opportunity and you're not here with us I respond to her and say I didn't see u I had my headphones on and I was going to class. Then Kasey says you did see her. Then a few of the other people in the gc tried to defend me. Today I walk in the dining hall and I see some them sitting together. Usually I go sit with them or least say hi but after yesterday I felt weird doing that. They never spoke to me and I never spoke to them. I'm not sure how to feel about this.

I've been having an ongoing issue with two co-workers who have basically just been mean girls since the day I started a couple years ago, and the only thing that I'm guilty of doing is trying to do my job to the fullest, which I know they haven't been a fan of because I draw more attention to our team which means more work might be given to our team and more responsibilities which they don't want. I know they don't want this because they have actually vocalized that to our manager, whenever there's a chance for more opportunities or extra work to be done they both shut the idea down so hard and fast and I'm usually the one who's okay doing the small tasks.\n\nThere's multiple incidents where they have both been unprofessional and have come at me in aggressive ways for various reasons. Every single incident has had another teammate witnessed the whole thing. my manager is aware that there is an ongoing issue and there have been corrective actions taken for one coworker since they have complaints in multiple departments from multiple people.\n\nAnd last Thursday they decided to ambush me in a meeting accusing me of not doing my job or avoiding work and insinuating that I was lying when I tried to tell them what was going on, and I had it, so I talked to my manager and they suggested I go to HR, because if I didn't they were going to report it so I figured well if it's going to happen one way or the other I might as well do it. so I reported this to HR something I have never done before. And I have anxiety through the roof, because I've never gone to HR with a problem before because normally in my other jobs the mean girls are the girls that the managers adore and they see me as the problem.\n\nSo in my head I'm going to lose my job because I'm the problem, when I haven't instigated anything.

        "selftext": "\n\nFor context, I (45F) have rental policies which I'm very particular about. One of these policies is that tenants are prohibited from having any colors in their house except beige, white, and black. Although this might seem strict, I allow tenants to have colorful screens, clothing, and food boxes (albeit in the trash). I also provide storage for food, which is properly colored to fit my needs. I also do check-ins every two months to make sure my terms are followed, and the property is not damaged. Occasionally, they'll be unannounced so there will be no cover-ups.\n\nOne of my tenants (29F), has been renting with me for five years. We went over the lease agreement, and she agreed to my terms. Since then, she has gotten pregnant and birthed a beautiful baby girl named Paisleigh, whom I insisted upon the name for.\n\nIn the present, it's a brisk August morning. As usual, I go to check my property. It is completely in shambles. The decorations, furniture, walls, and all of that were fine, but there was one massive oversight. Toys scattered everywhere. I would be fine if they were correctly colored, but no. These are colorful toys. Dolls, stacking donuts, blocks, wooden cars, rubber ducks. It was such a disgrace to my property, I had to look away. I reminded my tenant that of course, she can have toys in the house, but they must be in accord with the rental policy. She apologizes, and I leave. I thought my warning would be okay.\n\nFast forward to a few months later, I return, again unannounced. Still, she keeps these pigmented, bright toys around. I further warn her, but it's not enough. She insists bright colors are good for development. Later that night, I enter her house using my spare key, silently creeping into her room. The baby is sleeping inside a playpen, so no worries there. I wait to make sure that she's truly sleeping, then I pounce. I acutely latch onto her throat, and she screams. I feel her voice box vibrating through my strangling hands as she tries to scream, but nothing comes out, just sputtering and choking. I keep choking as she thrashes about, until around three minutes later, and I know I'm done. She has no pulse, and her body is as limp as a ragdoll.\n\nI transport her corpse and the sleeping baby into the car, driving to a beachside town to dump the body. I drive back to my house, and I don't know what to do with the baby, so I decide to barbeque her. As she sleeps, I preheat the grill, lighting it ablaze, and then after about 14 minutes, I set her on the cooking rack. Soon I can hear wailing from under the hood of the grill, before she could gasp for air anymore. It's terrible and loud, but eventually, with the smell of charred meat, it ceases. I drive to a nearby college town to dump the second body.\n\n\n",

        "selftext": " To preface I am in college now and this was almost 3 years ago. Okay so I (F 20) had a big group of friends in high school. We all got really close senior year and there were a lot of characters so I will be using fake names. It was around prom season this whole thing started. There was a boy I was talking to and he wasn’t super favored by alot of people but everyone talked to him because he was like a class clown. We’ll call him Jacob. Jacob had originally planned of going to prom with a girl Tess. Tess never wanted to go with him so when he met me and we started talking he told her that they shouldn’t go together because it would have been boring because she didn’t even want to go with him. This was wrong I know and should’ve told me something because me and Jacob went on to date and he was actually insane. \n\nAnyways this caused a big drama and caused Tess and her close friends to hate me. Tess’s friends were friends with some of my friends and my friends began to act weird to me. Not talking to me all that often but that was fine because I still had my core friends. My core friends being Sasha, Kylie, and Khloe. I ended up having a falling out with Kylie and Khloe too due to all of our other friends deciding to hate me for dating Jacob but that’s besides the point. \n\nJump to prom and all of the weird behavior continued and I had to go on a party bus with all the people who I know knew were talking shit about me. I ended up leaving with Sasha and Khloe because I couldn’t stand to be on the bus and we met up with Jacob. Prom ended so odd and it was clear no one wanted to talk to me because I was with Jacob. \n\nFast forward to the summer after prom. One of the boys who was in my old friend group posted something on his spam story on Instagram with a video from the party bus from prom, “ Missing prom. Don’t see any ‘dirty looks’ but I digress”. This was a direct dig at me because I had told Khloe that whole group had been giving me and Sasha dirty looks on the bus.  Me and Khloe had already fallen out by this time . (Sorry for all the jumping around Im just trying to give context). So I tell Jacob who I’m already dating by this point that he had posted something so Jacob decides to post on his story a picture from prom captioned “I loved prom but definitely not those dirty looks😍”. This starts a war in instagram notes of all places. We’ll call the boy who posted Joey. Joey begins posting in his instagram notes saying how me and Jacob are so mad and then begins and argument with Jacob on instagram notes. I was mortified because really? Instagram notes? \n\nBut anyways they go back and forth with petty comments to each other but I stay out of it. This goes on for probably 20 minutes. Then joey decides to personally attack me and posts “Letting him hit in 3 weeks? Not very disney of you” And he always used to say I could be an actor on Disney channel so I knew this particular comment was for me. I start crying because now personal information is being shared. Oh and every person I used to be friends with was egging him on in their instagram notes. I want to be clear that other than going to prom with Jacob I had never said or done anything to any of the people that were mad at me and posting about me. Joey keeps going and decides to post about things I only told Khloe and Kylie. About my personal sex life with Jacob. Joey posts that on instagram notes and I freak out because now everyone is looking at this and most people know it’s about me. \n\nThat’s when I start getting texts from fake numbers. Slut shaming me, calling me ugly, threatening me and telling me to respond. I couldn’t deal with it. It all ended 20 or so minutes later but I was like wtf. I don’t talk to any of these people anymore other than Sasha. Jacob ended up being a maniac so we broke up. Anyways this all happened almost 3 years ago I guess I just wanted to see what people would say and if going to prom with Jacob made me deserve all this?",

        "selftext": "Well when i was under the age of 6 i had 5 siblings. The two came after I turned 10. I didn't play with them at all because by the time the last two were of playing age I was already a teen. \n\nBut my mom always made sure that we behaved in public. Whether it would be by her pulling us to the side by the ear and threatening an ass whooping or to leave us at home, it worked. We would walk single file behind her, sit at restaurant tables and chat quietly with each other, never raising our voices. We ended up homeless for a year or two when i was young, so we were put in one small room. We were made to clean the house and learn chores so we could help the people we were staying with. \n\nWhen my mom was able to find a house, she said it was always hard because renters always thought that many kids wouldn't be worth a tenant. So anytime we moved we would clean the house spotless. We moved a lot. We also would clean spotless whenever the land lord was visiting. \n\nMy mom knew how it looked to have so many kids behind her, especially when her husband wasn't around because of work so it was only him. She thought people saw her as a poor, ghetto woman with an army of kids who she couldn't control so she made damn sure we wouldn't be like that. \n\nBut like why have that many kids in the first place.... or continue having them even after experiencing homelessness? We were back and forth between many of friends and family after my parents divorced. And we moved 13 times before I was in high school. Yet she still had kids but that's another topic for another day.... \n\nThat basically taught all of us to keep up with appearances. My mom was also incredibly mentally, physically and emotionally abusive so there was always fear in my house. It was my siblings and I against her, so we were all close and together. \n\nBut then we started to turn on each other as we got older, probably from my older siblings maturing and growing bitter and angry at the abuse. I'm going through that phase now. \n\nEither way it led me to become emotionally detached from my siblings. There was always just so many things going on, it was hard to keep up. \n\nOnce my older siblings moved out I was the oldest in the house and it became my responsibility to cook and clean for everyone. I got tired of it and moved out a month after graduating. \n\nI got sick of taking care of others when I was a child, so I just left. Another step i took to separate myself from my family. \n\nSure, having big families are fun. It's never quiet, immediate family reunions are crazy and loud (my mom also had 7 siblings so imagine how big they got), you get to grow up with multiple best friends, but when you have an emotionally and mentally unstable mother with an enabler husband, it's terrible. Never a peaceful moment, especially not with the homelessness or having to share rooms with siblings when we got our own houses, constant arguments because nobody knew how to regulate themselves and constant abuse. \n\nIt drove my older sister insane. I haven't seen her in years. It's driving me insane now. \n\nI never had room to be myself, not until after i turned 18. I never got to properly develop so now I have mental issues. And chronic illnesses. \n\nGrowing up with 7 siblings was hard. My mom's attention was only focused on the younger one. Yeah, we would have fun times and a lot of them but that doesn't overshadow the abuse or anything else.\n\nI always get jealous of people who are close to their siblings. I can never have that, not anymore. I can barely form and maintain friendships, much less familial relationships. \n\nNot to mention how people react whenever i tell them how many siblings I have. I've had to fight  few people who talked crap about my mom being a whore. My siblings have had to fight other kids for the same thing. Nothing says bonding time more than beating the kid who made fun of your younger sibling. Classy? No. Fun? Yes. ",

        "selftext": "My (30f) ex (33m)  is dating a neighbour in my building. We broke up about 8 months ago. We were together 3.5 years. Throughout the course of our relationship there were definitely issues. We lived together for two years and after the break up we still lived together for a month and a half as we had to sell our house. What's wild is we talked about getting married two months before we broke up and he was 100% on board. We broke up over a really intense fight where he blamed me for something he lost. It's a long story, but we fought for 3 days, decided to take a break for a week to think about what we wanted to do about this. He decided to end the relationship.\n\nLiving together still was hell. He was awful. He threatened to throw my stuff away because he thought I was dating. I found out he made two catfishing dating profiles right after we broke up which he later matched with me on and then would block me. I found out from a close friend of his what he was doing. Curiousity got the better of me. I made a real profile of myself to see if it was true. He swiped on me, blocked me, and remade those profiles a few times. He called me dumb each time I disagreed with him with things concerning selling our house. He skipped out on the last mortgage payment. He also refused to help prepare the house for sale. I did everything on my own. Meanwhile he still ate my food, kept walking in on me while I was changing (the door didn’t lock), and would sometimes pressure me to still sleep in our bed because as he put it: “we slept together for almost 4 years, what’s a few more nights.” He also got me an insanely expensive birthday gift and wrote me in as a plus one to a wedding both after we broke up. For weeks after he moved out, he kept trying to sleep at our old house for a whole week. I put my foot down here and told him I needed space. \n\nI tried to be respectful as possible from the start to honor his wishes. I didn’t want to be with someone who didn’t want to be with me. Besides one conversation about our relationship after we broke up a few weeks in, I left him alone. I only talked about the house or things we had to communicate about. I tried setting some boundaries, but after he called me dumb, I gave up and bit my tongue through it until he moved out. \n\nHe always knew where I was moving to, it was also in our documents for the notary. I told him when I found a place which street and he mentioned the building. Since I moved in, I swore I saw him often driving by. I knew he bought a car (that also looks incredibly similar to mine). I also was pretty sure I saw his bike parked outside my building a few times. I heard from a cousin who followed him on Strava that he also ran close to my place or in my street multiple times a week for months. Then there was when I had a dating profile, I saw he was on there for real as himself and it kept saying he was 650 feet away and sometimes 1 mile away. I'd sometimes block him and then he'd have a brand new dating profile again showing the same sometimes. Each time I deleted him, for months he popped back up. It was triggering me so much. I did delete all dating apps two months ago. I had a stalker (different guy) for five years with court dates and all. This same ex helped me through this. He was so empathetic about everything I went through with having a stalker. And here my ex is, also invading my space. In a different way, sure. \n\nNow last Saturday I saw him help a girl move a piano in. He was in the entry way of my building. I felt my heart race and my anxiety spike. There was another guy there so I was hoping that maybe this guy was her boyfriend and he was just friends with them. Then this morning, as I was returning from walking what used to be our dog (now just mine), he walked out of the elevator freshly showered. He smugly greeted me as if I was an old acquittance.  As I looked out the window of the elevator, I saw he used a key to the building. That made me feel a bit uncomfortable too. I was now even more suspicious and panicking. I texted a mutual friend. I don't care that he's dating. If I saw him in the city on a date, I probably wouldn’t react much. I do care that he's in my space. The mutual friend confirmed he's seeing someone and told me her name. We have a group chat with everyone that lives in the building and low and behold there she was.\n\nJust...what the fuck. Who does this? He knew when he probably first went to her place that I live here too. And when I guess things got more serious, he also knew. What's worse is that that friend told me a friend of ours set them up who also knew exactly where I moved to. If I was dating someone and I found out they lived in his building, I’d either stop seeing that guy, I would send a courtesy text, or I’d at least ask the person I’m seeing if we could primarily hang out in my building. \n\nI feel he could have at the very least sent a message. I thought I was being paranoid for months thinking I saw signs of him being in my space. Now I hate the fact that I may run into him this often, but I would have much rather known he’s dating someone than think he was stalking me. I also was just moving on with my life. Seeing him is still a bit upsetting. It's one thing if this was years later, but it's only been 8 months.\n\nAll of the things he's done since…It's so unbelievably cruel. I am so angry. I haven't messaged him because I don't think he'd respect my boundaries. I just want to move on. I deserve that. I don't deserve this.\n\nI've come to the conclusion that he should be the one who feels uncomfortable seeing me. Not the other way around. I shouldn't have to feel uncomfortable in my own space.\n\nSorry for the cursing, but what a motherfucking asshole. Never called an ex that, but he absolutely deserves the title.\n\nJust needed some other people to know about this jerk.",

        "selftext": "\nHi all. My mom has always treated me like I am her second favourite after my sister all my life. This has really messed up with my self esteem. Now I am married with a son and another one along the way. Anyways, there have been three situations where I asked her to come and stay with us for a bit. We initially both stayed in the same city but now are 2 hour flight away.\n\n1) First, my husband had a work trip in Oct last year. The morning sickness was at its peak at 3 months. And I just wanted someone around incase there is a medical emergency for 3-4 days. We have a nanny to help with my son for most of the day. So all she had to do was just be around. She refused saying she has a neighbour’s birthday party to attend. I let it go.\n\n2) Last month, I called her and asked her if \nshe can be with my son for 3-4 days when I will be in the hospital around my due date. Again the nanny is there. She just has to manage the night when he is sleeping. She refused saying she can’t leave my dad alone during easter time and needs to cook for him. My dad is a perfectly abled man who can cook his own food.\n\n3) Yesterday, my husband’s side of the family had an emergency situation and my husband had to leave for his parent’s place for 3-4 days. This time I was sure I will not ask my mom to come down again. But my husband called my mom and literally begged her to come down as he didn’t want to leave me alone with my son at this juncture. Her cold response was that she has to be with my dad and cook for him etc. She asked us to keep the nanny to stay over for a couple of days. I fully support my husband’s decision to be with his parents at this time for reasons I can’t divulge. \n\nAfter yesterday, I lost it with her. I told her that she wont hear from me again and she is a sad excuse for a mom who can’t even be with her daughter when there can be a medical emergency. And in case I die she need not come either. So she blamed me for moving cities without considering all this. And that my dad has slogged all his life to educate us etc. how can I think she can leave him and rush to me. For context, I moved cities because I got a better job that pays her bills to a certain extent and gives me some semblance of work life balance. As for my dad, he is not a baby.\nWhat kind of mother would want to miss the birth of her grandchild or not want to be with her daughter when she is almost due",

        "selftext": "People think that because they went a year without sex and it wasn’t a big deal, they can relate to someone who reaches 25, 30, or 40 years old without ever having kissed or held someone’s hand. They simply can’t. Everyone who tells me sex isn’t a big deal can’t truly understand it, no matter how hard they try. They can’t relate because sex (not just the act itself, but everything around it, like the confidence of knowing you’re attractive enough to attract someone) has become something they take for granted. Only someone who’s never experienced it can truly grasp its importance. You just can’t.  \n\nI know sex can be awkward, messy, or even empty. People get used, hurt, or end up feeling emptier than before. But here’s the crucial part: wanting to experience it doesn’t mean I’m chasing some idealized version. Even in its most ordinary forms, sex is still pretty great, and people still get something out of it. Otherwise, why would so many pursue it despite its imperfections?  \n\nIt’s frustrating to watch others freely explore, make mistakes, regret, have intimate conversations, go on dates, or even just buy condoms “just in case”—gaining experience all the while. People say, “Oh, but sometimes sex can be bad!” But many of us haven’t even had the chance to have sex at all, good or bad. That’s the frustration. \n\nTo all the virgins who want to claim it’s unimportant to them: I’m glad it isn’t for you. Maybe you have low libido, or dating isn’t your focus—that’s valid, and I’m happy for you. But just because you’re a virgin and don’t care doesn’t mean I have to feel the same.  \n\nTo the fatalists: Stop projecting worst-case scenarios and using your bad experiences to dissuade others. Using your story as a universal warning against sex is like telling no one to drive because you had an accident. Yes, sex can get complicated, like anything human, but that doesn’t mean we should avoid it by default or assume the worst.  \n\nAnd stop recommending prostitutes. First, it’s not legal where I live. Second, sex workers might satisfy curiosity about the act, but they can’t replicate the intimacy of someone choosing you.  \n\nTo everyone who says sex isn’t important: Would you trade places? Would you spend the rest of your life without sex, without being touched, without anyone calling you attractive? If it’s so “overrated,” why not? Would you stay in a relationship with a partner who never touches you, has sex with you, or makes sexual comments? If it’s truly irrelevant, this shouldn’t bother you. After all, if you tell me to “just focus on hobbies and friends,” you should be able to do the same to prove your point.\n\nAnd don’t hit me with, “Who says sex is overrated? No one says that!” I’m tired of hearing it in every post I make, or in others’ posts people claiming it’s “not a big deal,” “overrated,” or “no different from masturbation.” It’s a lie they don’t even believe themselves. They trot it out to comfort virgins, but in the real world, look how much energy, money, and drama people invest in sex. If it were “nothing,” why does it drive so much behavior? Sex isn’t everything, but it’s not “nothing” either.  \n\nIf sex is “overrated,” why don’t you stop seeking it? Why not live as if it doesn’t exist? Until then, your indifference just sounds like privilege disguised as wisdom.",
