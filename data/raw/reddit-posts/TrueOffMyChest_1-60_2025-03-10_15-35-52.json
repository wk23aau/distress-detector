I think I'm anorexic. \n\nI started skipping lunch because I wanted to lose weight faster. It worked, but it was too fast to the point where I caused my family to be suspicious of me. In order to mitigate suspicion, I planned to minimize the skipping of my meals, but as time got nearer and nearer to meal time, I realized that I was disgusted by the thought of having to eat, by the sensation of being full. So, today I bought someone a free lunch while I ate nothing, when the original plan was for me to eat a normal meal.  \n  \nI've never been down BMI 18.5 before, which is the criteria for being underweight. Going past the threshold seems almost scary. But at the same time, I just can't stop losing weight. Eating feels tiring. I have to constantly work my mouth just to finish a meal. Most of the times, I'm already full when I've only eaten half of my meal, and going further is tiring. I want to avoid that uncomfortable experience, hence the continued skipping of lunches. I also have no appetite, and couldn't even get hungry despite 14 hours of fasting \n\nI don't know what to do. I'm not sure if I could even maintain my weight if I hit 115lbs. I'm still a minor, so I can't see a therapist by my own. No one knows about my eating disorder. ",

    "selftext": "So this is rant/storytime about a toxic friend, who is still in my life and I\u2019m unable to remove her. Lets call her Sara. So I met Sara in the 1st year of my college through my ex-roommate (Lets call her Jane) Jane and Sara were in the same class so one day she came to visit Janes room, where I lived too. She immediately started talking to me very excitedly and telling about herself, and asked for my Insta acct, probably because me and her both are from the same religion, Jane isn\u2019t. So then we started hanging out often, all three of us and she also started meeting my other friends from college etc. Sara lives with her brother, they\u2019re both studying here. Fast forward a few months, and that\u2019s when it started getting unhealthy. She started acting very possessive and would get upset over me hanging out with other friends without inviting her, or posting stories etc. She would even get jealous when I went out with Jane or posted stories with her (she was my roommate ofc we would have fun together and be close). When a few times me and Jane have fought, she would always come and tell me things like yeah she is like that lets go out etc. instead of trying to reconcile us. I think she enjoyed it when I would have disagreements with my other friends.  \n  \nApart from the possessive nature, she is very cheap in money matters. Whenever we would go out to eat or have tea or anything, she almost never paid. And if she ever did she would ask me to send half of it. She would use this trick where she wouldn\u2019t order anything, and if I did she would eat from it. And if said to pay she would say that she didn\u2019t even order anything or she just tasted my food. If we ever made plans for the movies or any other activity, she would beforehand say I don\u2019t have any money expecting any of us to say we will cover her, and if no one said that and we went without her she gets upset. She then once caused such a big misunderstanding between me and Jane that we didn\u2019t speak to each other for 6 months and started living separately. We have started talking again now but live alone and not together. Jane still doesn\u2019t speak to Sara and probably won\u2019t ever, which I think is good for her.\u00a0\n\n\n\nShe also has this habit where she would just take my stuff. My parents live abroad and they would send me chocolates, or some food items available abroad, suppose they have sent 2 packets, she would just come pick up one and say Im taking this. Now, I am a person who can\u2019t say no to someone like this when they ask me for some food item or something, I don\u2019t know I try but I just can\u2019t bring myself to it. She then started asking for my other things too, which are not 2 packs or just anything. Like she once saw my aloe vera gel and said oh I want it what will you do of it, or even my plates and cups, hair brush, anything she would just say oh I am taking this, I have not given any of those to her. I have told her that no I need it, but she would still insist, it was very tough for me to have those arguments. She once even asked for a gift that was given to me by my fianc\u00e9 (his apple earphones) and said oh I need these, I said no he gave them to me why would I let you take it, and guess what she was upset about it. But she wouldn\u2019t stop. There are so many such incidents. One that has stuck with me is when I brought chocolates for her from abroad, and I asked her to give me one from the pack and she straight up refused saying they were hers. I was baffled that how could she refuse me chocolates that I brought her??? It was so cheap.  \n  \nSo these are all small things and in the past few months some pretty serious and big things she has done, which are:  \n  \n1st - She absolutely ruined my birthday. So my fianc\u00e9 (Lives in another country) had planned a celebration at a fancy restaurant with all my friends, as a surprise for me. He reached out to Jane to help prepare for the surprise as he couldn\u2019t manage effectively from so far away. When Sara found out that he reached out to Jane and not her, she got mad and upset about it, that why she wasn\u2019t asked and also cause she and Jane don\u2019t speak to each other. She made a fuss about it and on my birthday, in the restaurant she sat there, making a faces, didn\u2019t eat anything at all, wasn\u2019t talking to anyone and also whispering comments to someone either about me or Jane. I asked her several times what\u2019s wrong and she just said nothings wrong and continued behaving like that. Everyone saw that it was affecting my and everyone else\u2019s mood so they kept asking her to cheer up but she didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t even eat a single bite of the birthday cake, also constantly made faces didn\u2019t smile for once the entire time and left. The next day I confronted her about it and she said she is sorry and she was upset why she wasn\u2019t chosen by me. I said my fianc\u00e9 planned it all and I didn\u2019t know about it but she said I probably knew how could I not know. I told her that she ruined my day and she texted me \u2018I\u2019m so sorry\u2019 with the hands folded emoji, making it a sarcastic mean sorry.  \n  \n2nd - This incident happened a few days ago and has really made me think that I have had my last straw now and this is getting so so toxic. So she had borrowed money from me which she was supposed to return last month. When I asked her for it she said she doesn\u2019t have it and sent me a small amount and said she will send me the rest later. I said okay. Now a month has passed and Im really broke right now and need some money. So I texted her asking her to send me the rest of the money, she said to me again that she doesn\u2019t have any money. I said why not, even I don\u2019t have money and I need it, please ask your parents to send It or do whtever but please give me my money, at least give me half back as I am in need of money right now. But she just said that I don\u2019t have money, I will give it when I have it. I asked her when will that be and she said 4-5 months!! That\u2019s when my college comes to an end and I will be literally leaving the country, that\u2019s when she wants to pay me back. Its also not a huge amount which she can\u2019t arrange out of nowhere, she also has had time of several months but is still not returning my money. I argued with her for around half an hour over text asking her to give my money back now as I need it now and not months later. I even gave solution that she can pay me little by little each month at least but she plainly said no I don\u2019t have to all of it. I dont know how to get the money now. AND CHERRY ON THE CAKE IS ever since I asked her the money back she is UPSET with me. For asking my own money back!!! When I need it!!! She didn\u2019t say she\u2019s upset but she isn\u2019t sending me any reels as she used to, stopped reacting to mine, doesn\u2019t send snaps, which all she does when she is upset. I just don\u2019t understand where she gets the AUDACITY to be upset here?? I should be the one upset as she is not giving the money back. I feel like this is literally the last straw. Theres so many more things she has done but I cant write all of them down here or this will be too long.  \n  \nNOW I KNOW WHOEVER READS THIS WILL ASK ME WHY I HAVENT ENDED THE FRIENDSHIP, now that is because we have been friends for the past three years and my whole family, my fianc\u00e9, my in-laws they all know her and they ask about her frequently and ask if we\u2019ve been hanging out and how is she and everything and I\u2019ll be passing out college in the next three months and after that I\u2019ll be moving to another country and probably won\u2019t see her anymore maybe once in a blue moon in a lot of years, but we won\u2019t be meeting again I think so. So I just wanted to avoid any drama since the past six months I have been thinking that I should just let it go because it\u2019s just a few months and I don\u2019t want to create the drama and I don\u2019t want the fuss of explaining all the family members of why I don\u2019t speak to her anymore and all that but I think this is just getting so much out of hand. Even now she is still in my life, thinking that it\u2019s just three more months and it\u2019ll all be done but I don\u2019t know anymore if I should end it now or wait. All this time I\u2019ve been such a good friend even after she has done all of this I continue doing things for her. I continue trying to help her whenever she needs. I lent her the money after she did all that fuss on my birthday. And yet, she is like this. This is very very toxic.",

    "selftext": "\n\nI have a theory that I would like to share with you and hear your opinion on. It concerns elderly people, like your grandparents, or even more so, your great-grandparents.\n\nLet\u2019s get to the story.\n\nI live in a single-family house with about six rooms, so there\u2019s enough space for me, my mom, dad, and my grandparents, who always come to visit for a week in the middle of February. It's already March 10th, so it's been a little while since their last visit, but something still doesn't sit right with me.\n\nIt was February 14th or 15th, in the afternoon. I was relaxing on the couch, watching TV, when I suddenly saw a car outside. It was my grandparents\u2019 car, and they had come to visit for a two-week stay. We greeted each other, chatted, had some coffee and tea \u2013 everything was going well, but that was before my parents left for a company event around 6 PM.\n\nMy grandparents went to bed around midnight, so I was excited because after that, I could play games all night. Everything was fine, I talked to my grandparents, we played board games, and then they went to bed. Happy, I went to my room and turned on my computer. When it struck 12:39 AM, I realized my laptop hadn\u2019t been charging the whole time, so I went to get the charger from my grandfather\u2019s room (my grandmother and grandfather were sleeping in separate rooms).\n\nI need to tell you something important: my grandfather is already 74 years old, but when he was younger, he had a car accident that seriously damaged his brain, and he had to walk with crutches. When I went to get the charger, I noticed that my grandfather's room light was on, which seemed strange because he should have been asleep. Surprised, I stood next to the slightly open door and listened. I started hearing him count something, probably money, but it seemed absurd because he barely had any mental clarity. So, I peeked through the door and saw my grandfather counting large amounts of money, so quickly that it looked like at least two people were doing it.\n\nI have no idea how long I stood there, but when I snapped out of it, I went to the bathroom to check if my grandfather was going to hide the money and pretend to sleep. Of course, that\u2019s exactly what happened. I went back to bed and, even though I had been excited to play, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to. I lay there for about half an hour not knowing what to do, when suddenly I fell asleep. I don\u2019t even know when that happened.\n\nThe next day, my grandfather acted just as he always did \u2013 kind, loving, and cheerful.\n\nThat\u2019s the end of the story. I\u2019d love to hear your opinion on what actually happened. Thanks for listening.\n\nXYZ",

It\u2019s as if I\u2019m living my life through an out-of-body experience, like there are two separate versions of me: my consciousness and the person maneuvering my body, interacting with the world. When I look in the mirror, I barely recognize the person staring back.\n\nEver since I became self-aware( around six years old) I noticed I didn\u2019t feel the way others did. My classmates mingled effortlessly, forming bonds that I lacked the vocabulary to describe. But I could sense the absence of that feeling in my own life. My parents loved and cared for me deeply, and I knew that. I loved them, too\u2014I\u2019d cry for them, seek their attention, I was obviously attached to them.But something wasn\u2019t right. It was as if there was a glass wall between us. I could see them, they could see me, but I couldn\u2019t feel them.\n\nThis feeling\u2014or lack of it\u2014persisted. I was always aware of it, and it bothered me immensely. It confused me. I could feel emotions for others, I could empathize, I could care, I could love. But I couldn\u2019t feel them.\nEventually, I got sick of wondering and started asking people about it. I thought maybe everyone felt this way but just never spoke about it. Like a hush hush kind of thing. Each time, I carefully watched their faces as I explained. People\u2019s expressions would shift in tiny, quick ways\u2014so subtle they\u2019re almost undetectable if you didn't pay close enough attention. And every time, I saw the same reaction: a scrunch of the face, a flicker of confusion, discomfort, or even judgment. It was never positive. Then, their words followed: \"Im not understanding what you mean?\" \"How so? You clearly feel connected to people like XYZ.\u201d (who do you think are telling how I feel???) Or my favorite: \u201cThat\u2019s normal.\u201d\nI know for a fact this isn\u2019t normal.\n\nThis brings me to why I\u2019m writing this. I\u2019ve had friends, I\u2019ve had partners. I\u2019ve felt deep emotions for them. But I never felt one with them. They would tell me how connected they felt to me, how deep and natural it was. And I would lie\u2014because I didn\u2019t want to hurt their feelings. But deep down, I knew I could never reciprocate the feeling. I was attached to them, yes, but in a way that often turned toxic and possessive. That\u2019s not a real connection.\n\nThe best way I can describe this lack of connection is like wearing thick gloves. I can still touch things, still interact with the world. But I can\u2019t feel  anyhing. Like the softness of wool or the rough ridges of a rock\u2014nothing compares to the feeling of interactiing with the world with your bare hands. My gloves, though, seem to be stuck. Glued onto my hand. \n\nI truly believe I\u2019m defective. \n\n",

The level of control is suffocating, everything is \u201cdemonic\u201d or \u201csinful\u201d if it doesn\u2019t align with their worldview. \n\nTo give you a glimpse, I locked my hair in my third year (at 22), and when I visited home for two weeks, my mom sat me down with Bible verses, telling me she had dreams that my locs were demonic. The list of forbidden things is endless, concerning my graduation there\u2019s; pants on women? Sinful. Makeup? Sinful. Loc extensions? Also sinful.\n\nIf I were to attend my graduation, I\u2019d want to do it in a way that makes me feel good about myself, pimp up my locs, wear some light makeup to enhance my features, and wear a sleek suit (with pants, because I feel way more comfortable in that than a skirt). But that would all trigger endless lectures, guilt-tripping, and spiritual fearmongering. And honestly that sucks the joy right out of it and makes it feel more like a chore than a celebration.\n\nI\u2019ve had brief tastes of freedom when I was away for school\u2014boarding school (8th\u201312th grade) and university in a town five hours away. But every time I try to claim a piece of autonomy, there\u2019s massive pushback. Even my friendships have been policed\u2014some of my friends were literally labeled \u201cdemons in disguise sent to destroy me.\u201d Like... what??\n\nI know I need to get out, and I\u2019m actively working toward that but job hunting hasn\u2019t been successful in my country(zm) and entry-level pay is laughable or nonexistent without experience. So, I\u2019ve been upskilling, trying to learn in-demand global skills to land a remote job and finally break free. But I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll have achieved that by April 25th, and every time I see my peers posting about how excited they are for graduation, my heart sinks.\n\nIf I go, I either have to do it under their rules, which will make me miserable, or I have to be fully independent by then, which I\u2019m not sure is possible in such a short time. Even if I did manage to attend on my own terms, I know the backlash would be intense. Part of me feels like it\u2019s easier to just let the day pass. I was considering just buying my graduation gown so I could take pictures later with my family and then have a personal photoshoot that actually feels like me once I move out. \n\nI don\u2019t even know exactly what I\u2019m asking here\u2014advice? Suggestion? A decision? Help? maybe I just needed to say it out loud instead of bouncing it around in my head. I\u2019ve never met anyone who can fully relate to what I\u2019m going through, and it\u2019s isolating as hell. \n\nTL;DR: My strict fundamentalist family controls how I dress and look, making my graduation feel more like a battle than a celebration. I\u2019m working toward independence but might not make it in time, so skipping the ceremony feels easier. Just needed to vent.\n\n",

    "selftext": "My whole childhood was a blur due to all of the abuse I had to endure from my sister. It all started around when I was in kindergarten and she was in 6th grade. I remember her holding me down in my mother\u2019s closet, punching me in the face repeatedly. She would hold my head underwater when we went to the pool until I almost went unconscious. She would chase me and my mom around the house with any weapon she could find and she ended up stabbing me with a knife in the stomach at some point. This and more all went on for years until she moved out after she graduated high school in 2020. \n\nAt some time between 1st-3rd grade, I was SA\u2019d by her. She would make me watch pay gorn with her then she would make me kiss her also lick her chest and her downstairs. She would make me and my (disabled) little sister shower with her and one time she also made my little sister lick her. I spoke to my cousin about this and similar happened to them. They also witnessed my sister\u2019s abuse on many occasions. \n\nFast forward to today, I am 17, my sister is 23, and she moved in with me, my mom, and my little sister after the hurricanes along with her fianc\u00e9e(F22) and their son(2). They originally were just evacuating but they decided that they weren\u2019t going back. They were supposed to move out within a month but it has now been 6 months. They reside in my little sister\u2019s room so she now shares a room with my mom. The whole house is being taken over and I\u2019m tired of biting my tongue. \n\nLast week, I was about to take a shower and I noticed a pretty big mess my nephew made. There were crushed eggshells spread all over the carpet along with stickers and price tags (my mom runs an antique business) I asked my sister to clean it up and I go take a shower. I had just gotten out and there were even more messes that were made. There were crushed eggshells are still there. I go to the kitchen and there were magnets covering the floor which were also in the dining room. The cat\u2019s water had been dumped out and there were three towels in the garbage. I asked my sister what had happened (she\u2019s sitting on the couch, on her phone). She says something along the lines of \u201cmy son was just playing\u201d. I asked her to clean it up and she said \u201cI\u2019ll do it later\u201d. The thing is, she either never cleans or she does it half assed. So, I texted my mom pictures and basically told her that these messes were made, my sister isn\u2019t cleaning it, and I\u2019m not gonna be the one responsible for it. My mom calls my sister and she immediately starts yelling at me saying, \u201cWHY WOULD YOU TELL MOM MY SONS MAKING A MESS?\u201d \u201cDONT TALK ABOUT MY SON LIKE THAT\u201d I tell her that it\u2019s not her son, I understand he\u2019s a toddler, but she has to be responsible for that. My mom calls me and I go to leave to my room. I noticed my sister following me and out of the corner of my eye I see her threaten to punch me. I turn around and say \u201cgirl don\u2019t even\u201d then she punches me in the face and we tackle each other to the ground. My mom was on the phone the whole time and was telling her to get out of the house. She wouldn\u2019t leave and kept arguing with me saying stuff about how nobody helps her and she will never talk to us again but the thing is, she has lived in three people\u2019s houses rent free, including ours. She asks everybody for money and they send her money. Our family has helped her so much and she is so ungrateful and entitled. My mom gets home from work and tells her that she needs to get a hotel for a few days before they can come back and have a conversation about this all. \n\nThree days pass and it was the most relaxing three days of my life. I deep cleaned the house and discovered how much damage she has caused to our house (holes in the wall, paint splattered on everything, just everything being nasty). \n\nThe day has come that they come back. My sister has to work so she drops off her fianc\u00e9 and their son first. I talk to her about everything and we seem to be on the same page, she witnessed my sister hit me and argue with me. Time passes and everyone is home now. We tried to talk but my sister wasn\u2019t engaging and was just staring off into space. At this point, no one is mad anymore we just want to work through this bump in the road, but my sister, oh no she was pissed. She denied everything and acted like she didn\u2019t do anything wrong and kept asking for proof of everything that we talked to her about even though everyone knows what happened. She leaves and goes to their room. \n\nI leave and go to my room but I can hear my sister talking to her fianc\u00e9 about everything through the wall and she acted like she had no clue about anything. She said she didn\u2019t see my sister punch me and was just telling my sister what she wanted to hear. This pisses me off so I tell my mom what\u2019s going on and we go to their room to stop the twisting of the story. My sister had nothing but hateful things to say to me, but what really got me was that she said I never have her back when I say I do. I really have had her back so many times there are so many things that I have never told another soul because she asked me to. I tell her that and she\u2019s still denying and lying. I figured that the only way I can prove to her that I in fact did have her back and to get it through to her that she needs to stop lying and be accountable for her actions, was to tell her darkest secrets. I started tame and told my mom the reasoning why my sister got jumped a few years back. My sister acts oblivious. I as her if she wants me to keep going. She says she doesn\u2019t care, so I tell her fianc\u00e9 about how she cheated on her with a man less that a year ago. Of course she denies it but I had proof. I pull up text messages of her describing everything when it happened and she still tried to deny it. \n\nShe and her fianc\u00e9 start arguing which causes my sister to run away. She would do this all the time growing up, if she got caught doing something bad, she would run away but she would come back an hour later, but keep in mind this is a 23 year old adult were talking about. We found her sitting on the street talking to a random man and we bring her back home. She keeps threatening to off herself, which is another tactic she used as kids. \n\nAt home, she starts arguing with my mom and I, saying that everyone hates her and that I ruined her life and I only said that out of spite. I told her exactly why I did it but she\u2019s not having it because when she makes up a story in her head, she will stick to it. \n\nMe and her fianc\u00e9 go to the gas station to blow off some steam and we talked the whole time. She talked about how my sister would try to do \u201cnasty stuff\u201d to her but she didn\u2019t want to because she had a gut feeling that she was cheating and she was right. She also said that when she didn\u2019t want to do anything, my sister would try to force herself into her. Her saying this triggered my memory of the SA that happened when I was a kid. I told her about it and she said she believed me. \n\nWe get home and I figured I should probably tell my mom about the SA. I had hidden this from everyone because my sister always threatened me and by the time she was no longer a threat to me, I had blocked out that memory. This whole situation just resurfaced everything. My mom was horrified and at this point no one knows what to do but my sister needs to get out of the house. She has no one to go to because she ruined everyone\u2019s trust. She has no money because she can\u2019t save for shit. We decide to sleep on it because at this point it\u2019s like 1 am. \n\nI couldn\u2019t sleep for the life of me but the next day, this all continues. The fianc\u00e9 repeated everything I told her to my sister and of course she is denying everything and calling me a liar who is just out to get her. Not only that, but her fianc\u00e9 is denying everything that she told me, such as my sister forcing herself onto her. Their stories for everything keep changing but mine has stayed the same for everyone. \n\nAll day my sister was talking shit about me. It\u2019s so bad that I can\u2019t even be in my own room because I can hear them talking through the wall. As of now, I\u2019m sleeping on the floor in my mom\u2019s room. If I\u2019m not in the same room as my mom, they will talk shit to her. Despite all of this, my mom believes me and my one story, along with all of the proof I have. I haven\u2019t been this enraged since I lived with my sister as a kid. It feels like I\u2019m living with squatters from the worst roommate show. I have zero privacy and I can\u2019t breathe without someone making something up about me. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, this is still going on as of right now. I\u2019m currently on spring break so we have time to deal with this but we don\u2019t know how and if they\u2019re still here by the time I go back to school I will go insane. I have no where to go to because all my family lives in another state. I can\u2019t live like this. There\u2019s a lot of details I missed but it\u2019s just too much and my brain is scrambled. If anyone has any advice, please help. ",

I had,what i had hoped, was a solid job offer that might turn my life around.\n\nNow 4 months in,its such a huge lie. I live in a tiny space with a roommate, because company housing and all that jazz. I dont even have a closet to my name. We share a room and bed so tiny I'm scared im gonna fall off of it. There's no privacy, i work almost 70 hours a week, i barely manage to make friends and my coworkers are pieces of shits.\n\n The people here hate women so much that they make random complaints about them. I got called to my boss' office because apparently they heard fighting from my cabin,WHEN I DON'T EVEN TALK TO ANYONE!. The manager of the hotel i live in apparently complained that i screamed at the housekeeping, newsflash,i stay awake for 3 hours after work and dont even stay home for the weekends. They just straight up lied and for what? I cannot wrap my head around any possible reason why they would do it.\n\n I stay out of everyone's way and yet trouble finds me. I went to a concert back in January with a guy who i thought  could be my friend, but he turned out to be a jerk when i got drunk and he tried to take advantage of me. Then i decided I would go to concerts alone,and i got a can of coke thrown at my head. Fun times y'all.\n\nHow does it feel for someone to be tested at every moment of every day like this. For no reason. I live in such a dump there's 0 privacy. I work for so long hours that i barely even have the energy to stay awakeet alone pick fights with housekeeping (wtf).\n\n I feel like such an idiot because this is the best job i could get right out of college, i can't afford to take a break and go find  something better. Every move we make is guarded and recorded here, i can't even bring a guy around to my place because one,its apparently not allowed, and two, who brings a guy to a shared accommodation? I feel like im 14 and living with my parents.  Everyday my will to live is chipped away, i am constantly stressed. And now the cherry on top in someone's making up stories about me. How do you defend yourself from incidents that never happened?\n\nI know its such a rant but truth be told i regret waking up everyday . I hate seeing the people around me,i hate living with constant fear of what might go wrong, who i might accidentally offend by existing. At this point i keep myself alive as a social experiment, to see how much a person can take.",

It was relatively cheap and food was decent. \n\nWe lived in a city with quite some homeless people and oftentimes a few of them were hanging around waiting for money. \n\nAnyway, this one time we were eating and started hearing this commotion. We went to check what was up and it was a homeless guy being quite upset at the counter. \n\nHe had saved up some money to buy himself a meal, but was a few euros short and staff had thrown out the food he was going to buy. (It was a buffet style diner). He was so upset and I felt so bad, I asked my parents to get him a new plate. We didn't have a lot of money, but my parents still agreed. \n\nMy mother and I went back and told the staff we would buy him a new plate. \nTurns out, it had been the last portion of that specific dish and they had just thrown it out. So, of course, he became very upset again. \n\nIn the end, we bought him another meal and he thanked us profusely. We didn't sit with him though, which I hope we had. My father didn't speak the language and my mother is deaf, so it probably would've been very awkward anyway. \n\nAnyway, it's not a sensational story. I just sometimes get reminded of it and then get upset for a few minutes. I really wish we'd sat with him. He was probably in need of some company and just someone to talk to. \n\nHe had saved up for probably days to get this one dish he really wanted and he never got it. \n\nI hope he was able to get out of that situation and eat that dish another time.

I don\u2019t want him to suffer but he doesn\u2019t get to erase the past, not when he\u2019s grown and fully aware of what he did. The worst part?!

It\u2019s a nightmare..\n\nSeeing him makes me sick. His words are like a joke. I want to scream, to tell everyone the truth about what he did. Because of him, I\u2019m still afraid of men. I flinch at even the gentlest touch, even from friends. I sleep alone. I can\u2019t bring myself to say yes to a date, no matter how kind the guy is.. because deep down, I know I have nothing left to give.\n\nI don\u2019t feel normal anymore.\n\nI\u2019m exhausted by the questions\u2026\n\"Why do you only have female friends?!\"\n\"Why do you act so distant around men?!\"\n\"Do you hate them?!\"\n\"Are you a lesbian?!\"\n\nMaybe I am.

How would it make you feel?!\nDo you, like us, carry this weight and long to set it down?!\n\nI just want to know.. how do you all feel after everything?!\n\nBecause I feel devastated. Even after all these years, I still can\u2019t forget.\n\nI wonder, is there even a single man in this world who has sincerely apologized for this?! Who has taken responsibility, helped his sister heal and given her a chance to live a normal life again?!\n\nI want to believe that no one is beyond change, that people can choose to be better if they truly try.\n\nIs that too much to hope for?!\n\n(If any of this resonates with you, then please.. apologize to your sisters.

We just hit it off, we were different people but we just understood each other and got along really well. \n\nNot long after high school, we realised we had feelings for each other and that we wanted more than friends, and we decided to give it a try. We dated for about 6 months and it just felt natural, probably since we had been close for a long time. \n\nShe is a strongly religious individual, as is her family, and that was never an issue for me, and she had assured me that although I wasn\u2019t as religious (I\u2019m a raised Catholic but not to the extent), this wasn\u2019t a dealbreaker. It was part of our friendship to tease each other about our levels of faith.\n\nThat is until she broke up with me via phone call whilst I was visiting family, saying that she needed someone who could share her religious beliefs with. Naturally I was heartbroken and when I returned home, we spoke and she reaffirmed this further. We broke up and that was that.\n\nAcross the next 3 years I learned to move on, initially my mental and emotional state was rough but I learned to improve myself. I could say proudly that I wasn\u2019t the wreck I was afterwards.\n\nI found out about 6 months ago that she was dating someone else and had been for about a year (small town, everyone knows everything). At the time I was really happy for her (despite everything, she was still my friend for a big chunk of my life) and I ended up messaging her and telling her that. \n\nThat is until earlier tonight, while stalking on Facebook I saw that she had gotten engaged to this guy, and all I felt was sadness and jealousy, like someone had turned back the clock 3 years on my emotions, feeling like rubbish that it wasn\u2019t me with her still.\n\nImmediately after that I felt so guilty, like a horrible human being for feeling this way. I have no right to, we both moved on with our lives. I don\u2019t even want to message her again, let alone want to be with her again.\n\nI\u2019m just so disappointed in myself that all the hard work I had done across 3 years has gone down the drain\n",

I count every single calorie, and honestly, it's exhausting.\n\nI\u2019m from a Southeast Asian country where most of my peers are naturally small and skinny. Even if they eat a lot, they either don\u2019t gain weight like I do or lose it effortlessly. At 5\u20198\u201d and 150 lbs, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m that heavy. Yes, I\u2019m on the heavier side compared to the people around me, but I carry most of my weight in my chest, which only makes me look even \u201cfuller.\u201d On top of that, I\u2019m considered tall for a woman here, so I always feel like a \"giant.\"\n\nPeople,friends, strangers, family freely comment on my height and weight, and not in a good way. My family, especially, constantly gives me unsolicited diet advice, tells me I\u2019ve eaten enough, and makes jokes about my body. But the worst part is my mom. She\u2019s obsessed with having a \"perfect-looking\" daughter, and to her, that just means being pretty and skinny. My academic achievements, my promising career\u2014none of it matters. To them, I\u2019m just \"the fat one.\"\n\nBecause of this, I\u2019m always forcing myself to choose the \u201chealthier\u201d option, trying to burn off every calorie I consume. I religiously log everything into MyFitnessPal and limit myself to 1,000\u20131,500 calories a day, on top of working out. But no matter how much I restrict myself, my weight won\u2019t drop anymore. It\u2019s frustrating. I just want my mind to quiet down so I can enjoy a meal, but I feel like I\u2019m not even enjoying my life anymore. People still see me as the \"giant\" friend or the \"oversized\" girl in the family, and no matter what I do, the comments never stop. If I ever defend myself, I get dismissed as being \u201csalty because I\u2019m fat.\u201d\n\nI love food. I love cooking and baking. But I\u2019ve realized that I\u2019ve been trapped in this toxic cycle of diet culture for almost **13 years**. And after all this time, people still won\u2019t stop commenting on my body. It\u2019s made me start hating the things I once loved. I hate my reflection. I hate the small portions I force myself to eat just to fuel my body. And sometimes, when the guilt gets too overwhelming, I purge\u2014not even after binge eating, just after a regular meal. I\u2019ve even told my mom about it when she criticizes my weight, but she just stares at me and says I must be lying because I\u2019m \u201cnot losing any weight.\u201d\n\ni tried brushing everything off and thinking as long as i'm eating healthy and my body is healthy then it's okay but this is every single day, and some days it gets to me...and is mentally stuck in there.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do anymore. This is mentally draining, and I just feel stuck. If you have any thoughts and or advice, I\u2019d appreciate hearing them.",

    "selftext": "Tl dr; My marriage isn\u2019t over, but I don\u2019t think it will ever be the same. \n\nFirst, thank you to everyone that replied and messaged. I read every single one. I appreciated the hopeful comments and identified with the harsh ones. I\u2019m no angel in this story. \n\nSo some extra info - my husband has a very high intensity job, and travels frequently. I took over the bills so nothing would get lost in the shuffle when he was away from home and he could focus on what he needed to focus on. (Insert joke here, right). \n\nI wad a complete wreck last week. I barely slept, was physically anxious, and was both absolutely dreading Friday but also couldn\u2019t wait for it to just get here already. Fortunately my husband was on a work trip and my kids were busy with basketball, friends, theatre, etc and were barely home. I barely ate and lost like 3 lbs that I\u2019ve been stuck on. Not recommended for a diet plan. \n\nFriday we planned to each work a half day then have some lunch and look at our budget for the year. Tax returns were pretty decent and my husband got a good annual bonus, so it made sense to see what was what. He was already talking about throwing some in a CD or investment and I just felt ill. \n\nFriday comes and he comes home with In\u2019n\u2019Out and a chocolate shake for me and I just \u2026 lost it. Full on sobbing. It freaked the hell out of him, and took me like ten minutes to get myself under control. Then I spilled it all. I started with \u201cI love you and I\u2019m sorry\u201d and just let fly. That wasn\u2019t my plan, I had a whole thing written down to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything and it didn\u2019t matter at all. \n\nTo his incredible credit he just sat there in shock and listened. Then he definitely under-reacted and went directly to \u201cwe\u2019ll fix it together\u201d mode. He wanted some time to absorb what I\u2019d said and then wanted to work through our accounts one by one to see what was actually up, and he wanted to do this alone, then we\u2019d come up with a plan. \n\nI let him be and just did some cleaning and laundry. After maybe 45 minutes I heard him leave the house with a door slam. I wasn\u2019t about to chase him down after he asked for space to process. I did look at the computer and it was a list of all our outstanding balances. \n\nTo everyone guessing figures, here you go:\n\nI assumed it would be 60k based on my rough math, but I had forgotten a couple I had on autopay. \n\n$96,000 in debt that he had no idea about. \n\nHe messaged me a while later that he was going to stay by his mom for the night and would be back to pack a bag, and that he would rather not talk yet. I respected that and made myself scarce. \n\nHe came home the next day and we manufactured some time alone to talk by sending the kids out to run errands. The oldest can drive and loves any excuse. \n\nThe heart to heart was basically this - I fucked up royally here, but he shouldn\u2019t have checked out completely and let it get to this point. He is going to take over our finances. We\u2019re going to do a HELOC or second mortgage for all the recurring stuff and buckle down HARD. We will review everything together at least twice a month. We will do marriage counseling together. \n\nI agreed to absolutely every term and condition. I honestly thought he wasn\u2019t going to come back. Things are chilly at best right now, and I am so desperately sorry and sick over the hurt I caused. At the same time there is a deep sense of relief that, whatever happens, I\u2019m no longer lying about it and everything is out in the open. \n\nMaybe he\u2019ll still decide that he can\u2019t move on, but I\u2019m going to own whatever happens. \n\n",

    "selftext": "I grew up with my mother, who was a single parent. She had chosen to leave my father due to his alcohol and pill addiction. Shortly before I was born, she was granted disability pension because she was born with a spinal defect that made her physically disabled. In addition, she had repeatedly been to the psychiatric emergency room in the 1970s, likely due to being placed in foster care as she was born out of wedlock.\n\nToday, I know that I had undiagnosed ADHD that hindered my schooling, but this was not noticed by either the school or child and adolescent psychiatry. Despite having countless interactions with the school, child psychiatry, and social services to find a sustainable way for my mother and me to live together without harming each other. (Today, I have met social workers who are surprised that I placed myself in foster care when they hear what I went through as a child, and they say that things would have been handled differently today...)\n\nAfter struggling hard in elementary school to get into the high school program I wanted, my life was turned upside down when I found out that my father was sober (and had been for a few years) and that he hoped word would reach me that he wanted to contact me. So, just as I was about to start high school, I suddenly had a father again, and we were to try to establish a relationship despite barely having seen each other since I was two years old. At the same time as I was getting to know my father, it became untenable for me to continue living at home with my mother, and together with social services, my move away from home (with the help of social services) was being prepared at the age of 17. Shortly after the decision had been made, and I had moved in with my girlfriend and her family in a state of panic, my first major setback arrived.\n\nMy father passed away in his home, and I had to take care of going through and packing up his home (as well as his workplace), while also having my room at my mother's and the half of the household goods she had saved for me during my upbringing, so that I would have something resembling a home when I moved out. My uncle took care of my father's hunting weapons and his car, but the rest was left for 17-year-old me to handle, contacting private individuals and authorities, and announcing his passing. Not to mention the feat of improvising a funeral without any idea of what my father's taste or preferences were and any wishes he might have had for the ceremony. I still remember that I actually had a fever at his funeral.\n\nWe fast forward a few years to when I surprised my mother (our relationship improved immediately once I moved out) by taking her to be in the audience of her favorite TV show. That's when an idea was born in my head: TV/film, that's what I want to do! I came home and started researching how to get into the industry and saw that there were some educational programs I could apply for. But to get into these, I first needed to complete my high school studies. So I did, and then I applied to various programs until, after 2-3 years, I finally got into one.\n\nThe problem with the program was that it was over 200 km (roughly 125 miles) from my hometown, and I prepared to move to the location by myself to start my studies. But it turned out that my partner chose to join me in the move. Meanwhile, my mother had gradually worsened, and at that time, it was nice to get away from her gradual decline. Her memory was getting worse and worse. The program I had been accepted into was a two-year program, with the first year focusing on theory and most of the second year dedicated to practical training. But before we were to go out on internships, we had a short film to complete first. On the second to last day of filming our short film, my second major setback arrived (and at that time, I didn't know it would last for a long time).\n\nDuring filming, one of our actors collapsed and passed away during the ambulance ride to the hospital. I was responsible for the sound during filming and had four different microphones running, which captured the sounds the person made before they fell to the floor and we rushed to begin CPR while waiting for the ambulance. By some miracle and some trick filming, we managed to finish filming and could focus on the internship period.\n\nThe problem was that 90% of media production takes place in the capital, so a move to an already overcrowded city was the next step. After much searching, I found a place to live, or so I thought. It turned out to be a scam, and when I confronted the person and said I didn't want a lot of things ordered in my name, I was threatened with murder (the continuation of earlier mentioned setback).\n\nI managed to shake it off and made it to the capital and started my internships. But when things were running smoothly and the engine was at its hottest, the setbacks decided to hit hard.\n\nAs an unpaid intern trying to break into the industry, it was natural to say yes to everything, to be the one who fixed everything. Especially if you had gotten an internship at the same production where I had previously taken my mother. After a few weeks, the situation (saying yes to all and everything and at the same time having an undiagnosed ND-disorder) became untenable, and the supervisors chose to terminate my internship. I became so unwell that I sought help at the psychiatric emergency room, where they determined that I was burned out from what had happened. I then chose to move back to my partner to lick my wounds and recover. But barely a week passed before my sister called and informed me that my mother had collapsed and been taken by ambulance to the intensive care unit. Because her medication, including blood thinners, had been discontinued, she suffered multiple blood clots, which ultimately led to her death.\n\nWhile we were at the hospital and watching over her, knowing that she didn't have much time left, my partner chose to declare that 11 years together was enough and that she didn't think she could or wanted to continue. This was said when we were only a few meters from my dying mother. Once my mother passed away, it was almost Christmas, and we rushed to arrange a funeral to get it done before the year ended. At the same time, a process began to divide our 11-year life together.\n\nI started looking for a new place to live, and six months after my mother passed away, I moved, and a year of rehabilitation and sick leave to recover began. When I slowly started to feel ready again, I got a media job in the new location and began to feel that I could spread my wings again and actually aim for the capital again. So I did. I got a long-term temporary position, and there I was informed that even though it was a temporary position, it was for a function that was needed Monday to Friday, day in and day out, as long as the channel was broadcasting. This temporary position and this \"promise\" came five months before reports started coming in about people getting sick in China with symptoms like persistent cough and high fever. Eight months after I had started the temporary position, my service was terminated in favor of the permanent employees in the company.\n\nAfter arguing with the authorities to get my unemployment benefits (which felt like half the country was doing at the same time), I found an ad for a position 220 km (ca. 137 miles) north of the capital, and I packed up my belongings and left. I took a chance and hoped it would work out this time. I arrived and managed to work through the probationary period before COVID-19 hit with a new wave of illnesses, and people were afraid to hire permanently, which resulted in me being unemployed again, now in a much smaller location.\n\nNow, misfortune also began to take a toll on my finances, and I needed to take my first loan. A few more months passed, and a new opportunity opened up at the company I had worked for before the pandemic, but this time 490 km (ca. 305 miles) south. Again, I packed up my life and moved south. This time, everything felt good. I felt satisfied, and my new boss and team were happy with me. But then came the date when my probationary period was to turn into permanent employment. My boss checked with my colleagues and found that they were happy with me, but that I sometimes \"disappeared\" when I finished my tasks, and that I sometimes had difficulty reading social situations. This became the basis for their decision not to continue my employment, and the same thing happened again! (Later, it was determined that I have ADHD-I, and that the boss's decision was therefore discrimination based on disability.)\n\nLife repeat it self and I moved again and this time, it was a move of 200 km (ca. 125 miles), and to make that move even possible (and to cover previous expenses), I had to take a loan of approximately 20,000 USD (or about 18,000 EUR). Once there, I got a job where I stayed for two years before I realized there was no room for me evolving and I had to make the choice to go back to school (this time focusing on IT/networks/servers). This time, I had just turned 36 when I started studying again, and I was the second oldest in the class and felt like a fossil compared to my classmates. However, this time I had worked and pushed through an NPF (Neuropsychiatric Disability) assessment and now have a diagnosis of ADHD (inattentive version), and I know that with that, I have the right to help in my daily life, both in school/work and privately.\n\nToday, the debt is down to about 15,000 USD (or about 13,500 EUR), and I see a glimmer of light on the horizon. But at the same time, I know what it has cost me to get here, and that it will take time to reach the metaphorical tunnel. But I also feel an immense frustration that \"no one\" has taken the responsibility they should have.\n\nI know very well that I can't do anything about the situation today, but despite that, I can't help but retrospectively grieve that my ADHD was not discovered and diagnosed earlier. Who knows? Then I might have completed my high school studies and gotten into higher education earlier, and actually had a few years in the job market and stayed in the boat when the metaphorical waves came. Sure, I would have certainly gotten soaked and at times felt close to going overboard, but I wouldn't have fallen into the water like a mitten at the slightest ripple of waves, as I did in reality.\n\nSo, besides feeling deprived of \"everything\" that people usually do in their twenties, like traveling, working as an au pair, and partying, I haven't had the opportunity to experience all of that. And now I've met a partner who has already done everything they want to do as a \"young adult\" and who is well established in the job market and who, shortly after we met, was able to buy their first apartment. And here I stand, feeling stupid, unfinished, and \"late to the game\" in general when it comes to life. Add to that that my partner wants to start a family soon, and I who had hoped that after my education I would hopefully get a job and then do a forty-year-old's version of what I missed in my twenties \u2013 no, then I'll instead \u201chave\u201d to start a family, and instead of spending money on vinyl records I now may have to focus on buy teething toys and baby bottles, and instead of planning and comparing trips, I'll instead sit and compare preschools, and then when one is found, start planning for the enrollment of the child. It feels like I'm being deprived of life, and part of me feels incredibly selfish, while the other sees it more evolutionary and I realize that I have it better than, for example, a praying mantis male, who, if he's not in the game, dies after reproduction is completed. The question is just exactly how big the difference is?",

I'm very introspective, have ADHD, and have dated enough to actually know what I want. On the flip side I also have an awful history with relationships. I've been cheated on, used and left, and downright just ignored and ghosted on many occasions. I know in some cases it's through *some* fault of my own for moving fast. \n\nAnyways, with my current girlfriend, we're long distance. We met in person for the first time on a weekend trip and found out we have great physical chemistry on said trip. Our trip was two and a half weeks ago and we became official the night we returned to our homes. Before the trip, we had been in the talking phase for around ten days and we have been nothing but compatible the entire time.\n\nWe haven't had even the slightest hint of an argument (not for trying to avoid them we just get along extremely well), she treats me better than literally everyone I've ever been with, and she is the most supportive and understanding woman I have ever had the pleasure of being with. She's scared of us burning out and we have both decided to take it emotionally slow so that we can enjoy ride.\n\nBy the time our next visit happens, it will have been over a month of us being together and I have been thinking about telling her that I love her on the trip but I also still want to wait until *she* also feels sure about me. We've got another trip planned for after this one already and for that one it will be a week (I'm helping her move) so it's not like I don't have the time to let it sit more. \n\nAaaaaaaanyways, thanks for reading this, whoever did actually read it.

    "selftext": "TW: Abuse and SA content\n\nWhen I (20f) was around 7 years old a new girl moved to my school. We ended up being in the same grade and class together. She wasn\u2019t overly talkative or outgoing but she was super sweet and friendly. We ended up getting closer and I found out she had two siblings, one younger and one older and that she just lived with her mom and her mom\u2019s boyfriend. \n\nShe stopped coming to school often after the first year and when she did show up she would hide herself in sweaters even if it was super hot outside. I didn\u2019t really notice anything out of the different because I was a kid but I think the teachers started noticing because they had mentioned it to higher staff and her mom ended up withdrawing them from school.\n\nWhen I was around 10 news came out that the three kids were getting physically and mentally abused by their mother and her boyfriend, there was even accusations of SA towards the one girl I knew from the mothers boyfriend. I remember reading that he had committed murder and was on the run and that he was two provinces away from where he committed the crime. \n\nThey ended up catching on the where he was when he was with my friend\u2019s mom and him and the mom decided to bail and move somewhere far. They left the kids behind and luckily their father caught on and came and got them after years of not seeing them. The poor kids were alone in the house for 2 months before being able to reach out, the kids said they were too scared to leave home even though their mom and her boyfriend were gone. \n\nThis is the shorter end of the story but this happened just over 10 years ago and I think about it every day. I hope she and her siblings are doing well. ",

I didn\u2019t get neither the money, nor the parcel, nor any kind of compensation, while this was the worst thing to happen to me this last month this type of shit happens daily, I just can\u2019t handle it, it\u2019s not even like I focus only on the shit parts of my life I try to stay positive but I just can\u2019t when everything is ass, because it\u2019s very rare to something good happen to me, the last good thing wrote on my diary was when I got a refund for something I wasn\u2019t expecting them to give me refund and many people giving me \u201chappy birthday\u201d when I wasn\u2019t expecting many people to do it, but these things are more than a month ago.\n\nI never had a good long period in my life, either being abused by my parents, heartbroken by my first (and only) love, father \u201cabandoning me\u201d, losing my dog, losing my siblings, having shit grades all the time regardless how hard I try, discovering I got ADHD/autism, bullied, dealing with hairloss as a teen, and now feeling like I\u2019m alone since I lost majority of my friends, I know there are many people who got it worse than me but it still doesn\u2019t neglect my suffering, plus the feeling that this is misery porn and someone is laughing at this shit happening is constant, I really want to enjoy life and live happily but it just seems life doesn\u2019t let me, I know life has ups and downs but my life is just constant downs, many people will say \u201cit will be better\u201d but I\u2019ve told myself that endless times and it\u2019s only gotten worse regardless how hard I try to make it better, I just can\u2019t handle this anymore I feel cornered all my life and even if I can make my life a better one (which I really doubt it) I will still have the mental issues that these experiences gave me, I don\u2019t see no future for me.",

But he keeps doing it even though I am visibly uncomfortable, and I never reciprocate this kind of behavior to him.\n\nIn another instance, we were at a festival, and while under the effects of MDMA he grinded his crotch on me for a couple of seconds. I didn\u2019t pay attention to it at first, but after some months I realized all this makes me extremely uncomfortable and I feel like it is sexual assault. As far as I know he rarely did this to others, and only really me.\n\nI now try to avoid him and his messages, as I feel uncomfortable being around him, and don\u2019t really want to continue being friends. He's somewhat integrated into my current friend group although not much and I'm worried about future plans that might include him, and his girlfriend has always been kind to me and listened to my past trauma and issues, so I feel bad not interacting with her either.

She invited me to talk on discord, and so on we kept talking about fun stuff and life, after a month she just blocked from everywhere, I still don't know why. I tried contacting her through her friend and she just acted out cold and that's it, I keep thinking about why she did that (could be because I was annoying and message her a lot, could be because I was too depressing for her..)\n\nThe second one is also a girl from another country, and this one I got really close with cause I told her about my experience with the first one, I tried to avoid the mistakes I made with the first one, she invited me to talk on Instagram, we would talk for hours and all night, our conversation would go from laughing to talking about hobbies and life, we would tell stories from our childhood, and.. she also opened up about her problem and tried my BEST to comfort her and it worked, she tried to get me to talk but I just refused, with time and as we got closer I give in and talk and she was soo supportive,  we continue talking for a month with almost the same energy until one day she also blocked me from everywhere, I don't understand I made sure I don't pressure her, I give her the space to want to talk to me, yes I might of messaged more but I made sure she not busy I even end a conversation if I sense that she needs to study. I tried reaching out for her from another account, and she said \"nothing personal don't overthink it\" I asked for a reason but she didn't answer so I just said it was nice knowing you, she said \"me too\",  what have I done wrong, I was supposed to make her a birthday gift and sent it to her because she did the same, but it took both of us time, that can't be the reason I told her I'm still working on it, my only hypothesis is that she didn't like someone being too close with her, she wanted to be alone again and she didn't want to make me feel bad so she just blocked me, she didn't block me from the second account yet, should I send her this thing or not\n\nI don't know if I can get close with people again after this, I feel like just staying alone for the rest of my life.",

Idk what I will do if I ever lose him, I can't imagine losing him.. we just clicked from the first moment we met. The looks in his eyes now, how he couldn't hold eye contact with me at first.. he'd always look down, or look away. \ud83e\udd79 It was so cute, and still is. He calls me Mama and Mommy.

    "selftext": "I had a really disturbing dream last night, and I feel like it carries a strong meaning. It was incredibly vivid, and I felt an overwhelming sense of guilt and horror throughout.\n\nThe dream:\n\nI was sleeping in a hammock in the hall of my apartment building in my hometown when an old woman and her friends surrounded me, claiming that she had left her jewelry\u2014one necklace and three rings\u2014on my hammock. While I was still half-asleep, I found the jewelry, but she kept grabbing at me, searching for it. I hid the pieces because I wanted to keep them.\n\nLater, I ended up returning only the necklace, which was worthless, at the building\u2019s front desk, but I kept the rings for myself. This threw me into a huge moral dilemma.\n\nThen, I spent what felt like an eternity waiting for my food delivery. When I finally went to pick it up, I found the delivery guy lying on the ground in a pool of blood, his legs completely crushed. Cars kept driving over him as if he wasn\u2019t even there. There were two other bodies, crushed beyond recognition, one of them a child.\n\nI was with David (my childhood best friend, a doctor) and Sophie (my best friend, one year behind me in med school). David went to help the injured. Meanwhile, Leo (a former friend I used to do reckless things with) appeared, but he only walked beside me. We greeted each other, exchanged glances like we had things to catch up on, but we didn\u2019t actually talk.\n\nAs I walked back to my apartment, still holding the rings in my mouth, I decided to give them to the front desk guy. But when I got there, the usual porter was gone\u2014this one was heavily tattooed, someone I didn\u2019t recognize. Instead of taking the jewelry, he encouraged me to keep the rings and spend all the money on cocaine. He handed the rings back to me.\n\nThen, I got home, and my \u201cfamily\u201d\u2014but it wasn\u2019t my real family, it was The Sopranos\u2014walked in. Their presence made me feel emboldened to keep the jewelry. I put the rings on my fingers.\n\nBut then the old woman appeared again. This time, she confronted me directly and took the rings from me.\n\nThe entire dream was extremely vivid. I felt a crushing sense of guilt, and the violence of the crushed bodies was horrifying\u2014I could smell the blood and flesh mixed with rain, and I could hear the families crying in the distance.\n\nAt some point\u2014either in this dream or another one\u2014I also remember seeing my father. It was from a time before he was bedridden, before everything went downhill. He died when I was 19 after a 3 year long battle with cancer.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nContext that might be relevant:\n- I\u2019m a last year medical student and a (maybe recovering) polyaddict. I\u2019m like a week totally clean from everything except nicotine (ketamine and weed were the last drugs I used), maybe three weeks clean of a mild to moderate opiate habit. Coke isn\u2019t really my thing but I had a conversation about my addiction with my roommate and can\u2019t stop reflecting about my use ever since.\n\n- David is my childhood best friend, now a doctor.\n\n- Sophie is my best friend, one year behind me in med school.\n\n- Leo was my main companion for reckless behavior, including drugs. For whatever reason he suddenly cut me and another friend off but recently started sending memes like nothing happened. For the first time, I\u2019m considering cutting him off completely.\n\n- I\u2019m currently watching The Sopranos.\n\n\nThis was one of the heaviest dreams I\u2019ve ever had, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that it means something important.\n\nImmediately after I woke up I felt the urge to register it. I was calm, just felt like an uncomfortable dream, but as soon as I started reading ChatGPT\u2019s output on its meaning I had a legit anxiety attack, I\u2019ve had like 5 LEGIT attacks in my life and this one was textbook. Hyperventilation and a physical urge to cry even though I wasn\u2019t feeling really emotional. \n\nThis hit me hard man. It reeks of psychoanalysis so much it\u2019s comical.",

    "selftext": "This is an update to a post I made back in October (it\u2019s the only other post on this account if you want to read that first) I just wanted to thank everyone who responded and helped me realize it wasn't my fault. All the kind words have been incredibly helpful. \n\nIt's been 5 months so buckle up because there's a lot to say. \n\nthis isn't exactly the update I'm sure most of you hoped to get. It's definitely not the one I thought I'd get.\n\nI haven't received justice. I probably never will. \n\nIn my last post I mentioned how I wasn't sure how my employers would react if I were to tell them I was assaulted. Since then, unfortunately, another employee I work for was harassed and after months the harasser was fired. Now I know they'd take it seriously, but the difference is that I don't have proof.\n\nI did kinda end up telling G. He had asked me to work with Z and at first I agreed, but after almost having a panic attack just thinking about being near him, I finally got the courage to say that I didn't want to work with Z. I didn't go into detail, but G changed my schedule so that I wouldn't have to. \n\nA couple of days after everything, I was on instagram and clicked on one of those suggested accounts based on your contacts and stuff. It was his poetry account and he had just posted a poem where he wrote all about me rejecting him and how people should feel bad that I didn't reciprocate his feelings, but he conveniently left out the part where he assaulted me. He committed a crime and then went and wrote poetry about it and posted it for people to read which is crazy (I find this funny now but at the time it wasn't lol) \n\nSome of my memory from that day has come back, but it's still mostly blocked out. It's hard knowing that I might not ever know exactly what happened. Even if I'm not sure I want to. I used up like all of my sick days after we came back for the spring semester because the thought of going back to work with that man made me physically sick. Thankfully, I mainly have only seen him in passing while I'm working. \n\nThis is my last year working as a teacher. I want to make it clear that I'm not quitting because of him. I've been involved with this program for over a decade as both a student and an instructor and I feel like it's time to close this chapter of my life. I fully believe I would have come to this conclusion even if nothing had happened. I'm young and still trying to figure out what I want to do in life. I want to take the opportunity to try out other passions of mine. \n\nI'm currently in the process of opening a theatre company with some friends and hope to have our first production in the fall. This has been a dream of mine for years and I never thought I'd actually get to do it.\n\nHonestly, for a moment I considered stepping away from theatre in all together. It felt like he had tainted the thing I loved most. Theatre was my first love and he ruined it. He took the place where my happiest memories happened and made them bitter.\n\nIn the 5 months it's been since everything happened I've realized that's bullshit. I have spent over a decade building a legacy in that department. I've broken and set records, I've advocated, and I led recruiting. I worked to prove to my community that the program and it's students were more than just some underfunded extracurricular w/ kids who wanted an easy class. I helped prove that they were talented and mattered. The last thing I want is for my kids to think that there's one less person who cares about them because I left quietly or that their passions aren't something worth pursuing because I gave up on mine. \n\nHe took a lot from me that day, but I'm not going to let him have this. The 10 year old that dreamed of doing what I'm doing now deserves better than that. The girl that was trapped in that room when it happened deserves better than that. I deserve better than that. \n\nI've hit the anger stage. I'm normally a very empathetic person and try to justify every bad thing a person does to me (not great ik) but w/ him I just get so angry when I see him and for once I can't think of a single reason why I shouldn't be. Of course it's all justified by the fact that he's starting to lash out in his own way.\n\nA couple of days ago, I was at a competition with my kids and I had my sister come up to me panicking, because while I was helping unload equipment from our trailer, he was talking to the contest manager to get my name removed from the program which meant I couldn't help them. We were down 4 crew members and needed all the help we could get. G had to get after him because wtf? What was the point of that? Later, while I was helping them assemble their set (they have to set up in &lt;7 minutes or get disqualified) he pulls me aside and tells me \u201cjust so you know, we can be disqualified and not allowed to compete anymore if you touch anything else. Don\u2019t forget you\u2019re just our assistant.\u201d In a condescending voice.\n\nThis upset me because I've been taking part in this competition for half of my life, I know the rules. I even studied the damn rulebook when I first got hired. I told him \"actually if you look at the program for tomorrow I'm listed as a director and directors are permitted to assist their students with the assembly of the set as long as students put up 70% of it.\" Which is 100% true. He didn't like my answer so I had to drag G away from where he was helping and have him say the same thing I did. He was just wasting our time. It's like he wanted the kids to get disqualified.\n\nI explained that he was listed as just an assistant so I needed him to let me do my job because he didn't even have anything to do with our production other than suddenly showing up the day of contest to yell at the kids and stress them out (he yelled at them for not moving fast enough when unloading the set even though we had arrived early to make sure we could take our time. Like I said everything he does pisses me off for good reason).\n\nI was definitely rude and me pulling rank is annoying but he could at least speak to me like I'm adult deserving of respect rather than treating me like a child who has no idea what they're doing. I don't understand why he wants to punish me and my kids because he doesn't know how to respect boundaries and not cheat on his wife. \n\nI from an area where it's very conservative &amp; religious so It feels like the odds of someone believing me are low, but I did tell my sister. I knew if anyone was going to understand me, it was her. I was there for her when she was assaulted and it's felt like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders having her by my side. I'm hoping to start therapy soon and begin working on how to cope with what's happened.\n\nI don't know what's in store for me in terms of trying to heal and what I'm going to do once I finally quit, but I'm sure it's going to be really hard.",

    "selftext": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons.\n\nThis message has been sitting in my drafts for a really long time. I could never find the courage to actually send it to her. I don't think I can even today. So here I am sending this out in the void, hoping that one day, it reaches her somehow.\n\nAfter checking out her WhatsApp DP for one last time, I finally decided to delete her contact as I prepare myself to let go and move on with my life.\n\nFrom strangers to friends, and now back to strangers... only this time, with bittersweet memories of eachother.\n\n--\n\nHey.\n\nI have been really thinking about everything that happened recently and I honestly don't think I can continue like this anymore. I know we already discussed this before but I hadn't fully processed my emotions at that time. I really care about you a lot and love you beyond words can express but this one-sided attachment is going to take a huge emotional toll on me. I also really hated your nonchalant behavior that day and the way you were acting so cold towards me and pushing me away like you suddenly decided your feelings have changed and we can't fit into each other's lives, whereas just a few days back, you were telling me how you would wrap yourself around me and wouldn't let me leave the bed and all, like all such moments meant absolutely nothing to you.\n\nSomething which I never told you, last year, on 31st, I was so f***ed up by everything that had happened between us in those last few days that I just kept drinking\u2026 and drinking\u2026 until I finally lost consciousness right there in the club. My friends had to literally put me in a wheelchair and take me back to the hotel room. At times, they couldn\u2019t even feel my pulse, and for a moment, everyone thought I was a goner. The only thing I remember before passing out is wanting to talk to you on call because I just wanted to hear your voice one last time. I truly believe God gave me this second chance at life for a reason and I am going to make the most out of it.\n\nWith everything going on, especially with you moving to UK this year, we would be emotionally distanced even further and eventually things are going to fade away and we both know it. It is the start of a new chapter in your life soon and for me too, as I will have to learn to live without you. Our lives are just pulling us in different directions at this point. You were right. We have very different personalities, backgrounds, values and our future goals don't align either. That is a gap which is difficult to bridge.\n\nI really respect your feelings and boundaries and I have finally come to accept the unfortunate reality that things have changed between us now. I don't want either of us to continue holding on to something half-heartedly. I truly believe that destiny brought us together and meeting you was a part of my journey. I am really grateful to you because I never knew I was capable of loving someone so much and that too without expectations until I met you. What we shared was real and meaningful and I will always cherish those memories. After all, we shared a bond that has lasted for almost a decade without ever physically meeting each other.\n\nBut despite all this, things never really took off, which is why I think maybe we were never actually meant to be together but only to be a part of each other's journeys. I will really miss you, Janhavi. I will miss our chats and vc and how I was always able to be myself around you. I will miss waiting for your text for days and months every time we had a fight, how my day used to light up after seeing your text first thing in the morning, how my heart used to melt after hearing your sweet voice, how I used to play your voice notes again and again every time I missed you, how I struggled to keep up because you talk so fast, how I used to secretly steal glances at you when we were on vc, how my heart used to skip a beat after randomly receiving your text in the middle of the night, how I used to play my favorite songs to you on Spotify to convey my deeper feelings, how you used to always come back to me after every fight and we would start talking again like nothing happened, how you used to secretly install Kik on your mom's phone every night to chat with me and I used to stay awake waiting for you sometimes even till morning, how you made chocolates on my birthday and then ate them yourself on vc, how we used to send each other those \"disaster selfies\", how you used to fall asleep on vc while talking and I used to continue admiring you sleeping, how Sab Tera is still my favorite song even today because it was the one you sang to me, how we had Maggi at 3 AM on vc and you made fun of me for having a cupcake with it, and so many more such cute memories that I can't even possibly list them all here but these memories will always be a part of me and I will carry them with me forever. It was pure, innocent love at its best.\n\nMy life somehow always felt complete with you and stupid me always believed you were the one and that you were my soulmate and that one day I would definitely marry you. It's funny because I can't even tell you how many times I have rehearsed this whole scene in my head about how I would propose you. But I was wrong. In the end it was all in my head and you already had someone else in your life all these years. I don't blame you though and neither do I hold any grudge against you because of it. You will always be a huge part of my life regardless and someone who helped me understand love much more deeply and helped me grow as a person. I will always be thankful to you for that. I only regret that I never got to meet you in real life. But then again, I still believe you are an angel and it wasn't just your username and that's why I could never meet you. You came into my life for a reason but now is the time for me to let go.\n\nIf it is meant to be, I am sure God will bring our paths together once again, maybe in this lifetime or the next. But until then, this is where we must both go our separate ways. I wish you all the happiness in life and hope you can forgive me if I have ever hurt you in any way.\n\nGood vibes only. Goodbye, my favorite stranger.\n\nP.S. I am sorry for deleting our Spotify playlist yet again. I know you said that when you can\u2019t talk to me, you listen to it. But baby, I have to do this and it is what is best for both of us afterall.",

I can't recall how it happened exactly but I remember a couple guys came in and we were laughing and joking having a good time then all I remember is making out with this guy in a spare bedroom and getting really dizzy I remember he tried to put his hand under my dress but I stopped him by putting hand on his arm saying no but I have memory of being in the bed with him on top off me. I remember a light coming in the room when the door was opening and another guy coming in with my friend like they just caught us in the act. I woke up naked in bed next to him without being too gross their was evidence that a condom wasn't used. I told my friend that I think I was raped but she said she saw me making out with him before she saw us in the bedroom. My own friend doesn't even believe me but I don't know if she doesn't believe me because the guy is her cousin.

At eight I was thinking about it and it's like it doubles in intensity every year.\n\nIn year 9 (13/14) I tried to starve myself (weird ik) and planned a more conclusive attempt before reaching out for help on the day I planned and getting medical help/antidepressants. When I was in year 10 (14/15) I was worse, I planned, I collected drugs, and was found out. My parents confiscated anything basic I could hurt myself with. I got put into part time online schooling. Year 11 (15/16) things seemed to be getting better. I don't remember most of the year. Year 12 (16/17) I went through dellusionary episodes and attempted multiple times, sometimes on purpose, other times thinking I had to cut something out of me. I spent most of 2024 curled up in a ball waiting for my life to end. Things took a turn for the better at the start of December. \n\nNow the thing is every year I have at least a couple weeks of proper happiness. Other than a few years its usually a few months. During these months I feel I have gotten over the worst of it and everything is better now. But it always shows up again. It's back again for this year. I don't think I'm going to make it. I can't keep living like this. I can't go to therapy again because I don't trust mental health professionals anymore. I'm an only child and leaving my parents would devaste them but I can't stay. I'm so tired. I can't live like this, doing this every year? I don't do anything I enjoy anymore. It doesn't make me happy, if anything i feel worse. Every week seems to be a new issue that I didn't know I had to deal with. I'm over it. ",

    "selftext": "Hello, \nI know it's been forever since my original post. I honestly don't even know how to start this off. Since my original post was 2 months ago I figured an update was probably needed since I left so much in the dark.\n\nOver these 2 months my dad has moved out and is living somewhere else. me and my brother go over there after school and hang out until our mom can pick us up. They still act cordial in front of me and Tyler but they have so much built up tension it's concerning.\n\nBut on new years or like at 1ish on January 1st I tried to talk to my dad since he and tyler my little brother got into an argument about lighting off fireworks. I had gone downstairs since I thought I could talk to my dad and get his side of the story and just talk since he is my dad. But he had been drinking way way more than I have ever seen my dad drink before. So when I went to talk to him things took a sideways turn. My dad had ended up saying some words and the words he said still really fucking hurt. What he said to me really cut deep. he told me,\n\n \"I hate my life. I'm stuck in a shitty job, a shitty marriage, I have a son who treats his mom like shit, and then you. I have a daughter who is a piece of shit. When I found out I was going to have a daughter as my first kid, I was so excited. I thought i would have a daughter who loved to fish, hunt, and ve hardworking. instead I got a fucking snowflake of a daughter who doesn't like anytbing, is a worthless lazy piece of shit who expect her parents to bend over backwards for her. I got a daughter who doesn't give a fuck and is just nothing but a bitch.\"\n\nThat cut so fucking deep. and I hear those words in the back of my mind so much. \n\nAnd I haven't even really had a chance to really process the whole split with my parents. Because right after I was told my mom told me that I had to ve strong for my brother since this is really hard for him.\n\nSo I had to grow up and swallow the fact that my parents are taking a break. \nSo I tried to turn to my boyfriend (now ex) for comfort and support. Instead I got a couple comforting words and hum telling me it's going to ve okay. then he proceeded to tell me about his problems and how he got shot in the knee. (if anyone wants the story on this shit please let me know because at this point I need to talk because I can't afford a therapist and I'm going to explode if I don't let this shit out) \n\nI haven't gotten a break since this whole problem at Christmas. \nI get a Christmas present of my parents splitting. I start the new year with my dad telling me he hates me. Later I finally have enough with my toxic  boyfriend and decide to leave him and the police end up getting involved. \nliterally the only good thing about any of this shit is that I currently have a new boyfriend who is loving and supportive and doesn't gaslight, verbally and mentally abuse me, and will actually listen to me and all my problems. And I had my 15th in February as well.\n\nIf anyone wants more context I have much more but it's currently 2:19 in the morning and I haven't gotten a good night's sleep in about a week and a half. \n\nThank you to anyone and everyone who takes the time to read this mess of words. I hope you all have an amazing day/night.",

I seem to be the only one trying, but I am defined by my mistakes. I wasted my life for others, I did. It's foolish that I hope people to remember that, I feel foolish. How come I suddenly long for the struggles I had in the past? stuck in dead end jobs striving for survival, at least there I had a purpose, or at least there I had hope. Now, I don't know what to hope for, to pay debts? To get a better job? For the next Batman movie? To see if Superman Legacy will suck? Or Issue 6 of Absolute Batman? Is that all I'm hoping for now?

However, it took us 6 months of trying because he had ED (he was a porn addict I think). We had sex maybe 10 times jn the year we were together, but we did other things. Throughout our relationship I did some things I wasn\u2019t comfortable with just to appease him, to not appear an unexperienced and undesirable virgin. It was a toxic relationship that traumatized me and I took his inability to perform personally. I thought I was broken and ugly. \nA year later I got into another relationship that fixed my issues with sex, made me feel normal and desirable, hot, beautiful, but we weren\u2019t a good fit so I broke it off. I then got SAd by my first boyfriend\u2019s best friend, which ruined me. I was a normal girl before. So in total, not counting the rape, I had 5 partners before my current boyfriend and a few (2-3) \u201calmosts\u201d. My problem was I found a guy, we dated a few months then it turned out they had ED so we couldn\u2019t go all the way, I would then rush into sex with the next guy to prove to myself that I can have sex like a normal person and try to build a relationship from there (obviously it\u2019s not how it works). I would also wait quite a while between partners (a year, 6 months, a year and a half) so I always felt disconnected, anxious, stressed. \nThis is the first time I feel normal. I wished to have a normal relationship, and now I do. But I feel dirty and used, I hate myself for not knowing better, for not coping better, for finding sex empowering and cool. He knows and thinks I have little experience, he is very non judgmental. I have flashbacks of things I\u2019ve done, pictures I\u2019ve sent (just my first bf), no one has or should have material of me (unless it was against my will), but I still worry some could be brought up. It\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary I guess, it\u2019s just that I was pressured and not myself. I have no regrets about the experiences I chose for myself, but about the ones I was pressured into.

    "selftext": "Heres my dumb story, maybe someone will read it. Ive never told anyone. And I'm feeling lonely as hell.\n\nWhen I was 2 my mom had my little sister. People tell me I was very withdrawn, that once my sister came around, I almost stopped crying completely and that is was creepy.\n\nI got older, most of my memories that I remember I was always by myself. Getting myself ready for school, walking myself to the bus stop half a mile away in the dark. For kindergarten. \n\nWhen I was 7, my mom had my little brother. After that, I dont have many memories of her outside her room. I watched him and my sister for a few hours when he was a newborn. As he got older, she left me in charge of him more and more often. \n\nBy the time I was 8, I took care of my siblings from wake up to bedtime most days if I was home. Mom never left her room anymore pr sometimes she would be gone for a few days to a week (summertimes or weekends). I was their parent. I held them, fed them, parented them.\n\nWhen my sister started school that year, it stressed me out that my brother would be home \"alone\". And I would get physically ill from the stress and worry. It helped because I would be sick but still at home for my brother.\n\nThankfully, though, he was always ok when I got home. In fact, I was pretty sure that mom was out of her room while we were at school. But as soon as we came home, she was in her room and our brother was playing alone in our room. \n\nAs we got older, I was expected to keep up the house. If it wasn't it pristine condition, I would get punished. Better not to go into detail but there were physical punishments and mental punishments (the worst). For example if my mom ate something at midnight, I would get in trouble that the kitchen wasn't cleaned the next morning.\n\nI took care of my siblings, cooked all the meals, cleaned the house and deep cleaned weekly, yet I was somehow alwasy yelled at, punished, grounded.\n\nIn case anyone is wondering where my dad is? Gone usually. He would be home once a month and those were my best memories.. then he was gone for work but later I found out he would use this time to drink himself into hospitals.\n\nThat was my life from 10 to 15. We moved around a lot too, so I couldn't keep any friends especially because I developed severe social anxiety from some of mom's mental punishments. My mom loved to make me grounded whenever I actually had any plans. After turning down any new friends invitation 3 times in a row, they usually stopped calling me.\n\nMy sister, was becoming a mess. She was a feisty girl, alwasy fighting and looking for trouble, but also lonely and looking for friends to fill the hole that I just could not fill no matter how hard I tried :(\n\nHer problems came from severe bullying and she tried so hard to make friends. At the time, I would stress and yell at her, try to stop her from sneaking out, stop her from texting boys, I would get into fights with her all the time just to eat... now I'm looking back and I wish I just hugged her and was there for her instead. (She's moved out as soon as she turned 17, no contact with anyone but me and our brother. She has lots of friends now!)\n\nMy brother, was the most creative and smartest kid ever. He was reading, drawing and playing mine craft (lol) before 5 years old. But he was emotionally unstable because he only had me as an example of how to act. I tried to parent him, but it's hard when you didn't have a parent yourself. He became violent and would harm himself as a kid until I took parenting classes at 16 and was able to help him get better. (Now he's the sweetest kid, I swear. He's still super smart and wants to become a computer engineer!)\n\nAt 15 to 17, I found a good stable job that paid well (I babysat and did odd jobs since I was 10 because I needed money for clothes) but now I worked part time, went to school, took a college class (school paid for) each term, parented my siblings to the best of my ability, managed the house but my siblings did their share now, still cooked all the meals, took my siblings to all their events, bought all their clothes and food,  caring for my mentally unstable grandmother(long story) and also my parents who decdecid I was old enough to become a mediator for their fights. Still get physically and mentally abused by my mother too\n\nI had panic attacks every week, sometimes up to 3 times a week. I would have nosebleeds. I would never cry or process my emotions and it caught up to me now.\n\n\n\nAt 17, I met *him*. My now ex husband. He was alwasy an asshole but I saw him as some sort of savior back then... This 21 year old man. Not going to even go into that. My sister didn't and still doesn't like him. He asked me to marry him when I was still 17 and I was too scared to say no. We got married when I was 18, a year of being together.\n\nIt was stupid. \n\nHe got me pregnant just as I started college. I found out only now he poked a fucjing hole in a condom. \n\nAfter having our child, his behavior got worse and it got to the point he started threatening to beat me and stuff. So that was my life from 18 to 21.\n\nIt took me that long to get the courage to leave.\n\nSo here I am, about to turn 22 soon, hiding in my new apartment with my daughter and my brother. My brother, now 14, acts like he's protecting me and I don't even have the heart to tell him that he's staying with me because he has nowhere to go either. My parents don't take care of him. I count him as my own anyway.\n\nLike sucks. But I've got my 2 kids with me.\n\nIf you've read this far omg you're crazy, I wrote so much \ud83d\ude2d thank you",

I feel a bit better now, but I do not trust anyone. \n\nCurrently feel ashamed of being together in big gathering with cousins/ aunts uncles from both sides of family so I avoid them or stay in my room while they visit. Parents seem to not feel any regrets. Fighting/ then happy that is their lifestyle it is embarrassing- family members aunts/uncles are going through the same thing so I feel bad for my cousins honestly but unable to help them due to the trauma/ burden I have. \n\n\nThe only thing stopping me from taking the test is the burden of being rejected or causing family fights, and I am honestly tired of it.

He only dated people much younger than him, people that were vulnerable or have a disability. People that were abused like me. We constantly talked about deep shit and our past experiences. I shared everything with him but clearly he didn\u2019t with me. \n\nHe made me isolate from everyone in my life. When he got taken away so suddenly it hurt my heart. It\u2019s been a few weeks but I\u2019m still shocked, disgusted, hurt, and feeling used by him for many reasons. I don\u2019t think I will ever trust anyone ever again. You never know who someone truly is. ",

Every night we\u2019ve planned these last few nights always ends up getting screwed up. \n\nWe are raising a toddler that\u2019s about to turn 4. Shes been doing everything she can to push our nights as long as possible, and any attempts at shutting it down at the source is resulted in screaming fits. We both work full time and shes taking a few college courses a week, two of which she has to drive to a neighboring city an hour away in the afternoon. \n\nWe\u2019ve both been initiating and making the efforts to make the plans to hop into bed. These last few nights have gone terribly. She\u2019s been tired, and I\u2019m trying to support her with everything she\u2019s balancing, thats not the issue, I\u2019m happy to help her in any way I can. I\u2019m having a hard time staying okay with the hormones. Whenever we speak of a plan for sexy time later, in my brain it\u2019s game on. I do believe it\u2019s the same for her. Then before you know it, it\u2019s 10:30pm-11:30pm, she has to be up at 6, and it just hasn\u2019t been happening. Jerking off helps little to none. \n\nI sleep less and have less energy (weight cut, lifting, manual labor job) yet I still am fully charged for sex morning, noon, or night. \n\nI just want to fuck her brains out, not be sitting here teeming with excitement I can\u2019t get rid of when she\u2019s sleeping next to me. \n\nThere are definitely bigger priorities that come first, I get that. We have those handled, even if we\u2019re stretched thin. Fuck, someone take this kid for an hour mid afternoon so I can get some, please. But if I do that, then shes going to feel guilty and bad because she\u2019s missing out on time with our daughter, which is also fair. ",

The world just stops spinning in those few seconds. I start to tear up and breathe rapidly. My tinnitus gets louder and I can\u2019t hear my real life surroundings anymore. I practically undergo 80% of a panic attack. Then my vision is flooded with graphic visuals of myself lying against the wall with a hole through my forehead and letters to my family by my side. Sometimes it\u2019s a shotgun and my entire face will be gone instead. My brain sometimes plays a sequence of me sh**ting myself with the gun. I also see my mom panicking when she found my body. If she\u2019s not there, I see my body laying there, waiting until the morning when my mom checks on me. There really is no way to make this thought end, I just have to go with the flow and eventually it stops which is when I go through my routine reassurances that everything is fine, because everything actually is fine. My life is good. \n\nI started having these thoughts like 2 months ago after I googled ways to commit suicide out of curiosity. These thoughts happen about every other day. \n\nThese thoughts are so vivid to the point it feels like a hallucination. I\u2019ve never been diagnosed with schizophrenia and I can\u2019t root these thoughts into anything trauma related. I just remember looking up ways to commit suicide out of curiosity. \n\n",

Sometimes I just want to go and punch a tree to let it all out because it hurts feeling like this. \n\nI feel bad for inanimate objects. If a bottle or can is dented I'll pick that one. I rotate which stuffed animal I sleep with so no one feels left out. Hell I'm cleaning up a plush bag clip of Bingo because she must have felt so alone buried in the dirty snow. \n\nI don't know why am like this, I have always been like this. Always crying when characters die. I refuse to watch/read shows/books/movies because I know what happens and will cry again. \n\nIs there anything I can do to feel like this? The only diagnoses I have are anxiety/depression and have had that diagnoses since I was 13 or 14. I'm just tired of feeling more feels than I want to. ",
