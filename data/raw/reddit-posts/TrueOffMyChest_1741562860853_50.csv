"t3_1j555we","I’m living with Capgras delusion","I used to be a single mom, full-time student and I had a difficult (yet fulfilling) job. I took a research opportunity, and that is where my life fell apart. When I got back home from the research experience (July 2022), I no longer believed my son was my own…I pushed through it, but eventually his father raped me and I couldn’t hold it together anymore. I left everything behind and moved to Hawaii with 2 suitcases and no real sense of reality or self.

Needless to say, I did it…I was able to craft a normal-ish life. I’m renting a room, I have a good job where I’ve proven my work-ethic, a few solid friends, and pets to keep me company. That being said…the delusion of my son not being mine never actually went away.

I tried and failed to reestablish contact a few times over the last few years, but that part of my brain has never come to terms with it. I don’t exactly know where I went wrong, and now I’m living my own life…but it just feels like an unfinished story.

I don’t know why or how the delusion came to afflict me…but it fucking sucks. I cannot talk about it with other people, and have instead just deflected any questions about my son in a light that makes it seem like my choice, even though nothing is further from the truth.

I’ve tried professional help, but after being told to get better at eating shit by my last therapist…I guess I’ve just resigned myself to living a life of altered reality, where nothing makes any sense but hey at least I’m not homeless.","1","7"
"t3_1j5cwfj","My mom just admitted that she raped me when I was asleep when for months I thought it was just a dream.","I actually vomited because of this.

She got drunk today and we were discussing my transition (I'm FtM) and she commented in detail about how my crotch looks and how much she likes it.

She hasn't seen me be willingly naked in front of her since I was a toddler, let alone since I started my meds.

I asked how did she know about it and she admitted she ""took a peak"" when I was asleep.

Several months ago I had a vivid dream where she was on top of me, touching me and herself. All this time I thought it was just some fucked up dream.

I can't believe she violated me like this, but I can't say I'm surprised.

It's not the first time she's done such things to me.","0","2"
"t3_1j551or","I’m obsessed with my cats","so, I have three cats and they are my life. I almost want to spend all my time with them. if I am outside I am already missing them. they really became my identity. I can’t control my obsessive behaviour towards them and I am talking to them, hugging them, petting them, making the best and most healthy dishes for them. I can’t help that I just love them so much I can cry about it. my boyfriend says that I am all about my cats. like people say as a joke crazy cat lady but I am afraid I am really one. actually I love that I am like this but I also have the feeling people found me weird and boring and doesn’t follow me with this. maybe I need help or advice?","1","0"
"t3_1j54s03","My best friend tried to off herself yesterday night, and I still haven't cried","Basically, the title, here's some context.

I (F19) and my best friend D(F19), have been close friends since elementary school. The summer before COVID me and my parents moved to South Florida for the start of high school, and still we talked everyday. We would talk on Facetime for hours, fall asleep on the phone, play multiplayer games, and watch movies through shared play together. We got through college app season together, first jobs, and she was the first person I came out to. I've never had a sibling, but I'll always call her my sister. Even though we've practically been 1000+ miles apart for almost 6 years, she's always my #1 call. I tell her I love her everytime we hang up.

D is in college in New Jersey for nursing, and just recently started sessions with a psychiatrist. She is actively on medication for depression and sleep.  She's always been a very introverted person, but recently she has been telling me that she's been going to different club meetups and parties. I was excited for her because this was a chance for her to make some friends and get out more. We downloaded Life360 together and I told her to keep her phone charged, text me when she got back, and have fun.

I'm not dumb, I know kids are drinking alcohol and smoking at college events. Personally, I've made a life choice to stay away from that crap, but I don't hold judgment to my friends and others partaking. However, D has skipped the little white claws and high noons and started drinking straight vodka and tequila whenever she goes out. At first, when she told me, I just assumed she was taking a little shot here and there and calling it a day. However, some of her friends who know me and our relationship have let me know via Insta that she's drinking to the point of blacking out and keeps multiple bottles of alcohol in her dorm room. I've called D and told her that she's turning into an alcoholic, that she should stop going out as much, and that drinking leads to more destructive behaviors. She brushed me off and called me judgemental and stuck up. She's even blown off our gaming nights to go smoke with her friends.

Last night she texted and told me she had to call me about something serious. She told me that she was drinking alone last night to the point of wanting to kill herself.  Her roommates had found her called the police and she was brought to a psych ward. She told me that the police and her dad found out about the alcohol and that she ended up coming out to her dad unintentionally. She’s also been lying to her psychiatrist and has been skipping her meds. She said she's been admitted and was calling to let me know so I wouldn't worry. I just told her that I love her like always, and that I'm glad she's still here.

But after getting off that phone call, all I could think was “I fucking told you so. I told you the dangers of drinking and you ignored me.” I’ll I feel is anger. I feel angry that she would think that way about herself and want to leave me and her parents and her little sister. I’m angry at her on campus “friends” who observed this behavior and didn’t stop it. They let her get this bad and I wasn’t there to help her. It kills me that I’m halfway across the country and can’t afford to see her and make sure she’s okay. And most of all, I’m upset that if she ended up killing herself, I wouldn’t be able to do anything about it. I’m just her former middle school friend on FaceTime a million miles away.

I haven’t cried or felt sad and I’m not sure if this is normal.","1","1"
"t3_1j54p4q","I hate one guy at work","TW: Violence and threats

I work at a care home for people with various physical and mental disabilities. The one thing I absolutely hate is how passive management is with the participants. They let them make any decision they want even if it ends up with someone falling down the stairs with little to no consequences.

The one guy they are horrible with and let him get away with anything. He is extremely violent and has hurt me and others on numerous occasions. The only consequence he faces is when he breaks things he just doesn't get to use it till it's fixed or replaced. Which is nothing, the worst part is this guy is smart and knows he can do whatever he wants and get away with it.

The worst time I experienced this was when me and another staff took him out to buy him candy with his own money. He wanted to buy a knife (it was a butter knife) and we said 'no'. It took alot just to get him away from the knifes and out the door. We managed to get him some of his candy and as protocol we gave him some. Still mad with us daring to say 'no' he threw the candy at me and tried to run back to the store to ""get the knife so I can stab you f*ckers"". I had to do a hold to stop him from going too far and hurting someone else. However the hold we are trained to do doesn't restrain both hands so they decided to scratch at my arm hard, to the point I was bleeding. It took a long time to calm him down and get him back in the car. The part that broke me was the fact he wanted me the one shaking and crying to apologize and my coworker who did nothing but call management to let them know what was going on also tried to get me to apologize. I couldn't cause I went completely non-verbal and just got in the car. I missed a week of work cause I was terrified of that participant and was locked up in my room. I filed a report for injuries, but nothing came of it.

Now I just hate the participant. I'll never do anything to hurt or try and upset him, but I will always hate him and wish for his downfall.

One thing I want to note is that I understand alot of the people I work with can't control how they act. This one in particular also struggles to control their anger. However I've seen them handle 'no' from their parents and staff he likes and he was completely fine. He just doesn't like me and gets upset any time I ask him to do something or deter him away from dangerous things (I'm not rude about it I always ask very nicely I'm just not a guy or pretty enough so he hates me).

TLDR: I despise a guy cause he can get away with anything he wants, including hurting others and he knows it.","0","2"
"t3_1j54l4k","I feel like I've died my second death before my first","I read a quote a long time ago that went something like this: ""A person dies their first death when their body dies, their second death the last time they are remembered by someone who knew them, and their third death the last time their name is spoken."" It popped into my head yesterday and has been weighing on me like a mountain. I just need to fire this off into the void.

I've struggled all of my life with only feeling loved if I was valuable or useful. Affection, attention, and admiration have always been transactional with family and friends. I learned quickly that if I wasn't useful I found myself the target of malice, anger, open disdain, or annoyance at best. I feel like I have always been expected to help others by any means necessary and frequently at a detriment to myself. When I don't, or am not able to do so, I feel like I become invisible until I'm needed again.

I live in rural Texas and was raised a sheltered conservative christian homeschooler. I grew into my own person with so many questions and curiosities that were incompatible with conservative christianity and falling into line as my parents wanted. I learned their love was conditional as long as I obeyed and didn't question anything. They kicked me out at 16 for refusing to see a conversion therapy counselor, after I was outed as being gay by my sister.

I had made two friends around that time who I stayed with and became very close to. I've seen them become married and buy houses and have kids. We spent so much time together and I have been eternally grateful for their friendship. I have read stories and know people tend to drift apart when they begin having families. I've been fully prepared for when it happens to me.

For the past year, after many years of failures and bad experiences trying to date and constantly being ghosted (even in two different few-months-long relationships), I met someone I really truly connected with and was able to fall in love with. He is an incredible man and I still love him dearly. Hard times fell on us and he lost his job, and his car. I have tried my best to keep us both afloat. He has been so ashamed of his situation that he insisted on taking a break in our relationship and moved back in with his mom. I begged and begged him not to leave me or give up on me, but he did anyway.

----------

-- This leads to today. My birthday was yesterday and I turned 26. I haven't heard from my separated partner for a month and haven't seen him in almost two months. I can only assume he broke his phone but I fear I've been ghosted again, but this time by someone I thought I was going to spend forever with. He either couldn't or didn't try to get a hold of me to say anything for my birthday. He knows where I live, and work, and my schedule. It was our one year anniversary on Monday, but I guess I shouldn't be counting that since we are apart.

None of my friends said anything. No one called or texted, bothered to say hi, or check in. No one has asked me about my separated partner in over a month and they all knew him the whole year we were together. No one has asked if I'm okay.

No one at work remembered or said anything. I have my birthday circled and marked on my calendar at my desk.

I got a late text from my mother but it was just a gif saying happy birthday. She didn't call me for the first time, didn't even write out a message like she has done in years past. None of my siblings or any other family said anything.

I truly feel forgotten. No one can be bothered to think of me or remember me until they need furniture moved, a truck to tow something for them, or something fixed. I feel like I have felt my second death before my first, in a way. Not that I'm permanently forgotten but that on a day that is personal and matters to me, I'm completely invisible to the ones I thought cared about me. I've been forgotten until I'm needed, like a dusty power tool in the shed out back.

Someday when I'm gone, will I be missed? Or will my absence just be inconvenient?

I just want to feel wanted.","0","0"
"t3_1j4t1hf","I am probably the 100th survivor of a serial predator.","Throwaway account for obvious reasons, his initial is changed for safety, and I’ll try not to include too many specific details, but this is a long one. Here goes:

I started dating D after meeting at a bar, and things were amazing at first, as they usually are with narcissistic abusers. After a short period, his mask started to slip. He would sext me about his far out fantasies, some weird but benign, others dark and twisted. Sometimes I said no, but often I played along because some of the things he was suggesting I was fine experimenting with or could see myself potentially liking. And he was crazy hot, and the most charming person I’d ever met. And I knew he had been a player, but I didn’t mind. So had I, so it felt like a good match. I was falling in love with him and he (so he said) with me. We became official, and things immediately took a turn for the worse.

The first night he beat me up and raped me, I was on psychedelics that he encouraged me to take, and he convinced me afterwards that I had consented to the whole thing. That it was BDSM. That anything I didn’t like was fine but wasn’t his fault. (Mind you, BDSM requires specific, lucid, ongoing, and enthusiastic consent, and a safeword, which we did not have.) I think my brain chemistry was permanently changed that night because I sobbed in his arms and allowed myself to believe him. The gaslighting, heavy swings between silent treatment and intense attention, casual cruelty in our conversations, and lovebombing increased from there.

Later on, D coerced me into group sex within which I was sexually assaulted by a stranger multiple times at his direction, before he assaulted me, damaged property, and ran before the police were called. He convinced me again that he thought I had consented to everything. He masterfully gaslit and lied and manipulated me and my memories felt untrustworthy. He convinced me I was going to ruin his life if I pressed charges. Under the trauma bond that had formed that I mistook for love, he convinced me to rescind my statement to the police. And we “made up”.

The last time I saw him was the worst night of my life and the last time he raped me. I had been drinking all night at his direction, and once we started, he did not stop. Not when I was choking and struggling under him, not when I was crying and begging him to stop, not when I went limp, not when I had lost a pint of blood, not when I passed out. I am lucky to be alive.

But in the morning, the trauma had taken most of my memories. I pretended I was okay, but he knew what he had done. When I realized I had to seek medical attention the next day, he told me I was overreacting and ignored my pleas for aftercare. I begged him for compassion and promised he’d done nothing wrong, but he refused. As the days passed, my memories started to return. As they did, I started to try to hold him accountable. But as I’m sure many of you know, narcissism does not allow for accountability. Every attempt of mine to break up with him was foiled, until he finally decided to “break up” with me.

My horrific memories continued to return to me, and so I went to the police. Anyone want to guess how that went?

When they closed my case citing insufficient evidence, I was devastated. But I felt more than anything that I needed to warn the next woman. I posted my experience anonymously, and a woman came forward that he had drugged and SA’d years prior. More second-hand stories started coming out of the woodwork. So I posted him again. My case was closed, but my experience was real, and I realized people needed to know he was going to do it again and had probably done it before.

Yeah, not probably. Definitely. Dozens of women in a weekend in my extended circle of mutuals, and more outside of that, started sharing their experiences of abuse at D’s hand. Everything vile under the sun—sexual harassment, druggings, assault, blackmail, theft, manipulation, coercion, violence, and rape. Over MANY years.

D is a true serial rapist, abuser, and predator. His disarming charm and looks and fake feminism and subsequent manipulation and gaslighting had not just worked on me, but friends and roommates and coworkers and romantic partners. It has been overwhelming, and heartbreaking, and sickening. But when I went to the cops, I thought I was alone. When I shared my experience, I thought I was alone. And now I know I’m the farthest thing from alone. And you bet litigation and a reopened case are incoming.

But I’m writing this post because I learned tonight about some of the things he did to another ex-girlfriend. Worse than he did to me, worse than you can imagine. For a lot longer. My body has been shaking non stop and I am livid after seeing photo evidence and hearing her story. Every time I think this whole situation can’t get worse, it does.

I am so beyond angry at him. I am so disgusted with myself that I allowed him into my bed and into my life—that I stayed after he showed me his true colors. My belief system is so deeply rocked to my core, that a human being can be this consistently evil and on top of that, not get caught for a decade. I am terrified that he is going to come after me for exposing him to the larger community. And I am furious at all of the people around him who had to have enabled his horrific behavior. His family members who know of his history of abusing women, his male friends who listened to female friends try to share their experiences and brushed them off or gaslit them. His roommates who participated in or witnessed his crimes and kept quiet. The fucking POLICE who have done nothing to keep my city safe from this man or take my reports seriously or compassionately, despite him having multiple prior arrests and restraining orders against him. And most of all heartbroken at all the women before me who felt so alone and like they couldn’t come forward. And I feel guilty that I’m just a little bit angry at all of them too, because I wish just one of them had felt like I did, that I had to stop this from happening to the next girl. Because I was the next girl. And I’m forever changed.

I don’t know where to go from here other than to a courtroom, but so much work lies ahead of me. Of us. I’m in therapy and taking each day as it comes. Several of the other survivors who’ve had years to heal are standing behind me and helping holding the pieces together, but it’s hard. And after what I heard today, I feel broken.

But I’m also spiritually wound tighter than I ever have been. Maybe the universe somehow connected us to give him one last chance to learn empathy and be a good person and partner, and give me one last chance to step away from men who disrespect my boundaries the first time. And we both failed. But the result of those failures is broken cycles—I will never let a man disrespect me again for the rest of my life, and D will not be able to continue his pattern of abuse. Perhaps our paths crossed for me to be my own savior whilst being his undoing. All I know for sure is that I am not fucking alone anymore. None of us are alone anymore. And I’m hopeful that our power in numbers will deliver him the consequences he deserves.

Thank you for reading. Please, MEN, and women, and everyone in between, believe. women. when they come forward. Believe them the first time. This incredibly fucked up situation should never ever happen again. And to survivors everywhere: you are not alone.","5","0"

"t3_1j537hs","Am I a Murderer or just Mentally ill?","I often have this nightmare where my mind convinces me that the dream I’m having is a memory and in it, I’ve killed someone.

I vividly remember stalking them getting them out to a secluded area and brutalizing them. I wake up, genuinely believing that this is something I have done and then blocked out of my mind I find myself searching for evidence in my waking life of this person that I have allegedly killed and I can’t really tell if it’s just a sign of my terrible mental health or something that other people also experience.

I’ve had the dream on an almost weekly basis for the last five years in my dream it’s always the same person that I have killed and it’s always the exact same way it is downright terrifying to me because although every piece of tangible evidence  proves that I did not have the time or the ability to pull off something this heinous there is a little voice in the back of my mind that wonders what if?

It’s gotten so bad I’ve started looking through missing persons posters trying to see if I can match the person in my dreams to a person in real life and  I’m terrified that one day I will find a match .","1","5"
"t3_1j4uzav","I lied about my experience in a videogame.","I honestly debated sharing this for a while, but it's really bugging me. It seems dumb but I promise, it's a rough one, for me at least.

I started playing a game just for fun and to see what it was about, but I ran into a bit of a problem when first starting out. I understood the assignment really well for the first time playing but hated how belittled I was for my inexperience despite how quickly I caught on. So I fabricated a simple lie saying I used to play years ago but lost my account. This wasn't really a problem for a while, didn't expect to make any long-term friends while playing so I just stuck with the lie, so much so that I partially believed it.

I then made a handful of amazing friends that I care deeply for and they care deeply for me. We've been a little group for about I'd say a year now. I feel so unbelievably bad lying to all of them like this even though it's the only thing I've lied about around them (I don't have the guts to lie to them so this really is the only thing). I feel like a terrible friend by lying about a game that we all built our friendship on but I'm too scared to back out of this considering how far in I am.

I feel like actually saying what I did will do me good rather than continuing to just shove the truth to the back of my brain and is why I came here of all places.","3","8"
"t3_1j3tjoq","Found a girl OD'ing and saved her life. Found out more about the girl and what happened to her later.","This is a bit long, but it's also how it happened.

Sunday afternoon my wife, daughter, daughters-friend, the dog and myself went to the river to play and collect some pretty rocks since it was so nice outside. We live within walking distance and on the way back, we were about to leave the levee along our normally used path when both my wife and I spotted something on the levee about 50 feet away, we couldnt tell what it was. I asked my wife to take the dogs leash so I could go check, and to please take the girl a little way further away while I go make sure it's just garbage.

As I got closer and saw it was a person, I quickly told my wife and asked her to call 911. I went over to the person and found out it was a young looking girl, and she was still breathing. I ran back to my wife who was on the phone with emergency services and relayed the info that it was a young female, still breathing, not conscious. I then ran back to the girl and tried loudly talking/shouting at her to see if I could get some reaction, but I was very hesitant to touch her since I could see she was actively breathing. Her phone, which had been in her open hand the entire time, began to make ringing noises and I tried to answer it but it was some kind of Instagram thing and not an actual call, I dunno. I set her phone back into her hand and about 30 seconds later a police officer showed up. I waved at the officer to get his attention to the exact location. He quickly ran up to me and gave her a very brief checkout before administering a dose of narcan. He waited a few seconds and began to shake her and shouting a bit to get her awake, which resulted in a moan and partial roll from her. He kept trying to get her awake for maybe another 30 seconds and the ambulance showed up, they almost drove by but saw me waving at them and managed to just barely make the turn. 3 EMT's hurried up to us and checked her vitals and pupils and in the next 90 seconds they had her standing and eyes open. I figured the was nothing else they needed me for, I thanked them and quickly got out of the way. A side note, I'm very impressed with the reaction time of both the police and the ambulance, they were both on site with within 5 minutes of my wife calling them.

The next day at work, I mentioned this to a coworker whose father I know owns the trailer part right next to where I found the girl. My coworker found out more about what happened, and I hate it. Apparently the girl had gotten some weed from her cousin which had been laced/contaminated with fentanyl. It also sounds like her cousin was with her, and left her laying there when she collapsed. Also found out she had to be administered 2 more doses of narcan while in the ambulance and that she was only 13 years old. Also learned I sort of know her. I actually know her parents as I worked with them both about 10 years ago, I remember seeing her as a small 2-3 year old kid, haven't seen her since though so I obviously didn't recognize her.

I'm glad it was my family who found her and she will be ok, someone could have easily drug her away down into the trees and she would have never been seen or heard again. I'm terrified for my daughter, who is about half this girls age. I can't believe how close I ended up being to her family.

I dunno how to end this, but I needed to share the story. Teach your kids how to be smart and responsible, you won't always be there to tell them yourself.

And always wash your hands after touching random objects. I vigorously washed my hands when I got home since I touched her phone which could have been contaminated with fentanyl for all I knew.","1515","45"

"t3_1j52tul","I think I was raped and still have problems to process it","Writing from a throwaway.

Three days ago, I met a guy. He found me on social media, and we talked on the phone for a few days. He seemed easygoing and respectful, so when he asked if I wanted to meet for a cigarette, not at my place, just somewhere outside in the neighborhood.

When he arrived, we sat outside and talked for a bit. Then he suggested going to a nearby hotel. Only if I wanted to, of course, but it was cold and dark, and he said we could just sit inside, have a drink, and talk. He promised he wouldn’t try anything, that he didn’t want to be intimate either. He seemed harmless, trustworthy even. So I agreed, telling him I only had two hours anyway.

At first, he was still friendly. But as time passed, he started acting off. I kept my distance, positioning myself in a way that made it clear I wasn’t comfortable with any physical closeness. Then he went to the bathroom. When he came back, he was only in his boxers.

I told him to put his clothes back on and that I was leaving. That was the moment I felt truly unsafe. I got up, heading for the door when he grabbed me by my ponytail and pulled me to the floor.

I fought as hard as I could, but he knew exactly how to overpower me. At first, he didn’t rape me he enjoyed me fighting back. He hit me, yanked my hair, and choked me so hard I couldn’t even make a sound. He threw me all over the room. My body is covered in bruises, even on my throat. And then, at some point, he raped me. I pleaded for him to stop, but he just threatened me over and over again.

Eventually, my phone rang. I saw my chance and told him I had to answer it, that my friend would be suspicious if I didn’t call her back immediately, and that she had my location (she didn’t and it wasn’t a friend calling I was lying). I told him I’d just meet her quickly and then come back. He let me go and I left.

If this had happened to someone else, I would never blame them. But standing in my own shoes, I can’t stop thinking: What the fuck is wrong with me? Who goes to a hotel with a guy they just met? I’m almost 30. I should know better. I should have learned my lesson by now.

But I don’t feel scared. I don’t feel sad. I don’t even feel vulnerable. And that makes it hard to process what actually happened to me.","0","1"

I have to add, the last couple of months have been hard on me, my boss had a big problem with my appearance( for understanding I worked at a high class gym in my city) because I am very muscular and outshine him in a lot of ways, I also have a buzzcut but that shouldn‘t matter. because of my boss bullying and nagging me the last 7 months( yes it started in august), I quit, today I handed in my letter of resignation, I couldn‘t do it anymore, working 50-60 hours a week for an ungrateful boss that hates me and wants to fire me anyways isn‘t my thing I don‘t take disrespect. I‘ve been into working out for a couple of years and got my personal trainer license in winter of 2023, my mom was so proud. Yet she didn‘t work, my first paycheck went entirely into her purse, I didn‘t mind because I like responsibility and do plan to have kids in the next few years, so I have to be able to provide for people, yet she blew all my money on cigarettes cheap alcohol and gas to drive my sister and me to school, oh and the rent and electricity bill of course, there are no gas bills because we heat with wood. I was and am fine with that nothing wrong there, but after almost a year of unemployment for her she started becoming unbearable, she started yelling at me daydrinking, at one point she tried to punch and fight me physically. I begged one of her friends to find her a job at their workplace so she could finally get some fresh air, she had a boyfriend whom I got along with very well, very intelligent man, but her stubborn attitude and her narcissistic behavior obviously drove him away, I couldn‘t even blame him, in the time of my mothers unemployment I raised my half-sister (13/ F) drove her to practice on my bike,until I crashed it beyond repair, I made arrangements for her to be driven and picked up from everywhere. my mom started working, it is nice to see her happy and thriving, but she always had a bad temper and a lot of self hatred. I love my mother, I have always loved her for every sacrifice she made for me. but I stopped feeling anything towards her today.

after a heated argument, me staying mostly calm because I‘m the type to shut down and become quiet once I‘m yelled at, and my mother yelling at me. She said, that I don‘t have money, I don‘t have assets, I don‘t even work anymore, and that all this bullshit that has been piling up was too much for her to handle. I asked her if she wants me to move out and she said I should fuck myself and go to hell or wherever else I wanna go, I‘m in tears. I‘ve been living in this house for 7 years, a comfortable life that I tried to sustain for as long as possible. I have a job offer in chicago, but I don‘t have the funds to go there, I don‘t have enough money to buy a one way ticket for me and my fiancée (18/F) and one month of rent+ a downpayment on an apartment. I could move there but it‘s 10000km away. I have had reasons to move out before but decided to stick around so my sister has a male influence growing up, now she‘s a teenager and I‘ll never stop being there for her. I have packed my bag, I have prepared to get away from my home which I‘ve lived in for so long. I‘m applying for jobs tomorrow, going to a jobcenter, getting all my documents, renewing my CV and just applying at every gym I know. I‘m crashing at my fiancées place tomorrow night and see how long it takes for me to find something to start over with in a proper manner. I‘m in shambles, I know I could live in this house for another month, another half a year too, but I lost my will to do so long ago. I‘ve always wanted to compete in bodybuilding, but I am scared that all the dreams I have such as: Building a beautiful healthy family, having a homestead, winning and receiving an IFBB pro card, retiring my future wife and building wealth for my family, I come from nothing but I need to do everything, I‘m hopeless scared and alone, I‘ll figure it out by myself though I‘m confident.

if there is anyone who has advice for me, anyone who has been in a similar situation, please reply.","1","5"

"t3_1j5297d","Trueoffmychest My sister is getting adopted by my step dad today and I’m not happy about it.","!no names are real names! For some context let me start by explains my family tree and giving some history. I 20 female am the oldest child. My parent we’ll call them Bob and Lynda (not real names) had three kids me and a set of boy/girl twins ( East and brook). Then my mom cheated and got with a guy (Tony) and had two half brothers (Timmy and tommy). She then cheated again with a new guy (Bret) who was also cheating on his wife. He had two kids with his ex wife (Kat and Sam) my now step sisters. And my mom Lynda and Bret had two more kids (spike and Leo). Meanwhile my dad and step mom (Molly) had one daughter (Katie). So there’s 9 kids  total with my mom, in order it’s: me, East and brook, Kat, Timmy, Tommy, Sam, Spike Leo. My parents had 50/50 custody of us given to them by the court. My dad tried reporting my mom for abuse and the court did nothing about it. It’s very pro mommy where we live. My mom Lynda and Bret are very abusive parents. They used to to things like hit us, throw us outside, make us stand on chairs for hours on end without being able to get down, put shock collars on us and starve us. I remember once that I missed a spot mopping the floor and they made me use my toothbrush to clean it ( no I didn’t get a new one). We were also very low income but my mom and Bret always found a way to take trips to Disney and have expensive date nights. Them being out often left me home alone with kids for hours if not days at a time. This went on from the time I was 11-16. At 16 I finally said enough was enough and made the decision to live with my dad. I got thearapy and have been doing much better. It’s been 4 years since I left. I have tried to fix things with my mom and Bret multiple times but my mom always falls short and blames me for leaving instead of herself for her actions. However when I left to stay with my dad my sister brook chose to stay with my mom without giving anyone an explanation. My dad wasn’t bad to her but they where never close. My sister brook is my moms golden Child, her favorite and her mini. My sister was a snake my whole childhood and could get away with murder. So she left my dad and never looked back. Well this year she turned 18 and on her birthday my mom had posted a video of her asking my step dad to adopt her and today was the day of her adoption. I found out through my moms ex baby daddy Tony that she was being adopted because Timmy messaged him about being taken out of school to witness it. He shared the messages with me and then I shared them to my step mom and other family. Not my dad because in these 4 years he has been grieving my sister leaving and finding this out will only hurt more.I’m devastated for my dad and have left it up to my step mom to tell him. I just cannot understand what there thoughts are and why my sister has done any of what she’s done in the last 4 years but I cannot say I’m happy for her. But I wanted to get this out and I just needed to vent it somewhere. I guess in the 4 years I’ve been gone I’ve really been holding in a lot of what happened to me and still cannot find it in myself to let go or forgive them. Thank you Reddit for listening.","1","5"
"t3_1j4ww33","My ex cheated on me multiple times, used me for money, and still won’t leave me alone","I don’t even know where to start, but I need to get this off my chest. My ex (26F) and I (26M) were together for a long time and have a 4-year-old son together. I was completely loyal to her, but she put me through hell.

Before we were evicted from our home last year, she was already actively cheating on me—first with a guy named Liam. She would stay at his place while I was home taking care of our two stepkids (5 and 8) and our son (4). I was struggling financially because she was out drinking all the time with her friends, spending money we didn’t have, while I stayed home looking after the kids.

Then, in December 2022, she started cheating on me with a different guy—Mark. She promised over and over that she’d stop, but she never did. We ended up getting evicted in April 2023, and she moved in with her brother. I was staying elsewhere, and she had our son and her two kids. During this time, she kept lying to me about where she was living. She said she was at her brother’s, but in reality, she had secretly moved in with Mark. I found out when I logged into her accounts—yeah, I know I shouldn’t have, but it was the only way to get the truth because she compulsively lies. (She was living at her brothers for a couple months then after the wedding she moved in with him)

She even took Mark to her sister’s wedding, bought him clothes for it, and kept telling me we were going to fix things. She made dozens of promises—saying she’d visit me with the kids, bake me cakes, buy me gifts—but she never showed.

Even after I found out everything in October, she still asked me for money in December, saying Mark wouldn’t help her. And I gave it to her, like an idiot. In total, I’ve given her around £3,000 because she made it seem like we’d work things out. I even paid for the carpets in her new house because she told me she’d cut Mark off once she moved. But now I know that was just another lie.

Throughout all of last summer, she was constantly gaslighting me. I caught her sending nudes to Mark while playing Stardew Valley with him late at night while I was asleep. She’d go out every night with him, and whenever I confronted her, she’d call me crazy and make me feel like I was the one in the wrong. At one point, she and Mark even tried to get me to be friends with him—we all played games together, and I had no idea what was actually going on behind my back.

Even now, when I ignore her, she acts upset and says ""there's still something there."" But all she ever does is use me. She sends me explicit pictures and videos while claiming she “just wants to be friends.” And when I tell her she’s confusing me, she shuts down the conversation because it's “too stressful” for her. Meanwhile, I’ve been the one supporting her, giving her money, and being there for her when she needed help.

I also hate her friend Emily because she covered for her constantly. she’s cousins with Mark and was helping her lie to me the whole time.

One of the worst moments was when I visited her brother’s place while she was staying there. I found used tissues under the bed, and she swore up and down they weren’t what I thought they were—but come on, it was obvious. It was disgusting. And yet she still called me crazy. (She actually made out they were snot cause she had a cold but there was like 50 tissues under the bed lmao)

Whenever I ask her what she wants, she just says, ""I don't know. I need to live alone and figure things out because I’m not well mentally or physically."" But if that were true, why is she still stringing me along, keeping me as a backup plan while she’s with him?

She tells me I’m “stalkative” and that I’m the bad guy, but I only ever found out the truth by logging into her stuff—because without doing that, I’d still be believing her lies. I know I should’ve just walked away, but I love her. I actually cared.

Maybe I’m just too nice, or maybe I’m an idiot. But a part of me always thought this was just a rough patch, that we could fix things and go back to how we were before all of this. Maybe she’s sick mentally, or maybe she’s just a terrible person. I don’t know.

The one thing I do know is I feel used, betrayed, and like I’ve wasted so much time and money on someone who never really cared about me the same way. And the worst part? She still wants me to keep all of this quiet.

At this point, I feel like I should just tell Mark everything and ruin things for her, because I don't think it's fair that after everything she got it all.

(This is actually typed by me)

Like I'm currently on my parents sofa, I barely see my son, I keep trying to find private or council places but I'm getting nowhere. My depression is genuinely awful like I feel like after everything I have nothing I've just lost it all and no matter how much I try it won't get better. I used to be depressed at uni, even tried to kill myself on my birthday but my flat mates actually got me a birthday cake and stuff and it put me off for a bit, like it was genuinely heartbreaking.

Thing is my credit score is completely fucked as well cause I let her use my credit card and my very account and stuff and my credit score is tanked to hell because of it.

Like I am genuinely screwed and it's like trying to claw myself out of quicksand, struggling is just making me sink further into it.

I don't know what do you guys think? Is there a chance do I give an ultimatum or just do I give into everything

It's actually been great, the first few days were hard but now I don't even really care about checking Facebook. On a conscious level, I feel like not being on Facebook is great. But I also noticed on Tuesday that I was feeling really low and didn't know why. Same yesterday, and today is even worse. It occurred to me that my brain isn't getting its usual constant dopamine supply throughout the day from checking Facebook and seeing that I have notifications or new info to read (even if it turns out to be nothing interesting). I know that social media is engineered to give you a hit of dopamine with every notification to keep you engaged and coming back for more. And I'm starting to think my brain is literally addicted and I'm going through withdrawal. I'm actually really proud of myself and given how awful I feel right now, I feel even more resolve to break this addiction and not go back to how I was. But man, I feel like shit. I just feel so depressed and want to do nothing but sleep. I keep wanting snacks even though I'm not hungry, and I think that's my brain desperately seeking other sources of dopamine. This sucks.

"t3_1j4vn9k","I can't feel anything and it's weird","I'm 27M and life is so weird to me. I see people seemingly caring and loving each other but I struggle to feel that at all for anyone. I know my parents and family love me and I had a great environment growing up. But I'm just... detached. Like, I gained the ability to cry on command to feign sadness when something bad happens, but in reality, I don't feel anything at all. When my mother died, I know I was supposed to feel sad. I know I was supposed to love her as she did me, very much... but I failed at both. I really tried.

I've had relationships in the past where my partners would tell me they love me, but I couldn't feel the same way. They treated me amazing and I try my best to be a good partner, but I could never get attached to someone or care for someone in that way.

I know it sounds cruel, but I just can't seem to love anyone nor care for anyone no matter how hard I try.

I find it hard to feel what others feel. For example, when my friend's dad died, I knew I needed to feel sad, but I just didn't. I didn't understand what he was feeling so I just tried my best to be there for him and take care of him. Even though I couldn't relate to him at all. It's just, I know this is the action that should be done, but I have no emotions attached to it.

When I got a perfect GPA in college, and my cousin who was in the same college as me, in the same course did worse, I knew she didn't feel good, but I cant describe what that would feel like, if that makes sense. I mean, I've been bad or failed at things before and I just felt indifferent. So when my family was praising me and comforting my cousin, I was so confused because I had to feign being happy and sad at the same time.

It's so frustrating because I want to feel for people, but I can't look at people as anything else other than just... people. I can't relate to their struggles even though I try. I know I'm supposed to but I can't. I've been acting this whole time but I have no idea what's wrong.

I know how I'm supposed to feel but I can't feel it. Everything is just monotone for me and things that happen just happen. I know what emotions are and it's so hard for me to feel them or relate to anyone else's. Idk I just wanted to put it out there and maybe find out what's wrong with me...","2","3"
"t3_1j4bc76","My ex-husband broke me…","This is going to be a long one—sorry in advance.

I (29F) got divorced three years ago from my manipulative ex-husband after being with him for 6.5 years. We had no kids because he didn’t want any responsibility. I’ve moved on from him in the sense that I don’t want him back, but I feel like the emotional and psychological abuse I went through changed me in ways I can’t undo.

Whenever a potential new partner comes into my life, I can’t seem to accept them. The moment I see something I don’t agree with, even if it’s small, I start emotionally distancing myself to avoid getting hurt. I don’t even know what a healthy relationship looks like.

On top of that, I live in a Middle Eastern country where everyone constantly pressures me to get married before I become “too old.” It just makes me feel worse—like the manipulation and mistreatment I faced really broke something in me, and I don’t know how to fix it.

What my ex did to me

To summarize: he cheated on me multiple times, and I only found out about all of them at once. He never got me gifts—only things he wanted me to have so he could show off his status. He never initiated intimacy; it was always up to me. He didn’t want kids, but the moment he felt like I was pulling away, he suddenly wanted them—basically trying to baby trap me even though it was obvious our relationship was already over.

When I needed help—like when my car wouldn’t start or the faucets were bursting—he never answered my calls. I had to handle everything myself. He claimed he had OCD about cleanliness but would leave trash and dirty clothes everywhere, expecting me to clean up after him just because I was a stay-at-home wife at the time.

Financially, he cut me off (except for food and clothes) when I got a part-time job and started making more than him for like three months. In my culture, the husband is supposed to provide for his wife, but as soon as I had my own income (which was around 4k a year, yes a year), he refused to spend a single cent on me unless it was food or clothes (had to pay my own cell-service, gas, etc… which he previously paid for).

When we traveled, it was never about me—it was just because he wanted to see the world, and his friends couldn’t afford to go with him. When I put effort into our relationship—planning picnics, buying games so we could play together, setting up dates, booking hotels—he ignored it all, (yes I slept in a hotel by myself which is a huge NO-NO in my culture because he wanted to hang out with his boys instead). I tried everything to make it work, and the only complaint he had about me was that I “didn’t clean enough.” He would literally swipe his finger over a light switch, show me the dust, and act like that was a real issue.

Our last conversation? He told me I was perfect, that he was sorry he cheated, and that was it. Only when he realized that I was really leaving him, that he started crying in the corner of the apartment we had like a 3-year-old toddler. 2 days later he was like I did everything for you and it’s all your fault I cheated… :)

Where I’m at now

The cheating destroyed me. I never even checked his phone because I respected his privacy, and in return, I got blindsided. I lost myself completely. People see me as this cheerful, bubbly person, but it’s just a facade so my parents don’t worry about me.

After the divorce, I moved back in with them (which is normal in my culture). My dad even built me a small studio flat upstairs, so I have my own space. But I stopped working, so I have no income. Even if I got a full-time job, the salaries here are terrible—around $15,500 USD a year, even though I have nine years of experience in marketing and content. Realistically, I should be making $20K–$30K, but that’s a whole other issue.

I just feel like I have nothing to live for. My biggest dream in life is to have a family and kids, but the dating scene is discouraging. I do have hobbies—I love reading, drawing, playing video games, watching anime/TV/movies, taking walks, and doing at-home pilates. So it’s not like I do nothing with my life, but inside, I feel completely empty.

My struggle with marriage

I’m very traditional—not because of my family, but because I truly believe a husband should take care of his wife. That doesn’t mean I expect to be spoiled and contribute nothing, but I don’t think it should be my responsibility to cook, clean, and do everything 24/7.

Most men here, though, want a wife to take care of them. I keep getting set up with men through my family, and it’s always the same story—they expect a woman to be a maid, not a partner. I feel like I’m running out of time to get married, and it’s making me anxious because I really want to build a family.

My thoughts are all over the place, and I don’t know what to do.

PS: This is the first time I’ve ever shared something this personal. I don’t even know if this makes sense. English isn’t my first language, so sorry if it’s messy.","59","24"
"t3_1j4cb0j","[FINAL UPDATE] I went on a date with my ex-husband last night.","Update from this post.

My (35M) ex-husband (36M) and I recently reconnected. I won't go over the details of why we split or our reconciliation since I'm sure the average redditor can click buttons and most likely read. He was the one taking me out, and promised that it would, in his words, ""knock my socks off"" to make up for his neglect of me. He sure as hell delivered.

A little backstory, we've been together since we were 15 and 16 respectively, and have never moved out of our hometown. This year would have been our 20th anniversary (of getting together, not marriage). We were dating secretly for about five years before our parents caught us one day during summer break. The fallout from finding out their son was gay actually made his parents split. His dad wanted to send him away to conversion therapy. He's seen his father maybe once per year on average, and every time he's incredibly cold towards me. Would never refer to me as his son-in-law, only my husband's ""pal."" I wonder why. Anyway, not what you're here to read. I'll get on with the lore.

He picked me up from the house and wouldn't tell me where we were going, but told me to dress warmly. He ended up taking me to the place where we met: a run down ice skating rink in our town. He used to do hockey, and I spent some time trying to learn figure skating until people started beating me up for it. Both sports would practice at the same time and I remember barely being able to keep my eyes off him. We went skating, I tried to pull off a few of the moves I remembered (he only had to catch me from falling on my ass once or twice, and I won't complain about an attractive man that I love hooking his arm around my waist), and we spent an hour or so there until our feet hurt. At one point I said that my face was getting cold, so he skated around in front of me and placed his gloved hands on my cheeks to warm me up. I just about burned a hole in the ice from how hard I was blushing, I swear to God.

He wasn't done then. We left and went to dinner, specifically the restaurant where we had our first date. It's a cheap hole-in-the-wall place, seeing as we were poor teenagers when we first met. We chatted and ate food that probably took 5 years off our lives, he was an incorrigible flirt, and even held my hand underneath the table like he did all those years ago. I know I said I never stopped loving him, and I stand by that, but I think I somehow fell in love with him a thousand times over again during that meal.

At the end of dinner, he asked if I had energy for one more simple thing, to which I agreed. He took me a while out of town to a dark sky zone park, specifically the one where he proposed to me ten years ago. He set out a blanket to sit on and another to cuddle under, and we went stargazing all bundled up together. You never know how much you miss the sound of someone's heartbeat until you haven't heard it for so long. We shared a bottle of sparkling grape juice in plastic champagne flutes and dumb, giggly kisses. It felt so similar yet so different. He told me in a moment of quiet that he loved me, and oh, God. It took everything I had not to cry. I barely hesitated before asking if he wanted to change venues. He seemed surprised, but eagerly accepted.

I ended up at his place, as some of you may have seen from my edit on my second post yesterday. I wanted to take it slower than this, but it was so hard to. I was so starved of affection and hadn't been intimate with anyone for just about six years. I'm gonna keep what happened at his between us, but all I'll say is that his medication was no issue and all of you should be jealous. I woke up in his bed this morning, reached over for him, and pulled him close just like I used to do. I haven't been this happy in a long time. We had a sleepy discussion and decided to get back together, but we're not using the term boyfriends. It just feels weird after all this time. So he's my partner, or my lover. He's mine.

My passion for her has grown so much in the time that I’ve met her and gotten to know more about her. We have gone on many friendly dates to restaurants and coffee shops and we have made that a routine thing. We share so many interest like our music, taste in films, food, and fashion sense. We have even gotten matching tattoos together. Whenever either of us has something happen to us we immediately share it to each other. She has only been in two relationships and in both relationships she was only used for sex and her body. I have been in a similar situation where someone will be with me just for sex. But I don’t care at all about her body, don’t get me wrong she has an incredible one but it’s not what I’m into. I’m into the way that she talks with me and the way that we share jokes. I know that If I was in a relationship and we never had any sex or I never even saw her naked I would still be incredibly in love with her because I’m in love with her soul and her being more than her physical body.

Any time I find any interest in someone they friendzone me or try to get me to introduce them to my friends.

It just really sucks because with everything currently going on (I’m in the US) I’m so scared and all I want is someone who loves me for me so I know everything will be okay. I have friends but they all have their person that they need to look out for, and I am so terrified of having the time come that everyone leaves our country out of fear and I’m stuck here alone and afraid.

I know I’m technically still young and I “have more time “ but with the current climate of my country I’m terrified something will happen and time will run out.

I keep picturing that scene in Titanic where the elderly couple is in bed just hugging each other as they accept their fate. I want that when everything finally goes to shit.

I fight for my queer and trans siblings everyday, but I want someone to fight for me and to be there for me if things don’t go according to plan. I’m just so scared and all I have ever wanted is to find my true love. I just keep hoping it happens before it’s too late.","7","0"

(Not sure if that was true) I went through a lot of emotions.

Get everything straight and have some closure.  I truly believe that we were with the wrong people and we could have been great together.  We obviously went about it the wrong way and hurt a lot of people in the process. I always wonder what could have been if we did it right. But I've accepted that that won't happen. But it's almost been a year and I still think about her everyday and HATE that there was never any real closure. I just wish I could just talk to her. Pathetic i know.

He pulls my sweatshirt towards him and makes eye contact with me, while i’m standing there confused, because he’s grabbing my sweatshirt for no reason.

"t3_1j4wh50","Got committed to an insane asylum","Throwaway account.

Sorry if the story is too long because the details are a bit fresh.

I  have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for a couple of years. I am finishing up university, but since I major in Humanities, my career prospects seem bleak. Also, I had problems with with uni so I had to repeat a few semesters. Both of these things are a source of my anxiety and depression.

I have friends and family members, but not a significant other or a person with whom I can talk about my problems.

For the past several months, I have been looking for a job without too much success. At the same time, I was trying to find help for my depression, insecurities and suicidal thoughts. Since I'm broke and cannot afford a therapist, I found an organization that offers free counseling. After filling out their application, they told me I should go to the hospital because they are not qualified to handle patients experiencing suicidal thoughts.

I had my reservations about doing that since public healthcare, especially regarding mental health, albeit free, is pretty bad in my country.

Fast forward one month, I managed to get two job offers, one in a translation company, which is a 9 to 5, and an evening teaching job.

I was pretty excited about the success in getting not one, but two job offers so I decided to take it easy and not exaust myself with work. I thought that the best course of action for me was to start doing both jobs until I figured out which one I liked more so I could focus on that job or even quit the other one.

Monday was my first day on the translation job. In short, it went pretty horribly. The ""translation"" job turned out to be a regular office job, where I had to scan documents and edit Word files, and it did not involve any sort of translation or useful skill that could help me further my career. Bear in mind, I have had several translation jobs and I am not a complete beginner.

After coming back home, I just started crying and felt desperate because that unpleasant experience on my first day on the job brought up all my repressed emotions to the surface, uncertainty about my career, loneliness, and the fact that all people my age have accomplished something in their lives except me.

Therefore, I gathered my courage and took a taxi to the hospital, hoping to find a therapist with whom I can talk about my problems. I went to the ER and talked to the nurse working at the reception, who was very compassionate and patient. Then, she led me to talk to a psychiatrist, who after listening to my woes politely informed me that I would be transferred to a psychiatric hospital (or a mental asylum if you like) since the hospital is full and they can't take me. He also told me that I should not try and leave the hospital otherwise they would be required by law to call the police since I said that I sufferred from suicidal thoughts.

Then, I waited for two hours until the ambulance arrived and an ambulance crew member escorted me to the car, holding me by my arm so that I would not try to escape, completely ignoring the fact that I came looking for help and did not try to hurt myself.

Fast forward to the insane asylum, I was interviewd by a middle-aged psychiatrist, who gave an impression as if he wanted to be literally anywhere else but in that room talking to me. After the interview, he told me that I would have to be committed either involumtarily, which would last for 48 hours, or voluntarily, in which case I would have to talk to a different doctor and stay in the insane asylum until she decided what is to be done with me. I tried patiently explaining to the psychiatrist that I only wanted to find help for my anxiety and suicidal thoughts and that I did not want to be committed to this institution. Moreover, I stressed that my emotional issues are connected to my career and that I had to go to work on the following day. I tried reasoning that missing the second day of my job and possibly losing both of the job offers is hardly productive for my mental health. He shrugged it off saying that it wasn't the end of the world.

The nurses then marched me off to the psych ward, gave me different clothes, and showed me to my room. The room had three beds and the furthermost one from the door had a heavily-sedated patient, whose arms and legs were tied to the bed. The nurse, in all seriousness, even asked me if I would prefer to sleep next to the sedated patient or I would choose the first bed.

The lights went out and I took the sleeping pills that the nurse offered and slept peacefully... until at least my roommate woke from his sedative-induced stupor and started cursing, swearing and yelling at the top of his lungs, demanding to be released from the restraints.

Two days have passed since then. I have not showered, brushed my teeth or shaved since I wasn't prepared to be committed to an insane asylum and had not prepared any of my things when I initially went to the hospital to get help.

A lot of thoughts have gone through my mind in the past few days so I hoped that writing it all down and sharing with strangers would help me make some sense of it.

TLDR: Tried to ask for help and find a therapist. Got committed to an insane asylum instead.","1","2"

"t3_1j4n9fx","Went to a bar with my friends and realized we were sitting opposite to a girl on a date with a guy I used to date","To be honest, I’m just venting. I’m so indifferent to the whole situation. Also, I just want to share that I only wish him well and not trying to paint him as the bad guy. Just wanted to make some sense of the night.

The chances of it happening is just so little since he doesn’t even live close to that neighborhood and it’s not close to mine either. Somehow I ended up seeing him with another girl.

Immediately made me remember the last time we spent time together. To paint the picture, he kept rationalizing being not ready for monogamy with me. A lil context - he already talked about him only being/wanting to be in monogamy. He admitted to me that he was seeing other people while he was with me (context: we saw each other every other day-ish). Lastly, after trying to rationalize, he started talking about all things that his ex did to him that hurt him for an hour.

During that bit I didn’t say a word and I just had my eyes down low, listening. He didn’t even caring if I’m feeling anything in that moment. Not even checking in on me. Rambling about all details of why he called off the wedding for an hour. Which just reflects how unhealed he was.

He got up to use the washroom and mentioning returning and before he came back, my Uber was booked and already waiting for me.

I chose myself.

A bit more context - I’m not trying to paint him as the bad guy, he was nice to me but people can be flawed and unhealed. He was the one to start talking about future/plans/trips and we even started doing exercise together. He proudly showed me to his family and also was the one mentioning proudly that he’s dating me

I admit though I’m happy for him to be going to dates, I felt a bit sad. Part of the sadness is some dysphoria. Seeing him with a cis girl made me feel gender dysphoria, I felt like I’m not as feminine as cis girls (which is partly true). Even thought that he must have left me because I’m trans - could be the truth but with a very little possibility, he’s bi.

The past bunch of months, I have been thinking about it enjoying the happy return to singlehood and having nothing to do with dating.

I’m choosing peace of singlehood and enjoying company of the ones I love, giving them more time 🤍","6","5"

I reported it. My son was removed from their mother’s care for her failure to comply with a CFS safety plan: keep the kid away from the pedo. I won custody of my son shortly after his detainment. He was placed in my care.

"t3_1j4vczc","I (26M) am starting to feel attracted to my MtF (25) friend and am confused.","Hello, it is my first time ever posting on reddit and english is not my native language so sorry if I am screwing stuff up.

Quick context: I am a 26 year old male with a partner of 5 year (28F) that I love very much together in our house with cats. My friend called ""V"" is a great person to be around, really soscial and funny. We met at university and were good friends from the moment we met and although life has lowered our time together, we still meet for DnD once a month at least and chat when time allows!

Anyway,last year V told our close group of friends that they are transitioning but we can still use male pronouns and everything around him for now. We all accepted it and told him that we are here if he needs help.A couple of months went by and he started the hormone treatment, grew out his hair and starting dressing and acting more feminine. I started to find it a bit interesting to witness the transformation and my GF talked with him about his feelings and some tips and tricks regarding clothing and make-up.

The first ""feeling"" came when he was going to a dress-up party where he asked my GF to help to dress as a proper women for the first time with a wig, make-up and everything. She was happy to help and went over to his place where he and his roommates live (all girls) to work her magic. All went well according to my GF's text and she send me a picture when he was done. He looked so good! Cute but also sexy and most importantly, happy! That is when I first felt ""something"" and I was a bit shocked, I kinda pushed it away as a reaction to seeing the guy I know for 7 years suddenly as a beautiful women.

The next feeling came later on the evening when I got a message from him (drunk) that was a picture of him blowing me a kiss and saying ""I love yooouuuu"" and some other stuff that he is happy to have me and my GF in his life. This gave me a butterfly in the stomach feeling but I thought it was just a corny message that some people send to friends when drunk (I remember plenty of instances where other friends told me they love me after a night of drinking as I am dropping them of at home and vice versa). I showed the message to my GF and she jokingly asked if I am going to leave her for him. I told here no because I really love her and this is just a random drunk text plus he mentioned her also in the text that followed so it was not only aimed at me.

That leaves me with the situation right now where I am 90% convinced that this is all just a temporary feeling and will blow over as they complete their transition and I move on with my GF in the meantime.

What the hell should I do if the other 10% turns out and I cannot stop thinking about him/her when he starts looking for surgery etc? I really love my GF and I also don't want to ruin a great friendship. Do just thug it out or try to talk with V about it? Thanks in advance","1","4"
"t3_1j4nhml","My grandma is mentally ill and i have no idea what to do","tldr - got a call from a hospital stating that my grandma is in a catatonic state and is using the bathroom on herself in jail.

My (19F) grandma (58F) is severely mentally unstable. She can’t hold a job due to her mental issues she is bipolar and i suspect maybe she might have schizophrenia. I noticed within the past year that she was going down a mental decline. In september things blew up. I get a call one day from her and she started yelling and screaming that somebody put a bomb in the trucks gas tank. She told me to take everyone’s names to which i did so she would calm down. i was not taking her seriously because this has happened before just not to this extent. She immediately starts screaming “Do you want me to die???” So i took names. Which was consisted of people that didnt like her.

Her roommate who she does not get along with was pounding on the door and the cops were circling around her windows according to her. she ended up taking her barricade down that she had up and went to the hospital. She gets out the hospital and proceeds to go back to the hospital 3 days after getting released. Her roommate told us he got an eviction notice for her (it’s his house). My mom (35F) tried to cool the situation down and we didn’t hear about it again. Okay, then she gets out a second time. She goes back to her house, she calls me for a couple days and then its radio silent. Time passed and we went to see her and her roommate tells us she went to jail. Okay wtf happened. She dumped his urine containers for the hospital on him and broke a window.

November passes by. I haven’t gotten a call from jail. I go put money on her card. Still nothing. I contacted the police multiple times to get in contact with her. “You gotta call this department” “We will tell an officer” Well fuck you because its been weeks and i haven’t heard jack shit. One day in mid december i get a call. The jail transferred her to the hospital so now she is going to the psych ward. She takes the phone and we started talking and she told me that people died and how they died in jail and how the jail straight jacked her. Sent her to a psych ward. She calls me everyday and cries and screams at me to get her out and that they discharged her. She spends her birthday in jail and I wasnt allowed to see her. She gets out on new years eve. My mom and I know she is getting evicted but we don’t know if she knows yet. I barely know whats going on. We go back to her house.

They greet each other and i catch their conversation and he tells her to get her stuff out. We take her back to our house. I give her my room and i stay by my boyfriends house. She stayed in bed for 3 days. Just sleeping. She ends up getting in contact with another one of her old roommates and he said she can stay with him. My grandma had gotten an injury 2 years ago and won a case for it, and was waiting to get her money. I have no idea how legal stuff and money work. She stays by friend for a couple days and then her roommate called me and told me she went to jail. This was 2 in the morning. She got out December 31st and went back to jail January 5th. I look up her charges and she had 4 counts of breaking a restraining order and unauthorized entry of a dwelling. Bond at $19,000. February passes. We have not heard anything and we got mail from her lawyer. We learn she was carrying $1,000 when she went to jail.

I just now get a call from another hospital. Nurse says she is discharged. Huh?? I call my mom and she doesnt want to go get her, same case with my uncle. And im trying to figure out what to do when the nurse calls again and proceeds to tell me there was a miscommunication between nurse and officer. Grandma was going back to jail. “Why did they bring her back” I asked. Nurse said she had an ankle monitor on and the officers left her. But turns out they came back for her. Wtf!!? “Well, may I ask why she’s there?” The nurse tells me everything came out negative and that she didn’t have paralysis or anything. Yeah well turns out my grandma has been in a catatonic state and was using the bathroom on herself. Nurse said it’s not physical it’s psychiatric. They took her back to jail Nobody seems to care. My mom is fed up with her and my uncle doesn’t do a damn for her. Im so upset. What do I do? They changed her medicine and she broke. She isn’t moving. She is using it on herself. What do I do?? What can I do? Im sorry for making such a long post and that everything is everywhere. Im so stressed. Is there a way to get in contact with her? Her lawyers? What do I even do.","5","2"

It is almost always me going to her place, waiting 2 hours. A few months back around mid October, kind of wanted to break it up because I didn’t feel very happy in the relationship, but I said I would wait a little because we had a trip to Berlin which was super awesome and things were going great. Now it’s been a while, still taking the train 2 hours to see her and I feel that the past few weeks my feelings for her has dwindled. I feel a lust for other woman, don’t find my girlfriend as attractive anymore and very little need to see her. I don’t look forward to seeing her which I hate because I wish I did

I have told her how I feel and we said we would give a little time and if it keeps going we should break up. The problem is I can’t decide, one part of me is screaming stay with her because I love her but not the same way anymore but I still love her and at the same time I feel like the only solution is breaking up. I’m not sure if it’s because I love the idea of her what is making me so confused

"t3_1j47j8o","I gained 50 pounds in a year and feel miserable about my body","Hey guys. Throwaway account here—I (20F) just want to vent after a trip to the mall recently that legitimately made me realize just how much my body has changed. I tried on a dress in the size I was last year, and after I tried to force the zipper and it didn't work, I felt so disgusted with myself.

I weighed myself on my scale for the first time in a while and realized I'd gained about 50 pounds in less than a year. I'd just started college, and a healthy eating and exercise routine I'd gotten into in my senior year of high school went down the drain during my first year as I began drinking more, getting takeout and eating out at least 4+ times a week, and not exercising (trying to balance a crazy social life with academics was just not something I was cut out for).

This year, I'm getting more into home cooking, exercising, and staying away from junk foods, but whenever I feel like I'm making progress I end up relapsing for some reason. For example, I made excuses during exam season and ended up getting a lot of takeout again, ruining my progress. Whenever I go out with friends or am with family, I feel too embarrassed to mention I'm trying to diet because I'd always been the chubby kid growing up, and I wanted to continue living as the ""thinner, glowed up"" person I'd become when that isn't who I am anymore. As a result, I end up eating a lot during hangouts or just giving in to temptations. I also sometimes have the bad mentality of ""I ate something unhealthy today already, might as well just use today as a cheat day"" way too often.

Overall, this isn't just about the weight gain itself: I feel like I've lost the discipline I once had and my self-confidence just keeps slipping away. It's been a week or so after a stressful life season, and I'm attempting to start this process again. I'm now 3 days into my new routine of encouraging myself to get out more as well as eating healthier and reducing portions, and I've been seeing some good calorie deficits without even feeling too worn out. I hope I can keep up the progress this time. I need to do this for myself, not only for my physical appearance, but my mindset and to re-instill discipline. I'm not trying to make excuses, just ranting about everything here to get it off my chest. If anyone sees this, thanks for reading!","41","62"
