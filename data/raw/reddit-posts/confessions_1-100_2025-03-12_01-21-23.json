    "selftext": "I wanted to get this off of my chest because I have nobody else to talk about this with.\n\nI'm so glad that I'm exploring my sexuality and getting more comfortable with the idea of sex. Sex itself is very scary for me, so I feel like I'm finally breaking out of my shell after having a sexual relationship with this guy online. \n\nLast night we were sexting for almost 3 hours straight. I made him cum 4 times back to back by just talking dirty, moaning over the phone, and mutually masturbating with one another. This morning when he woke up I sexted in my car with him. It felt great to just not give a flying fuck about if someone might hear me or not. Yes, I was masturbating naked in my car out in public while he was on the phone. Although, nobody saw me because the windows are tinted and it was in the driveway of my house lol. \n\nIt just feels liberating for once to just not give a flying fuck and be as dirty as you want to be. Most of my life I've been worried about being called a whore or being body shamed if I showed my naked body but thankfully he was respectful towards me and said that he enjoys seeing me naked. My whole life I've been in fear of having sex due to what other men might think about my naked body. I'm glad that I'm starting to slowly overcome those fears little by little everyday. I'm tired of being afraid and just want to be happy. ",

    "selftext": "So, it's a long story. I was in a long-distance online relationship, and we broke up about two months ago. When I was with my ex, he was never really sexual with me and barely paid attention to me. Anyway, we broke up, and since then, I've been feeling sexually frustrated.\n\nAbout a week ago, I met another guy online. Initially, he reached out to support me after seeing my vent post, but after a few days of talking, things escalated, and we ended up doing a lot of sexting and phone call sex. He would masturbate on call with me. While we were masturbating together, we would talk dirty and moan a lot on the phone. Since then, we haven't stopped sexting each other. Last night, we sexted for about 2.5 to 3 hours, which was very liberating, honestly. I've never been sexually intimate with anyone like this before, so I'm glad I met him.\n\nHowever, there's an issue: he keeps feeling bad about my situation and keeps offering to help me out financially. I keep saying no to him because, firstly, I don't want to feel like a prostitute, and secondly, I don't want him to think that I'm using him for money. I've told him that I appreciate the thought, but I don't feel comfortable accepting his money. He understood, yet there's something about him wanting to give me money that rubs me the wrong way.\n\nIn addition to that, he tells me that I shouldn't tell him if I'm seeing other men because that would make him jealous. We aren't in a romantic relationship, but he's already getting possessive, even though we're just in a friends-with-benefits situation. He also told me that he would get envious if he found out that I lost my virginity to anyone besides him, yet he claims to understand. Honestly, I don't know how to feel about this.\n\nI haven't been this sexually intimate with anyone before due to my insecurities about my body. Also, I just don't know how to talk to guys in real life. I love talking to him and being myself around him while we sext. However, I can already see the red flags in him. I'm going to keep him at arm's length and not date him romantically since he comes off as a red flag. I don't know how to feel about this situation, and I just wanted to get this off my chest.",

    "selftext": "So, there I was, living out my Disney princess fantasy, ready to rescue a tiny, helpless creature in distress. The mouse was stuck on a glue pad, screaming its little lungs out like it was auditioning for a horror movie. Naturally, I sprang into action, armed with the most heroic tool I could find: vegetable oil. (Move over, Captain America\u2014my shield is a bottle of canola.)\n\nI gently poured the oil, whispering sweet nothings like, \u201cHold on, little buddy, I\u2019ve got you.\u201d The mouse looked up at me with its beady eyes, and for a moment, I thought I saw gratitude. Spoiler alert: I was wrong.\n\nAs soon as its tiny feet were free, the mouse turned into a furry little demon. It lunged at my finger like it was the last piece of cheese on Earth and chomped down like it was trying to set a world record for \u201cLongest Mouse Bite.\u201d Fifteen seconds. FIFTEEN SECONDS. Do you know how long that feels when a rodent has a personal vendetta against your fingertip? It\u2019s basically a lifetime.\n\nI\u2019m standing there, bleeding like I just lost a sword fight, while this ungrateful little gremlin is hanging off my finger like it\u2019s a carnival ride. Finally, it let go, and I released it outside, where it scampered off into the sunset without so much as a \u201cthank you\u201d or a \u201csorry for the attempted murder.\u201d\n\nNow, I\u2019m left with a bandaged finger, a bruised ego, and the haunting realization that I\u2019ve been outsmarted by a creature with a brain the size of a pea. Moral of the story? No good deed goes unpunished, especially when the recipient weighs less than a slice of bread and has the temperament of a tiny, furry serial killer.\n\nThis is kind of what it looked like, except I got bitten.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5FucgCMswcA](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5FucgCMswcA)  \n  \n",

    "selftext": "A man liked me on hinge 4 months ago, and I decided to give him a chance in spite of him not matching my usual type. I liked his profile back.\n\nWe talked for a couple of months during the holidays, but because he lives in a different state, we ended up never getting to meet in person. He followed me on instagram and we basically interacted every now and then (though he left me on read any time I tried to strike conversation).\n\nHe came across as such a sweetheart, and I'm not sure why, his smile and the way he seemed to interact with his loved ones really stroke me as someone special. It's like I've been hypnotized ever since I met him.\n\nI decided to reach out anonymously, because any time I tried to send him a meme and start conversation, he'd just like it or leave me on read... And I'm REALLY shy, so the idea of coming forward as myself and him finding me too ugly or rejecting me for being too forward scared me...\n\nI wanted to message anonymously to see if he was as sweet as he seemed to be, or if I could find out more about his personality--to either come forward as myself and declare my intentions, or just leave it be.\n\nWell, he was freaked out and worried I was a stalker... I know it's a valid concern, especially given that I could only find his work email online... :(  \nHe still talked to me under his throwaway email for a few days, and I realized we have more in common than I could have ever anticipated. However, I realized he thought I was his ex that he still likes to this day after a while...\n\nEvery night we spoke anonymously, we would go to bed with him saying how special he felt that someone liked him this way, to the point of messaging anonymously. Then, in the morning, he'd wake up freaked out and delete me (only to re-add later on)...\n\nIn the end, I ended up calling him and coming forward. We had a really lovely conversation on the phone that lasted about 3 hours, and he wanted me to fly to see him, and that we'd make it work because he felt so flattered.\n\nThe next morning, he blocked me everywhere and said it wouldn't work. We haven't spoken ever since.\n\nI think I freaked him out. He probably thinks I'm insane, and I worry that I came across as such.\n\nHe is a lawyer and was really worried this was some type of scam. Though, he did seem to enjoy when I praised him and I feel a little used given some of the things we talked about.\n\nIt's been 3 days, and I feel horrible. I still like him, and I don't even know why I like him so much...\n\nI just have this feeling he thought I was prettier anonymously than I turned out to be. If I was prettier, he wouldn't have blocked me...\n\nHe also told me he had some complicated exes that he had to call the police on, so I hit a soft/difficult spot by reaching out anonymously...\n\nI keep thinking: what if I had just come forward without the anonymous email? What if I had just flown to his city, pretended as if it was a coincidence and texted him \"hi! I happen to be in your city :) maybe we should grab dinner and catch up?\"...\n\nI keep thinking about reaching out again, but then I know I'd be really a creep as he told me not to reach out again. I wonder if he's thinking about reaching out to me, or if I really meant nothing...\n\nI'm a fool.",

    "selftext": "This has been going on for years and I just need to get it off my chest. I\u2019m 24 and I\u2019m the oldest of five kids, parents are still married and all five kids are from both parents. I\u2019ve always been a bit different, but overall I think I\u2019m a normal person. My entire family treats me like the weird kid you tolerate until their mom comes and picks them up from the sleepover. \n\nI used to feel left out as a kid, and looking back I can see it\u2019s because I had very different interests from my siblings and I was very oblivious to social cues. I was (and still kind of am) super nerdy, loved LEGOs (still do), and other kind of geeky interests. I always valued school really highly and my siblings hated school. I was a really outgoing kid and loved making people laugh, and I always seemed to have an easier time with people outside my family. \n\nI went out of state for college and became much better socialized. I grew a lot while I was there and I made a ton of friends through my degree program and my church. I graduated with honors and a good GPA and immediately got a job in my field. I stayed in the same state and met my fianc\u00e9, and we\u2019re getting married this year. \n\nAll of this is to say, I love my life. I like who I am. I have good friends, a good job, and a very loving fianc\u00e9 who I am so excited to marry. \n\nAnd as soon as I\u2019m with my family, the only thing I can think about it how they don\u2019t like me. \n\nThey constantly make jokes at my expense. They exclude me from everything. My siblings all take pictures together, go and do things together, and hang out together, and when I\u2019m home or we\u2019re all on vacation, I am not included in any of it. I have to fight to be included in things, which is the only reason that pictures of me and my siblings together exist. My parents make fun of what I wear. My siblings make fun of me for getting engaged quickly or for going to college (none of them have gone, which is fine, but obviously it helped me get a job, so idk what their problem is). Every single time I visit them I immediately want to leave. \n\nA few years ago when I officially moved out, my mom told me I was ruining her marriage (she didn\u2019t want me to leave but dad supported me). When my sister did it she was \u201cbeing independent.\u201d When I was thinking about \u201csewage slide\u201d in high school and early college she told me it was my fault. When my other sister was dealing with the same thing they paid for her therapy for three years. And now when I try to have conversations with my mom, she doesn\u2019t listen or she starts conversations with other people while I\u2019m mid sentence. I call her regularly to be a good daughter, and she doesn\u2019t care to talk to me and degrades everything I say. My fianc\u00e9 bought me a super cool LEGO set for Christmas (I almost never got LEGOs as a kid, even though it was the only thing I would ask for at Christmas or for my birthday), and my mom\u2019s first response was, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he buy you a down payment on a house?\u201d\n\nI can never get a word in, I can never land a joke, and my siblings make it perfectly clear that they have more fun without me. It\u2019s eating me up and I can\u2019t deal with it anymore. I never want to visit them by myself again. ",

With everything that entails, doctors, assistance, and a lot of suffering. That process was very painful, I had to see less of my friends to be able to take care of her on the one hand, and on the other hand I didn't feel like going out as much, and having much of a social life. A few months have passed, she passed away, and I am resuming life again, with all that that entails, since it was partially paused. I have worked a lot on grief. I attend therapy to accept it and overcome it. But lately, sometimes at social gatherings, parties, dinners with friends, I need to go to the bathroom to just be alone. Be calm for a few minutes and then leave as if nothing had happened. It's like my head, after socializing for a while, needs a break. I don't know if it's social anxiety, low self-esteem or what... the fact is that I will work on it with my psychologist but I would like to know if something similar has ever happened to you or what you think about it.

I am a good muslim boy at home who does chores and is loved by my parents. At school I am known as someone who, has lots of friends, is pretty popular, gets good grades, talks to girls, has hobbies, wears good outfits and do my skincare and hair. And there is no reasonable explanation for how I treat myself in private. \n\nBut for the past year or more I cant recognize myself in the mirror. I have a porn addiction that i have been trying to quit for 3-4 years. This means using once up to three times a day. But sometimes it gets really bad and i start seeking more. That means trying sexting online, live cams, discord servers and other disgusting bullshit. This has ruined the way i see myself and honestly ruined my self respect.\n\n And before all you gurus come at me with advice like read the easypeasy method, watch these youtube videos punish yourself do this, do that. I have tried everything and i am not asking for advice, i know that i could quit if i wanted to but quitting is more about self image than anything else and how you change the way you see yourself is not simple and sometimes you don\u2019t want to let yourself change it. I have at times gone weeks without using and crushing my goals only to think \u201cif i really quit right now i dont see myself NEVER doing it again and the feeling when i relapse after however long will only be worse from here on\u201d and so i do it and i cant convince myself otherwise. And it has affected me in so many ways people cant see.\n\nFor instance, i fell victim to sextortion, luckily nothing happened and i was let off the hook but it damaged me psychologically to an extent i still feel today, like a wake up call. Furthermore this addiction has damaged my sexual interest, my brain and more importantly my faith and some of the best years of my life. \n\nAnd everyday i ask myself how i would let me do this to myself but its always the same conclusion. I feel like an addict, and i don\u2019t trust myself to stay consistent. And its not like i can reach out for help cause that would shatter this image that everyone has of me and thats all i have right now.\n\nIf anyone even cares to read this far, say what you want in the comments whether it be sympathy or advice i dont care..",

    "selftext": "This happened when I was around 7 or 8, and my neighbor\u2019s kid was around the same age (maybe a year younger). We used to be friends, but I feel too guilty to call her my friend since I took advantage of her.\n\nFor context, I am from a Muslim-majority country where homosexuality is still illegal. I am Muslim, and my neighbor\u2019s kid was Hindu. None of our families were strictly religious, but homosexuality is still very taboo.\n\nSince we were around the same age, we used to play together a lot. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I recall watching movies with my parents where the male and female leads would date and kiss, and I wanted to try that too. So one day, I convinced my neighbor\u2019s kid to play house with me and roleplay as husband and wife. I didn\u2019t like her or have a crush on her, but I wanted to try dating and having a boyfriend like in the movies. We weren't allowed to be around boys so that's why I was roleplaying with her. I convinced her to kiss and make out with me since we were pretending to be husband and wife. We played like this a lot.\n\nWe didn\u2019t always play house. We also played other normal games that kids play, like hide and seek and board games. I wasn\u2019t specifically targeting her to take advantage of her, but now that I\u2019m older and can reflect on my actions, I see that what I did was awful. This wasn\u2019t a one-time occasion. We frequently played like this until I moved to another country and lost touch.\n\nI haven\u2019t been able to go back to my home country yet so I don't know how she is doing.\u00a0I\u2019m scared to see her again because of what I did. I want to apologize, but I\u2019m also terrified that if I do, this might bring back bad memories for her or this incident could reach our family members, and I don\u2019t know what the consequences would be. It makes me feel even guiltier that I\u2019m afraid of the consequences, even though they would be a result of my actions.\n\nI don\u2019t know if she would even want an apology. Maybe she doesn't recall any of this and it\u2019s better to leave things as they are. I remember that she called my mom a few years ago and asked to speak with me after I moved, but I didn\u2019t talk to her because I wasn\u2019t sure if she would bring this up or not. Actually, I don\u2019t even know if this is as big of a deal as I\u2019m making it out to be, but I feel so horrible about it that I feel like I need to be punished.\n\nI\u2019m 18 now, but back then, I didn\u2019t know anything about sexuality. Since it\u2019s a conservative country, these topics weren\u2019t really discussed. I also suppressed this memory until now, so I don\u2019t remember the details anymore or how she felt about us playing like this.",

What do you guys think I should do?\n",

    "selftext": "\nHere\u2019s a long story I\u2019ve never told a soul. \n\nWhen I was 21, I was a junior in college. Not your typical college guy. I was shy, reserved, didn\u2019t drink, didn\u2019t smoke, never slept around. I had a girlfriend at the time I really liked. Typical college story though.. she met another guy on the tennis team and dropped me for him. I was devastated. \n\nI went with a friend on a trip, out of feeling so down from my breakup. I did something I normally didn\u2019t do and went to a bar, where a lady older than me randomly came up to me very friendly and said that I looked like a \u201clost puppy.\u201d She was 28 and married. She asked for my snap, then began to message me and nothing happened on our trip between she and I. But her messaging turned into about 10 months of a sexual affair. We lived far apart, so we\u2019d just find random places. \n\nThis lady told me I was her 3rd sexual encounter outside of her marriage. She told me she had cheated at a wedding a couple years prior and on another vacation years prior. \n\nShe told me she was a \u201cserial cheater\u201d and had cheated on every single man she had ever been with, from high school until the present then. \n\nShe told me how she had so much nostalgia for some dude she dated in college. She said she\u2019d wait for her husband to get drunk and she\u2019d go message this old college flame, while her husband was passed out drunk. \n\nI was so innocent then and idk, but I think her \u201cbad nature\u201d drew me in.. sickening to think of now\n\nSince then, she moved even further away, left her husband and from my peeping of her socials, has been in at least one serious relationship since her marriage dissolved. \n\nAll this to say.. I have never forgiven myself. I have no clue how I went from such a good guy, to doing such a heinous and evil act. I\u2019ve never done anything of the sort since nor will I ever. Did we get caught? Nope, but I think that made it even worse because now it\u2019s been YEARS, but every day I think of how awful I am and how much I just wish I could go back in time and talk to that 21 year old kid and tell him how things are.. How wrong this is, how he\u2019ll regret is badly when he gets older.. Why is he ruining his innocence and hurting a sacred covenant? These are thoughts I still live with. \n\nI\u2019ve been in therapy since and not to make this religious, but I\u2019ve prayed so many times for forgiveness because I feel filthy and awful and unworthy of anything now. I\u2019ve done volunteer work and am way less judgmental of people now, because I realize we all have something in our past we aren\u2019t proud of. I\u2019ve tried redeeming myself, but still feel awful. \n\nA little while back, this particular girl tracked me down and messaged me\u2026 I replied in a very matter of fact way, didn\u2019t tell her a thing about my current whereabouts. I told her I didn\u2019t have any desire to ever communicate with her again, I told her I forgave her and hope she forgave me, because we enabled one another to do an awful thing. She hasn\u2019t tried reaching out since. I\u2019d be happy if I don\u2019t hear her name until I read her obituary.. Hopefully that\u2019s a long time away, because I don\u2019t wish her any harm, I just want to bury that behind me for good. \n\nFWIW, karma did get me good (which I deserved), after college graduation I had a very brief stint in the Marines and was dropped during induction for medical. Then came back to my home state and met a girl I was crazy over.. She told me a little bit into our relationship she had been cheating with her ex the entire time behind my back. I was devastated.. But, I knew it was karma and i deserved it. \n\nI\u2019ve never told a soul of what I did (other than my therapist) nor do I plan to. It\u2019s too shameful and my guilt way too high. I hope to take it to the grave. I just hope to live a better life and maybe someday I can meet someone good and make a life together, but I guess I\u2019ll just never forgive myself for what I did at 21. That was the worst chapter  my life and I\u2019ll never forgive myself for it, fully. ",

    "selftext": "I have so many complex feelings I need to express towards this woman I call my mistress. Our relationship started out as simple fun and it was absolutely exhilarating but now that things have changed I have to say that she's really left her mark on me. I've never known a woman with such a loving heart and so thoughtful and understanding. She's the most beautiful person I know inside and out and I'm forever grateful to her.  She opened my eyes to my own feelings and has even continued to support me in my journey of finding what's right for me. She has a beautiful family now and a loving boyfriend so it's no longer my place to share these feelings with her directly but if by some chance you do ever read these words I just want you know that I love you. I love you with all of my heart and more. I'll love you till the end of my days even if we never speak again. When I smile, when I cry, when I'm alone in this world I think of you and look to the moon we share at night and fall in love with the memories all over again. I could never admit that I'm love with you to your face anymore so let me say it here. I love you mistress and not just as a precious person. And even it's painful to not be the one chosen by you, you absolutely deserve the world and all the good in it. If it means you'll be happy, I'm happy to live with a hole in my heart because knowing you're happy and fulfilled and taken care brings me more joy than anything else. Okay. Got that off my chest now. Whew! I'm hopeless over this woman and so proud to be her friend. You twist me up in knots but I wouldn't have it any other way so long as I can be a part of your life. Now that I've confessed I feel more ready on now.

    "selftext": "Providing context: I, 16f, met my friend, 15f, when I transferred to a new school this year. She invited me to sit next to her and we\u2019ve been friends since. We bonded over our love for reading, but also over our vast differences. We like very different music, books, artists, guys, etc. The last few days she has been talking more and more about God, Jesus, the Bible, Church, etc. She is an evangelical Christian. I am a former Christian, but left the church and became agnostic around age 10 for many reasons (I am against homophobia, I believe the Bible is often used to propagate sexist gender roles, and I just don\u2019t believe it is real). Yesterday we were chatting, and she randomly said that her goal for this year is to convert me to Christianity. I respect her religion, and am glad that it works for her, but it doesn\u2019t for me. She explained that she doesn\u2019t want me to burn in hell forever, and she feels good with God so she wants me to feel good with God. I understand she has good intentions, but she knows I am not Christian anymore.\n\nThe thing is I am part of the LGBTQ+ community (I\u2019m not sure if she knows), and she has occasionally made homophobic remarks. She says \u201cshe tolerates but doesn\u2019t support it\u201d, but I\u2019m not sure. Apart from that I am pagan, and practice witchcraft. I gained interest in those beliefs around the same time I left the church, and I honestly feel more secure and empowered with my current beliefs than I did then. \n\nThis is not to hate anybody\u2019s religion since you have the right to believe what you want to believe, but I feel like if she finds out I\u2019m pagan and queer our friendship dynamic might change, or she may take it as a challenge to further convert me, which I find a bit uncomfortable.",

I was so fed up and felt like i wasted the year i earned. I started applying everywhere in my field again and finally got a call back as a Work From Home Customer Service Agent. I was trying to do IT so this was a step in that direction. \n\nAfter interviewing they took all my information and said I would be training during a 2 month probationary period and be paid in the end. \n\nThey actually assigned me daily work over the course of a month and I was \u201csupposed to be paid\u201c after my six weeks were up. But weird things started happening.\n\nFirst, I got a call from a random lady from Texas, claiming I friended her on Zelle. Then I got an email a couple weeks later saying my banking information was successfully transferred to a new financial institution, which I never approved or attempted. And finally someone claiming to be with the FBI called me saying I\u2019m under investigation for stealing $3000 from someone\u2019s bank account. He was not an FBI agent. At this point i called my bank to report potential fraud. That email and \u201cFBI\u201d call both happened within 30 minutes. \n\nAll in all, just in case the money was real I sort of did the work but didn\u2019t expect much. I locked my account so nothing can be taken, but money can be added. \n\nI was wholeheartedly impressed by the scam I fell for so I wasn\u2019t even mad. I usually play along with scams just to fuck with them but this was some next level shit lmao. \n\nThe website they used and everything was falsified to look so real, with references and all. \n\nSo, what did I do?  I added that to my resume as two months of experience in the field adding all the shit that\u2019d look good for my actual career, even though that was a lie. Shortly after that, I got an actual job in IT finally. They were unable to actually call the job but could check the website for \u201cverification\u201d lol. I even gave myself a nice recommendation letter from my boss. \n\nSo technically, I lied on my resume, but did I really?\n\n***TL;DR:***\n&gt;**I fell for a job scam and did the fake work for 2 months.

Well one of those babysitters was a close family friend. From ages 6-8 she continuously made me grope her breast, used my hand/ fingers to pleasure herself, and made me preform sexual motions over her body while she laid on her back. Growing up I never understood the magnitude of what I experienced. I felt so \"cool\" knowing I was able to go through that at such a young age. Now I realize that im a victim to my abuse and its taking a toll on my mental health. I am addicted to Porn. I cant seem to escape myself and only bury myself deeper into my addiction. I try to keep myself distracted. Social media dosent help. I cant bring myself to speak to anyone close to me about this. I mean how do you do it after nearly 15 years? Im exhausted. Just had to get it off my chest.",

    "selftext": "So I work in retail and my manager often has me work on my aisle to make sure things are in check ( mostly cause I talk a lot and being alone fixing the place would help lol) anyways my job is to keep things nice and clean and help customers if they need help. And that\u2019s where I met her. \n\nShe was slightly shorter, long curly hair and a pretty smile. She wore that uniform like it she was doing it a favor. She was quiet but would talk tia. Few girls in that specific section and ofc how I\u2019m out going and polite I was like why not she\u2019s cute and she\u2019s quite my top 2 things I like in a girl. I felt like she was the one and as the months passed I progressed little by little and thought about her all the time. \n\n One night in august me and my homies from the stock room decide to get a big group and my close friend Alex was like yo dude this is ur perfect chance, invite her and try to get her social at the same time. I was scared but I made the confidence to talk to her and in the end she did. Sadly she did not go out with us for personal reasons but she texted me , i responded, she added me to her close friends, and we began to talk more and more. \n\nLooking back I think it was the fact she was darker then me that made me like her more lol ( I\u2019m pale asf) and she was also a Salvi. When we college started we would meet up and it led to us revealing we wanted to get to know each other more. I still remember that day we sat outside , behind the science building at our campus. We sit next to each other after she says goodbye to her friend and we make eye contact. My hearts beating as we sit close together and I\u2019m scared but I know what I wanna say. I honestly enjoy being with you and I wanna get to know you more if that\u2019s cool with you. \u201c I wanna get to know you too. You look like the type of person I wanna get to know\u201d \n\n2 days later we shared our first kiss in her car and I sometimes think about how smooth and sweet her lips were.( she vaped so it tasted like strawberries) as the weeks passed we progressed to\u2026 well I will admit I\u2019m at fault I rushed a few things as in making out, and nearly having sex. I respected her wishes as in waiting or to do it in a better spot. ( we would mostly make out in her car cause both our places got people) regardless I started to lose feelings mostly due to the fact how she was really starting to\u2026 be a bit weird the more I progressed with her. I was also seeing her nearly 5 days a week 3 extra times in school and maybe 2 days to myself so this came into a factor as well. Also that\u2026 she looked different well not entirely different but she relied a lot on makeup. \n\nHer friends were interesting, mainly gay which does not bother me but most would be talking about stuff or cracking jokes that I did not  understand. I was always nice don\u2019t get me wrong but I felt\u2026 a bit out of place and weirded out due to certain graphic topics that came up. 3 weeks in I told her I can\u2019t do this and it did hurt\u2026 however I did not diss her or tell people oh cause of this. I kept it private and\u2026 well a month flew by and we tried again\u2026 but then again it did not work out well. \n\nIk her very well and she\u2019s a hard working individual and one of the most funniest. It\u2019s been 5 months since and I still got her IG. I message maybe once in a while but stopped to not let her catch any feelings. We both have this bond or\u2026 I guess work bond you can say? Looking back I feel like \u201c did work make us do this? Like did work make us ignore certain things about us that we were blind and got a reality check? Regardless she is one of the best females I ever dated and I will always remember her. ",

    "selftext": "I been living with my great aunt and uncle for nearly 10 years. I have a really terrible childhood that if I was to tell the story it would need to be a whole other Reddit post cause of the amount of shit I been thru. However when I turned 18 my aunt was beginning to hit me over little things that no family member should do. As I mentioned they are Jehovah\u2019s Witness and my aunt who i was living with at the time is  related to is my mother. Aka my Tia abuela or grandma aunt. \n\nAnyways my family especially from this side i was raised in have a ton of anger, depression and mental issues and often the old heads just bury there feelings or trauma with something. Claiming that mental health ain\u2019t a thing that your just lazy or don\u2019t believe in god.  this aunt I was with used this religion to cover up her trauma and just leased it out on me. \n\nOnce when early Saturday morning, before the people came to our house for service my aunt got mad for something and grabbed me by the collar while dressed up ready to go preaching, she grabbed me so hard she ripped a button off and later got mad when I told her while it was ripped.\n\nOne time she got mad at something I did and grabbed me by my collar and broke my chain my grandma gave me and I cried later cause I had to use a string to fix it\u2026 I was 13 both times \n\nOnce I called my mother the 2nd year I was with them cause my aunt  and her husband were so old school that they would hit us thinking it was right. Was about 8 and eventually gave up after a fight broke out with them both\u2026\n\nI felt growing up with her it was eggshells and ofc she took the basic stuff to take care of me and my sister like food and shelter but I felt\u2026 like that love was not there. You ever speak to someone and be open? Like you tell them how you\u2019re feeling and they add on to it? That\u2019s something I did not feel like I could do with her cause she scared me..\n\nIn 2023 when I turned 18 she placed her hands on me more cause I would speak up or back at her. What confused me more was that she would hit me or slap me and take it as a challenge if I put my hands up which was just a basic mechanism to protect myself.  I would tell her how can she be acting like this before or after church? It made no sense for a women to be the wife of an elder to act so innocent and happy but say the harshest things to me and cover my arms in scratches.\n\nOnce we had a special circuit overseer ( a traveling missionary in that religion ) come over for dinner. It was a Saturday so I was studying and while my uncle was cooking steak outside she was like go watch him cook and learn. I said: I know how to cook, every time I\u2019m with the people from the English congregation they always let me. Tio does not let me. \n\nShe got mad and told me to go do it and so I walk downstairs and grab my shoes and toss them on the ground after she yelled something. When the I tossed my shoes she slapped her dishes and walked up to me and grabbed my wrist and yelled at her to let go and she scratched my arms so bad that even my friends at my part time job were concerned about me. It was bad\u2026 whats crazy my uncle never said anything to her after he asked me what happed to my arms cause he saw the claw like marks and my aunt that night was just smiling and happy talking to the missionary\u2019s and his wife\u2026\n\nMy final straw was when she started to hit me early in the morning after she saw me sleeping in after our 3 day convention which are like 8 hours max and for us cause they were both high ranking officials so I had to be there early asf with them and what I found crazy this woman was slapping and hitting me in the head like I did the worst thing in the world just for sleeping in 1 day  during summer school and what\u2019s funny I told her I can just take it online here at home. 7:00 in the morning she\u2019s yelling and I get up as she grabs me and yell at her how is she acting like this after a the convention? ( literally yesterday)\u2026 \n",

I live alone and don\u2019t really have any friends that are my age, so work is my main social interaction. I got a job on an ICU floor in the hospital 6 months ago. When one of my coworkers asked me how old I am, I was genuinely embarrassed because I was the youngest person there by far, the majority of my coworkers are in their mid 20s-30s and a few 40+. I was scared that they wouldn\u2019t think I wasn\u2019t competent to work in the ICU at such a young age, so I said I panicked and lied that I was 21. I have told several coworkers this when they ask. I also recently started seeing a guy who is 22, we met on social media and I saw that he had mutual connections with 2 people from work so I lied to him as well. We have went on several dates and he has been to my apartment, but every time he asks to go out for drinks I always make up an excuse (since I\u2019m actually not of drinking age in the US). It hasn\u2019t got too serious just yet but I really like him and would like for the relationship to progress. I feel incredibly embarrassed and guilty for lying but I don\u2019t see any possible way that I could tell the truth without people thinking I\u2019m weird. I\u2019m absolutely terrified that someone will find out and expose me. I wish that instead of feeling embarrassed, I would be proud of having a good job and living independently at 19, but now I have dug myself into a hole by lying. ",

You can imagine the pain she felt and the sorrow and the distraught. I \"manned up\" and consoled her for however long she needed because I love her and it's not her fault. I made sure she knew it wasn't her fault and that I love her. This happened in October of 2024. \n\nToday I was working and I was listening to my music. I have apple music so I had created a station where it plays music it thinks I would like. One song came out where it talks about how children are gifts from God and little kids started singing at a part. I don't know why it hit me like a truck today. I felt like exploding in years but I couldn't cause I was working.\n\nNo one consoled me when it happened. I don't ask why it happened. I know things happen for a reason. I've always asked myself if I'm still considered a dad. I don't know if I do. I asked google because I just didn't know and it said I am considered a father to an unborn child. That just broke my heart and now I'm just in a state of sadness and sorrow.",

Sexual assault\n\nHey reddit! \nSo I\u2019m not sure on how to really write this and I\u2019m very emotional right now writing this but anyways here it goes\n\nSo I (20F) was at my best friend\u2019s house about a week ago and his cousin Jake(fake name)(30M) was there. Now I have liked Jake for a while and i have known him since i was 15 and he was 25. we were both drinking and we kissed. He wanted to have s3x and he told me he has wanted to do this since we met (which i found a bit creepy since i was 15 and he was 25)\n\nAnyways he kept asking and i said no and he continued to ask while attempting to undo my pants. I said no a few more times and eventually allowed it to happen. \n\nAfter that night i was taken to the doctor to be tested for any STIs/STDs for it was unprotected. And i had so many invasive tests done in the trauma unit. \n\nI have been in an emotional state since and im not sure why \n\nMy parents and friends are saying i was assaulted but I\u2019m still not sure\nbut i did feel like i was taken advantage of. \nIm so confused on if i was actually assaulted or if I\u2019m being dramatic because i feel guilty because my body enjoyed it. \n\nI don\u2019t want to get the police involved or to get a case. I just want to forget about it. \nAnd also the fact that I\u2019m not sure if it was sexual assault. So i don\u2019t want to ruin someone\u2019s life because of something i may have overreacted to. \n\nSo i just wanted another opinion \n\n",

    "selftext": "My childhood wasn\u2019t something any child should experience. My parents were always fighting. When they weren't fighting, they would rather go outside, leaving me alone with a babysitter. The neighbors didn\u2019t like it when I played with their children due to my family\u2019s condition.\n\nI found it difficult to study and I had trouble staying focused on the topics in class, which led me to be the dumbest kid in class. Other children didn\u2019t want to play with me because they thought I was odd. The only time they let me hang out with them was when I promised to carry their bags wherever they went. I will please everyone, lick their shoes if I have to as long as I can be friends with them, but most of the time I just sat alone on the swing in the school playground.\n\nDuring my teenage years, I was bullied because of my appearance. My hair was tangled, falling out, and thinning due to stress. My skin looked dulled and I had acne. My body didn't fit the beauty standards in the place where I lived. Oh right, I forgot to mention that I\u2019m still struggling academically. I have short attention span, I get distracted very easily and it\u2019s difficult to concentrate.\n\nNow back to my parents. I know I'm not supposed to self-diagnose, but I believe my parents have untreated mental health issues. Every time I told them I was interested in learning something, they would tell me no because they thought it was a waste of time, just a phase, and that I\u2019d get bored by it later.\n\nFor example, when I told them I\u2019d like to learn piano, they said no. When I asked if I could take a sewing class, they said I\u2019m not good enough and just gonna waste their money. When I received a job offer outside of town, they told me that I cannot bring any of the things they have purchased for me, which includes laptops for work, my phone, and my clothes (I was only allowed to take one empty bag to put my documents and the clothes I was wearing at that time). As a result, I lock myself in my room for a long time\n\nI got very depressed at some point, but now I\u2019m a little stable. I became a very hateful person, envious of those who have their lives together. I learned how to manipulate people, only befriending them if they could bring me benefits and taking advantage of them. I ruined my friend\u2019s relationship with her boyfriend because I envy her. I regret it so much. Every time I did something bad, I feel guilty and ashamed of myself. I wanted to be a good person since I was a child, but I crave revenge for everything I went through as I grew up. I\u2019m conflicted with my own feelings. I want to stop, but my thoughts will give me reasons why it\u2019s useless to be a good person",

    "selftext": "The past decade has been a crazy tumultuous time for me. I have dealt with so much and am trying to get my life together and get my career going.\n\nI lost my Dad 5 years ago to alcohol abuse. He drank himself to death and it was a difficult time for me to put it mildly. He lost his job and started drinking away as a means to cope and he would hit me if I tried to take the alcohol away. In the months before his passing he would tell me that he would pass away eventually and I was in so much pain. \n\nI remember coming home from school and seeing him collapse and pass away, it was the most painful and difficult situation of my life.\n\nEveryone in my neighborhood made fun of me and tormented me following my father\u2019s passing. My neighbor drove drunk into my driveway and started harassing me calling me the N word and saying I didn\u2019t belong in the neighborhood and that my dad died because he hates me. She knew where I went to university and while I was there she falsified a report to the police that I was dangerous. Campus police pulled me over and put a gun in my face, I thought I was going to die. Furthermore due to PTSD I crashed my vehicle a month later however I got it back through insurance. I continued having mental health issues.\n\nA few months after this I started working in IT and it was the most fun job I ever had, I love technology and solving issues related to it was so much fun for me. I met this girl I really liked and we started dating. The friend group I was in felt that I wasn\u2019t giving them as much attention as I should so they started putting me down and talking negatively about my relationship and myself in hopes of gaining control of me and keeping me within the confines of the group. \n\nAround the time I started working in IT, I lost 40 pounds and got dreads. My friends commented initially that I started to look more attractive and they liked the look and my girlfriend agreed. It ended up being a point of contention when my friends realized my girlfriend was White and I was African-American. They used to talk down to me and kept saying \u201cYou think you\u2019re better than all of us\u201d when I had never said that in my life.\n\nThe hispanic friends within my group had the most vitriol and hate for my which I will never understand. The last day I ever hung out with these people I was dropping home one of them and he asked me if I wanted to hang out with him and I said sure. He took me to a nightclub without telling me and gave me alcohol, I drank and this girl came up to me and we started talking in the club. He was on the other side of the room seething in anger and later that night tried to rob me. When I realized the situation, I left the club and took an Uber home. After his failed attempt to rob me, the group chat was filled with constant threats against me and racist remarks. I decided at this point to leave the group and never look back. The guy who tried to rob me later attempted to break into my house at 4am and my mother called the police and he was placed on a criminal trespassing charge. Following the charge, as retribution he attempted to sue me in court for harassment however this did not go anywhere and the case was dismissed for insufficient evidence.\n\nThroughout my life I treated everyone as human beings not by their colors, it only made sense with ancestors from the civil rights movement. Thats the way I was raised and I care more about respect and character than the appearance of a person.\n\nI want to become a software engineer and applied for a Master\u2019s in Comp Sci program online. Hopefully I get in. In the meantime I\u2019m dealing with depression as I treat my vitamin and mineral deficiencies with supplements, when I feel better I plan to learn how to code everyday. It\u2019s basically code or die trying at this point, tech is the only thing I\u2019ve ever been interested in and cared about.",

    "selftext": "In march of 2023 when i was 19 i received a benefits affair of 10k from the government.\nIn holland Around 2014 the government taxed alot of parents for childcare. For invalid reasons. So in 2023 they paid back the children and parents who suffered. I grew up with a single mom who tried her best to make ends meet. She always told me to be careful about spending money since we didn\u2019t have much. I always had trouble managing the little money i had. So when i received the benefits affair i got really excited. The first few months i really saved alot and only spent 1-2k of the money. I wanted to save for my drivers license and the future. At the end of 2023 somebody told me about this escort site. I thought about it but let it fade quickly cause I wanted my first time to be special.\nFew months later i was failing school and had trouble passing my school and driving exams.\nAll of my friends where throwing their sexual lives in my face which made me insecure and they didn\u2019t know i was a 20 yr old virgin. I\u2019m good looking so i was told and in my life 2 girls approached me but i was too shy and insecure. I remembered the escort site and decided to go since i felt ashamed for being a virgin and im too shy and insecure for a relationship. I became addicted and in total i slept with 100+ i think. I spent all my money so i searched jobs and worked. On work a few colleagues were gambling on breaks and was making money. Since I didn\u2019t had much i thought i could make it through sports gambling wich seemed easy. I think you know how that went. I won like 500 and since then it went all bad. I quit my job cause of depression snd suicidal thoughts. I told my mom about the gambling and now im seeing a psychologist. Im still very depressed and worried about my future. I never had a relationship cause im afraid to get cheated on and get hurt. But i made some goals for myself like going back to school and doing social work maybe. Just wanted to vent. Thanks\n",

My friend insisted that I spend the night at the house of the colleague who organized the party. Then between 2 boys and 2 girls they put her in the room.\n\nWhen I wanted to go in to see it, they told me to stay outside, I insisted but the others pushed me and left me on the couch. It was very suspicious that they wouldn't let me in. I told another friend what happened and she told me to calm down that she would be fine. I listened to her and the party continued.\n\nWhen it was time to leave, I asked about my friend and the girl told me that she would stay with her and her boyfriend. I wasn't too sure about leaving her, but my other friend lived far away and asked me if I could accompany her, I went with her and I didn't hear from my friend until Monday. She arrived at the university normal, I told her that she was fine and she responded that yes, she seemed normal until on the way to the lockers I heard those from the party say \"she was so asleep that she didn't even realize, I took photos and videos of her\" you could hear the boys and girls who in theory were going to take care of her laughing.\n\n I told her what I heard and she went to confront them but they denied everything and apparently deleted all the photos and videos. She asked me if I heard correctly why I lied (I didn't). She stopped talking to me for a while because of these flyers telling her lies about me that maybe I did that.\n\nDays passed and I told a friend about it and with a slightly worried look she told me \"that's not new.\" She told me that at all the parties she went to they did that to her and then I understood why she told me that whenever she drank she lost consciousness and didn't remember anything. Those bastards forced her to drink on purpose.\n\nI was shocked, I didn't know what to say, but it was no use telling her since she wasn't going to believe me without proof and she also stopped talking to me a few days later, that happened a year ago, I haven't spoken to her since then, I'm not going to lie, I feel bad for her.\n\nSurely he will continue going to those \u201cparties\u201d and they will continue doing the same thing until he gets tired or bored.\n\nI'm not asking you for advice, I just want to show you that there are people who are so used to their lifestyle that you can't change them.",

We all know Ramadan is a holy month where sins, like physical relationships or other impure acts, are forbidden, and we\u2019re expected to focus on worship and purity. However, since Ramadan began, I\u2019ve been struggling intensely. I\u2019ve had to fight strong urges every single day. Not a day has passed without me watching explicit content or engaging in dirty talk with my male friends. Just a day before yesterday, I gave in to my desires and met up with a friend. We made out wildly and sloppily, with our bodies touching and pressing against each other. But as soon as I remembered I was fasting, I pushed him away and left. Since then, my urges have been uncontrollable, like they\u2019ve reached the peak of Everest. I apologized to the better part of myself, but today, I couldn\u2019t hold back anymore. My friend (who\u2019s also my ex) and I made a plan, met up, rented a hotel room, and just\u2026 we just fucked. And honestly, it was such a relief! I feel guilty because I was fasting during Ramadan, but the release was incredible. He held back for a while, and so did I, but it turned into one of the roughest and most passionate experiences I\u2019ve ever had. I don\u2019t know what people will think of me, and I might face criticism, but I did what I felt I had to do. I couldn\u2019t resist my urges.",

So basicly nobody is ever able to pronounce it right and i had a fair share of bullying while growing up because of it. It also turns any meeting with new people into an awkard situation. Something that should take a few seconds \"hi, i'm x, nice to meet you\" into either them struggling to get it right or, even worse, a whole conversation about the name. I'm an adult now so i don't mind it that much, and i don't meet new people that often, but i think it kind of scarred me, or at least surely added to my introversion and social awkwardness. \nLately i heard again some \"sales advice\" that says to call people by their name because everybody loves to hear their name.

    "selftext": "This happened 10 years ago, It was my fault, I shouldn't have snapped. It still eats me up from the inside every single day. If I could go back and do things differently, I would in a heartbeat. \n\nTen years ago, when I was 16 years old, this new kid started at school. I was really into Minecraft back then, and he was wearing a Minecraft t-shirt. I didn't have anyone to play with, so I approached him and tried to start a conversation. He was really hesitant and shy at first, but when I asked him about the shirt and complimented it, he lit up. We got to know each other a bit and planned to play together.\n\nWe played together for quite a few times and had fun, but eventually I got bored of the game and went outside with my friends instead. My friends didn't like him, so we never invited him; and that's when he started to get a little clingy, he would constantly keep asking to play and wouldn't take the hint if I said no. He had also asked our friend group if he could play outside with us quite a few times, and I didn't mind him and would have welcomed him, some people in the group didn't want him there, so I went along with it.\n\nHe started following me around a bit later and pestering me quite often. He would follow me around and talk about memes, YouTube videos, and Minecraft, often talking about it nonstop for up to 10 minutes without even giving me a chance to speak.. This kept going on for quite a while, and the whole time, I was getting more and more irritated, yet the more we spoke, the more I was getting irritated. I was too scared to back out of the conversation politely, which led to my irritation building up over time.\n\n*Then I had one bad day, which took away a life.*\n\nOne day, we were at the bus station, and he approached me and started chatting. At one point, all the anger built up over time inside me exploded, and I snapped and I told him:\n\n ***\"Just shut up! I was never your friend; we just played Minecraft together a few times. You are extremely annoying and nobody likes you\"***\n\nThe next day, the teacher sat us down and told us that he had committed suicide, my entire world shattered. I instantly knew that what I said caused this and that I had caused him to commit suicide.\n\nI was invited to the funeral, during which his parents spoke to me and revealed an extremely important detail about him. It turns out he was very autistic and had severe trouble making friends all his life, and he was obsessed with MC. When he met me and we played, he became really happy and wouldn't stop talking to his parents about how he finally made a good friend, they knew me as his best friend. \n\nThis shattered my world, I didn't know he was autistic and considered me his only friend, I didn't realise how important our sessions playing together were for him.  But that doesn't justify what I did, I should have never said that. I still can't play Minecraft after a decade.\n\nToday is the 10th anniversary of his death, and I needed to post his because it should have been me, not him.",

When I got out of it they all were on the hill with me but even though it was dark, there was a bright light as a stage projector above the river that apparently only I could see. It was so clear that even the trees had shadows behind them n could see persons faces. Anyway, I started having an uneasy feeling that I kept looking around confused (I'm not used to not being in my head all the time), felt like unending deja vu that I tried to escape so I wouldn't experience that horrible feeling again. Everywhere I looked I looked there before, could hear myself swallowing and people's footsteps. Kept repeating the same words like- this is a nightmare. Was being decisive whether to go towards the light or with them. Tried resisting the spotlight but it was PULLING me like a moth to a flame. Think I went through 5 stages of acceptance or grief and the last stage I accepted that I was in the backrooms and that there's no way out of them so I laid down on the ground hoping I'll get out. They dragged me to lay against a tree where, at the moment I laid down, I couldn't move couldn't feel my body could hear myself swallowing, but still heard them talking and stressing what to do. The 5 minute coma felt like not knowing anything about time anymore, about years. What I was seeing were \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udcc8 these lines that go up n down all the time like in hospitals and lie detectors, and in my head I thought this what life is, you follow the lines and think. Think so long about living, that you go into and fuse those thoughts and memories so it feels real. Then gained consciousness a little bit and got stood up, tried to think what I did that day to this point so I could snap out of it. Once I was almost out, the light came back into me, when it did, I regained my hearing just like when u wake up and opened my eyes. It was so relieving to be back in my body.\n\nThey said I could've drowned if didn't stop me.\n\nFound out it was marijuana and that it alters your perception of time.\n\nIt couldn't be laced cause everyone smoked and my head had just never been right.\n\nWhat I'm most curious about is the light.",

The reality is I'm actually right side dominant, and the true reason I use my phone left handed is that I watched concerning amounts of porn when I was in middle school which lead to me developing my left hands proformance for scrolling. As for my wallet, it just feels more natural and it frees up my dominant hand to use my card and type on the pin pad without having to fumble my wallet around, I just hold it in my left hand while I pay and when I'm done it frees up my right hand to grab my items while also putting my wallet back in my pocket.",

    "selftext": "THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING PLEASE OMG I JUST NEED TO SAY THIS OR ELSE I WILL DIE INTERNALLY.\n\nI (20F) was with my friend as he went to an open audition for a acting company. The way we got there was via bus...... we both don't have a car. The place where the auditions were being held was in a town I was super unfamiliar with, like SUPER unfamiliar. Anyways, as my friend went into the audition room, I, of course, wasn't allowed in since I wasn't auditioning.. I needed to pee *SO bad.* the closest bathroom was across a MASSIVE FIELD (One of those park field things that have bathrooms on the opposite side),, I speedwalked with a full bladder, only to find out the bathroom had a gate that was locked with a fucking chain and fat lock (it was 12pm on a Thursday????). So I walked back across this massive field, full bladder. THERE IS NO BATHROOM ANYWHERE. NO BUILDINGS. NO FRIENDLY LOOKING HOUSES. I pissed my pants and ended up pulling my pants down to piss against a tree... ass to tree btw........  \nI have never felt so disgusting and shameful in my LIFE. I also, have never peed my pants in public before. I seriously thought I'd be able to hold it in, I've made fun of multiple people for their 'pissing my pants' story, so I guess karma hits hard. After absolutely soaking my pants and shoes, I knew I had to get home ASAP. My phone was dead, and it had BEEN dead for the past DAY. I was staying the week at my friends house and halfway through the week my phone gave up on me, meaning, I was fully dependent  on my friend and *his* phone. I happened to cross paths with a very kind lady (F maybe 26?) and decided to explain how my phone wasn't working and how I didn't know where tf I was. She then invited me into her car and offered to drive me home, I never told her I had pissed my pants. I sat in her car, slowly soaking her car seat in my piss. Oh and guess what, I came home to realize I was on my period. So not only was my piss on her car seat.... my period blood too. I *would* tell you the cover up story I told everyone to protect my shame, but, I'm so scared that they'll somehow see this. I'm so embarrassed.\n\nTLDR;; I pissed my pants in a field/park, located in an area I didn't know. My phone was dead and I had to ask a random lady to take me home, I proceeded to sit in her car with my piss pants whilst she was oblivious of my accident. Came home to find I was on my period. Piss and period blood, embedded into her car seat.\n\nLife Lesson;;; ALWAYS PEE BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE HOUSE. EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU DON'T NEED TO. EVEN. IF. YOU. DON'T. THINK. YOU. NEED. TO.",
