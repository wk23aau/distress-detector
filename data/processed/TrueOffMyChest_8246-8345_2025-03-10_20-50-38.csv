1j52twe,road to recovery,i have been struggling with depression and bipolar for years but being back with loved ones family friends and lover made me realize how loved i am. there has been some added responsibilities and i learned how to be more compassionate and empathetic after 10 years of living abroad. some years alone. i dont believe life gets better before. now i discovered that it does get better but not in a typical way where suddenly your career health relationships would work out at the same time. there will be some tests that would drive me insane but i knew i would pull through. maybe when im 40 i would be back to square one but the lesson i learned before will always be relevant.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 18:49:00 UTC,1,0,0.99,,positive,0,0
1j52tul,i think i was raped and still have problems to process it,writing from a throwaway. three days ago i met a guy. he found me on social media and we talked on the phone for a few days. he seemed easygoing and respectful so when he asked if i wanted to meet for a cigarette not at my place just somewhere outside in the neighborhood. when he arrived we sat outside and talked for a bit. then he suggested going to a nearby hotel. only if i wanted to of course but it was cold and dark and he said we could just sit inside have a drink and talk. he promised he wouldnt try anything that he didnt want to be intimate either. he seemed harmless trustworthy even. so i agreed telling him i only had two hours anyway. at first he was still friendly. but as time passed he started acting off. i kept my distance positioning myself in a way that made it clear i wasnt comfortable with any physical closeness. then he went to the bathroom. when he came back he was only in his boxers. i told him to put his clothes back on and that i was leaving. that was the moment i felt truly unsafe. i got up heading for the door when he grabbed me by my ponytail and pulled me to the floor. i fought as hard as i could but he knew exactly how to overpower me. at first he didnt rape me he enjoyed me fighting back. he hit me yanked my hair and choked me so hard i couldnt even make a sound. he threw me all over the room. my body is covered in bruises even on my throat. and then at some point he raped me. i pleaded for him to stop but he just threatened me over and over again. eventually my phone rang. i saw my chance and told him i had to answer it that my friend would be suspicious if i didnt call her back immediately and that she had my location she didnt and it wasnt a friend calling i was lying. i told him id just meet her quickly and then come back. he let me go and i left. if this had happened to someone else i would never blame them. but standing in my own shoes i cant stop thinking what the fuck is wrong with me? who goes to a hotel with a guy they just met? im almost 30. i should know better. i should have learned my lesson by now. but i dont feel scared. i dont feel sad. i dont even feel vulnerable. and that makes it hard to process what actually happened to me.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 18:48:58 UTC,0,1,0.5,,content warning sexual assault,0,0

1j52ns5,my best friend told my biggest secret,i 19m am bisexual. about two years ago i fell in love with my best friend t now 19m. i knew he wasnt into men so i triedand succeededin getting over it. however one night while i was drunk he was taking me home and i confessed. i told him that i had been in love with him but that i wasnt anymore. i apologized sincerely and explained that i just felt he had a right to know. naturally he was uncomfortable but we agreed to try and maintain our friendship. things were never quite the same but we remained close. i made every effort to respect his boundaries and avoid making him uncomfortable. i also felt guilty as if i had hurt him and ruined our friendship. though he never explicitly said so that was the impression i got. whenever i asked he insisted that everything was fine. about a year and a half after that due to circumstances beyond our control we had to sleep in the same bed. i asked if he was okay with it or if we should switch rooms and he said it was fine. still i did my best to stay on my side of the bed so he wouldnt feel uncomfortable. unfortunately at some point during the night i rolled over onto his arm in my sleep. he woke me up and asked me to move. the next night he decided to sleep in a different room saying it was because of the bed. i thought that was an excuse but i didnt press himhe had every right to make that choice. instead he slept in a room with two of our female friends a 19f and k 18f. after that things mostly returned to normal except i noticed that a and k became more aggressive toward t. fast forward to about a month ago i was out for coffee with a and we were discussing t. he had made an awful joke toward k and i was defending him when a suddenly said she had to tell me something. she revealed that on the night he changed rooms he had told them about what happened. he told them i had feelings for him that he constantly felt uncomfortable around me and even outed me as bisexual i am closeted because i live in a very homophobic country. he also told them that he couldnt wait to work abroad for the summer so he could get a break from me. at first i didnt want to believe her but she knew details only he and i had discussed and i was sure i hadnt told her. a said they hadnt told me sooner because they thought i wouldnt believe them. i was crushed. i confronted t over the phone but he claimed he didnt remember anything from that night and insisted a and k were just trying to ruin our friendship. were meeting for drinks in a few days to talk facetoface and hopefully resolve things. i dont know what to think. everything points to him betraying me and his excuse isnt convincingbut i dont want to believe it. any advice would be welcome.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 18:41:54 UTC,5,6,0.73,,,0,0

1j5297d,trueoffmychest my sister is getting adopted by my step dad today and im not happy about it.,!no names are real names! for some context let me start by explains my family tree and giving some history. i 20 female am the oldest child. my parent well call them bob and lynda not real names had three kids me and a set of boygirl twins east and brook. then my mom cheated and got with a guy tony and had two half brothers timmy and tommy. she then cheated again with a new guy bret who was also cheating on his wife. he had two kids with his ex wife kat and sam my now step sisters. and my mom lynda and bret had two more kids spike and leo. meanwhile my dad and step mom molly had one daughter katie. so theres 9 kids total with my mom in order its me east and brook kat timmy tommy sam spike leo. my parents had 5050 custody of us given to them by the court. my dad tried reporting my mom for abuse and the court did nothing about it. its very pro mommy where we live. my mom lynda and bret are very abusive parents. they used to to things like hit us throw us outside make us stand on chairs for hours on end without being able to get down put shock collars on us and starve us. i remember once that i missed a spot mopping the floor and they made me use my toothbrush to clean it no i didnt get a new one. we were also very low income but my mom and bret always found a way to take trips to disney and have expensive date nights. them being out often left me home alone with kids for hours if not days at a time. this went on from the time i was 1116. at 16 i finally said enough was enough and made the decision to live with my dad. i got thearapy and have been doing much better. its been 4 years since i left. i have tried to fix things with my mom and bret multiple times but my mom always falls short and blames me for leaving instead of herself for her actions. however when i left to stay with my dad my sister brook chose to stay with my mom without giving anyone an explanation. my dad wasnt bad to her but they where never close. my sister brook is my moms golden child her favorite and her mini. my sister was a snake my whole childhood and could get away with murder. so she left my dad and never looked back. well this year she turned 18 and on her birthday my mom had posted a video of her asking my step dad to adopt her and today was the day of her adoption. i found out through my moms ex baby daddy tony that she was being adopted because timmy messaged him about being taken out of school to witness it. he shared the messages with me and then i shared them to my step mom and other family. not my dad because in these 4 years he has been grieving my sister leaving and finding this out will only hurt more.im devastated for my dad and have left it up to my step mom to tell him. i just cannot understand what there thoughts are and why my sister has done any of what shes done in the last 4 years but i cannot say im happy for her. but i wanted to get this out and i just needed to vent it somewhere. i guess in the 4 years ive been gone ive really been holding in a lot of what happened to me and still cannot find it in myself to let go or forgive them. thank you reddit for listening.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 18:25:22 UTC,1,5,1.0,,,0,0

1j52025,i think im going through withdrawal,lately facebook has been making me super depressed so my boyfriend suggested we try to go a full week without checking facebook. its actually been great the first few days were hard but now i dont even really care about checking facebook. on a conscious level i feel like not being on facebook is great. but i also noticed on tuesday that i was feeling really low and didnt know why. same yesterday and today is even worse. it occurred to me that my brain isnt getting its usual constant dopamine supply throughout the day from checking facebook and seeing that i have notifications or new info to read even if it turns out to be nothing interesting. i know that social media is engineered to give you a hit of dopamine with every notification to keep you engaged and coming back for more. and im starting to think my brain is literally addicted and im going through withdrawal. im actually really proud of myself and given how awful i feel right now i feel even more resolve to break this addiction and not go back to how i was. but man i feel like shit. i just feel so depressed and want to do nothing but sleep. i keep wanting snacks even though im not hungry and i think thats my brain desperately seeking other sources of dopamine. this sucks. i really hate feeling this way and i hate what social media has done to my brain.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 18:14:46 UTC,0,0,0.33,,,0,0

1j503q8,i broke up with my girlfriend last night and its killing me on the inside.,first post here and from phone so apologies if theres poor formatting. also not sure if this is the right platform but turning to here as i need to get this out of my system. as the title says i 21m ended things off with my girlfriend 21f last night and i feel awful. i had initially thought that i would feel relieved but its tearing me apart. she was my first. we were together for 2 years and all of 5 mins it was just gone. took everything in me to not lose it on the train ride home. even though i initiated it i hate myself for what hurt it has caused her and i havent been able to sleep or eat well. its really harder than i had imagined. of course with any relationship there were low moments but there were also some of the highest highs and i was so blessed to be with her. i broke things off because i havent been in a good place recently and i didnt want to bleed on her due to whatever circumstances i may have. in hindsight this was immature thinking as i chose the easy way out and im now dealing with immeasurable amounts of pain as a consequence. today at work the events from the previous night replayed in my head over and over. i said what i had wanted to say but something still didnt feel right. thing is i do not think this is a take time to heal situation. part of me feels like it was poor judgement to not fight off my thoughts of leaving. i really miss her terribly. not looking for any sympathy here. just wanted to pen down my thoughts that clearly arent very cohesive with no fear of judgement. if youre reading this thank you for everything. im sorry for the small things we bickered about that escalated unnecessarily. thank you for our fun dates that brought me so much joy. im sorry for all the tears you shed because of me and my actions. thank you for the past two years.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 16:57:17 UTC,5,4,0.73,,,0,0
1j4zka7,ive been selfprescribing my adhd with crystal meth for little over a year now and its changing my life.,in my younger years ive struggled with drugs. ive done everything you can think of but the only drug that scared me to my core was meth. the first time i smoked it my brain said this is what youve been looking for your whole life so i was a functional meth addict for 3 years would go on weeklong benders every 45 months then i quit cold turkey with all substances for 5 years started getting muscular at the gym got my life stable and manageable. now i own my own landscaping company and i flip homes life is good. but it was getting overwhelming. the paperwork that comes with selfemployment is the bane of my existence. especially because i was diagnosed with severe adhd as a child. so about a year and a half ago i went to my doctor to get diagnosed again so i can get prescribed some kind of medication. i knew i was going to need something to keep my business growing without completely crumbling it under my lack of focus. i went through the long process and got denied because by divine providence i smoked weed for the first time in years about 5 days prior. i was infuriated. so i finally said fuck it and looked up old contacts and bought 3 grams of meth the next day. i still remember holding that bag like i was sméagol with the one ring lol. the deep whisper that calls to all addicts beckoned me to go all in to smoke that shit right up. but by that point i had already realized the simple joy of living a true peaceful life and i knew i would throw it all away if i started back up again. i bought a milligram scale and started off with 25 milligrams. the realization of seeing what 25 milligrams of meth looked like made me understand the sheer power of amphetamines. for years people were smoking grams of this shit. consuming it like candy yet all you ever need is a crystal the size of a grain of sand. i put them into individual pill cases and started to take one a day. if i havent taken a dose before 10am then i would skip taking it altogether. ive tried adderall in high school from friends and i really enjoyed how it made me focus meth felt cleaner more aggressive. over time i started to remember my appointments without having to write them down. my sleep schedule became predictable as i never sleep during the day anymore. and my willingness to work harder is becoming effortless. sex is always amazing and i stopped drinking again because ive become sociable without the need for alcohol. the best thing that has happened is that im more aggressive with business negotiations. im less nervous and im not afraid to assert my dominance when i feel it is necessary. now i can never think of ever smoking this stuff again. i know im the exception and im not telling you to use drugs. meth is powerful and will destroy your life before you realize whats going on. but i just needed to tell someone. ask me anything you want. btw i still havent finished the 3 grams i first purchased a year ago. itll probably last me another year before i have to go back out on the streets for more.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 16:34:54 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j4yx7b,the cp case against my ex husband has been closed and i dont know how to feel about it,in the beginning of the year my 27f ex husband 27m came to me after not talking for a year since the divorce finalized to confess to me of having sexual fantasies about children and looking at cp while we were together. i took this information to the police and have been working with an investigator since then and made a controlled call to him with the investigator where he confessed only to looking at animated cp because the real stuff is really hard to find. today i was told that they spoke with him and looked at his devices and havent found any evidence and are closing the case. and its a relief that to the best of my knowledge he didnt hurt any children or consume any content that hurt actual children. but i was also warming up to the idea that he would face some kind of consequences for his actions. because he also emotionally manipulated and raped me throughout our entire marriage. i know that i could still try to press charges for what he did to me but i dont really have any proof except for my own words. and i want to be able to just move on and enjoy my life now that im free from him. but he has a new girlfriend who is significantly younger and reminds me of me when i was young and fell for his bullshit. it feels so wrong that he can just do all of this and put me through so much and have nothing happen. i hope hes telling the truth about getting help and wanting to change but i also cant help but believe that every word that comes out of his mouth is a lie even when he believes its the truth. but ive done what i can it cant be my responsibility anymore.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 16:07:52 UTC,32,10,0.82,,,0,0
1j4ypt0,the girl best friend is always the issue,i 20f just went through my boyfriend 21m of seven months phone for the first time. i have my face in his phone and hes told me multiple times that i can. however what i found has hurt me and hit my confidence in myself and my relationship. i know that some girls have felt it too that little nagging feeling that something is wrong. when i looked i went straight for the girl best friend. and that is exactly where i found messages between them sexting. it was about a year ago at this point that these messages were sent however they were saved in chat. he is still best friends with this girl and did not tell me about this because he said that he didnt wanna lose her. to give a little context i have been cheated on with the girl best friend before twice. so this immediately raised some red flags for me. to top it off too recently the amount of times we are intimate has severely decreasedonce a week or sometimes less i cried for a bit and then i woke him up to talk to him about it. he apologized and i was very mature and tried not to let my jealousy show. i told him its ok that he is still friends with her. i just wish she had told me. however a couple days later here we are i cant stop thinking about it and how shes everything im not. shes skinny with blonde hair he sexted with her and never does with me and he seemed to be way more attracted to her than me. i cant help but overthink and be jealous. edit thank you for all of the advice. i talked to my boyfriend and we have started to work it out and set some boundaries so we can move forward. i am a firm believer of not having friends of the opposite sex but i also would never want to make him choose between us. he is an amazing guy and hopefully this just ends up being something we look back on. we have some growing to do of course were young and new to this relationship but we want to work it out together. to clear some things up no he did not cheat just saying i have experience that issue with girl best friends in the past and saying that i invaded is privacy is wrong. he put my face in him phone and told me i can look through it if i needed to. yes im crazy jealous yeah i have some self doubt but i was just venting about something that was bothering me so then i could put words to paper and evaluate how i wanted to go about handling this. just want to remind some people that everyone is different along with their relationships. i hope you have the day you deserve lt3,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 15:59:29 UTC,53,89,0.72,,,0,0
1j4xfoh,i overheard one of the funniest conversations ever and i cant stop laughing,not an english speaker. so im actually walking back home from the park where i was and i cant stop smiling and laughing alone like a crazy person. so after a long walk i stopped in a bar in the park and ordered a coffe and sitted outside thinking and thinking. after like 5 minutes i heard a couple starting to argue pretty loudly. i dont know who they are but just listened a bit. they were arguing about a possible break up after he caught her kissing another guy and she wasnt apologetic or something like this but was arguing back that everyone make mistakes and after 3 years of relathionship for her this wasnt a major reason to break up cause she was drunk and dont remember anything about it. im gonna say the exact piece of conversation that i heard her are you serious? you wanna break up with me for a kiss that didnt meant anything? are you insane? him of course what else would you expect? me cheering you up for another? or maybe more? her but this insane its not cheating. it was just a kiss when i was drunk. it meant nothing him to you maybe not but to me yes. its called taking responsabilities of our own actions. i cant believe im even here to argue about this her me too cause this insane it was just a damn kiss while i was drunk that meant nothing him well this ends here im tired of you and your excuses her you know right that if you break up with me you will never find anyone like me right? him well honestly i hope so pause and then she do you think you are funny? should i laugh? him do what you want but i really hope to never find someone like you her i was way out of your league anyway so its your loss and not mine him whatever you say ex gf now i wanna go home and text your sister. she is hell hotter than you her dont you dare. i will ruin you if you only try him well this is funny cause a few days ago she texted me first so lets see how things goes. believe me i almost chocked myself from not laughing at this. i just love this things and this little conversation made my day ahahah.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 15:03:35 UTC,1128,32,0.92,,,0,0
1j4xeie,preparing to end things,since november i had a plan that if things turned out a certain way that i would most likely end my life. however i have been trying to find things to keep me going. to survive out of spike at least. however if i lose access to my disability income that will be the last straw for me. i am hoarding pills away making sure i have enough just in case i end up losing everything i need to survive. every day i live as a survivor. every day i try to find reasons to hang on. however i also feel like i need an exit plan now. no one is going to save me except for myself. however i can only do so much with my chronic pain conditions and my health. i cannot work full time. i hope my parents are proud for what they wanted out of things here. at the expense of their only daughter.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 15:02:10 UTC,0,1,0.5,,,0,0

1j4xbz7,my wifes family are a bunch of ungrateful aoles.,tldr wifes family felt entitled to my money to help with their mothers retirement and none of them have ever expressed one word of gratitude. not looking for advice just venting. backstory im 65m wife is 61f. married 36 years. wife has three siblings one older brother one older sister one younger sister. we were very close with all of her siblings and their spouses for many years we went on dozens of vacations with all of them always had gatherings at holidays spent weekends at each others homes etc. her brother and i were as close as we could be always hanging out playing music and having a great time. i loved him more than my own brothers. he began to hate me in 2020 because i had the gall to disagree with his political views. when he found out i voted for biden he screamed at me were fucking done at a family gathering. hes barely said two words to me since then. her older sister and her husband have had a simmering illwill towards my wife and i for many years. back in the 80s and 90s i was earning great money and we used to take them and their kids on vacations that were 99 percent paid by me because they didnt have two nickels to rub together. if we bought a new piece of furniture or tv or whatever we would offer them our barely used stuff for free which they seemingly gladly accepted. we did these things because we loved them. evidently they took our generosity as treating them like a charity case. now that they are both in highearning careers and dont need anything from us they basically hate us for treating them that way and now simply look down their noses sneer and snub us. her younger sister and her husband have always been good christians but have become more fervent evangelical southern baptist over the years. i made the mistake of having a discussion about religious beliefs i am an atheist with the husband several years ago. i know a thousand times more about his holy bible than he does and the discussion did not go well for him. ever since then they have done their best to ostracize us from the family at every opportunity. fast forward my wifes 80yearold father passed away a couple of years ago leaving his wife my mil also 80 widowed. they relied almost exclusively on social security for their retirement income. after his death there was a shortfall in the mils monthly ss income. my wifes three siblings had a meeting and decided that the shortfall would be made up by the four siblings split evenly. each share came to 2500 annually to make up the mils shortfall. all three of the other couples are fairly wealthy with annual incomes in the 250350k range and all have 401k accounts over 1 million which they brag about. my wife does not work. i own a small business which has slowed dramatically since covid i make around 75k in a good year. i would like to retire at some point so i am trying to save every dollar that i can in order to do so. i will rely heavily on social security for retirement income. the long and short of it is that i had to funnel 2500 per year into mils retirement needs that would have otherwise gone towards my own retirement savings. the way the siblings view it is your money is your wifes money therefore she needs to chip in to help her mom. fortunately two years into that arrangement the mil sold her house she moved in with one of the siblings and netted around 200k. she told my wife that with that money plus her ss income and the 50000 she already had in savings i would no longer need to contribute to her income especially since her expenses were now basically zero. so thankfully i only had to donate 5000 of my retirement money to the mil. the shitty part is that not one of the siblings or the mil have ever expressed one word of thanks or gratitude to me even though they are well aware that the money we contributed came 100 from my earnings. we still have to see them every now and then at weddings or funerals or whatever and they have never even acknowledged my contribution and sacrifice. their sense of entitlement is appalling especially in light of the fact that they all have a great disdain for me and consider me to be their asshole brotherinlaw.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 14:59:10 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j4ww33,my ex cheated on me multiple times used me for money and still wont leave me alone,i dont even know where to start but i need to get this off my chest. my ex 26f and i 26m were together for a long time and have a 4yearold son together. i was completely loyal to her but she put me through hell. before we were evicted from our home last year she was already actively cheating on mefirst with a guy named liam. she would stay at his place while i was home taking care of our two stepkids 5 and 8 and our son 4. i was struggling financially because she was out drinking all the time with her friends spending money we didnt have while i stayed home looking after the kids. then in december 2022 she started cheating on me with a different guymark. she promised over and over that shed stop but she never did. we ended up getting evicted in april 2023 and she moved in with her brother. i was staying elsewhere and she had our son and her two kids. during this time she kept lying to me about where she was living. she said she was at her brothers but in reality she had secretly moved in with mark. i found out when i logged into her accountsyeah i know i shouldnt have but it was the only way to get the truth because she compulsively lies. she was living at her brothers for a couple months then after the wedding she moved in with him she even took mark to her sisters wedding bought him clothes for it and kept telling me we were going to fix things. she made dozens of promisessaying shed visit me with the kids bake me cakes buy me giftsbut she never showed. even after i found out everything in october she still asked me for money in december saying mark wouldnt help her. and i gave it to her like an idiot. in total ive given her around 3000 because she made it seem like wed work things out. i even paid for the carpets in her new house because she told me shed cut mark off once she moved. but now i know that was just another lie. throughout all of last summer she was constantly gaslighting me. i caught her sending nudes to mark while playing stardew valley with him late at night while i was asleep. shed go out every night with him and whenever i confronted her shed call me crazy and make me feel like i was the one in the wrong. at one point she and mark even tried to get me to be friends with himwe all played games together and i had no idea what was actually going on behind my back. even now when i ignore her she acts upset and says theres still something there. but all she ever does is use me. she sends me explicit pictures and videos while claiming she just wants to be friends. and when i tell her shes confusing me she shuts down the conversation because its too stressful for her. meanwhile ive been the one supporting her giving her money and being there for her when she needed help. i also hate her friend emily because she covered for her constantly. shes cousins with mark and was helping her lie to me the whole time. one of the worst moments was when i visited her brothers place while she was staying there. i found used tissues under the bed and she swore up and down they werent what i thought they werebut come on it was obvious. it was disgusting. and yet she still called me crazy. she actually made out they were snot cause she had a cold but there was like 50 tissues under the bed lmao whenever i ask her what she wants she just says i dont know. i need to live alone and figure things out because im not well mentally or physically. but if that were true why is she still stringing me along keeping me as a backup plan while shes with him? she tells me im stalkative and that im the bad guy but i only ever found out the truth by logging into her stuffbecause without doing that id still be believing her lies. i know i shouldve just walked away but i love her. i actually cared. maybe im just too nice or maybe im an idiot. but a part of me always thought this was just a rough patch that we could fix things and go back to how we were before all of this. maybe shes sick mentally or maybe shes just a terrible person. i dont know. the one thing i do know is i feel used betrayed and like ive wasted so much time and money on someone who never really cared about me the same way. and the worst part? she still wants me to keep all of this quiet. at this point i feel like i should just tell mark everything and ruin things for her because i dont think its fair that after everything she got it all. this is actually typed by me like im currently on my parents sofa i barely see my son i keep trying to find private or council places but im getting nowhere. my depression is genuinely awful like i feel like after everything i have nothing ive just lost it all and no matter how much i try it wont get better. i used to be depressed at uni even tried to kill myself on my birthday but my flat mates actually got me a birthday cake and stuff and it put me off for a bit like it was genuinely heartbreaking. thing is my credit score is completely fucked as well cause i let her use my credit card and my very account and stuff and my credit score is tanked to hell because of it. like i am genuinely screwed and its like trying to claw myself out of quicksand struggling is just making me sink further into it. i dont know what do you guys think? is there a chance do i give an ultimatum or just do i give into everything ive ran this through chatgpt because originally i was just trying to get this off my chest through it and get some advice but i figured here would be a good place to get some human advice and itd help get rid of all the identifying details if anything doesnt make sense just comment it and ill elaborate on it cause ive noticed a few details are wrong but i mostly wanted to get it off my chest anyway,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 14:38:38 UTC,2,16,0.63,,,0,0
1j4wh50,got committed to an insane asylum,throwaway account. sorry if the story is too long because the details are a bit fresh. i have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for a couple of years. i am finishing up university but since i major in humanities my career prospects seem bleak. also i had problems with with uni so i had to repeat a few semesters. both of these things are a source of my anxiety and depression. i have friends and family members but not a significant other or a person with whom i can talk about my problems. for the past several months i have been looking for a job without too much success. at the same time i was trying to find help for my depression insecurities and suicidal thoughts. since im broke and cannot afford a therapist i found an organization that offers free counseling. after filling out their application they told me i should go to the hospital because they are not qualified to handle patients experiencing suicidal thoughts. i had my reservations about doing that since public healthcare especially regarding mental health albeit free is pretty bad in my country. fast forward one month i managed to get two job offers one in a translation company which is a 9 to 5 and an evening teaching job. i was pretty excited about the success in getting not one but two job offers so i decided to take it easy and not exaust myself with work. i thought that the best course of action for me was to start doing both jobs until i figured out which one i liked more so i could focus on that job or even quit the other one. monday was my first day on the translation job. in short it went pretty horribly. the translation job turned out to be a regular office job where i had to scan documents and edit word files and it did not involve any sort of translation or useful skill that could help me further my career. bear in mind i have had several translation jobs and i am not a complete beginner. after coming back home i just started crying and felt desperate because that unpleasant experience on my first day on the job brought up all my repressed emotions to the surface uncertainty about my career loneliness and the fact that all people my age have accomplished something in their lives except me. therefore i gathered my courage and took a taxi to the hospital hoping to find a therapist with whom i can talk about my problems. i went to the er and talked to the nurse working at the reception who was very compassionate and patient. then she led me to talk to a psychiatrist who after listening to my woes politely informed me that i would be transferred to a psychiatric hospital or a mental asylum if you like since the hospital is full and they cant take me. he also told me that i should not try and leave the hospital otherwise they would be required by law to call the police since i said that i sufferred from suicidal thoughts. then i waited for two hours until the ambulance arrived and an ambulance crew member escorted me to the car holding me by my arm so that i would not try to escape completely ignoring the fact that i came looking for help and did not try to hurt myself. fast forward to the insane asylum i was interviewd by a middleaged psychiatrist who gave an impression as if he wanted to be literally anywhere else but in that room talking to me. after the interview he told me that i would have to be committed either involumtarily which would last for 48 hours or voluntarily in which case i would have to talk to a different doctor and stay in the insane asylum until she decided what is to be done with me. i tried patiently explaining to the psychiatrist that i only wanted to find help for my anxiety and suicidal thoughts and that i did not want to be committed to this institution. moreover i stressed that my emotional issues are connected to my career and that i had to go to work on the following day. i tried reasoning that missing the second day of my job and possibly losing both of the job offers is hardly productive for my mental health. he shrugged it off saying that it wasnt the end of the world. the nurses then marched me off to the psych ward gave me different clothes and showed me to my room. the room had three beds and the furthermost one from the door had a heavilysedated patient whose arms and legs were tied to the bed. the nurse in all seriousness even asked me if i would prefer to sleep next to the sedated patient or i would choose the first bed. the lights went out and i took the sleeping pills that the nurse offered and slept peacefully... until at least my roommate woke from his sedativeinduced stupor and started cursing swearing and yelling at the top of his lungs demanding to be released from the restraints. two days have passed since then. i have not showered brushed my teeth or shaved since i wasnt prepared to be committed to an insane asylum and had not prepared any of my things when i initially went to the hospital to get help. a lot of thoughts have gone through my mind in the past few days so i hoped that writing it all down and sharing with strangers would help me make some sense of it. tldr tried to ask for help and find a therapist. got committed to an insane asylum instead.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 14:19:35 UTC,1,2,0.67,,,0,0

1j4vn9k,i cant feel anything and its weird,im 27m and life is so weird to me. i see people seemingly caring and loving each other but i struggle to feel that at all for anyone. i know my parents and family love me and i had a great environment growing up. but im just... detached. like i gained the ability to cry on command to feign sadness when something bad happens but in reality i dont feel anything at all. when my mother died i know i was supposed to feel sad. i know i was supposed to love her as she did me very much... but i failed at both. i really tried. ive had relationships in the past where my partners would tell me they love me but i couldnt feel the same way. they treated me amazing and i try my best to be a good partner but i could never get attached to someone or care for someone in that way. i know it sounds cruel but i just cant seem to love anyone nor care for anyone no matter how hard i try. i find it hard to feel what others feel. for example when my friends dad died i knew i needed to feel sad but i just didnt. i didnt understand what he was feeling so i just tried my best to be there for him and take care of him. even though i couldnt relate to him at all. its just i know this is the action that should be done but i have no emotions attached to it. when i got a perfect gpa in college and my cousin who was in the same college as me in the same course did worse i knew she didnt feel good but i cant describe what that would feel like if that makes sense. i mean ive been bad or failed at things before and i just felt indifferent. so when my family was praising me and comforting my cousin i was so confused because i had to feign being happy and sad at the same time. its so frustrating because i want to feel for people but i cant look at people as anything else other than just... people. i cant relate to their struggles even though i try. i know im supposed to but i cant. ive been acting this whole time but i have no idea whats wrong. i know how im supposed to feel but i cant feel it. everything is just monotone for me and things that happen just happen. i know what emotions are and its so hard for me to feel them or relate to anyone elses. idk i just wanted to put it out there and maybe find out whats wrong with me...,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 13:39:02 UTC,2,3,1.0,,,0,0
1j4vi0l,im a male escort and i have a crush on my client part 2? tiny update on my plan and back story,i just want to say thank you for all the replies. honestly its really opened my eyes. i think i was very lost in my feelings and i truly appreciate everyone encouraging me to go for it as well as those who reminded me to be careful and respect her boundaries. thats really important to me. the last thing i want to do is make her feel uncomfortable or like ive overstepped so i want to be very mindful of that. i also just want to say thank you for all your love and support. im a bit shocked. you guys are incredible people. someone suggested a book for me to read and someone else suggested that i heal... yes. i do think this is the crux of the matter. thank you for that. i looked into the book and honestly i think its exactly my current experience. i got a lot of dms asking for my personal experience and also how to become a male escort. i thought id give a tiny update on what i plan to do and then my story in case people might be interested. sorry of its long and jumbled. ive only ever really spoken about some of these things with my current client. okay so my idea i dont know if its going to work but i think it allows me to put the idea there in a careful way. based on how she reacts i might then make the decision to drop her as a client because i dont think this situation is healthy for me. some people have pointed out that this isnt a great way to do business as an escort and i completely agree. honestly if im being real i dont think im a good escort anyway grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes businesses wise. so heres my plan. my birthday is later this month and theres a company in our area that specializes in theatrical productions. they have a live performance at a restaurant where you get dinner and a show all in one. from what she and i have talked about this is exactly the kind of thing she values. she loves theater singing opera shes very cultured in that way. and its something that appeals to me too for my own reasons which ill write in my back story in case someone is interested. she also knows this is something personally meaningful to me. so im going to buy two tickets but i wont invite her outright. instead ill reach out and jokingly reference the terms of the boyfriend experience she paid for something like you know technically part of the package is me checking in on you and i havent heard from you in a while haha. depending on how she responds i might then say something like i was actually given two tickets to this event but i dont have anyone who would really appreciate it. would you maybe want to come with me? she knows thats true. i really dont have anyone else for something like this. the reason i thought this might be a good approach is because a lot of people pointed out that her paying puts her in control of the dynamic which i completely agree with. but in this scenario theres a disconnect from that. its something separate... what do you think? heres my story i grew up in a small rural town close to where i currently am. my home life wasnt ideal a bit of a mix of financial instability and neglect. i didnt finish school and by the time i was around 16 i was doing odd jobs mainly in auto repair. i learned from the older men in town working informally in backyard garages. i guess i figured this would be my future. everyone in this town was kind of like that. grew up there. married someone who lived there. never left... everyone has dated everyone kind of thing. i was never really interested in dating. there was a girl a bit older who only showed up on weekends and during school holidays. she was visiting from somewhere bigger. she went to school in the city. we werent close or anything but just knowing someone like that existed that could... leave the town? i dont know. i think it gave me hope or something. later on i got an opportunity to work as a farm laborer in the area. the farmer was an older man past retirement age but still running around and working. he had a wife and two adult children. i was fixing fences and machinery driving tractors hauling feed digging in the dirt with spades but eventually the farmer saw i dont know potential? in me. he gave me more responsibilities and a few years later i had some kind of a foreman role. one day i was about to go into the farmers office when i overheard him and his son talking about me. i ended up eavesdropping probably shouldnt have but i did. his son is more 10 years older than me im not exactly how much older and he was basically saying that me and my whole family were low class. and honestly? it hurt. but also because i felt like he wasnt wrong. we were low class. but my mom was trying her best. she wasnt around much but that was because she was working constantly to make ends meet. and i have my own complicated feelings about her but i also recognize that she was doing what she thought was best for us. what really got to me though was the son has had every opportunity handed to him... his family is wealthy he can travel wherever he wants study whatever he wants never worry about money. and yet he does nothing. i dont want to sit here and judge someone elses life but he sleeps until 10am every day barely does anything then goes out drinking every night. half the time hes passed out on a couch sometimes puking from drinking too much. and thats the person calling me low class?someone whos never had to fight for anything never had to struggle to survive? but maybe he has his own demons hes dealing with. maybe this is just his way of coping. i dont know. what i do know is that comments like that stick with me. and i do know that im not that guy passed out on the couch. im out here trying. eventually the farmer offered to pay for a ged for me. i took the opportunity and im so grateful for that man. i took a ged course that was offered by the university in the next town over. the big city. but it was actually just a bigger town face_with_tears_of_joy it opened my eyes. suddenly the world felt bigger. i had savings from working on the farm and i wanted to go further get a degree but i needed a way to make some more money. thats when i kind of considered escort work. i dont really have some dramatic story. i just googled male escort agencies near me grinning_face_with_sweat i was surprised by how many results popped up. at first it was just research out of curiosity more than anything. but found a website that seemed legit or at least more polished than the sketchy looking ones. i sent an email attached a couple of photos. and then a few weeks later i got a call and i met up for coffee with two men. one was the manager the other was an escort himself. they explained the business was small just a handful lol of guys. their clients are men and women. they werent highend but they aimed for discretion and professionalism. at first i wasnt sure. but i did like these men and the way they carried themselves. they were confident polished almost like businessmen who just happened to be in a very unconventional business. they made it seem... professional. i decided to just give it a go. why not... they provided me with a handbook of some sorts. it had information on how to conduct one self as an escort. how to negotiate with clients. self defence... information on drug use. how to identify and avoid stds. things i always need to take with me when seeing clients. how to dress yourself. some legal aspects that might arise. honestly it was all very helpful. my first client was a woman in the middle of her phd. i didnt know what i expected... but i guess it was not was i was expecting? she was blunt straightforward and treated the encounter like a business transaction. there was no awkwardness no false pretenses. it was surprisingly easy. she was my client for a long time. i saw her maybe twice a week. over the next two or three years the agency changed. more men joined some left and eventually the guy managing it moved on to other things. the few of us who remained started working more independently but still using the agencys reputation but mostly managing our own profiles. that brings me to the current situation i guess. some people have asked about my future plans whether im thinking about a different job or what happens if things pan out with my client. so i thought id write something about that here. from the beginning my business as an escort was always slow. it seems like the escorts who take both male and female clients get more work but i was only comfortable working with female clients so maybe that played a role. either way it was never something that fully supported me. there were times especially over the last year and a half when i didnt get any work at all. it was really just a side hustle something that sometimes worked out and sometimes didnt. im trying to focus on getting my degree. im older than most of my classmates of course. in my second year i got the opportunity to work as a pharmacy assistant. the pharmacy was close to my university so i could walk over after class. im really grateful for that job because it helped me a lot financially. then from there i landed an internship at a company in my field. its parttime but theyre paying me to work there and theres an understanding that once i graduate which if all goes well should be by the end of this year theyll offer me a fulltime position. so escorting was something i turned to as a way to earn extra income and for a while it did help. but i always knew it wasnt sustainable and ive been slowly stepping away from it. in fact before this specific client i hadnt taken on anyone in quite a while. i had a few once off clients here and there. some of the comments suggested that i should let my client know that im quitting escorting and that if she still wants to stay in touch we could. thats something ive been thinking about too. because the truth is i am stepping away. the agency doesnt really exist anymore and its basically just a bunch of us still lingering. but i think id like to make this official. it feels like the right time to close that chapter and fully focus on whats next. as for why this event that i want to ask her to is special to me it ties back to something from my childhood. when i was growing up there was an old lady in town who played the organ at the church. my home life wasnt great as ive said. but to give more context my mom was raising me my sister and my sisters baby my niece who was unfortunately born addicted to heroin. my dad was... somewhere but not in the picture. i had a cheap bicycle and used to ride around town a lot. one day i rode past this ladys house and saw that she had a dog. i dont know why but i just went inside her yard and started playing with her dog. i was about eight or nine at the time. she invited me in for tea and cookies. she was a retired music teacher. she actually called my mom to let her know i was there and my mom was absolutely livid telling me how inappropriate that was. and yeah maybe it was. but the old lady seemed to like me. i ended up going back a few times i guess i helped her around the house and in the garden sometimes. she was a widow and her son was living overseas. she tried to teach me how to play the piano. i never really got good at it but it became something special to me. i sometimes go to concerts when i can sometimes there are music concerts at my university. so this specific even that i want to invite her to really resonates with me. i dont know if its the right thing or not. i guess well see. if youve made it this far thank you for time. i think i really needed this and i needed all of you.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 13:31:34 UTC,168,30,0.89,,,0,0

1j4vczc,i 26m am starting to feel attracted to my mtf 25 friend and am confused.,hello it is my first time ever posting on reddit and english is not my native language so sorry if i am screwing stuff up. quick context i am a 26 year old male with a partner of 5 year 28f that i love very much together in our house with cats. my friend called v is a great person to be around really soscial and funny. we met at university and were good friends from the moment we met and although life has lowered our time together we still meet for dnd once a month at least and chat when time allows! anywaylast year v told our close group of friends that they are transitioning but we can still use male pronouns and everything around him for now. we all accepted it and told him that we are here if he needs help.a couple of months went by and he started the hormone treatment grew out his hair and starting dressing and acting more feminine. i started to find it a bit interesting to witness the transformation and my gf talked with him about his feelings and some tips and tricks regarding clothing and makeup. the first feeling came when he was going to a dressup party where he asked my gf to help to dress as a proper women for the first time with a wig makeup and everything. she was happy to help and went over to his place where he and his roommates live all girls to work her magic. all went well according to my gfs text and she send me a picture when he was done. he looked so good! cute but also sexy and most importantly happy! that is when i first felt something and i was a bit shocked i kinda pushed it away as a reaction to seeing the guy i know for 7 years suddenly as a beautiful women. the next feeling came later on the evening when i got a message from him drunk that was a picture of him blowing me a kiss and saying i love yooouuuu and some other stuff that he is happy to have me and my gf in his life. this gave me a butterfly in the stomach feeling but i thought it was just a corny message that some people send to friends when drunk i remember plenty of instances where other friends told me they love me after a night of drinking as i am dropping them of at home and vice versa. i showed the message to my gf and she jokingly asked if i am going to leave her for him. i told here no because i really love her and this is just a random drunk text plus he mentioned her also in the text that followed so it was not only aimed at me. that leaves me with the situation right now where i am 90 convinced that this is all just a temporary feeling and will blow over as they complete their transition and i move on with my gf in the meantime. what the hell should i do if the other 10 turns out and i cannot stop thinking about himher when he starts looking for surgery etc? i really love my gf and i also dont want to ruin a great friendship. do just thug it out or try to talk with v about it? thanks in advance,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 13:24:33 UTC,1,4,0.6,,,0,0

1j4v78i,confusion,i m18 and my girlfriend f18 have been together for little over a year now. we started dating at boarding school so we saw each other every single day so we also argued a lot. after boarding school ended we moved back. this meant we would se each other a lot less because we live 2 hours apart. but that worked fine seeing each other about 13 times a week instead. it is almost always me going to her place waiting 2 hours. a few months back around mid october kind of wanted to break it up because i didnt feel very happy in the relationship but i said i would wait a little because we had a trip to berlin which was super awesome and things were going great. now its been a while still taking the train 2 hours to see her and i feel that the past few weeks my feelings for her has dwindled. i feel a lust for other woman dont find my girlfriend as attractive anymore and very little need to see her. i dont look forward to seeing her which i hate because i wish i did i have told her how i feel and we said we would give a little time and if it keeps going we should break up. the problem is i cant decide one part of me is screaming stay with her because i love her but not the same way anymore but i still love her and at the same time i feel like the only solution is breaking up. im not sure if its because i love the idea of her what is making me so confused what do you guys think? please help me guys folded_hands_medium_skin_tonered_heart,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 13:16:06 UTC,1,7,1.0,,,0,0
1j4v23r,sometimes i go into toilets to be alone,i feel so self conscious in public. as a uni student i stayed home almost the entire semester last year because i just hate to be in crowded lectures halls. i feel so uncomfortable walking to the campus from the uni accommodations cause theres so many people walking the same way. i havent made many friends cause i cant talk to people the only ones i have are through a group project and one that i knew earlier online. i sometimes really wanna study somewhere not in my room but i cant stand going to the libraries or cafes cause theyre always so crowded. it feels horrible the main point is this. sometimes when im at uni i will feel so vulnerable so self conscious that ill go into a bathroom stall just to be alone for a moment. not just bathrooms either. ill hide anywhere i can. i was once waiting to take an exam there were so many people in line and the invigilators were late setting up so i walked through this door in the hall where j was waiting into this random break room where i probably wasnt allowed to be but i just couldnt stand there. i spend a lot of time on how i look how i dress because i dont want to stand out. if i look sharp and nondescript im that much closer to invisible. or at least thats the rationale ive come up with its sort of a subconscious behaviour. i can also barely leave my house without headphones. maybe its some sort of protection some defense mechanism that disconnects me from the world around me. i know my fears and anxieties are extremely exaggerated logically theres no reason for me to be nervous. maybe theres some underlying psychological disorder thats causing it i do have adhd and autism but i cant afford therapy or any sort of treatment so i really just have to deal with it for now until i graduate. but it mostly hurts because i know that it wont just get better with time i need to do something about it the future wont be brighter just because the present is so dark. but im trapped like this for now.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 13:08:19 UTC,6,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j4uzav,i lied about my experience in a videogame.,i honestly debated sharing this for a while but its really bugging me. it seems dumb but i promise its a rough one for me at least. i started playing a game just for fun and to see what it was about but i ran into a bit of a problem when first starting out. i understood the assignment really well for the first time playing but hated how belittled i was for my inexperience despite how quickly i caught on. so i fabricated a simple lie saying i used to play years ago but lost my account. this wasnt really a problem for a while didnt expect to make any longterm friends while playing so i just stuck with the lie so much so that i partially believed it. i then made a handful of amazing friends that i care deeply for and they care deeply for me. weve been a little group for about id say a year now. i feel so unbelievably bad lying to all of them like this even though its the only thing ive lied about around them i dont have the guts to lie to them so this really is the only thing. i feel like a terrible friend by lying about a game that we all built our friendship on but im too scared to back out of this considering how far in i am. i feel like actually saying what i did will do me good rather than continuing to just shove the truth to the back of my brain and is why i came here of all places.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 13:03:56 UTC,3,8,0.72,,,0,0

1j4u79y,sexually attracted to my friend who is the wife of another friend,fake names my friend james introduced me to his wife sarah when they first got together around a decade ago. i dont think sarah liked me at all until a couple months ago when we started hanging out through a shared interest. to be honest im not sure she likes me much now and i think she only spends time with me when her friends are busy. i feel like james told her to be friendly to me because he knows im socially awkward and suffer from depression especially recently. anyways we have been bonding over the same hobby for the past couple months and something about her drives me wild at times man. when i first met her i didnt think of her like this at all and would have said she was probably a little above average looking. after getting to know her as a person and seeing the way she carries herself she has become extremely gorgeous to me. i respect both of them too much to do anything and im genuinely content with being friends with sarah because she is a fantastic person like james. ive been minimizing contact with her recently though and it sucks because i know that i would never act on these feelings. the reason i havent been talking to her as much is because i dont want james to feel like something would happen between us. i was spending much more time with sarah than james because we are both into the same stuff right now. im glad sarah doesnt feel the same way toward me as i do her but it sucks knowing that she wouldnt feel the same even had she never met james. i feel so guilty and ashamed for liking her.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 12:19:37 UTC,0,12,0.22,,,0,0

1j4t53m,did my partner cheat 10 years ago and forget it wasnt me that was with him,my partner and i were in bed watching silly videos when a clip of a comedian popped up asking people about the weirdest place theyd had sex. without thinking i laughed and said oh for us it was definitely the beach! remember when we used to go there? for context it was a very isolated beach. but then he looked at me and said nooo the weirdest place was in the bathroom at asda. i froze. what? i stared at him confused. we never had sex in a bathroom at asda. he insisted we didback when he was living with his brother and i was staying with my aunt. he even painted the scene our son was asleep so we snuck off to the bathroom. only our son wasnt even born yet. i was pregnant at the time. and i am absolutely sure i would remember having sex in a supermarket bathroom. that kind of adrenaline rush would have stayed with me forever. yet he kept insisting it happened. and thats when it hit me. did he cheat on me and forget that the person he was with wasnt even me? this was 10 or 11 years ago but still i would not have forgotten this. and i know this because i remember every place ive ever had sex in public even from before i was with him. so this made absolutely no sense to me. so yeah there you have itthe truth off my chest. . . . . edit or update whatever you want to call it i didnt expect this post to get so much attention. this is my first time posting here. this is not ai or fake. english is not my first language but i am somewhat fluent. my grammar isnt the best so i asked ai to correct it i dont see a problem with that. and seeing how some people are roasting me in the comments for being with a cheater saying my child deserves better hoping hes not a doormat like his mom and that i deserve this i can only imagine what the comments would look like if my grammar was bad! as for those commenting about my child he doesnt know anything about this. hes never seen us argue all he sees is what we let him see. apart from the things i mentioned weve had a very loving relationship the cheating 5 years ago i forgave and i dont regret that we have been happy trust is still hard sometimes but at the moment in the present he has not given me reasons to think that he has cheated or though about it. i understand what people are saying that he might be abusive or mentally manipulating me but i dont really see it that way maybe when we argue but i dont think he does that on purpose or maybe im just blind . right now im thinking this might be something hes confusing with a dream or something like some people have said. thinking back i have mentally blocked out a lot from that time i had a very stressful and traumatic pregnancy and its not something i want to get into or talk about. i posted this just to get it off my chest. please dont offend me in the comments thats just mean and dont bring my son into it he has nothing to do with this!,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 11:10:46 UTC,5751,275,0.95,,,0,0
1j4t1hf,i am probably the 100th survivor of a serial predator.,throwaway account for obvious reasons his initial is changed for safety and ill try not to include too many specific details but this is a long one. here goes i started dating d after meeting at a bar and things were amazing at first as they usually are with narcissistic abusers. after a short period his mask started to slip. he would sext me about his far out fantasies some weird but benign others dark and twisted. sometimes i said no but often i played along because some of the things he was suggesting i was fine experimenting with or could see myself potentially liking. and he was crazy hot and the most charming person id ever met. and i knew he had been a player but i didnt mind. so had i so it felt like a good match. i was falling in love with him and he so he said with me. we became official and things immediately took a turn for the worse. the first night he beat me up and raped me i was on psychedelics that he encouraged me to take and he convinced me afterwards that i had consented to the whole thing. that it was bdsm. that anything i didnt like was fine but wasnt his fault. mind you bdsm requires specific lucid ongoing and enthusiastic consent and a safeword which we did not have. i think my brain chemistry was permanently changed that night because i sobbed in his arms and allowed myself to believe him. the gaslighting heavy swings between silent treatment and intense attention casual cruelty in our conversations and lovebombing increased from there. later on d coerced me into group sex within which i was sexually assaulted by a stranger multiple times at his direction before he assaulted me damaged property and ran before the police were called. he convinced me again that he thought i had consented to everything. he masterfully gaslit and lied and manipulated me and my memories felt untrustworthy. he convinced me i was going to ruin his life if i pressed charges. under the trauma bond that had formed that i mistook for love he convinced me to rescind my statement to the police. and we made up. the last time i saw him was the worst night of my life and the last time he raped me. i had been drinking all night at his direction and once we started he did not stop. not when i was choking and struggling under him not when i was crying and begging him to stop not when i went limp not when i had lost a pint of blood not when i passed out. i am lucky to be alive. but in the morning the trauma had taken most of my memories. i pretended i was okay but he knew what he had done. when i realized i had to seek medical attention the next day he told me i was overreacting and ignored my pleas for aftercare. i begged him for compassion and promised hed done nothing wrong but he refused. as the days passed my memories started to return. as they did i started to try to hold him accountable. but as im sure many of you know narcissism does not allow for accountability. every attempt of mine to break up with him was foiled until he finally decided to break up with me. my horrific memories continued to return to me and so i went to the police. anyone want to guess how that went? when they closed my case citing insufficient evidence i was devastated. but i felt more than anything that i needed to warn the next woman. i posted my experience anonymously and a woman came forward that he had drugged and sad years prior. more secondhand stories started coming out of the woodwork. so i posted him again. my case was closed but my experience was real and i realized people needed to know he was going to do it again and had probably done it before. yeah not probably. definitely. dozens of women in a weekend in my extended circle of mutuals and more outside of that started sharing their experiences of abuse at ds hand. everything vile under the sunsexual harassment druggings assault blackmail theft manipulation coercion violence and rape. over many years. d is a true serial rapist abuser and predator. his disarming charm and looks and fake feminism and subsequent manipulation and gaslighting had not just worked on me but friends and roommates and coworkers and romantic partners. it has been overwhelming and heartbreaking and sickening. but when i went to the cops i thought i was alone. when i shared my experience i thought i was alone. and now i know im the farthest thing from alone. and you bet litigation and a reopened case are incoming. but im writing this post because i learned tonight about some of the things he did to another exgirlfriend. worse than he did to me worse than you can imagine. for a lot longer. my body has been shaking non stop and i am livid after seeing photo evidence and hearing her story. every time i think this whole situation cant get worse it does. i am so beyond angry at him. i am so disgusted with myself that i allowed him into my bed and into my lifethat i stayed after he showed me his true colors. my belief system is so deeply rocked to my core that a human being can be this consistently evil and on top of that not get caught for a decade. i am terrified that he is going to come after me for exposing him to the larger community. and i am furious at all of the people around him who had to have enabled his horrific behavior. his family members who know of his history of abusing women his male friends who listened to female friends try to share their experiences and brushed them off or gaslit them. his roommates who participated in or witnessed his crimes and kept quiet. the fucking police who have done nothing to keep my city safe from this man or take my reports seriously or compassionately despite him having multiple prior arrests and restraining orders against him. and most of all heartbroken at all the women before me who felt so alone and like they couldnt come forward. and i feel guilty that im just a little bit angry at all of them too because i wish just one of them had felt like i did that i had to stop this from happening to the next girl. because i was the next girl. and im forever changed. i dont know where to go from here other than to a courtroom but so much work lies ahead of me. of us. im in therapy and taking each day as it comes. several of the other survivors whove had years to heal are standing behind me and helping holding the pieces together but its hard. and after what i heard today i feel broken. but im also spiritually wound tighter than i ever have been. maybe the universe somehow connected us to give him one last chance to learn empathy and be a good person and partner and give me one last chance to step away from men who disrespect my boundaries the first time. and we both failed. but the result of those failures is broken cyclesi will never let a man disrespect me again for the rest of my life and d will not be able to continue his pattern of abuse. perhaps our paths crossed for me to be my own savior whilst being his undoing. all i know for sure is that i am not fucking alone anymore. none of us are alone anymore. and im hopeful that our power in numbers will deliver him the consequences he deserves. thank you for reading. please men and women and everyone in between believe. women. when they come forward. believe them the first time. this incredibly fucked up situation should never ever happen again. and to survivors everywhere you are not alone.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 11:03:57 UTC,5,0,0.73,,content warning sexual assault,0,0

1j4soab,how do you heal after your own mother wishes you werent here?,im really sorry for posting something this heavy. i know its a lot and i hate to put this out there but i just need to get it off my chest. a couple of months ago i had a conversation with my mother about how much i needed her love and care both as a child and even now. i opened up to her hoping shed understand but instead she got angry like i was attacking her just for expressing how i felt. the conversation spiraled and out of desperation i told her that i felt so unloved that i didnt want to be here anymore. i thought maybejust maybeshed finally see how much i was hurting. but instead she told me it would be better if i did it that she wouldnt have to deal with an ungrateful brat anymore. i was so shocked i almost started crying and then she added that if i was going to do it i should make sure not to make a scene or end up on the newsbecause that would be an inconvenience for her. she even said she wanted to be there to make sure it looked like an accident. that was the moment i knew i had to leave. and i did. but i still dont know how to deal with what she said. i try to move on but it keeps coming back. i have nightmares about it and sometimes i just sit there thinking about how my own mother could say something like that to me. its messed up and honestly i dont know how to get past it. some days i just really wish i wasnt here at all.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 10:37:22 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j4sk2q,i 20m am in love with my best friend 20f,as the title says i have fallen madly in love with my best friend. weve known each other for 2 years as we met at the start of college and in our little friend group that consists of about 10ish people we are the closest. my passion for her has grown so much in the time that ive met her and gotten to know more about her. we have gone on many friendly dates to restaurants and coffee shops and we have made that a routine thing. we share so many interest like our music taste in films food and fashion sense. we have even gotten matching tattoos together. whenever either of us has something happen to us we immediately share it to each other. she has only been in two relationships and in both relationships she was only used for sex and her body. i have been in a similar situation where someone will be with me just for sex. but i dont care at all about her body dont get me wrong she has an incredible one but its not what im into. im into the way that she talks with me and the way that we share jokes. i know that if i was in a relationship and we never had any sex or i never even saw her naked i would still be incredibly in love with her because im in love with her soul and her being more than her physical body. i feel that i could give her anything she wants or needs in a relationship and i wanna tell her about my feelings but im so afraid that if i do that ill lose and if i do lose her than theres no point in me being in this existence.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 10:29:00 UTC,3,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j4sdte,i 20f just recently came out of a 2year relationship and its only been a month since my ex and i broke up.,now my ex has moved on and hes already seeing someone he claims is just a classmate. meanwhile ive recently started talking to an old friend. we grew up together and we reconnected after i went to a fiesta with my friends. we drank together and before i went home i joined them for one more drink. he was there along with some of my other childhood friends. out of nowhere i started opening up to them when they asked about my ex. i told them we broke up and from there my conversations with this old friend started. its not like were talking 247 but i can sense that he has feelings for me. have any of you experienced that feeling where youre with someone and you start to feel like they like you? anyways i enjoy his company. weve shared coffee and last night we drank with some of our friends and then something happened between us and when i woke up i felt so badlike really sick. i regret it. it shouldnt have happened but we were both so drunk. before i left i remember him saying i love you and that made me feel even worse. i dont like him in that way and im still not healed from my past relationship. right now im not responding to his messages because i dont know what to say. i feel like i should talk to him about what happened but i cant seem to gather the courage.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 10:16:22 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0
1j4s9h6,so are you gonna be our new besties? the june 27th incident at kings island,hey everyone for the second consecutive year i stayed at great wolf lodge from 623627. i visited the park kings island on 625 amp 627. in a perfect world id love to tell you about everything i did and the people i met. but unfortunately the sense of joy rejuvenation and fulfillment i get by being there was tarnished by an incident that took place at the end of the trip and at park closing on the 27th. this post is as long as it is to make sure i cover all the details of what happened as specifically as i can. its now been eight months since this took place so i needed some time before i went public about this. what i hope to accomplish with this is to have a better understanding of the world from a unique perspective and to use this as a learning tool to learn from someone elses misjudgements. im posting this with the complete acceptance understanding that this story may bring some type of criticism in my direction and honestly to achieve some type of closure on this particular incident. with all that being said ill begin... on the night of june 27th i was in the fast lane queue for orion to get a postfireworks night ride. that day i was wearing a white ross chastain gone fishing busch light car tshirt wrangler jean shorts and allblack under armour mens charged rogue 4 running shoes. i was at the top of the steps and happened to introduce myself to two young ladies who were sitting against the fence in the station. to best describe it as many of you know theres a 34 foot gap between the station and the stairs before you actually enter the station. if i was to guess i originally thought these two females were in their early 20s im 28 for context but they ask me are you gonna be our new besties??? no girl has ever asked me a question like that. so im of the impression that theyre attracted to me and assumed theyre of legal age so i jokingly responded well im gonna be leaving tonight unless you had something else in mind and even if things worked out i wouldnt have bothered because i have a 2 hour drive in front of me back home to louisville after i do this night ride. but the girls then look at each other very awkwardly and say something along the lines of dude were 16! i profusely try to apologize but they begin to overreact and make a scene in the station escalating the situation and start running down the steps of the normal queue. and i apologize to the greeter and to a ride attendant because i didnt know that they were underage. as ill explain later in more detail that part of the situation like all parts of this situation couldve been resolved with an apology and life couldve went on. as this was misunderstanding. some may ask why i didnt just ask how old they were. ive been raised on the idea that asking women how old they are is inappropriate. so i finished my ride which while it was spectacular im kinda nervous about what happened beforehand as i head to my locker to retrieve my belongings. mine was on the section closest to the onride photo desk and im not able to open it probably because the park is now closed so the rental by default has expired. so while im about to get someone to help me get this locker opened two teenage boys confront me very aggressively on the situation before the ride saying something in the realm of what are you doing touching up on these little girls!!! you should know better!!! you wear that cross on your neck and do something like that?! how would god feel about that? for context i regularly wear either black or silver cross necklace. ive had many people make conversation about that. im disappointed in you. youre not going anywhere until you apologize. they also asked if i was at soak city earlier which i was to check it out for the first time and look through some of the shops. but they claimed i made inappropriate physical contact with someone there to. which i didnt. i know that isnt exactly what these two gentlemen said but its what i remember as my anxiety ramped wondering how do i get outta this dilemma that just got handed to me on a silver platter. but a couple of things i never groped these women. the park has security cameras everywhere including in the coasters stations so theres proof that didnt happen and i also attempted to explain to these two gentleman that i had no clue they were 16. again i thought they were in their early 20s college age. but they werent buying it as both told me bro you could tell! many women look older than they actually are. so you really cant sometimes. but they both proceed to exercise public humiliation on me by shouting how i was touching up on little girls! to everyone who was leaving area 72 that evening. like theyre the men from dads against predators on locals. finally security steps in to figure out what was going on and by the request of these young men. one guard originally begins to interview me but then attends to the younger gentleman who initiated the confrontation so another guard interviews me and i explain everything as detailed as i can and as calm as i can l which in the moment was pretty impossible to accomplish. i finally got my things outta my locker then this guard escorts me to the front of the park to see what his supervisor or coworkers had to say on the matter and they told me youre good to go sir nothing else is gonna happen. next time when youre having small talk just be more careful. so i walk the path back over to great wolf where my car was parked. i checked out from there that morning and was granted permission to keep my car parked there. but as im then at the northend of the parking lot in the small section that walks southeasttonorthwest what appears to be a black 2014 honda civic pulls up and its the teenagers again. the gentleman in the passenger side ask for my name number address and zipcode. which i like this whole time cooperate and disclose it. and many of you may ask why would you give your information to them? they arent police or security. i thought that being honest and cooperative would salvage my reputation in this situation. and what if they can tell that im lying. so after doing so he says to me we just got banned for a month. this is my favorite place to go to. have a good night i love you. then they take off into the night. to be honest i shouldve walked down columbia road instead of the walk path to avoid the possibility of further encounters. but at that point i thought the teens left at that point. or ask security to escort me to my car if theyre allowed to do that. after filling up my car at the goco on kings mills road i began my drive home. i look over to my left on southbound i71 to look at the park one last time despite it looking so spectacular in person at night i was unable to enjoy it because of what all just happened. heres how this situation shouldve been resolved if i were the girls id peacefully and politely inform me sorry to tell you but were actually 16. then id have responded my apologies i didnt know that. ill back off i apologize. then the girls shouldve said youre fine. its all good. then life wouldve moved on and the situation wouldve never escalated to the point it did. but to begin with if the girls never asked that question none of this would have ever happened to begin with... if i were either of the boys i would have started with professionally and calmly said excuse me sir you gotta minute to talk? and i wouldve said sure. no problem. they couldve have offered to buy me a dasani then said do you know why were wanting to speak with you??? okay there was an incident involving several young ladies in the station a few minutes ago would you mind sharing your side of the story? and i wouldve done just that. so they have both sides of the story and develop a conclusion and they finished the meeting by stating okay we believe you did make a mistake you didnt know their age just be more careful next time. thank you for talking with us and have a good night. theres a reason for the saying cooler heads prevail. you gotta assure everyones calm in order to then get to the bottom of any situation. that never happened. there also has to be a presumption of innocence established in the investigation process as well. thats why in the legal system all suspects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. which thanks to security for helping with this incident and siding with me on this. on june 28th one of the male parties in the incident made a post to this group that afternoon which was a motive to making this post in response. i waited til now to conduct this post so i made sure i could tell my side in the most detailed and comprehensive way possible. but prior to the post either being deleted or taken down i monitored it by reading all the comments throughout the time that post remained up. to start i read that i was reported to mason police. i was waiting to see if either they would call me for an interview i never did. i thought about calling them myself but when talking to someone about the matter they recommended i didnt. this individual also claimed in the comments i watched him do what he did. but in the post he states 2 girls came running down the stairs which implies that he was either at the bottom of the stairs or still at groundlevel. and in addition to the wall that divides the fastlane queue to the regular queue after the show building there would be no possibility for him to have seen the incident unfold. so it seems very contradicting. also another user had stated the girls wouldnt of lied about something like that this where i channel my inner alex jones and become a tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist in retrospect hindsight is always 2020 i believe the possibility that those girls asked me that question are you gonna be our new besties??? to bait me. ill even go a step further that im of the belief that they mightve been of legal age but claimed they were 16 as a convenient excuse to cause a problem. im not saying thats the case its complete speculation. in todays society select people love to cause andor escalate issues to play the victim card because it gets them attention. on top of that they also delivered misinformation by stating i had groped them. like i mentioned earlier there was a 4ft gap between us that wouldve been impossible. and security cameras are everywhere and if footage was pulled up it shows i never did that. so they lied about that to artificially make the situation look worse to garner more attention and spark more outrage. this is why you have to hear both sides to the story then develop the conclusion. not just hear one side and ride with it. again what other reason would these two girls ask me that question? in the minutes hours and days following this has greatly amp negatively affected my mental health as ive had many thoughts rush through my head. i thought maybe it was best i should wait a couple years before visiting again. im worried about the people around who witnessed what happened how will they think of me? whats the ride attendants at orion gonna think of me? whats gonna happen if these teens see me again? are they gonna forget about what happened or will they try to engage in some type of conflict? how will i be able to pick myself up from this? and am i sure ill still be a positive asset to society? thankfully i didnt have to wait too long to answer that last question. on july 3rd i visited ark encounter and it felt therapeutic to be on i71 again then be around people again. while there id happen to see a mom try taking a family photo but she wouldnt be in it so id ask excuse me maam if you wanna be in the shot ill take the photo. and that situation happened 4 or 5 times that day and to see the sense of joy appreciation and thankfulness expressed by these families to me reassured that i was good person and a positive asset to society. ive talked to many people about this for advice and support. while at the gocopopeyesdunkin donuts on kings mills road to fill up and i talked to the guy working there about this and mentioned it was teens just looking to cause issues. when i woke up friday afternoon i talked to my parents immediately about this if i didnt theyd notice something was bothering me. i also talked to select people at work on xbox and to other friends of mine and everyone unanimously have said that i did nothing wrong and agreed it was a misunderstanding. i wanna thank everyone who ive reached out to for support as this has been a difficult time. im surprised everyone has sided with me on this they didnt have to but im grateful for helping me get through this. i can only imagine the stress and anxiety women especially attractive women feel in public. to go to any zoo bar restaurant bowling alley amusement park movie theater etc. has to be sometimes unbearable. to always be looked at or to have someone always making advances towards you has to feel vulnerable and invasive. with that in consideration i do whats necessary to respect womens boundaries when out in public. so to even claim that im a predator is absolutely inaccurate. as mentioned earlier this was a misunderstanding. these girls asked a question that led me to assume they were attracted to me and of age. i responded based off that then they blew it out of proportion and caused a huge mess at the end of what was supposed to be another fun and memorable multiday trip up there. in conclusion the last absolute last things id want to do is make enemies inside the gates of kings island. not within mason ohio not within warren county not within the cincinnati tristate area and not within the state of ohio period. and the other last thing i wanted is to be on the radar of the city of mason police department. i imagine a day where i can call mason ohio home so i want to be on good terms with everyone i encounter. to the other parties involved if they read this post i hope we can mutually apologize come to a better understanding of what took place so we can be on good terms with each other achieve closure and move forward on a positive note. im gonna be visiting the park again this year so i dont want us to cross paths and have any further conflict or sense of animosity or discomfort. while im not wishing ill will on anyone these four people possibly will be faced with a situation thats a misunderstanding as well. if so id want their situation to be handled calmly and smoothened out as well and as quickly as possible so they dont face any hate or animosity from the opposing parties of whatever situation faces them. and i apologize to the two young men for getting banned. yall unfortunately were denied the opportunity to see the fourth of july celebration fireworks display and more valuable time to ride orion the beast or whatever yalls favorite coaster might be. while i understand they were trying to stand up for whats right it still wasnt the correct way to do so and hopefully they learn from this as well. for me i just use it as a learning experience to be extra careful on who im talking to and not make decisions off assumptions. which i apologize to the young ladies for doing so. im someone whos very respectful to peoples boundaries and wouldnt wanna make decisions about that makes someone feel uncomfortable. but i do hope they apologize for asking a question that expresses attraction only to turnaround and cause a scene that couldve been resolved with a simple apology. nobody wouldve gotten banned and security wouldnt have gotten involved. im gonna be presented with 1000 different situations and scenarios and ill be fine in 925 of them. nobody is perfect. also its been important for me to allow time to heal the wounds as the situation shrinks farther in the past. i come to kings island for peace and serenity not drama and distress. and this sadly was drama and distress. ive met many people in my now four visits to the park and had wonderful converstations and engagements with those people both fellow guests and employees. its very unfortunate this all happened and was more heartbreaking that it happened at the very end of this trip i took. i refuse to allow that to be the last memory i have of the park this year. thank you to everyone who took time outta their day to read this and whether or not youre going to the park today have a great day everyone,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 10:07:37 UTC,0,0,0.33,,,0,0
1j4s0t1,engagement,call me whatever you like but i just found my boyfriends receipt for our engagement ring. it was less than 500. he told me he couldnt buy me anything for christmas because he was saving up for the ring when he proposed. i know how much he makes and the bills he contributes to. the ring was nowhere near that amount. he spent the bare minimum. this ring was an afterthought. i told him what i wanted out of a proposal please have my nails done and please let my friends andor family be around to see the moment. neither of those things were done. im disappointed. im happy to be engaged but its been almost a month since its happened and i cant let it go. what do i do? where do i go from here? i didnt ask for much. or did i?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 09:50:44 UTC,1,2,0.67,,,0,0
1j4rnjx,people in my life are desensitized to my pain,i f31 am immunocompromised. i have a chronic pain condition autoimmune disorders and multiple sleep disorders. i was even born with some of these issues ive been in pain for forever and i get sick a lot which makes everything worse. i hate being a burden on people most of the time i hide my pain. i am good at that up to a point. probably most people who technically know me have no idea how sick i actually am while the people who really know me are unfortunately more exposed to how bad it is for me. yesterday morning i was in pain like absurd pain like the worst pain i have ever felt. ive felt that exact pain exactly 3 other times in my life. all 3 times i was rushed to the er under the assumption that my appendix was having kittens or something. no appendix issues were found and eventually after about 12 hours of hell the pain goes away. this time was no different except this time i knew there was no reason to go to the hospital at aprox 11 hours in it finally subsided and i was able to crash. my best friendroommate m24 was in the house for the first half of this. mind you i was moaning scream crying and begging the universe for help most of the morning. i told him the about going to the hospital each time before and receiving no help and no answers. he seemed concerned but that was it. he didnt even check on me before leaving for the day. i was supposed to be puppy sitting while he was at work. my bf m36 came over about two hours after the pain subsided. he was very informed about how the day had gone for me as i had been texting him all day while he was stuck at work and school. he barely acknowledged my condition when he came in still glued to his phone even though i started bawling like a baby as soon as he came in. i know his day wasnt easy i ended up massaging his arm and even skipping the snuggs and cry session i had requested via text to hold space for how he was doing emotionally. we went to bed. he did ask how my pain was and spent a moment checking for classic appendicitis symptoms. but he was a million miles away...... i know that i am always in pain and i dont want people to dote on me but i felt so invisible and neglected today i could almost blow away in the wind. i dont think anyone did anything wrong. my whole family does the same thing remember ive been in pain my whole life. im just kind of devastated. i had one of the hardest most painful days of my life and i did it alone i still need to cry i still need to be held.......,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 09:23:01 UTC,0,4,0.5,,,0,0

1j4r7st,moved to spain started a business and got fired. now im stuck advice?,how i started a bag store and what went wrong loudspeaker why im writing this post i want to share my story about how i started a business from scratch faced unexpected challenges and now find myself at a crossroads. this isnt just about bagsits about resilience risks and the struggle to keep going when everything seems to work against you. i genuinely want to hear your thoughts because honestly i dont know what to do next. house life before everything changed before all of this my family and i had stable jobs and life was fairly predictable. but then everything shifted. my parents lost their jobs and i had to step up to support them. i also had to make the tough decision to send my wife and child abroad to ensure their safety while i stayed behind and worked. i took a job as the head of security for a wealthy businessman. every cent i made went to supporting my family. i lived on the bare minimum just making sure i could keep going physically and mentally. handbag how the idea of the store was born my mother after months of being unable to work started looking for a way to do something productive. she remembered the small bagmaking business that my wife and i had started before the pandemic which we had to shut down due to covid19. she decided to try reviving it and we applied for a small business grant. the process was slow and after waiting nearly a year we were approvedbut for much less money than we had originally planned for. we had to decide whether to take the risk and move forward or let the idea go. light_bulb why we decided to start the business anyway my mother had no prior experience in fashion or sewingshe had worked in an office her entire life. but she was determined to learn. i helped her enroll in bag design and sewing courses and she began developing the first models. meanwhile in my free time i worked on setting up our etsy store. we put everything we had into making this business work. airplane a new opportunity and another setback while all of this was happening my employer decided to relocate to valencia spain and offered me a job there. it seemed like a great opportunity so i moved my family and followed him. over several months i helped relocate his family and others. assisted in finding and purchasing a new business a plywood factory for investment purposes. but after everything was set up he fired me without warning leaving me unemployed in a foreign country with no backup plan. man_shrugging where are we now? right now my family and i are living in spain relying on our last savings enough for about 45 months. meanwhile our etsy store has not generated a single sale and my mother is struggling to keep up with rent for the workshop. red_question_mark what are we doing wrong? i need your advice! our bags are highquality handcrafted leather pieces. we set the price range at xy but we havent made a single sale. we tried advertising on etsy and instagram but conversion is extremely low. maybe weve chosen the wrong target audience or our product descriptions arent engaging enough? magnifying_glass_tilted_right please check out our store and give honest feedback! maybe youll see mistakes that were not noticing? any advice or critique would help us understand what needs to change to keep this business alive. im attaching the store link and a video of our production process. id be grateful for any input! folded_hands,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 08:48:59 UTC,0,0,0.14,,,0,0

1j4qjzv,how to escape unhealthy mindset,sometimes i just want to choke myself to death. theoretically i cant it is the given nature of humans to respond to threats so instead i just smash objects and choke my pillow. i got angry and aggressive even with the slightest trigger but i didnt want to hurt anyone around me so i tried to keep my mouth shut and lock myself up whenever i felt crazy. a little bit of background. i was terribly sucks at social interaction and during work i was feeling useless. my boss was kind as they explained to me that i have to show more passion and that they cannot offer to extend my contract which i agree with. however i was somehow irritated with some of my seniors words and i kept replaying those words in my head to the point that it hurt my chest and exploded my head. whenever i recall that conversation i just slapped myself really hard multiple times and i got addicted to that i just stopped slapping because i knew i could not die and dealing with a dizzy head after torturing myself was not a good idea. i dont want to blame anyone as it is my choice after all but having these unhealthy behaviors has taken a toll on my mental health and affects my job hunting. now i dream every night about people speaking ill of me. as i am writing this i no longer understand why i was having that kind of thought during my rant most of the time after the burst out my mind just blacked out and proceeded with anything i was doing previously like nothing ever happened. but thoughts like this keep coming randomly and im afraid that i could eventually hurt myself or someone.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 07:58:36 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0

1j4qbra,unexpected invitations bother me,let me explain i get really bothered when i make plans or i am a part of plans where i am the driver and someone invites someone unexpectedly. aka gives them a seat in my car without asking me. for context my car seats 5 people including the driver so 4 seats for passengers. also im the only one in my immediate friend group with a car. usually if my friends and i have plans were taking my car. i dont have an issue with that as we fit in my car and id rather do that than spend unnecessary money on an uber. if were planning something as a group i make sure to communicate with my group and tell them who ive personally invited so that way no ones surprised. i get really bothered when i show up to pick people up and they have someone extra that they didnt tell me about. i get especially annoyed if its someone i dont know and they just expect me to give a ride.. this really annoys me because 1. usually my car is full because as i said im the only one in my immediate friend group with a car. so if im offering to give you a ride thats not an invitation to invite other people. especially people i dont know. you dont know who else ive offered a ride to and its not your car to offer !!!! 2. to me it seems extremely rude and entitled. i dont care how close of friends we are at least give me the heads up that youre bringing someone else. im not a bitch i wont say no just bc idk them or like bc it was unexpected. i just get extremely annoyed when you dont even give me the courtesy of asking???? again its not your car to offer spots in. and if its a group plan you dont know if im giving other people rides !! if you would have asked me hey i invited x person can you give them a ride too? i can have the chance to say oh sorry my car is full im sorry! but no u just show up with them and then im in the awkward position of turning them away bc theres no space and then i look like a bitch i just want the courtesy yk??? and ive communicated to my friends how it bothers me and how if they plan on inviting someone else and they are expecting me to give them a ride ask me ! i literally just let one of my friends know yesterday privately how much it bothered me and he said ok. he proceeded to do it again today so instead of waiting till we were in private i just told him in front of his guest i said im sorry my car is full. i have to go pick up my friend so theres no extra seats. if you wouldve let me know then maybe i couldve saved her a seat but i didnt know she was coming. and he claimed to not know that his guest was gonna come but he literally invited her _. and again i literally would not have had a problem saving her a seat!! he just never told me he invited her so i offered rides to other people!!!! wtf this is rational right? or am i just being mean. i definitely couldve worded it better bc in the end i did make his guest feel a bit bad but i was just so frustrated! especially since i had just talked to him about this yesterday!!!!! it lowkey makes me feel taken advantage of like why cant u just give me the courtesy of telling me who u plan to bring into my car. im literally not even stingy with giving rides either 95 of the time i say yes unless i absolutely cant. so why not just ask me. cause now i look mean and like a bitch. would this bother you too?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 07:41:13 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j4q5vg,54 and struggling,hi. i when i was 12 i was playing in an arcade on the slot machines and a guy came up to me and started feeding my machine with cash. i went back every week and he paid whilst i played. this happended over a period which i cannot remember and then one day he started to stroke my penis. nobody had ever touched me here before so naturally my body reacted and i got erect even though i was scared as hell. i continued to go back for six months then one day he took me to a cafe on the pier and bought me dinner. burger chips etc. he undid my zip on my trousers and got my cock out and jerked me off and i came my first ever ejaculation. i keep blaming myself because i kept going back to get jerked off and fed. my mom was single parent and dad moved away. i was left alone for hours when she was working. i now realise i was groomed and sexually assaulted . i still have these feelings of excitement when i remember this first time which then turn immediately to disgust at myself for saying nothing and letting it continue. i have had therapy when i was 16. long story but i was addicted to the machines by now and another guy started doing the same and pay me 40 for the privilege. the money just went back on the machines. this second guy groomed me so much i ended up going to his flat to see his spectrum computer and he continued there which turned to blowing me and paying me 40. the last time i went he raped me. i ran away after and stayed out late and the police were out looking for me. i was scared to go home as much bottom was so painful. the police found me hiding under the pier and took me home. i told them and mum that i had realised i was late home and rather than face the music stayed out as i was scared of getting into trouble. so naturally i was in a vicious circle the later it became. the accepted it and nothing was said about the assault. i dont remember how i dealt with the pain but my brain has blocked some stuff out. ff three years and the police turned up at myself home and said i had been exposing my penis to the public. i seriously honestly have no recollection of this at all. they cautioned me and my mum shouted and screamed when they went asking why until i broke down after she said has someone hurt you. she got the police back and i made a statement. to this day ive never been told what happened the guy. whethery they caught him or not but i never had to go to court. for years i thought they filed it nfa as i was just a dirty rent boy who deserved what he got. i feel let down by the police as i know now that i was a child and it was grooming secual assault and rape. i am a gay man and have never been able to take it sorry for the crudeness due to the memory. i know its not everything but i know im a disappointment for not being a real gay man. when i have these feelings of not being good enough for anyone or deserving of anything i struggle and want to run away. as i am a let down to others for not getting over it. ive been in a relationship for 28nyesrs and my partner he knows everything but i still regularly have these days of being not enoug people pleasing and feeling like everyone would be better without me. for some reason i just had my first nightmare in over 35 years and it started with the first day of being touched at 12 and ended with the rape and police. i woke up to my disgust with an erection which soon went down when i was awake. i feel sick and cant believer my body reacted in this way to a traumatic memory. i have felt guilty all these years that the guys who assaulted me made me erect and ejaculate but the therapist said it was just a natural reaction to being touched down there. and ive accepted it wasnt my fault. until now. that dream has taken me back over 40 years and to wake up erect makes me wanna kill myself. what sick fuck am i? or was it my 12 year old inner person that made me.erect. i am due at work in a cople of hours and cant face the world. i am disgusted with myself again after all the years of counselling and accepting i was a child and they were adults and as such i took no blame whatsoever. but this fucking nightmare has moved the goalposts. why the fuck would i wake up sexually excited over something so traumatic? the only thing i can think of is yesterday my partner and i and his sister found out their dad my dad in law has secondary cancer and metastatic cancer which is obious a traumatic. could this trigger earlier trauma? but the sick feeling of waking up with an erection makes me feel so low i cant tell anyone. i wont kill myself dw. i am a people pleaser and would never put my friends and family through that. i have cptsd as 8 years ago my best mate took his life and i found him. so i could never put others through what i have so in not killing myself i am a failure to me twice. as i am pleasing others instead of me. i just wanna go back to the day before yesterday when i felt a normal person. instead a funked up freak of nature.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 07:28:56 UTC,2,1,1.0,,content warning sexual assault,0,0

1j4oji3,im growing sick of my mentally ill sucidal partner and im too scared to end things.,headline says a lot. im dating someone that is very very openly suicidal and refuses to get help for it. seems like no matter what i do nothing gets through to him about finding help speaking with someone far more qualified than i am or even admitting he needs to get things under control before he puts himself in even worse health. i constantly have to hear him complaining about how everything is everyone elses fault the world turned its back on him and how nothing matters since nothing goes right for him anyway. its wearing me down. hard. i try so hard to see things on the other side and keep suggesting that he sees someone about this because i can only do so much but now its to the point where i want to slap the shit out of him and try to literally knock some sense into him before having him committed against his will so someone can drug him enough to where hes far less annoying. only thing is i love him so much that i cant do anything but go along with it because im petrified of waking up one day after being honest with him and finding out he did himself in. i have no one to talk to about this. my friends keep telling me to leave him and they see how tired i am from dating him and constantly trying to keep his spirits up. i know were heading down that road if this keeps up but i also know that if we do end things ill always be dreading that phone call letting me know he took his own life. i also know that once this is over ill never date again because ill never be able to open myself up to potentially dating another selfish suicidal asshole who only thinks about themselves. i also know that without him ill likely be so stressed and lonely ill have a broken heart to deal with and thatll do me in. im finding my own therapist to talk to about all of this but goddamn it i cant handle another night of him being brutally honest about wanting to die and i just sit here and quietly take hearing about it. my love life hasnt ever been perfect but i was hoping so badly this would be the one relationship to finally break my streak of finding someone to be with that wasnt me clinging on to the first person who gave me some sort of genuine attention. i should have known finding love that would stick around was never meant for me. i dont even know why i bothered in this relationship i should have known the happiest ive ever been in life with someone by my side would also be the most miserable ive ever been. i dont know what else to do. only thing i can think of is just staying the course and seeing what happens. typing all this out helped but i know this time tomorrow morning ill wake up and realize im still going to be with someone that refuses to help himself and its just a matter of when not if.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 05:38:58 UTC,3,1,0.8,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0

1j4o5u0,i cant forgive my friend for how she treated me,what she did hasnt had lasting financial or safety effects on me but i just feel pissed that she had the thought to treat a human like that. i was meant to go to a concert with her and one of her friends. everything was fine until a few hours before when she decided to started making long messages and voice notes about how everything was just going to crazy and chaos. i was informed last minute that her friend has problems being at concerts and around any people due to social anxiety. i said i understood as i had suffered with it still do at times and had only really gotten over it recently. and then it just gets worse and worse cant pick you up anymore my friend isnt calming down shes been freaking out about this since we bought the tickets months ago. we probably wont talk to you much you might just had to stand a hit away from us. you can be there just do your own thing i told her to just tell me if i cant come and she told me its probably best if i dont. 11 year friendship just treated like an ant on the ground stepped in on and killed. i asked her why she didnt just tell me months ago if her friend was uncomfortable with me there. i could have made other plans or tried to message her friend help her know that i wont judge her and she doesnt have to interact with me if shes uncomfortable. but i was left with 4 hours to get other plans. thankfully sold my ticket last minute but lost lots of money from it. i got mad at her but i dont know if i feel sorry. a friend of mine that knows her too but its not like wed ever all hung out or even mention eachother to eachother said maybe i should have been more considerate and just left it because her sister had passed away a few years ago and she still struggles. i told her i understand that i dont expect her to not ever be affected my that again. but i also told her that i wont be excusing her if she treats me badly. when ive grieved ive never used it as an excuse to treat people badly. ive heard other stories about her not treating people the best and i feel like she now hides behind this and uses grief as her excuse. i never got an actual apology just a idk what to say. im not putting this up to grief even if it was it doesnt excuse what she did. she had months of time to inform me that the situation may not have been appropriate as her friend is uncomfortable around anyone new and had been anxious for months leading up to this her words i dont need the full diagnosis and pry into her friends life because im not entitled to that. but if i had just been told months before that she was feeling anxious about going to a a concert with an unfamiliar person i could have seen if the friend wanted to meet in a quiet place with the mutual friend or meet over text. or i could have made other plans. its fine now its been a little bit of time since then. i dont talk to her much at all only if i have a question but i dont forgive her for the reason that she treated a human like that.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 05:15:51 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j4o0dx,i broke up w him 2 months ago,wevef24 been together for a year and hem25 was my first in everything. everything just hurts and its been 2 months since our break up. 2months ive been losing sleep but im still functional. he still wants us to be together but im keeping myself away because i know our relationship wont change and we just keep going on cycles of his outburst and me wanting him to understand my side. he always told me i was an exception because when his with me he tries to control his anger. he mentioned having anger issues. but one time when we got argument he left me alone and drove himself back home. i know it was my fault for making him mad but do i deserve being left alone and it was raining at that time. there are other circumstances but hey atleast he didnt lay his hands on me right. he says communicate with him but when i do why do it turns to an argument. ive tried breaking up with him few times but he has his ways to make me feel guilty and ill always come back. i think about the good times we had everyday at the same time i had to say to myself i dont feel secure anymore in that relationship and i have to think of the my future. it was my bday today and he sent me a greeting then the convo went to him wanting to go back to our relationship. i had to slap myself and block him for good. i just wanna rant. maybe someone here has the same situation as me. i cant wait to feel like being me again. i just miss myself.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 05:06:32 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j4nzqe,i lost my job,i went into work tonight like any other night i work third shift and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. i was assigned to a work station like any other night nobody was giving me weird looks or anything just a normal night. recently i was given a warning for too many absences and i acknowledged that but i was under the impression that my last two absences were excuse because i brought in a note from a doctor. about a week after my last absence from work my alarm didnt wake me up in time for work and i ended up being thirty minutes late. at the time nobody said anything so i took that to mean that there were no problems. that was a week ago. i know that i fucked up. they dont pay me to be absent and there are plenty of people willing to take my job if im not performing well enough and i cant perform well if im not there. i cant tell my family yet. its me my ex and three stepsons. i am currently our only source of income because my ex is waiting to have her second pelvic fusion surgery. she will in theory be able to work after her second surgery but in the meantime im the only one. we do get some assistance but we are hanging by a thread at any given moment. im scared im angry at myself and i feel numb at the same time. im typing this less than an hour after it happened i dont think that its sunk in yet. i will tell my family tomorrow and i will also start applying for jobs tonight. i just feel like such a failure. what kind of 39 year old cant consistently do something as simple as show up to work when theyre supposed to? my instinct is to make excuses and point fingers but im the one who is in charge of my actions. im trying to find the silver lining and use this is a learning experience but its hard. thanks to anyone who has taken the time to read this. wish me luck.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 05:05:25 UTC,2,2,0.75,,,0,0
1j4nzfg,spent the weekend with someone special and i regret it,i 36f went on a weekend trip with this guy 43m. he lived abroad most of his life so he doesnt know our tourist destinations that well. we went to this tiny town that everyone who lives here has been to multiple times and because it was a long weekend everything was fully booked so our hotel was far away from the towns center. i liked him for almost half a year but ive known him for years he is one of my favorite artists and he has a very niche ig account. we met in person last year and we were both awe struck about each other when we met like i couldnt believe how handsome he was in person and he kept asking me to hug him i could feel him smelling my hair. i went to visit him while i was abroad in his city back in january and when i saw him he totally tricked me into getting to his apartment and well... we ended up doing it. but i didnt want to catch feelings for him so i decided not to visit him again while i was in his city. he then decided to come visit here for the long weekend. hes pretty handsome and definitely draws female attention to him and he always tells me about all the girls that approach him in public. i guess he wants to make me jealous? anyway i punch back and i tell him about the guys i date. dumb little game i know. so this weekend we went on this trip together since he doesnt know his way around i had to be on top of the booking. i booked two separate bedrooms. my plan was to have a nice weekend with him and not get attached because tbh hes way too handsome and i dont think i could manage all the jealousy that comes with having someone like him as a partner. the getaway went ok we couldnt get our hands of each other but my poor planning skills ruined some parts of the trip and he was noticably irritated but didnt blame it on me. i ended up knowing him better we had long talks he was very sweet to me. he showed me some of his work unedited. we talked about our childhoods and all. at some point he said something like i know that for you this is something superficial and when i asked him what he meant he said that he knew i was there for the sex and that i only used guys for pleasure. i told him that i actually had admired him for years and that i wasnt at all interested in sleeping with him when we first met i was just so glad to meet one of my favorite artists. and i did tell him i cared deeply about him but i knew that i wasnt special for him at all either and i had no reason to believe he wanted anything else than just having a good time with me as he is surrounded by beautiful woman all the time i was just the flavor of the week. he seemed a bit offended by that comment he said he doesnt see girls that way and that he only opens up to someone special. we agreed that we both like each other and we both café for each other so that the best thing would be to take advantage of the time together and maybe do physical stuff while we still can when we have the chance but remain good friends until were old. i dont know it was a weird conversation and i cant shake the feeling that he was just trying to make me say that i was in love with him or something because of his narcissistic nature. i have shielded my heart from guys like him years ago because i know falling for them doesnt ever end well. anyway at the end of the trip we couldnt get a bus back to our city and he got pretty mad. i felt awful and i wasnt looking forward to spend the next 3 hours next to him being mad. but he explained to me that it was just his survival skills nothing personal. he went back to being all touchy feely and even told me he had referred to me as his wife to some lady who asked him who i was to him. i told him he was full of it i knew he was just trying to manipulate me. he fell asleep on my lap for most of the trip holding my hand while i caressed his hair. he drooled on my pants and he was so embarrassed haha so sweet. and then.... once we arrived and left the bus he just asked me if i could get a bus to my place from where we were. plain and cold. i said yeah so he just turned around and said see ya then! no kiss no hug nothing. i called him out on it he turned around gave me a small peck kiss and then went away. i was just in awe about how he could just shift from being so sweet to basically abandoning me there like as i was some stranger. i think thats what really bothers me. we shared some good moments and i opened up about my feelings for him. i told him that maybe we couldnt be good as a couple because neither one of us is willing to settle down but that i did want him in my life as a friend as i admired him too much. and he agreed! but the way he left me there just made me feel like he never really cared. and i am here now as a 36 yo woman crying like a teenager because i feel i lost someone i was really starting to care about. i know i cant get his heart im not special im not as pretty and i am old so i dont even entertain the idea of him ever falling for me and i know i knew since we started this whole thing to prevent myself from getting hurt. but i did want to be able to maybe go out with him for coffee and talk about art for years. i wanted a friendship. im so confused. i guess i just wanted to write about it and get it off my chest so that it doesnt eat me anymore. i dont want to and i also cant tell my friends because he is kind of famous in our circles and one of my best friends told me he was a major player so i should stay away from him and im kind of embarrassed of how it played out. i miss him. i messaged him a few hours after i got home back from our trip he just put a heart react on my message and that was it. i dont think i can push it anymore i should wait for him to write me and im dying thinking he might never write again. ah well i ended up being hurt despite all my efforts not to. thanks for reading. if you have any advice about how to handle this it would be highly appreciated.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 05:04:53 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j4njw2,im helping someone and everyone tells me im a great person for that but i dont really feel that way.,there is this girl im helping out because she was kicked out of her place. she is not my friend just an acquaintance of a good friend of mine. she is staying with me for a bit because i have the space. i also got her a job at the same warehouse im at. everyone is telling me that it is such a nice thing to do and that im such a good person. honestly i dont feel that way. i usually just respond with im just doing what i wish someone would do for me on that situation. i dont really feel that way i dont really care about it. the only reason some people at work know my boss and a few coworkers in management its because i dont want rumors going around seeing us on the same car or getting in together. i know im supposed to feel flattered about the compliments and all that but it just feels awkward to me. there was a time i would be happy for all the good comments but now it just feels hollow.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 04:39:19 UTC,1,2,1.0,,,0,0
1j4njl4,what is the actual contribution of entertainers and influencers to society?,what is the actual contribution of entertainers and influencers to society? growing up i always thought about what my contribution to society would be. i believed that a meaningful life should involve helping others in a tangible waywhether its building bridges being a doctor who treats patients a teacher who educates or even a wedding planner who helps people organize one of the most important days of their lives. even a makeup artist contributes by helping people feel comfortable in their own skin through skillful techniques. but when i look at idols entertainers and influencers i cant help but wonder what is their actual purpose beyond surfacelevel happiness? sure they make people feel entertained maybe even inspired but does that really compare to professions that create real change? and yet these are the people society worships the most. they get millions live in luxury and are treated like theyve accomplished something greatwhile doctors engineers teachers and everyday workers struggle for recognition or financial stability. it feels unfair that popularity is more valuable than actual contribution. i know entertainment is a part of life and im not saying its useless. but on a deeper level i wonder what even is their life purpose? if your whole job is just singing dancing or making videos whats the end goal? its not like theyre solving world problems creating lasting change or advancing society. does anyone else ever think about this? or am i just overanalyzing it?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 04:38:48 UTC,1,3,1.0,,,0,0

1j4ndms,my cousin abused me,i guess my cousin abused me idk if this is the right sub. i found the confession sub tonight but the rules didnt seem right for this but i kinda felt like talking about it. i have never talked about this once in my life. ever. this is so weird. when i was 7 my 12year old cousin asked if i wanted to practice kissing while my dad had put us down for a nap. my dad putting us down for a nap at that age is also weird to me now as an adult but anyway thats what happened well basically what happened was it went a bit further but the way i remember it is her shutting me down after i was cool with it after. i dont want to get too into the details. its one of those things where i have never been upset with her about it at all. in my mind we were both children. even as an adult i wonder what happened to her? but i think ive also never really seen it as abuse or whatever. is there a way to reconcile it without demonize the perpetrator? because i dont think she deserves that. i should probably saying this to a therapist and not reddit but its kind of one of those things i tend to feel like it out of my mind but obviously its probably not. anyway. im honestly nervous posting something so vulnerable on the internet but its a throwaway and i can delete so. but. ive never said this to a single soul.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 04:29:22 UTC,3,3,1.0,,,0,0

1j4n9fx,went to a bar with my friends and realized we were sitting opposite to a girl on a date with a guy i used to date,to be honest im just venting. im so indifferent to the whole situation. also i just want to share that i only wish him well and not trying to paint him as the bad guy. just wanted to make some sense of the night. the chances of it happening is just so little since he doesnt even live close to that neighborhood and its not close to mine either. somehow i ended up seeing him with another girl. immediately made me remember the last time we spent time together. to paint the picture he kept rationalizing being not ready for monogamy with me. a lil context he already talked about him only beingwanting to be in monogamy. he admitted to me that he was seeing other people while he was with me context we saw each other every other dayish. lastly after trying to rationalize he started talking about all things that his ex did to him that hurt him for an hour. during that bit i didnt say a word and i just had my eyes down low listening. he didnt even caring if im feeling anything in that moment. not even checking in on me. rambling about all details of why he called off the wedding for an hour. which just reflects how unhealed he was. he got up to use the washroom and mentioning returning and before he came back my uber was booked and already waiting for me. i chose myself. a bit more context im not trying to paint him as the bad guy he was nice to me but people can be flawed and unhealed. he was the one to start talking about futureplanstrips and we even started doing exercise together. he proudly showed me to his family and also was the one mentioning proudly that hes dating me i admit though im happy for him to be going to dates i felt a bit sad. part of the sadness is some dysphoria. seeing him with a cis girl made me feel gender dysphoria i felt like im not as feminine as cis girls which is partly true. even thought that he must have left me because im trans could be the truth but with a very little possibility hes bi. the past bunch of months i have been thinking about it enjoying the happy return to singlehood and having nothing to do with dating. im choosing peace of singlehood and enjoying company of the ones i love giving them more time white_heart,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 04:22:44 UTC,6,5,0.88,,,0,0
1j4mzu2,my ex best friend tried to ruin my life because my brother rejected her 10 years ago. she wont stop.,this started years ago now and ive pretty much let it go but i never talked about it fully with people out of trying to not pull people into it when it was happening so here goes. warningits long lol i met this friend through another friend and we quickly became close. we ended up working together as well for my parents another area of my life i needed to have boundaries but i was 19 and thought it would be fine would hang out after work we called each other twin because we had a lot in common. we got hired for a creative project together as we were both into photography. we worked on personal creative projects together we were together constantly. we were teenagers and as teenage girls often are we were constantly talking about different guys we were interested in and i found out she was interested in my brother. they went on a date and my brother very quickly realized they were not compatible. this is where i can pinpoint a change in our friendship. she stopped asking me to hang out. i would ask her to hang out and she would be busy. she would constantly hang out with our mutual friends. at the time i thought reaching out and asking if i had done anything wrong to warrant not being invited places i had previously been invited to was the right choice and got told dont worry about it everything is good. i was getting married at the time and had already asked her to be my maid of honor so i assumed that maybe it was a rough patch i was stressed etc. tip dont assume everything is fine shes in all my wedding photos now lol the real switch to trying to ruin my life was after i got married. i have been photographing for years and decided to try to pursue it as a business as my parents business had closed. she hated that because she did photography too and suddenly any similarities we had were me copying her. i posted a story on ig about prices she posted the original is always better than the copy. one of her friends that i didnt know was her friend at the time modeled for me and she posted that people always try to undercut your business. at one point i posted something i dont even remember what it was at this point and she posted within 5 minutes and said okay shes obviously copying me right? now full transparency i did not handle this well. i tried to talk it out with her tried everything i knew and she would smile to my face and tell me everything was okay and then continue to do this. i found myself looking at her posts constantly because she would never say what i had done to hurt her to my face but would post consistently so i felt like at least i could try to piece together what had gone wrong and also if she felt i had been copying her i wanted to make sure i didnt post anything similar to her because i genuinely just wanted it to stop. we talked a couple times tried to make amends but she still would post about me often. a couple years later i did a photoshoot with another photographer modeling for me for a concept around a pregnancy loss. i have chronic health issues and so does this photographer and i decided to center it around healing. it was a beautiful project. the day i posted about it she posted a video on tiktok that said if you want to be me just say that. i didnt follow her but with her being a contact in my phone sometimes her videos would still pop up. that was it. after all the posts and all the years of just dealing with it i was done. she had tried to isolate me from members of my husbands family she had deleted texts and then posted screenshots of our conversations and i had just turned the other cheek but if she could somehow take a photoshoot about my pregnancy loss and make it about her i was done. i blocked her on everything. and then i started seeing friends of hers looking at my posts so i blocked several of them as well. im 28 now and have a wonderful life with my husband and our son. i do photography part time now so i can stay home and take care of him. i have talked to her once since and i asked her why she did all of that. she told me that it was because she had a hard time with her dynamic with my brother and my family after working for my parents. i asked her specifically what i did and all she said was that i was clingy and she wanted other friends. i personally have let a lot of it go but theres always little reminders of it because our circles are so intertwined and tonight i feel like its okay to talk about to strangers on the internet because i never said anything to anyone else when it was happening except for my husband and a few friends never did anything about it and just prayed she would stop. so theres that. just a big ol get it off my chest. the biggest thing i learned from it is friends that arent willing to talk through it are not friends i want to have and that sometimes you just need to block and walk.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 04:08:07 UTC,1049,17,0.99,,,0,0

1j4kufy,update my cat keeps sniffing my butt and im over it,see original post my gyno visit was today but still no updates on butt cancer or cancer up the coochie. my theory is that my cat is just a horny bastard. i was spending some time with her tonight and i noticed she kept trying to sniff my privates. im currently in my fertile window and im supposed to be ovulating. i think because penny isnt fixed yet she can smell my hormones and it makes her go crazy. my next theory is that her dad was orange but other than that the only reason that could explain her behavior is that i synced hormone cycles with my cat. this was not on my bingo card,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 02:14:44 UTC,3,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j4kkmx,i didnt want to rehome a cat,this is not so much a post asking for advice as much as it is about being upset that i had to do it. my girlfriend and i moved in together in wisconsin last sept. i have 2 cats boy and girl who are siblings gf hashad 1 girl cat. her cat and my boy cat got along fine but my girl cat kept bullying her. trying to attack her while shes trying to eat or trying to hit her while shes nearby. cut to i had to move to wa for a new job since i got laid off. gf moved a few months later. we brought our cats over. the behavior continued so we had my two cats in our bedroom and the girl cat had the rest of the house to herself. we tried a fresh reintroduction and it seemed to be getting better but my girl cat started attacking her again. she peed on the carpets a few times and then peed on a chair when we tried to move her so we could sit on it. this never happened before when she was a single cat when she just lived with my gf. she didnt have problems with people either but i dont think she was happy with the other female cat. she was not having a great time. we had to decide to rehome her and gf and i are distraught.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 02:01:23 UTC,1,2,0.67,,,0,0
1j4k76n,my lesbian coworker has given me hope for the world,and myself i guess. backstory about five years ago the woman that was my soulmate and best friend called off the engagement. it hurt and sudden. within two years she was dead. shed been diagnosed with terminal cancer didnt tell me and left because she didnt want me to deal with that i found out from mutual friends years later after the funeral. it hurt confusing and i got real cynical about life. relationships. all that. it was bad for a while but i worked thru it. since then ive been mostly single. sort of a loner. dated nothing serious. closed myself off from friends too. life moves forward. career takes off. my job requires a lot of moving. enter my lesbian friend who is honestly funny and so good hearted that its made the craziness of the world bearable. im a male. we became quick friends both being new and looking for things to do. shes refilled my faith in humanity. shes got hobbies independent ideas and cares about people she doesnt know. she has sympathy for people that hate her. shes willing to be the butt of the joke and then dish it out. i want to make clear that this isnt about a secret love or desire to date her to get over my ex fiancé. shes just a good person and friend. i just like her. shes helped me realize how much ive shut myself off from the world. and shes reminded me of why its so important to have connections and friends. shes a bit of an introvert and im too so weve been helping each other with that. feels good which i need in the world today. she has a girl shes trying to get the courage to ask out. im trying to convince her to do it like my friends did with my exfiancé a long time ago. she deserves a shot at happiness. but i wouldnt have thought that for myself six months ago. this excellent lesbian friend has helped me rediscover the part of me that loves human connection. and it means so much. since our friendship started i feel the first genuine desire in years to try snd do things and date. to make friends and connect with others. to be part of the world deeply and meaningfully. im so thankful to her for being just such an awesome friend by just being herself shes helped me in so many ways shell never know. i think my exfiancé wouldve liked her a lot. and i hope all of you will have the chance to have a really great lesbian friend who will help give you faith in humanity too. we need that.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 01:43:06 UTC,196,16,0.94,,positive,0,0
1j4judy,i was the daughter they finally learned how to control.,everyone talks about the eldest daughter trauma the one who raised her siblings like a second mother the one who carried the whole house on her back while nobody even asked if she was tired. but no one ever talks about the last daughter the one everyone thinks had it easy. the one who was loved a little more spoiled a little more protected a little more but never really seen. they say i was the lucky one the child who walked on a path already cleared by others. i always knew when to be careful and when to stay silent because my sisters had already made the mistakes i wasnt allowed to make. every fight had already been fought before i even reached that age. every heartbreak came with a warning before i could fall too deep. they think i had it easy because i never had to struggle for my freedom. what they dont know is i never got the chance to fight for it either. i was the daughter who grew up watching the cracks in the house but i was never allowed to acknowledge them. i was the one who learned how to laugh off the fights how to pretend i didnt hear the shouting behind closed doors. i was the daughter who learned how to act dumb because if i smiled enough if i played the little girl they wanted me to be theyd believe they protected me from the ugliness of this house. what they never realized is i saw everything. i just stayed silent because youngest daughters arent supposed to know what pain looks like. nobody ever asked how i felt. nobody ever wondered if i was okay because the youngest ones are always supposed to be happy by default. i became the light of the house not because i wanted to but because someone had to be. the clown who made everyone laugh at the dinner table so they could forget how broken everything really was. the one who took up responsibilities without being asked peeling garlic in the kitchen making tea for guests finishing the little chores nobody wanted to do. not because anyone told me to but because the guilt of letting my mother do it alone would eat me alive. i was the obedient one the daughter who never crossed the line. the one who said yes to everything who stayed quiet when she wanted to scream who shrunk herself down to fit into the version of me they wanted to see. my sisters got to rebel got to be wild got to disappoint the family but by the time it was my turn my mother was already too tired. there was no space left for me to be difficult. i had to be the perfect daughter. the easy one. the one who never asked for too much. maybe thats why i feel so distant from my own mother. she had nothing left to give by the time i came along. i watched her have those long deep conversations with my sisters conversations i never got to have. the only thing she gave me was rules. maybe she thought if she was harder on me she could save at least one daughter from turning out like the rest. i was always loved. i was always taken care of. but not because of who i was because thats just what youre supposed to do with the youngest child. love them spoil them protect them but never really see them. nobody ever wonders what happens when the child who made everyone laugh starts crying behind closed doors. nobody wonders if the girl who had it easiest was silently drowning in the weight of trying to be perfect. they called me lazy when i took two gap years not knowing i spent more time peeling vegetables with my mother than studying for my own future. they called me spoiled when i got everything i wanted not knowing i gave up dreams before i could even name them just to make life easier for everyone else. they called me the lucky one but how lucky can you be when your whole life is built around making sure nobody in the house feels like they failed you? i was never the rebel but i dont think i ever wanted to be the perfect daughter either.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 01:25:32 UTC,88,34,0.86,,,0,0
