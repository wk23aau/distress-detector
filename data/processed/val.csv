1j3jx39,Let my girlfriends cat out because it didnt like me and now I feel guilty about it,Posting on a throwaway for very obvious reasons The cat is fine I do see it roaming around from time to time Ive been dating my girlfriend for roughly 4 years We dont live together but we are looking for places However I was so apprehensive because I hated her cat and her cat hated me Im not much of a cat person and I understand my energy was probably off putting to the cat But Ive always tolerated it the best I could despite its dislike of me She went on a week long work trip 2 months ago and asked me to just stop by and feed her cat as well as check on her apartment to make sure all is well Sure whatever I agreed Her cat got nasty with me day one and I ignored it Second day same thing By the third day I couldnt take it and I just couldnt imagine living with this stupid cat So I grabbed it and let it outside through the window She lives on the first story so the cat was fine I placed it on the ground and let it leave Im not a total monster The next day I went to the shelter when they had an open appointment and looked for a cat that looked identical to her cat She had a generic black cat so it wasnt hard I brought it to her apartment and left it at that She came back and everything had seemed fine Shes only noted that the cat was skittish at first but we both just chalked it up to it being the first time she was away from home for so long I dont necessarily feel guilty because she seems happy but I do feel slightly guilt over my actions I needed to tell someone even if its the online void just to get it off of my shoulders,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 19:57:47 UTC,0,27,0.06,,,0,0
1j5f159,Im going to visit the place Ive always wanted to move to and Im not telling anyone,Basically the title I 22F am going to visit the city Ive always wanted to move to I want to visit not in a tourist way but staying in the areas where it would make sense for me to live in I will decide if it is a fit for me and if it is I will start going around and looking for jobs I have an idea how to get a place there finding a sublet for a few months and eventually trying to lease I have lived in a similar city so I have an idea of how to go about it I currently live with my dad and I have come up with a complete lie to tell to him I am visiting my college town to see friends for a birthday I am going 1000 miles away from there loudly_crying_face I have lived with my dad for the last year and Ive enjoyed it but I need to be alone I feel like an adult and I want to act independently and be able to be myself I just feel like he will be angry that I am going to this city when I live with him because if I can afford to do this then I should be helping out more I will be honest I partially took a term off so I could focus on moving out because I find this more important at this point in my life I do not think I can be open about it since the city seems unrealistic in his eyes The last time I moved when I went to college he said youll be back in a year and when I had to move back due to tuition issues he said I told you so I didnt stay with him for long that time but I bounced back This time when I move I wouldnt have to worry about tuition I would be focused on making sure I make 3x or more on rent which is why IF I like it I will be looking at jobs and be able to figure my life out as woman in my 20s I am so excited I guess I wanted to share my excitement to go with someone so Im doing it with the internet I know this sounds like Im more anxious which I am but I know Im doing the right thing,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 04:14:46 UTC,9,2,0.91,,,0,0
1j49dv1,I think my perception of a healthy relationship is whats sabotaging them,Most of my perception comes from observing from my parents relationship They love each other a lot and spend pretty much all of their time together However there are times when my mom feels a bit smothered by my dad and this has led to arguments in the past but I would say that overall she enjoys spending most of her time with him Ive even tried inviting her to different events but she would often turn me down to spend time with my dad I feel like this has led me to create an unrealistic expectation that my partner and I should be spending a lot of our time together A few of my partners have told me that they felt smothered or that I was never satisfied with them Was it a matter of different needs or was I truly doingexpecting too much Or is it a little bit of both People say a relationship is supposed to feel easy or natural in the beginning but its never felt that way for me I have to be doing something wrongwhether its not communicating well enough expecting too much from my partner or not setting firm enough boundaries for myself or maybe all of the above,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 18:02:26 UTC,1,4,1.0,,,0,0
1j5ox11,Boyfriend wants to get married and Im indifferent towards it,Back story Im F28 and my M30 wants to be married We were on and off from the years I was 1920 and when I turned 21 we got together offically and I was convinced by him and his mom to move in since I was living alone and my parents are retired in a different country From the years 1922 he was just not nice very rude and he would always choose his friends over me and his friends were always females In the early stages his friends or family will tell him to leave me and he would do it and then be adamant on staying friends when I would say no He also kept crying to me about his ex and how much she hurt him and he hid the fact he would talk to her mom like once a week When I found out he stood his ground and said no to cutting her off He only agreed to cut her off because I was pregnant with his child When I turned 23 during Covid we fell pregnant although I took Plan B I didnt realize I was ovulating so it didnt work We kept our son but he was just so rude during my pregnancy he took it upon himself to be there for a female friend all because she was dating a guy and needed help and instead of her going to her female friends my bf was always available He went as far as to stay out all night and get drunk with her and their other friends and the guy she was dating when I didnt want him to and when he returned home he cursed me and his mother out because I held him back in life I also had told him for years how important marriage was to me and he was just so whatever about it I told him while I was pregnant just ask with a ring pop since we didnt have too much money and I wanted to be married before having a kid and he came home a few days later and as I was lying on the couch he threw the ring pop and said you going to say yes right I said no because he made it seem like a chore or obligation rather than him wanting to He also spend all my pregnancy mad at me because I didnt want to name our son after him When Ive told him since I was 19 and even before when we were sort of friends at 16 that I do not want to name my son after their father name Fast forward our son is born and he is currently 4 and throughout these 4 years he keeps wanting to be married and I told him unless he has a career were he can care of the home expenses what is the point Since our son been born Ive made almost all the money paid our rent our bills hes has jobs here and there He just made one year at his current job and he does pay his part but even before our son and now Im also paying like 6070 and he pays the rest and theirs been times Ive paid 100 I told him if he becomes a police officer id feel okay and comfortable marrying him since its a good paying job and he can support us and he wants to and hes doing it for him and for us to be married But I also feel so indifferent like I dont see the excitement in calling him my husband since we skipped over the step Sometimes I feel like its my fault and I should of ignored that he threw a ring pop at me and other times I feel like if I would of accepted it I would be open to constant disrespect from him in the future Him as a father super good and kind he takes our son to school and picks him up he lets me sleep in and sleep whenever He tries to pay for dates when we are out our son and him have a strong bond He gets me flowers offers to cook even it it doesnt taste the greatest Overall him as a dad and a partner is nice I do feel spoiled But because I cant let go of how he treated me Im always going to have this fever hes going to revert back,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 14:15:54 UTC,3,9,1.0,,,0,0
1j73abs,I Ran Away from Home at 13 to Escape Abuse Now Im Trying to Change My Life,I Ran Away from Home at 13 to Escape Abuse Now Im Trying to Change My Life I dont know if my story matters to anyone but I feel like I need to let it out Maybe someone out there understands what its like I grew up with my grandmother when I was little and she made me feel loved She taught me kindness humility and the importance of sharing even when you dont have much I still carry that with me today But when I was five she had to leave and I was sent to live with my mom She tried her best she worked abroad to support me Eventually I was left along with my half siblings to their grandmother and thats when everything changed From the time I was six until I was thirteen I was abused Not just words physical beatings that left my skin red and bruised My teachers saw the marks but I told them I fell What else was I supposed to say No one would have believed me anyway My only escape was watching TV dramas I cried along with the characters because for a moment it felt like I wasnt alone I had no phone no way to tell my mom no one to vent to I tried everything to please her I got good grades I cleaned the house I did the dishes Nothing was ever enough Because in her eyes I didnt belong I wasnt of her blood No matter what I did I was unwanted So one day I left I walked nearly 6 kilometers to my grandmothers place It wasnt my first time running away I even did it once when I was six but that time I brought a school friend with me Their grandmother was furious that I brought their grandchild along with me tbh I didnt know what I was thinking I was still a child that time in 2nd Grade But this time I was alone and determined When I finally arrived my grandmother wasnt upset she was happy to see me She took me in without question It was only after the third time I ran away that she finally got mad and went straight to confront the woman who had abused me That was the moment I finally felt safe My grandmother has been my safe space ever since But the past doesnt just disappear Even after escaping I still struggled In 7th grade I got dengue and had to be hospitalized for a month Thats when the doctors found other health issues but I was never told what they were No one ever explained anything to me At least my stay was covered by PhilHealth so it didnt add to my problems Now Im 19 but I still feel stuck I have trust issues I struggle with selfworth Sometimes I wonder if Im the problem if Ive just been blaming my childhood for everything But I also know I want to break free from this cycle I want to change I want a better life I want to help others like me I want to leave an impact and make a difference And if I want that I have to keep going,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 08:30:36 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j7qf3k,I caught my boyfriend masturbating to other women,I know this doesnt seem like a big deal but my heart hurts This weekend I was using his phone to look up a restaurant and I saw in his search historybar that he looked up at least 2 specific womens only fans leaked And he clicked on multiple websites just to find these womens leaked images I also thought to look at his twitter after finding this out and saw he looked them up there too Between these 2 women he clicked on at least 10 different websites to find these womens leaked photos the funniest part is that me and these women look nothing alike These women are beautiful dark hair dark eyes While Im a redhead with blue eyes Our bodies are completely different as well I just feel ugly He was saying all men do it but I dont believe that It just hurts that he sought these women out hard to find pictures of them to pleasure himself to when weve been in a committed relationship I know this is a controversial thing among people but Ive always thought why do you feel the need to pleasure yourself to other women when you have me And finding out these women look nothing like me just makes me feel not good enough and it makes me feel so ugly He knows Ive battled with weight and eating disorders and I feel like this is making it worse and it is torturing me The worst part to me is he sought so hard for pictures of them when he went across multiple social media platforms to find them and pleasure himself and knowing they dont look like me and knowing hes in a committed relationship How can I believe when he calls me beautiful yet pleasures himself to women that look nothing like me EDIT his needs are being met someone told me I should mention this as well but I can assure you his needs are met with how much we go at it Also he doesnt like me masturbating to other men So I dont masturbate to other men but he is masturbating to other women even though I dont like it So Im also upset about that because I followed his wishes but he doesnt follow mine,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 04:18:16 UTC,17,238,0.53,,,0,0
1j4an82,I loved her but I was never enough,One night at a bar I met her She was different Beautiful poetic full of life in a way I hadnt seen before She looked at me like I mattered and for the first time in a long time I felt seen We worked in the same company but had never noticed each other before that night From that moment on my life revolved around her We werent officially together but we acted like we were Shed come over almost every night wed talk for hours fall asleep in each others arms It felt real It felt worth fighting for But she kept saying she wasnt ready for a relationship I told myself to be patient to wait until she healed from her past But months passed and nothing changed Every time I tried to define what we were she pulled away And yet she always came back She had a drinking problem I picked her up from bars when she was too wasted to get home I held her hair back when she was sick tucked her into bed made sure she was okay I cleaned up the messes she madeliterally and figuratively And still I wasnt enough She had a kid and I got along with her so well I ignored the fact that she still lived with her exhusband in the same apartment One night after yet another drunken call she told me she had kissed another guy A few months later she admitted she had slept with her ex And yet I stayed Not because I had no selfrespect but because I loved her Because I convinced myself that maybe love was enough But it wasnt I convinced myself we werent dating I guess she convinced me too The night she finally agreed to date me it wasnt out of loveit was out of guilt Because I cried in front of her Because I was breaking Because she saw what she was doing to me It wasnt the kind of love I wanted It wasnt real And yet I held on for months hoping things would change They didnt I should have left the first time she hurt me I should have walked away when she made it clear I was just convenient But I didnt And it cost me more than I ever imagined I dont know why Im writing this Maybe just to get it out of my system Maybe because deep down I still love her Or maybe I just need someone to tell me that it wasnt my fault,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 18:52:30 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j54p4q,I hate one guy at work,TW Violence and threats I work at a care home for people with various physical and mental disabilities The one thing I absolutely hate is how passive management is with the participants They let them make any decision they want even if it ends up with someone falling down the stairs with little to no consequences The one guy they are horrible with and let him get away with anything He is extremely violent and has hurt me and others on numerous occasions The only consequence he faces is when he breaks things he just doesnt get to use it till its fixed or replaced Which is nothing the worst part is this guy is smart and knows he can do whatever he wants and get away with it The worst time I experienced this was when me and another staff took him out to buy him candy with his own money He wanted to buy a knife it was a butter knife and we said no It took alot just to get him away from the knifes and out the door We managed to get him some of his candy and as protocol we gave him some Still mad with us daring to say no he threw the candy at me and tried to run back to the store to get the knife so I can stab you fckers I had to do a hold to stop him from going too far and hurting someone else However the hold we are trained to do doesnt restrain both hands so they decided to scratch at my arm hard to the point I was bleeding It took a long time to calm him down and get him back in the car The part that broke me was the fact he wanted me the one shaking and crying to apologize and my coworker who did nothing but call management to let them know what was going on also tried to get me to apologize I couldnt cause I went completely nonverbal and just got in the car I missed a week of work cause I was terrified of that participant and was locked up in my room I filed a report for injuries but nothing came of it Now I just hate the participant Ill never do anything to hurt or try and upset him but I will always hate him and wish for his downfall One thing I want to note is that I understand alot of the people I work with cant control how they act This one in particular also struggles to control their anger However Ive seen them handle no from their parents and staff he likes and he was completely fine He just doesnt like me and gets upset any time I ask him to do something or deter him away from dangerous things Im not rude about it I always ask very nicely Im just not a guy or pretty enough so he hates me TLDR I despise a guy cause he can get away with anything he wants including hurting others and he knows it,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 20:06:44 UTC,0,2,0.33,,CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCEDEATH,0,0

1j7pm91,I dont think my boyfriend will ever love me,Not putting ages but Im a woman dating a man for that context We both told each other prior to us even being official that we dont really know what it means to be in love but based on everything i have read i believe i am in love We have been together for a short time but have known each other for a long time I dont believe he will ever love me and theres an internal dichotomy of i am okay with unrequited love because we make a good partnership and he is sweet and considerate to me and what is wrong with me why am i not enough what if one day he realizes he can do better and leaves me I worry a lot when were together lately that hes thinking of someone else a past love maybe someone hes still in love or obsessed with I of course cannot ask him because it would kill me if the answer is yes he is thinking about someone else and wishes i was her instead I already know that hes never really had feelings towards me which is leading to my skepticism so far I can take him at face value now when he says he likes me but it didnt come easy and doesnt come without a voice in the back of my mind saying its not true I found out tonight that basically Im coming on too strong i guess with verbal affection i miss you things like that and i worry that turns him off from me I worry that it makes him not want to be with me I worry that it makes him think Im desperate which he did essentially accuse me of a few weekends ago But i worry that it pushes him away from me He likes physical reassurances that i want to be with him physical affection and intimacy and i need the inverse to feel secure And i can tell hes making an effort i think he can tell Im making an effort But I worry Ive pushed things too far by being too verbally affectionate Im worried hes thinking of breaking up with me This weekend I have been considering telling him I love him and its okay if he doesnt return the feeling but now I cant I try very hard to be present and suppress my fears and insecurities when were together but Im sure its noticeable at times still There are women from his past I know he had a thing for and I feel so uncomfortable when he talks about them I dont know if hes noticed that and he doesnt do it often but it is very painful I wonder if he wishes I was one of them instead of who I am He has denied it but I do still think a huge reason hes with me is my body I know hes been attracted to me physically all these years and so I worry that that is the main draw to me the main thing that makes him want to stick around I worry another reason is because were getting older and we both feel like were missing life milestones and we could be each others solution for that I am so insecure and scared and worried in this relationship but I have wanted it for over 10 years more than 10 years have I had a crush on him So I am okay with the fact he will never love me But I do need to cry about it sometimes,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 03:32:05 UTC,2,1,0.63,,,0,0

1j62wut,nex fiancé ruined my life blamed me for it and then admitted he was never capable of it,just saw a post about their narc maybe being DL and im realizing mine definitely was and after everything he did and blaming me for it he said thats why he did it and couldnt have let us every happen or get married bc of his hidden desires exact quote at the bottom in the beginning he said he had a deep fetish he said it was humiliation at first then the real truth was later revealed to me and then it wasnt until after the break up he said there was sissy and cross dressing and that he might be gay which is so bizarre bc one he only ever told me about the real kink way later and never told me the full details of it and he loves women sexually and is very sexual and addicted to porn but he was interested in trans women and anal sex i guess its wild bc he always said he could never be in a relationship with a man bc he needed a woman who was submissive and he had control over basically he wanted a woman in her feminine energy but wasnt safe enough to let me stay there after our break up also he went on a power kick after i was trying to say goodbye like i guess trying to regain power and he was being agressive and telling me to submit and basically confirm that he was right and i was wrong and legit got hard from it the next day i said i will only submit to a man who protects and takes care of me and does not abuse me and he said he would still abuse me and i should stop whinning about it there were times he wanted to have sex with me while watching porn and wouldnt show what the porn was or giving him bjs and hjs while he watched porn ive posted my story lots but have left out this major detail bc it felt wrong to discuss but for reference we got engaged i uprooted my life to go move in with him in another state 6 days after the proposal and me thousands of dollars deep into the move he called it off unprovoked bc by this time i had been perfect according to his unreasonable standards but he still blamed me this is all after months of emotional and verbal abuse i lost my home a job a baby mental health love my best friend my safety the realization is he legit told me he loved his fetish and addictions more than me and he also said after he broke off our engagement and putting me through absolute hell and destroying my life and financially abusing me and me loosing my home to go move with him after our engagement AFTER blaming me for the reason why he did it and a couple weeks after i came back to my state and was recovering from the move he said So we get married have kids And I say by the way I love wearing diapers Dressing as a girl and letting dudes or someone fuck my ass I wasnt gonna let that happen and that he wasnt sure if he was bi or gay i couldnt tell if he was saying all of that as a ploy to make it easier to be friends with him bc he was actively saying he wanted me in his life and he said would it be easier if i were gay and then told me all those things idk if it was more manipulation or if its true i know his kink is a major thing and it wasnt something i was into and he wants to be with someone romantically who isnt into in but still have sexual encounters with people who are into his kink i can never tell when he was being honest or just saying something to get a certain reaction out of me there were several times hed say im going to go fuck this girl tonight bc you stress me out and then id find out he was home along and not with her his mom would tell me or he later would tell me he never did there were plenty of cases like this too he would just say things to make me believe it so i couldnt tell if he was saying he might be gay for that instance too idk in no way am i being insensitive to sexuality or kinks i was very supportive to him through it all but this is just making me realize he was never going to follow through and legit used me he basically admitted to putting me through hell abusing me very thoroughly blaming it allllll on me and my character flaws made me lose my home to move states with him tell me entire family we got engaged lose my job and spend thousands on moving lose a child all to cancel our engagement and move during a mania spike he had and BLAMES IT ON ME all while he was literally never going to be capable of following through there were so many signs too im realizing now that ive missed he used to straight up tell me that he was mirroring me and i thought that was weird bc women typically mirror the man he used to also say hed just find someone to marry him out of convenience bc he wasnt capable of love he was always so selfish in every aspect of our lives he always made it known to everyone and called me his wife and loved the image that it gave him but treated me like dirt this man was straight up telling me he was a narcissist and i missed the signs in a haze he emotionally verbally mentally and financially abused me for literally nothing bc i was kind and sweet and supportive and empathetic and showed him love he couldnt even fathom he literally watched me as i bent over backwards for him and took care of him and lost the stability in my life to create one with him while he was just belittling me and destroying my worth and esteem he needed control over me bc he lacked it in his own life and addictions and self and was never going to marry me or create the life together we planned bc his demons and desires would have never allowed it even when i was accommodating and understanding but the blame is all on me for loving him and having needs theres so many factors to this and so many versions of him its hard to wrap my head around it all,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:01:38 UTC,5,5,0.7,,,0,0

1j3arxo,I Work in a massive privately owned manufacturing companyThe Corruption CoverUps and Nightmare Work Culture They Dont Want You to Know About,I have to be as vague as possible because if this company is identified and they figure out who I am not even kiddingI feel like theyll come looking Lol No joke this privately owned would be fortune 500 corporate giant makes Black Mirror feel a little too real Some real Dr Evil shark tank with piranhas type stuff lol The company I work for is responsible for just about everything plastic If its plastic packaging theres a good chance it passed through here I live in a place so small its not even a townits officially considered a village No McDonalds barely any businesses and one massive factory that showed up about 20 years ago and just kept growing What started as a laidback trustworthy workplace with great pay eventually expanded into multiple buildings and became the towns biggest employer Then after a major buyout billions of dollars started flowing through and everything changed Now you cant step into one of the two gas stations or small handful of stores without seeing someone wearing the company shirt they hand out But when outside corporate interests took over they started bringing in their own people handing out management positions to friends and running the place like a private club And once a company gets big enough in a small town theres no accountability What used to be a solid job turned into something straight out of an HBO drama The usual corporate nonsense got worsefudging time cards sexism favoritism and adjusting drug test results after major accidents But it doesnt stop there Were talking covering up assaults extreme drug use highranking executives not saying how high just in case cheating and keeping mistresses in plain sight in the giant glass HR building and fullblown criminal activity One of the companys truck drivers had a history of drinking on the job and multiple DUIs One day he drank before his shift and ended up ending a motorcyclist After what I can only assume was a ton of money changing hands it was swept under the rug No company name in the news just one vague article about a truck driver In a town this size that should have been the biggest headline of the year Instead Nothing When you work here long enough you start to feel like they could make you disappear if you did something they didnt like Im not some highranking executiveIm just a few steps above entrylevel still working on the factory floor But over time Ive pieced things togetherbetween constantly signing paperwork agreeing to their policies overhearing the right conversations and befriending a supervisor who introduced me to a highranking corporate employee who was a little too trusting with their secrets I still consider these people friends but the work environment is toxic and after enough time it starts to mess with your sanity We work 12hour shifts and if you think workplace screaming matches are rare try several a night The corporate systems they claim improve production dont actually work which throws everything into chaos Meanwhile the building managerwhos supposed to oversee operations regularly sleeps for half the shift hides in a janitors closet and watches movies But if we stray from their broken systems Its not pretty You can get written up for not wearing gloves while using a tape measure and speaking up about only getting one 10minute break in a 12hour shift is a quick way to get fired no questions asked And before you ask Why dont you just leavewell the pay was really good then and its REALLY good now and in a small town with almost no other highpaying jobs thats not an easy decision I want to highlight two specific incidents that really set the tone for what kind of company this is I have plenty more stories Id be willing to share if anyone is interested First not long ago an employeewho to be fair was very good at their jobhad a serious problem with anger and violent outbursts Whether there was something personal going on I dont know but theres no excuse for the level they took it to Were talking constant verbal abuse to all of his peers throwing heavy and sharp objects and even threatening to end multiple coworkerswhile openly keeping a weapon in his vehicle The companys solution Slap a No weapons sticker on the door and call it a day One time during a rage fit over a production issue he threw a metal holder containing a sharp industrial blade It hit a coworkerfortunately the injury wasnt severe but it was serious enough that it should have led to real consequences Instead behind closed doors the injured employee was convinced to stay quiet promised that action would be taken Nothing happened That same injured employee weeks later asked for a break after eight hours of nonstop hard labor and hinted that he might speak up about what had happened to him if he didnt at least get a few minutes to eat The next day He was fired The guy who threw the blade Still works here no consequences And the man who was fired One of the hardestworking most respectable guys Ive ever met This one really gets to me Now lets talk about one of the biggest food specific product not named companies in the country My company is pretty much the sole provider of all product for them and theres a strict rule in place a specific banned chemical cannot be used in any productionnot just in their products but in any product we run period To keep the contract we get frequent audits When that happens A fullscale coverup goes into motion That banned chemical is hidden on the highest warehouse shelves fake labels are created and paperwork mentioning it is thrown out and replaced after Employees in charge of this are explicitly told to make sure nothing with the chemicals name is left visible If this information ever got out I can guarantee that contract would be terminated immediately The deeper you go in corporate manufacturing the more you realizeethics are a PR stunt safety is a technicality and coverups are just business as usual Sorry for the long read but if you made it this far I seriously

the ends of the earth for them once he had to deliver something car oil at 6AM for his sister n her husband 6AM Mf usually wakes up at 2pm ffs 4 he has this obsession w fixing up old cars he would spend loads of money on it and w literally his blood sweat tears and his time Yo i dont mind mf got a hobby i got a hobby too thats great for him but wht abt when i need to shower Do i have to go outside to ask you to watch over our son again with your ugly smug face again to sum up he has 2 obsession league of legends and his car None of which you can bother him at all My hobby is just gym JUST GYM FOR 1 HOUR At which i can ONLY work out when my son takes his afternoon nap I just want him to evenly schedule his hobby not to the point he doesnt have time for his son or me Do u think he listens Nah Everytime i told him this hell be like this is the only time i can do this while im working at sea i cant do this stuff im like HELLO cars and games are forever Your wife and son could leave you or die anytime wtf is his mindset mahn istg hes still acts like a teenager I literally feel like i have 2 sons as of this time 5 his dirty clothes and socks Need i say more I feel like almost every wife experienced this 6 he spills his coffee and chocolate milk every where in the kitchen but never wipes it I once saw the mf VACUUMS his familys kitchen bc there was a spilled rice grains Basically hes really sloppy There are more but thats the top of my head Idk what I should do Everytime i tell him whats been bothering me we always have a huge fight and it always ends with ok i promise i wont do it again but he still does and its and endless cycle I cant leave him bc I literally have no money to raise my son alone AND my mom is getting old so i have to take care of her too So til now im just tolerating everything but it drains my energy so much but at the same time i put on a happy smile on my face for my son i dont ever want my son to see depressed or angry Mind you he used to b very sweet and thoughtful at the beginning of our dating life and marriage life I thought he was the most amazing guy I know he loves me and my son but i dont think he loves me enough to

1j3x4w1,My abusive mother tried to raise baby birds it did not go well,Edit i forgot the obligatory Click meniton I 16M have a mother who loves birds especially cockateils she has three in total until about 2 months ago two of them ended up getting a little too close and WHAM babies Now my mother is overall not very good at parenting she messed up me and my sister pretty bad But when it comes to her pets she at least acts like she loves them Now when these babies hatched two survived and they were looking really nice and healthy that was until a couple weeks ago my mother was starting to get annoyed at their constant screaming you know as babies do and decided that they were eating enough seed it wouldnt matter if they were seperated or not from their parents they were still being fed by their mother and father occasionally throughout the day so cue her forcibly taking them cramming them into a small cage and not letting them see their parents anymore so they wouldnt scream again i was going to say something but due to being too scared to say anything if anyone disagrees with her on something big she gets explosive i kept my mouth shut i mainly helped her with them when we had to hand feed them when they were infants so i wasnt as worried as checking on them as i should have been becuase i thought she could handle it aparently i was wrong she cant and her decision to seperate them ended up being fatal for the youngest in heindsight i think he was stressed from being seperated from his mom so suddenly and so he stopped eating according to my mom he haddent really been eating too much over the past two weeks or so ie since she seperated them i could be wrong though i have some experience with birds and i at least do my reserch the youngest couldnt stand up just trying to walk resulted in him just stumbling and falling over i asked my mom why dont we take them to an avian vet to see if something was wrong and her words were i dont want to deal with some sick bird its too stressful if they die they die and plus the vet bill will probably be 200 dollars and i dont want to spend that much so cue me flabbergasted i try and hand feed the bird at least a little bit and it works hes eating some and putting him on his mothers cage floor and hes slowly eating some seeds im estatic and i think oh ill check up on him in an hour cue me falling asleep for a few hours instead and i wake up to check on him and hes already passed away i tell her and what does she say oh well ill bury him tomorrow put him in a plastic bag until then not really relevent she buried all our previous pets in plastic ziplock bags and such so thats going to be a nice supprise for the next owner i recommended that she stop doing that but she still does anyway i cant belive im related to her how can one person be so heartless she loves all her pets until they get sick then theyre just another burden to her talk about unconditinal and worst thing is i bet she wont even listen and pretend like it died from some illness again it could have been something else but im pretty confident she killed it tldr my mom shouldnt have birds and especially never should have tried to hatch and raise baby cockateils if she really gets annoyed that easily birds will be noisey i know from experience,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 06:45:29 UTC,4,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j4bxql,The only thing I will ever regret,Hello everyone I 20m miss my 19f exgf so much When we first met eachother 2 years ago everything was perfect We were in love and having good times no matter what We were long distance about an hour and 30 minutes from each other and we hated it but it never mattered The more days that went by the more in love we were At the time I was struggling with really bad paranoia and I quit my job and ran away to go live with her I left my family and most importantly my grandmother behind I wanted to show her everything I wanted was with her and her only but I think that was one of the worst decisions we made during our relationship We were only together for 23 months at the time and I stayed with her brother while she lived with her mom and step dad We started spending every second together and it was just getting even better but we started getting aggravated with eachother more I eventually got a job 12 months after moving in with her brother Then things started to pick up again probably because of the motivation of going to work and getting money to spend on her She never cared about the money I did its the only way I knew how to prove my love Her mom and step dad were both alcoholics and abused eachother quite often and they really werent a fan of me for some reason They got in a fight one night and started treating my ex wrong so I stepped in and pulled her out of that situation before she got hurt and I took her to taco bell at 3am After that we started fighting a whole lot more because money was getting tight and it was the only thing that made me feel stable I wasnt comfortable living with her brother at all and was starting to wish I never moved in We started getting more and more distant until the day she got me a cat A beautiful baby and I named her Honey She was the sweetest thing ever and it brought me and my ex closer than ever Then I got kicked out of her brothers for unknown reasons I just had to be out by the weekend so I called up my family for some help and me and my ex moved into a camper with some of my distant relatives We were still arguing and growing more distant but we worked out some of the problems but it just wasnt enough We ended up moving back in with our families separately and only seeing eachother on the weekends but going from living with eachother for over a year and then all of a sudden splitting apart again brought some issues My trust issues got very very bad and I started with my outbursts and starting arguments for no reason We both did and we would blame eachother for everything I broke up with her and got back with her multiple times I started running from our problems and coming back expecting it to be the way it was when we first got together but it never turned out that way I started focusing on myself and what I could do to be better for her I tried so many things and so many ways but I could never find a way that worked and made us both happy I wanted it to work out so much but she got fed up with me and blocked me on everything I broke her heart so many times and lied to her because I didnt wanna admit I was wrong I miss her so god damn much and wish I could go back in time to fix things I want to hold her one more time I want to give her all the affection she deserves I wish I payed a little bit more attention to her and put myself to the side for once My only regret so far in life I wish I treated you a little bit better Peyton If by any chance you find this and read it just know Im still trying my best and not giving up just for the chance I get to love you like I should have Honey was the best thing we ever had and youre the only other person that I share those memories with You have her kitten and I miss getting to see her Youre my fucking soulmate Peyton and I will never love anyone else like I love you If my life ends with you not by my side then it was all a waste My life will have no meaning,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 19:43:50 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j72p6c,I was in an aya cult I told his wife and she didnt believe me,After returning home from an ayahuasca ceremony I got a message from a friend of mine whom I considered a spiritual brother He wanted to meet up I was still in that postceremony glowfull of energy despite the late hourand I wanted to socialize I live down a long dirt trail a 15minute walk from the nearest road When I got there he was waiting in his SUV I was excited to talk with him Right away he offered me some hard liquor saying This is what the indigenous people drink here Its very good for you But I had just returned from drinking ayahuasca and he knew that He wasnt speaking clearly but he started telling me stories about indigenous cosmology which fascinated meuntil the conversation took a turn He began talking about how husbands take other women and how normal it is Then he told me he needed someone spiritually on his level so they could have a deeper connection than with their actual partners I told him flat out I wasnt interested But I kept asking questions Does your wife know about these practices you do No no he said but its better for her Better for me too And for our children He started going on about how we dont marry the people we are equal towe marry the ones who are good for having kids That real spiritual connection is with extramarital lovers He kept inflating my ego using spiritual talk to manipulate me I asked if he had done this before Ive done it many times he admitted With many different women Then he put his hand on my leg I told him I was leaving But I made the mistake of trying to stay friendly Let me just show you one thing before you go he said He stopped me behind the car and hugged me Thats when I froze Trauma hit me like a wave This wasnt the first time something like this had happened to me and suddenly I was simultaneously trapped in his arms and in my past He pulled me tightly against him ran his hand down my back onto my hindquarters At the same time he started kissing melightly from my ear down to my collarbone My stomach churned with nausea I squirmed to get away He let go I was in full trauma response barely able to hold back tears Then he begged me not to tell his wife I barely managed a goodbye before I ran back up the hill to my house praying he wasnt following me A few days later I saw his wife Despite my own pain I felt it was my duty to tell her the truth about her husband Never mind my traumathis was her husband She deserved to know At first she seemed to believe me But later that day I got a message from her She repeated all his lies He told her I subconsciously wanted to be with him That based on our messages I must have known it was going to be romantic But that couldnt be further from the truth I was completely blindsided Now looking back I understand things I didnt back then At the time I was in a cult I believed that everyone in it was a good person incapable of this kind of thing If it were me now Id know better Id understand that if a married man asks a woman to meet him at 2 AM hes not looking to talk about life Full stop Today I saw both of them Seeing him again brought everything back how he lied how he got away with it how his wife believed him over me The anger and pain hit me like a tidal wave I wanted to punch his stupid mouth to do something to make him face the truth of what he did I even had a thought of roleplaying the situation in front of his wifeforcing her to see it so she would understand But I know deep down no matter what I do she probably wont believe me He has her wrapped in lies And Im the one left carrying all of this Ive been crying all day I feel so much anger hurt and grief I dont know how to process this,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 07:47:16 UTC,201,31,0.91,,,0,0

1j33mak,My marriage ended after 25 yrs,Im doing this on my phone so excuse the formatting And also excuse the rambling Upto 2023 my marriage was on good footing But then my physical and mental health took a nose dive I lost interest in sex and I couldnt explain why to my husband because I didnt know why My migraines were coming at 67 a week yes almost daily and lasting 612 hrs long and I was having issues with bleeding most of the time I have several other medical obstacles and I am considered disabled by social security I closed off thinking my husband didnt want to hear about my petty complaints Housework became his responsibility as well as cooking dinner on top of working full time I cant work due to my physical and mental health He was overwhelmed and asked if I could cook dinners again I did for about two weeks and then I couldnt because my migraines were making it hard to smell food let alone eating it My day basically was laying in bed all day listening to audiobooks to try to get my mind off the pain of the migraines Then at the end of May I had a needle biopsy of my thyroid come back abnormal most likely cancerous and that made me spiral more Thats when I got a text from an angry husband telling me that my husband was seeing his wife This happened within a few days of finding out I needed to get my thyroid out It was not a good week to say the least I immediately confronted my husband with the text and he confessed it true I thought it was only an emotional affair but he said it became physical back in April when he went on a Writers retreat with several people or so I thought It turns out it was just her and my husband I completely lost it and was sobbing in his arms This was not his first affair I asked him to break it off and go into counseling with me but he said no He cared for her and didnt want to lose or hurt her This was a major blow to me I had been seeing a therapist for a while but she retired So a week before I found out about my thyroid I started seeing a new counselor On my second appointment with her was a mess I told my counselor about my thyroid and of my husband cheating We had just celebrated our 25th anniversary before I had found out I started having suicidal thoughts and told her about them I even had a plan to carry out the suicide involving ODing on one of my meds She urged me to get a lockbox for that med and give the keys to my husband He still loves me but was not in love with me anymore He our 15 yr old son and I talked about the drug issue and it was decided for my safety that either my son or my husband would portion out the days worth of med about an hour before I was due to take it We didnt tell our son the exact reason why it needed to be controlled because we didnt want to alarm him I was spiraling down fast at this point I stopped going to my water aerobics class and became a recluse I didnt want to see anyone It was hard for me to focus on conversation so I lost interest in talking at all I was seeing my counselor weekly and my prescriber of my antidepressants and antipsychotics monthly That time is somewhat fuzzy in my head August comes around and they took out half my thyroid Turns out I had Medullary thyroid cancer in that half So they needed to remove the entire thyroid the other half was taken out in October That side was clean thank goodness They had caught it before it could spread outside my thyroid My husband started driving to see his AP on a biweekly basis We didnt tell anyone not even our son for a while We tried to keep things normalish as to not upset him My husband and I decided to remain friends at least and he wanted a divorce We broke the news to our son in December about us splitting up but he was the only one to know My parents arent the most forgiving people so we wanted to keep the news from them for as long as possible My relationship with my father is rocky at best My counselor and I were talking on a weekly basis at this point trying to reason with me that killing myself isnt the answer I knew I didnt want to die because of our son but that was the only reason I could even rely on Everything was just falling apart around me My husband moved out of our bedroom in December so I was sleeping alone And crying myself to sleep almost every night We would talk about his day in general and about our son but that was about it When my depression would spike and I was feeling very suicidal at one point I tried to find the key to the medicine safe he would talk me down I still dont know if that was a good thing or bad thing AP lives 8 hours from us So every other weekend he would drive to see her she filed for divorce a week before they met IRL in April and in her state you have to be physically separated for a year before the divorce is finalized her ex is an a and kept harassing me and my husband So a year after I found out May 24 my husband says he wants to move in with AP so he needs to get a job there I tell him I cannot stand to stay living in our townhouse as it has too many memories He suggested I look for another apartment that our son and I can live in after he moves We did just that He started working his new job the week after we moved to a flat July24 just before we moved we had to put down one of our cats she was fading and we didnt think shed survive the move plus she couldnt walk or use the litter box on her own Moving seemed to help my mental state Im not having as many panic attacks or psychosiss hearing voices that arent there Im able to do some of the housework myself cooking vacuuming keeping the kitchen wiped down my bedroom and my bathroom Our son now 16 does his own room his bathroom the dishes the trash and the kitty stuff like feed the cat and keep the litter clean We are currently working on a dissolution on our marriage Since we dont have much just a car really and our son there isnt too much to split We are on the same page about spousal and child support in the state I live in if youre married more than 25 yrs I get 30 of his income for the rest of our lives or until I marry again and child support until our son is 18 Our son and I get to see my stbx every 34 weeks for a weekend Its painful to be separated from him but it also hurts to see him I know I failed persevering_face and its mostly my fault our marriage ended Its

1j7gtg5,Am I entitled to feel in such a way,Hi this is my first reddit post and I need to get these feelings off my chest I just feel so angry and I hate it Context gt So around a year and three ish four months ago my father had died in hospital All shocking and scary times for me and my mom I was 16 at the time So I was quite affected and so was my mom We mourned for quite some time after his death And we went through a rough patch for a few months before we recovered So this is where the story starts my mother began chatting and dating around To which I was fine with as I was happy she wasnt mourning over my dad and was healing She dated a one or two guys before she found this guy Bill not real name who works as a driver They started dating and shit And I was quite okay with it Despite for a few times I was annoyed and irritated at him For starters my mom would never tell me if he was coming over And normally when Id wake up in the morning hed be in the kitchen with my mom drinking coffee This kinda annoyed me I didnt like this stranger enter my house where my father once lived I hated sharing my private personal space with this stranger I hated and still hate his presence in my house He is quite annoying as a person his like a kid Extremely curious and neat picking He laughs in a weird manner not a proper laugh He acts childish at times Hes obsessed with my pet budgie named tim not real name but he doesnt know how to hold him properly He constantly stresses my bird out Which i hate Anyways I always felt like my mother moved on way to quickly from my father And I quite hate it Im aware its her life and she can do whatever And that shes healing but its hurts seeing her do things she never do with my father My father wasnt physically the most affectionate as in ways of kissing or holding hands But he loved me and my mom in his own ways My mom truly loved my dad I dont know how to describe the emotions Im feeling Its difficult to explan everything I just dont like him and I hate his presence in my home I hate him touching things inside my house I find him irritating at times and annoying I feel these angry feelings I hate the fact I dont have mother daughter time with my mother As Bill comes over to sleep over like 3ish to 4 days a week Tuesday Wednesday Friday Sunday I quite missing going out with my mom on Saturday shopping or in town But now as bill sleeps over in Saturday he spends his day off Sundays with us And I hate that Every time I plan something with my mom on Sunday he always has to crash our daughter mother time I hate him kissing my mom Being all lovely dovey Im happy for her healing and being happy with someone But its not the same as it was I miss my dad Edit forgot to mention my mom literally babies him Every time he comes over she cooks all the time She never has a second to herself,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 20:28:05 UTC,1,5,1.0,,,0,0
1j5ez5s,I treated my for a broken handwrist as a kid and didnt knowrealize it until i was older very long read oof,i honestly really should probably talk abt this bc it honestly was actually pretty tramuatizing enough that i feel like i may have locked away some memories of what happened bc of just how awful some of the experience was my memory is somewhat spotty bc of how scary it all was but ill try my best to explain my friend had a Halloween party at her house we decided to play something that involved running which was a rather stupid decision as everything was slippery and dark outside i was running nearon ground that was steeply raised up a bit for a buliding to be bulit flat on i slipped and fell despite the mud when i instinctively reached out to brace myself by putting my hand out towards the top of the small slope i got hurt really really badly i had never been in such pain before i dont remember how quickly it arrived exactly but it was pretty quick to show up i started crying a soon as the pain hit and the girl i had been running behind took notice and from what i can remember asked if i was ok the other girls i was playing with eventually noticed and the escorted me to the house and to my friends mother who is a vetvet tech she wrapped it in blue vet wrap in the kitchen and asked if i wanted to go to the doctor and child me refused out if fear of possibly having to get surgery and probably bc i didnt want to inconvenience anyone the vet wrap was uncomfortable and irritating but honestly the splint i got for a broken foot abt 2 years ago was worse and it was by an er doc too and while child me had to experience that awful splint the vet wrap did make my hand feel better i felt like i could pick it up and move it safely so i ended up staying inside sitting on one of their couches in the living room and resting my arm on the arm supports watching tv with my friends mom i wasnt rly interested in the show but that was the least of my worries then i think at one point she brought me food like a hotdog or smth which had ketchup bc my autistic ass wouldnt eat meat unless ot had ketchup on it the other girls went outside after everything calmed down somewhat tho my friend stayed a bit longer from what remember to make sure i was ok eventually they came back inside for an event i forget if it was planned or started bc it was dark and I was stuck inside basically it was a game where someone would get wrapped on toilet paper to become a mummy they included me in it by loosely wrapping parts of my armhand that i was willing to move and then we eventually all went home i dunno when any of this next stuff happens exactly but ill try to explain it in order i was cyberschooled then and at first i was fine until i needed to write something im right handed and my right hand was the one that was injured i remember my mom yelling at me because i refused to use my right hand and i think i asked if she could write for me she told me to use it and i remember crying and saying I cant I cant i tried to move it even slightly in order to try obeying what she said but the pain was terrible horrendous unbearable i cant think of words that can extensively describe how much pain i was in i dont quite remember it all but i think when i tried to use my left hand to write i was yelled at too and my mom minimized my pain by saying smth along the lines of it isnt that bad and i was also condescendingly asked if i wanted to go the doctor which i again refused fearing surgery and also bc having my parents yell at me made me upset all this time i remember i still had that blue vet wrap on my hand was shaking and in so much pain i forget if my mom did the usual let me feel it thing but if she did i most definitely refused and probably yanked it away based on the fact I still had that vet wrap on i think it was probably the next day i was allowed to write with my left hand but not without being scolded i remember writing down things in notebooks for fun with my left hand and i even decided that a character id made had my left hands handwriting i eventually got better writing with my left hand and honestly really had fun with it while i wrote and did things with my left hand i also did not use my right hand or bend my wrist at least i did as little as possible i kept on using the vet wrap to stablize it until it wouldnt stick no more then i found some wrap i has gotten from when i sprained my leg and so i it instead and remembered how i treated my sprained leg used that was refrence for resting my hand and also didnt move it bc it was painful i dont remember much else abt the recovery i think i stopped wrapping it and started using my right hand again as soon as the pain lessoned which probably was after like a month or two perhaps ik it takes longer for a broken bone to recover but the pain does go away pretty quickly honestly i remember my mom expecting me to recover from my sprain in about a week and was upset i still refused to use it and instead write with my left hand i did keep on writing with my left hand sometimes for awhile after that just for fun which ironically probably helped my right hand recover lol i dont quite know how long after it was but i think it was a decent chunk after but within the same year i once again slipped and fell and i forget which handi landed on but based on the pain and how caught myself the same way again i think it was my right which i once again assumed was a sprain but only a minor one so i again pulled out the wrap i had and i think for abt a day or 3 days wrapped my hand i remember not having much pain and wondering if it still needed wrapped the next day but i still ended up keeping it on i think and until i was a teen it never hit me that the pain i feltin my bones was not a normal sprain thing but probably a broken bone and it really hit me after a horse broke my foot 2 years ago that yea that probably wasnt a sprain bc like it was while less pain that pain i got from my broken foot felt literally like a lesser version of the pain i felt in my hand when i was a kid tbh im not completely sure if i did break my hand as ive never rly had it inspected for past breaks unlike my foot it doesnt rly act up when the weather changes or from overuse etc at least i think so i never rly took notice of anything like thay as a kid because i was never aware or looking for anybpain related to broken bones so im open to anyone suggesting its something else not for legitimate medical advice as well ik i shouldnt get it from here and its already healed just out of curiosity i wonder if it was like a pinched nerve maybe but it didnt feel like one at all ive unfortunately had and continue of have pinched nerves in my neck

1j6owam,Mourning Myself,Me and the Past A Meeting with My Old Self I turned on my old device from 11 years ago and listened to my old voice recordings I broke down crying I miss myself I used to be cheerful and innocent Now Ive been depressed for so long Ive lived through terrible things I keep picturing that girl from 11 years agothe one who used to sing in different languages record rap songs and create all kinds of things It feels like I lost her I cried as if I lost a loved one As if that girl died and Ill never see her again I lost myself I lost my teenage years I lost my laughter I lost my creativity I lost me I miss her I used to love myself admire myself I was confident I was innocent I was creative And now Panic attacks anxiety problems responsibilities endless worries I feel like Ive been dead for a long time Like Im just wandering among the living in some kind of dream I feel disconnected from life like a lifeless soul drifting through a world that keeps moving Why do I feel like I died a long time ago and Im just living these years backstage trying to figure out the cause of my death Why does my life now feel like an illusion while my past felt real God Im so tired of myself Why do I miss the past so much Why do I long for my old self She was strong and kind despite her young age The older I get the more scared I become And the more I need her She was wise creative confident Her soul was light and gentle like a breeze Everyone loved her She was mischievous but even her mischief was innocent Despite being quiet at times she was still wellknown because she left a soft lasting impact Even if she caused a little trouble it was never harmfuljust the kind of mischief that made people laugh later I admire her I love her I miss her the same way I mourn the people Ive lost in my life Im grieving myself Because I died Im nothing more than a body without a soul,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 19:31:21 UTC,3,2,1.0,,,0,0

1j3ahkl,Being a teacher makes me hate everything,Im a teacherlibrarian at an elementary school in my tenth year and it has become increasingly apparent that this is not the job for me Despite not wanting to be another statistic in the world of education I need to get out before I completely lose it Reading and libraries used to be my life I would spend countless hours reading books and browsing through the stacks in libraries Whenever I traveled my first stop was always the library Growing up no one ever doubted that Id become a librarian Life took some twists and turns along the way but I finally finally made it back to the libraries I love Now I fucking HATE IT Along with anything else that used to give me joy in life I used to love to go hiking shopping working out just be out and about for no reason at all but now all I do is crawl into bed and sleep until the next morning And calling it sleep is very generous Running on about four hours of sleep has become standard and dont think that the lack of sleep contributing to my overall feelings about life has gone over my head Problem is that nightmares about going back to work wake me up and fretting over the students for several hours after makes sleep a luxury for me Im sick of spending the majority of my day managing behaviors Im sick of trying to find engaging lessons for the students to absolutely not be able to handle it Im sick of the constant NOISE the SCREAMING and the VIOLENCE Why is violence the first thing these kids turn to Im sick of these kids leaving the library and the books in pieces acting as though they havent had me since kindergarten and know how the library is supposed to be kept Im sick of the students acting like its their first goddamn day on Earth Im sick of hearing the phrase Im sorry and just watching them do it again five minutes later I told one girl that her apology had less meaning than a pigs fart and I dont even feel bad saying that Im sick of their entitlement and how they think they deserve to take every piece of me without giving a modicum of respect in return Im sick of getting excited and emotional over a book I bought the students thinking that theyll like it just for them to roll their eyes Its like these kids have only two settings mean little bastards or asleep I used to be a creative I used to spend my free time drawing painting knitting and writing Boy how I loved to write I looked at some old Google docs of my stories and I miss that girl the one who could spin worlds out of nothing and create endearing and courageous characters But that girl is dead I couldnt write even if you pointed a gun to my head These goddamn energy sucking vampires disguised as children left me bereft of any emotion willpower or desire to do anything I cant even distract myself in the company of other people The single life has plagued me for over two years and I want to get into dating but Im such a miserable person that I dont think its fair to subject someone to the unpleasant experience of being in my presence I barely want to be in my own company The only other people I occasionally hang out with are other teachers so our primary form of entertainment is drinking and trauma dumping I dont even like reading anymore Reading For a librarian I pick up a book and it reminds me of school a straight up hell and thats enough to turn me off The thought of having to do this for another twenty years drives me to despair Can you believe I used to win teaching awards I used to be a good teacher I dont know where I went wrong Like the only thing that is keeping me here is my dog and shes 13 years old But with a lot of spunk Once shes gone I wont know what to do with myself So like I dont know what my aim is with this The jobs here are pay a fucking joke and I already feel like a failure enough that losing my house will definitely send me over the edge So here I am day after day spending the better part of my life with people I hate,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 13:14:19 UTC,15,16,0.87,,,0,0

1j7bpwd,My 20f dad 54m refuses to pay for my sister 18f tuition because he has no money,So when we were in highschool my dad made us quit any extracurricular activities to make extra money and help pay bills and save for our college and just put into saving for us Thats what he told us But He would take whatever we made and only give us 20 of spending money every pay period We gave him thousands that went towards the bills and college funds and even built a house back in our home country for when our parents retire To add to that we have gotten many scholarships so the majority of our schools were paid for My sister in question lost her job and has been having a hard time finding another one My dad used her funds to pay for the first half of her tuition but refused to pay for the second half The cost is 4k He said he has no money but yet he JUST bought a new BMW worth 25 to 30k Keep in mind we have 3 EXTRA CARS that need about 500 worth if fixing for him to drive just fine When my mom was trying to talk to him about helping pay for my sisters college tuition he told her to ask us the siblings to help Since I have money saved I was able to help pay for her tuition but before I did I wanted to confirm with him first that he couldnt pay for it He said he wouldnt answer that question and brushed me away When I tried to get more from him he started yelling at me calling me disrespectful This is an ongoing thing with him Whenever we try to talk back he calls us disrespectful When he is with his friends he brags about how smart educated and respectful his children are but then in private he belittles us sends money to strangers and constantly puts others first before his own family I guess we are all sick of it and I want to write this out because I dont know if somebody can see his side of things and tell me what I am missing here Yes we can move out but the economy is so bad and he knows that so whenever he gets mad he tells us that we can just leave knowing that we cant support ourselves He gets about 1500 extra in rent from us every month from 3 of us but not from 2 of us cause my sister lost her job and my other sister just started her college as well shes 17f She worked very hard and brought about 60k of yearly tuition down to 7k with scholarships and is staying in the dorms My dad has now refused to pay that even though my sister has worked throughout highschool to make that money When we argue about money he stirs the conversation away from the main point and starts going on longggg rants about this certain bill and that certain bill and whenever we cut him off so he can get to the point he calls us disrespectful and tells us to get out of his room We know he purposely does this so he can get out of a conversation And even when he says he never has the money he is constantly sending money to random people and we feel like he is flexing it I remember I had to stay at school while my classmates got to go on a fieldtrip cause he didnt want to oay the 5 fee And then he bought a 20 hat for a funeral he went ONCE He likes to be constantly looked at and its so embarrassing when we have to go out And my mom is constantly arguing with him on our behalf Its tiring and I feel for my mom who has to deal with his tantrums most of the time,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 16:46:45 UTC,2,2,0.76,,,0,0

1j4a10l,In an instant I saw two lives change forever in two completely different ways,I have been trying to process and work through what I saw yesterday but it has been really hard The event itself was a lot but now Im dealing with the whys which make me feel guilty since what happened has nothing to do with me I was just a witness I tried writing through it but it hasnt been enough so Im trying again thinking that if I get it in front of others I can start to live past it Yesterday evening I was sitting on this big rock while I was waiting for the bus A little ways down the road there was a taxi van He was either backing out or adjusting his Uturn but obviously reversing and not moving super fast From where I was sitting I didnt see how fast the bike courier was going when he hit the front side of the van And the biker immediately went under the front wheel of the van and I could hear him and his bicycle crunch under the tire The position the biker was on the ground was how he stayed for the whole 20 minutes that he was out there He never moved So Im almost positive he died during the collision or if there was some way he survived he could have been fully paralyzed But there werent many people to see the accident head on like I did A man in his Jeep came out and a few security from the booth around my stop is near a campus came out to help They checked for signs of life and directed traffic around him and had someone call 911 Police came and did much of the same The fire department came and started doing CPR but they didnt take off the mans helmet The ambulance came and I didnt see any defibrillator or adrenaline unless they did those things in the back once they loaded him on the gurney and took the man away But even after they put him in the ambulance it didnt leave or take off There wasnt a rush It felt like I was out there for two hours but it all happened in about 20 minutes And its hard to think about the collision and how if the biker hasnt passed away Im sure the injuries will last a lifetime And I think about the taxi driver who just sat in the van with his head down and how he will most likely lose almost everything because of an accident I dont know why I had to see it but I did and I dont know what to do with it if anything at all,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 18:28:08 UTC,7,2,0.9,,CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCEDEATH,0,0

1j3qh3b,I Am Watching My Best Friends Fiancé Ruin His Life Day by Day,Long time lurker first time poster I have reached a boiling point where I cannot keep this within anymore My wife and I have been watching my best friends life crumbles in front of us due to his fiancé and her manipulations For the remaining of my story I will refer to my best friend as T and his fiancé as Z T and Z met on Tinder during late 2021 and T introduced Z to me and our friend group in early 2022 Ever since I met Z my wife and I had identifed so many red flags about her Here is a summary of what I can recall 1 Z has a habit of trauma dumping her past to everyone she met Even during casual conversations when people asked about her life before meeting T she would reveal about her previous engagement where her exfiancé would beat her in front of her mom just all kinds of sob stories her suicide attempts and generally just all sorts of stories that Z loves telling people that she just met making every conversation with Z extremely uncomfortable for everyone 2 Over the course of their relationship Z had convinced T to cut off his friendships with all of his childhood friends who all warned T about Zs questionable character I remember that the day T told his childhood friend group that he no longer wishes to speak to them that whole group messaged me on Facebook warning me to watch out for Z and that she is bad news even though they have never met me my guess is that T talked about me with them given that T and I are really good friends who went through a lot in life together This is the beginning of Zs gradual removal of Ts friends and her plan to isolate him from his support system What I also noticed is that Z is unable to make and keep any new friends any new friend group that met Z through T eventually got so repulsed by her that they distanced themselves from T and Z 3 Z casually bragged to me and my wife that she read all of Ts personal messages on Facebook and texts to his friends even the things he said before they met My wife and I kept telling Z to be more respectful of personal boundaries especially when it comes to the past but Z did not care and kept reading Ts personal messages to friends and family til this day 4 T and Z bought a house together in 2023 and the moment they signed it off Z quit her job claiming mistreatment even though she always bragged that the job allowed her to nap in her own office anytime she wanted and everyone treated her like family there 5 Now that T and Z are a singleincome household with T working his ass off to cover their mortgage and living expenses Z always asked for T to take her to lavish restaurants frequent trips to Disney parks even having him take her to a week in Disneyworld in Florida after she left her job Every weekend she would have him take her to LA for a different expensive restaurant so that she could take pics and flex for her IG stories 6 Z got a diagnosis for Bipolar 1 sometime in 2024 Ever since she frequently asked T to leave his work early to come home because of her not feeling well for whatever reasons Note that because of this T eventually got flagged for declining performance at his work but despite knowing this Z still had T leave work early often for her 7 It is interesting to note that despite always claiming of not feeling well almost every day during the times that I would come over at Ts place to hang out I observed that Z was frequently able to drive herself late at night to play video games at her brothers house which is a half hour drive away and come home late just fine What pissed me off the most was that during my wedding which was the only time in life that I asked to spend a lot of time with T Z asked T to leave my wedding early because you guessed it she wasnt feeling well To make matters worse Z wore a white dress to my wedding and my wife and I got asked many questions from our friends about that but we just shook it off because we were speechless about that as well 8 While she was unemployed Z decided to go to college for an accounting degree even though she has no goals of working anywhere after She always openly bragged about how she had T doing her college homework and coursework for her because she has difficulty learning since English is not her first language 9 T eventually got fired from his job for his declining performance My wife and I was able to meet up at Ts house to provide T some guidance and support to look for a new job During that time Z told us that she already asked T for a boob job she claimed that she feels insecure in college for being flat chested and she also wants T to pay for a few other cosmetic procedures well knowing that T doesnt have a source of income anymore T and Z will get married at some point in 2026 and I feel like theres nothing I can do about it My wife and I know it to our core that Z is a terrible human being but T keeps giving her excuses and falling for her trauma dumping When my own family briefly talked with T and Z at my wedding they have also all noted that Z came off very disingenuous and manipulative Since my wife and I spent the most time with T and Z our friend group for the most part doesnt know as much about Z as we know I feel like I am watching Ts life crumbles in real time as Z keeps draining his life away for her own use I honestly wish I put in more effort in talking T out of dating Z when they first met I never expected T to end up with someone that feels no remorse ruining his life like this Guess since I cant talk to anyone else IRL about this aside from my wife I am better off letting this out on Reddit,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 00:41:23 UTC,2,6,1.0,,,0,0

1j7fdqt,My exgirlfriend gaslit me while relationship while cheating on me found out on my birthday,My m24 now exf26 girlfriend started dating in March last year I had just come out of a toxic situationship where I take part blame I was a bad communicator Im sure I still am but I gained some communication skills I really liked her found my now ex 3 weeks later I knew it would be a rebound but it helped so much Especially considering this girl had been my crush since 8 years ago when I had first started working with her We had so much fun early on trips going out eating out It started to feel less like a rebound and something of a real relationship Unfortunately it came to her moving out of her moms house She needed a place to go and me with my somewhat trust issues was scared to let her move in with her friends which were one girl and two guys She had been known to get around but I trusted her more than most people did and had hope She was very kind had many mental issues but nothing I couldnt stand I had grown up with childhood trauma and this seemed like nothing So me with my trust issues and wanting to move out of my moms house as well took her offer of renting a place together It seemed fun and I had just started a career job so it seemed like a good time Found out very quickly it would not be See my ex well call Fiona had severe insecurities and drinking issues not to mention drug addiction I had known to some extent but not to this severity The first week we moved in I wanted to have a get together party for our first place together Turns out Fiona hates having people in her space She was very quiet the whole night and near the end she stormed off to the room where Id get yelled at when I head to bed She scream at me in bed as I had work the next morning I told her sorry and wed talk about it tomorrow She got up and stormed out the room I was just happy for the quiet until I hear her screaming my name and yelling help Help I storm out seeing her wrist covered in blood with it spilling all over the floors I help her best I can she didnt hit an artery so it soon stopped but left a nasty scar After this night most nights especially when we went out I would get no rest being accused of cheating or just not giving her enough love Over the next few months one of our mutual friends decided a surprise birthday party for her I honestly wasnt thinking to hard about it I just thought maybe itd make her happy forgetting she didnt like people in her space Same thing happened She was upset the whole night stayed in the bedrooms and never came out Through out the night you could hear her screams saying get out of my house In the most embarrassing way possible Her sister was there and tried to calm her down the whole night which did not work I eventually got everyone out because the music was barely covering it up I went to bed again Same thing yelling at me She got up stormed out I was worried but thought that it was a one time thing Nope I instantly hear my name being screamed This time much worse I come out to see the cut is even deeper attempt to stop the bleeding but it just wont I call 911 while making a makeshift tourniquet to try and stop it The paramedics get her after the police which was someone I knew I told them about how she was saying before that she wanted to die I didnt think this was an attempt but a callout I took her to the hospital after the medics said she didnt need the ambulance after patching her up Stayed up all night at the hospital dropped her off at home then went to work I was miserable I couldnt stand this anymore I didnt want to break the lease but at the same time I also still cared for this girl I felt bad I needed a way out that night was my chance but you just couldnt leave her alone she cried and begged me So we continued our relationship A few months later same thing yelling at me and saying I dont give her enough affirmations and accusing me of deleting snapchats and sneaking people in when shes off at work Which led to a night that she destroyed my tv in the living room put holes in the walls and screamed at me in my face I was done I left to stay at my friends house Told her to leave wed figure out the situation after The day after she said she needed time to move and wanted to talk I went over and we talked the whole night She promised shed get therapy and help And I felt so terrible I truly loved this girl but it was such a toxic relationship I gave her one last chance We decided to stick together agreeing to talk things out more See I still have my trust issues and being accused of things makes me curious why its that in particular I memorized her password months ago but never really felt the need to look through her phone I had it just in case But I was working one night straight shift She went out with her friends Acted very strange to me and I just felt something was off I come home at 7am find her dead asleep Couldnt even wake her up to give her a kiss She had left her phone on my side of the bed I felt the urge to look through it Went through it for hours Finding hidden messages in messenger of her taking to her ex saying how she thinks about him everyday and that she needs him Other messages to her OTHER ex on Snapchat came across it by chance because it had been cleared and muted It was of last night being very flirty and him leaving hearts and her pictures with her hearting back Her saying I miss you and then a phone call about 6 minutes lasting I called this number I asked him to be straight up if shes cheating He sounded dumbfounded but said she wasnt and that they were just friends that use to date But I found pictures dating only right before we started dating that they were kissing and all over eachother I woke her up absolutely heated Ngl this was probably the angriest Ive ever been I told her what I had seen She of course denied it Eventually admitting that it was cheating but they never had sex Which I absolutely think is a lie But I said it was over and she took it so easily She nodded and called her mom got her stuff in the car then laughing about a joke she made saying shes tired of constantly moving All while I sit and wait for her to leave Also if I didnt mention this happened ALL ON MY BIRTHDAY She leaves not answering any of my questions like why how could you do this Since then Ive been sitting here she still left a few things and needs a truck to come pick them up She just texted me that shes coming today to pick them up I still feel like shit but can hold my emotions

1j64g7u,Coming to terms with the thought that my sister is not a good person after all,It has been almost 15 years since its slowly started to dawn on me that my sister never really loved me she just thought I was so much lamer than her that she didnt see me as a competiton For the context she is 10 years older than me and for as long as I can remember I loved her more than anyone alive I loved her more than our parents brothers friends etc She was my absolute role model and everything she did was perfect It is fucked up to compare kids ever but when parents and relatives are comparing two people who are so different and not even in the same age group that is especially fucked up She was always labeled the beautiful one me as the smart one She was the caring child I was the mean one Her life was hard mine was easy Everything that was happening to her was always celebrated if it was good or we were all devastated together with her if it was bad and it was never her fault when it was bad Everything I ever did was considered as luck or as normal if it was good and my fault if it was bad She loved me back and always worked on building my self confidence but never to the extent of me succeeding in being better than her in any way This was particularly obvious in her relationship with our parents where she told me multiple times that our father wanted mom to have the abortion when she was pregnant with me Any sign of me not liking that thought was being met with the comment along the lines of me being too sensitive or oh come on he loves you now I reacted explosivelly about that only once when I told her openely to go fuck herself with those fucked up pieces of info which of course ended with her being in tears appologizing and making me promise THAT I WILL NEVER REMIND HER ABOUT THAT EVENT She made it about her and her feelings and I was told by the involved parties that I shouldnt have been so hard on her These were occasional outbursts when I would always make a conclusion that I over reacted and I would end up crying begging her to forgive me and promising never to do it again Bear in mind we are talking about my teenage yeara here not adult me FF to my 20s while she had one relationship with her then longtime bf who became almost like a family member I mostly fucked around and either didnt really meet reciprocated feelings in guys or I didnt even want anything serious She eventually broke up with him it was a family tragedy ofc like anything bad that happens to her and she somehow put us both together to we are never getting married file I mean she never said it but it was obvious that she is not supportive of my potential relationships I kind of knew it but I became sure about it when I started to date my now husband when I was 25 and as I became more selfassured because I felt loved she started to become more and more openely toxic and she was doing it often She would use every opportunity to let me know she thinks he is lazy and irresponsible while I didnt think any of that She started to hate my hobbies style habits which didnt change much I just wasnt as miserable as before and she was suuuuper pissed when she broke with her second bf and I got engaged She called me and raged about how it is inconsiderate that everyone is saying congrats on social media while they are aware of her recent break up I felt bad because during the last year of her relationship she lost one pregnancy but I still didnt think that I should hid posts my boyfriend put on social media when he proposed After that it all went downhill She was good to me either when something super good would happen to her or when something really bad would happen to me She hated my wedding day and pregnancy but she was full of understanding when I had PPD She did nothing to help but she was good to me then As soon as I got better she was hating me again In the meantime all good that was going on in her life was still celebrated and all bad was mourned while my life was kind of unimportant to our mutual loved ones mostly I started to fight back but I was rarely talking shit about her to our family while she wasnt really private about her opinion on me Every time when she would show her good side again I would come back to life because I would regain the hope that the most loved person from my childhood is still there Recently I lost all hope that I will ever want her back in my life Our father died and in his final months while I was crying my guts out and doing EVERYTHING to help him as we all did she told me that I was selfish as always and not showing any empathy towards him That was the straw that broke the camels back for me and I screamed at her and told her to get the fuck away from me forever We did communicate after that because there were many things that had to be done with our dad and I was there for her to be her shoulder to cry on when she needed me but it was just because I felt I had to for the rest of our family As our dad passed my feelings of disgust came back and I am back to feeling hurt by our last fight She mentioned it briefly and said that it was just a dumb fight as she always does after moments like that but to me it wasnt To me now none of the fights we had were dumb and they were all about one thing her wanting me to be the obedient loser sister that she had when I was from 0 to 20ish and her from 10 to 30ish I cant stand the thought of her hanging out with my kid anymore My kid loves her and I was so happy when my sister and I patched our fight from a few years ago and she had good relationship with her niece but honestly I have two fears 1 She would fuck her up the way she fucked me up 2 She would be telling my kid mean things to show me as a bad person for whatever reason One thing I found out later after my PPD was gone is that she was planning to take the kid away from me because it seems like I am not fit to do it but she never considered talking to my husband about it Like he didnt have PPD he was fine why didnt she talk to him Why was she planning to adopt the kid who was not out for adoption Anyway I am done with her but I think I will need a lot of time to process this Maybe therapy would be beneficial,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:14:59 UTC,8,0,0.91,,,0,0
1j773xl,I wouldnt marry my husband of 17 years if given a doover,Four years ago I felt like I had achieved all goals happiness and was married to my best friend For context I 35f and my husband 38m have been married for 17 years I met him as a teenager we dated and married promptly after my 18th birthday I felt like we had really worked through a lot of issues to build a good marriage and life together I dont have a strong support system of people in my life so it was just him and me against the world Well that changed and Ive been beating myself up about it for a while and trying to navigate my feelings or just ignoring them idk I started to have feelings for a coworker I know typical He has been a friend at work and is married There has been nothing romantic between us and I dont get any indication from him that he is interested in more He has just been supportive as my coworker and a friend and that friendship doesnt extend outside of work at all I have no interest in pursuing a romantic relationship with him either I dont want to have infidelity in my marriage or try to convince someone else to be untrue And breaking marriages for another person just means a worse marriage This has really led me to contemplate my life Why when everything was feeling so right did I start catching feelings for someone else I looked back at our relationship and started seeing all the negative I questioned if I was just looking for reasons to justify how I felt I came to the realization that our dating relationship was abusive and early years of our marriage More than just bad or two stupid kids He was very controlling pushed sex on me before I was ready and even used a sexual act two different times as punishment that was painful Anytime Im alone with my thoughts I think that so much of how I am today in my relationship with him was shaped by the bad times He isnt that person any more he isnt controlling and treats me better overall But I dont have friends am scared to make him mad scared to talk about my feelings am super agreeable to avoid any conflicts He has been explosive and mean in the past when he gets angry although that hasnt been too recently Nothing ever physical I still feel like a terrible person for thinking about another guy and feel some blame for wallowing in the past I think if I would do it all over and theres no way I would stay in the relationship if given a do over If I had a daughter I would teach her how to avoid this and reach out for help I feel like my eyes have been opened to the truth of our past I tried to bring it up with him by asking what he thought about our dating relationship He said he doesnt really think about it and I said that I thought it was bad I brought up some things and he didnt want to talk about it He said he had apologized and I just hadnt forgiven him for it He got mad and I got upset and cried I remember him giving an apology several years ago we both got drunk and he said he felt bad about things and I consoled him but Im just now realizing it was abusive I wanted to get confirmation from him that he agreed it wasnt a healthy relationship just for healing But there was nothing productive about it I find myself lately being depressed and bottled up I work full time and my husband hasnt had a job for a few years now I really dont care if he works but want him to contribute to our relationship in some way Instead he spends a lot of time sitting around the house on his phone making a mess and spending excessive amounts of time on hobbies And no I dont think there is any chance he is cheating I think he is also depressed My guilt and frustration are overwhelming I love him and he loves me but Im spending too much time in my head not dealing with my feelings just hoping things find their place and go back even though I know thats not likely I know I could use counseling to work on past trauma and learn to be a better partner myself So maybe Ill finally do that,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 12:59:24 UTC,706,67,0.91,,,0,0

1j7uunf,UPDATE My 21F boss 50M is in love with me and idk what to do,This is an update to a post I made back in October its the only other post on this account if you want to read that first I just wanted to thank everyone who responded and helped me realize it wasnt my fault All the kind words have been incredibly helpful Its been 5 months so buckle up because theres a lot to say this isnt exactly the update Im sure most of you hoped to get Its definitely not the one I thought Id get I havent received justice I probably never will In my last post I mentioned how I wasnt sure how my employers would react if I were to tell them I was assaulted Since then unfortunately another employee I work for was harassed and after months the harasser was fired Now I know theyd take it seriously but the difference is that I dont have proof I did kinda end up telling G He had asked me to work with Z and at first I agreed but after almost having a panic attack just thinking about being near him I finally got the courage to say that I didnt want to work with Z I didnt go into detail but G changed my schedule so that I wouldnt have to A couple of days after everything I was on instagram and clicked on one of those suggested accounts based on your contacts and stuff It was his poetry account and he had just posted a poem where he wrote all about me rejecting him and how people should feel bad that I didnt reciprocate his feelings but he conveniently left out the part where he assaulted me He committed a crime and then went and wrote poetry about it and posted it for people to read which is crazy I find this funny now but at the time it wasnt lol Some of my memory from that day has come back but its still mostly blocked out Its hard knowing that I might not ever know exactly what happened Even if Im not sure I want to I used up like all of my sick days after we came back for the spring semester because the thought of going back to work with that man made me physically sick Thankfully I mainly have only seen him in passing while Im working This is my last year working as a teacher I want to make it clear that Im not quitting because of him Ive been involved with this program for over a decade as both a student and an instructor and I feel like its time to close this chapter of my life I fully believe I would have come to this conclusion even if nothing had happened Im young and still trying to figure out what I want to do in life I want to take the opportunity to try out other passions of mine Im currently in the process of opening a theatre company with some friends and hope to have our first production in the fall This has been a dream of mine for years and I never thought Id actually get to do it Honestly for a moment I considered stepping away from theatre in all together It felt like he had tainted the thing I loved most Theatre was my first love and he ruined it He took the place where my happiest memories happened and made them bitter In the 5 months its been since everything happened Ive realized thats bullshit I have spent over a decade building a legacy in that department Ive broken and set records Ive advocated and I led recruiting I worked to prove to my community that the program and its students were more than just some underfunded extracurricular w kids who wanted an easy class I helped prove that they were talented and mattered The last thing I want is for my kids to think that theres one less person who cares about them because I left quietly or that their passions arent something worth pursuing because I gave up on mine He took a lot from me that day but Im not going to let him have this The 10 year old that dreamed of doing what Im doing now deserves better than that The girl that was trapped in that room when it happened deserves better than that I deserve better than that Ive hit the anger stage Im normally a very empathetic person and try to justify every bad thing a person does to me not great ik but w him I just get so angry when I see him and for once I cant think of a single reason why I shouldnt be Of course its all justified by the fact that hes starting to lash out in his own way A couple of days ago I was at a competition with my kids and I had my sister come up to me panicking because while I was helping unload equipment from our trailer he was talking to the contest manager to get my name removed from the program which meant I couldnt help them We were down 4 crew members and needed all the help we could get G had to get after him because wtf What was the point of that Later while I was helping them assemble their set they have to set up in lt7 minutes or get disqualified he pulls me aside and tells me just so you know we can be disqualified and not allowed to compete anymore if you touch anything else Dont forget youre just our assistant In a condescending voice This upset me because Ive been taking part in this competition for half of my life I know the rules I even studied the damn rulebook when I first got hired I told him actually if you look at the program for tomorrow Im listed as a director and directors are permitted to assist their students with the assembly of the set as long as students put up 70 of it Which is 100 true He didnt like my answer so I had to drag G away from where he was helping and have him say the same thing I did He was just wasting our time Its like he wanted the kids to get disqualified I explained that he was listed as just an assistant so I needed him to let me do my job because he didnt even have anything to do with our production other than suddenly showing up the day of contest to yell at the kids and stress them out he yelled at them for not moving fast enough when unloading the set even though we had arrived early to make sure we could take our time Like I said everything he does pisses me off for good reason I was definitely rude and me pulling rank is annoying but he could at least speak to me like Im adult deserving of respect rather than treating me like a child who has no idea what theyre doing I dont understand why he wants to punish me and my kids because he doesnt know how to respect boundaries and not cheat on his wife I from an area where its very conservative amp religious so It feels like the odds of someone believing me are low but I did tell my sister I knew if anyone was going to understand me it was her I was there for her when she was assaulted and its felt like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders having her by my side Im hoping to start therapy soon and begin working on how to cope with whats happened I dont know whats in store for me in terms of trying to heal and what Im going to do once I finally quit but Im sure its going to be really hard,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 09:37:13 UTC,21,0,0.83,,,0,0
1j3co94,You know what to do,Ive been following this community for quite some time now and I can finally come here to get something off my chest Most of the posts in here or other communities that ask for an opinion or advice of what to do in their romantic relationship you know what to do You are searching reassurance which is very important and valid sometimes we just need to feel validated to fire in us the courage to do whats needed to save ourselves from a bad situation Your post is important However 9 out of 10 you know what needs to be done Tbh if you needed to come to reddit post a personal problem youre having with your partner because you tried several times to talk to them or you are afraid of their reaction to say XYZ I mean if your voice isnt enough for your partner to care about you and really try finding a solution together or if you are walking on eggshells with your partner or if you been through the same discussion time and time again with no change nor even honest attempt to deal with said issue you have a much deeper problem than the problem you came here to solve with our help When communication is staled cut avoided or violently pushed away this is THE MAIN factor to end any kind of relationship Its not that redditors like to say break up to all postsits just that there is really no one can do if your relationship is oneway street in communication Really We would love you to thrive and be happy with your loved one but if your partner doesnt consider you enough to try to solve a problem after you offering solutions and all what other advice can we give to you And you know it Do not feel discouraged to post though We will reassure you and most of comments really want you to have a good relationship and be happy Wish you all the courage and happiness For real,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 15:00:21 UTC,4,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j880m4,True Story for English Project,A few years ago in 2019 I went over to a friends house to complete a project While there I noticed she had some cats roaming around her yard and she mentioned that her family also had a few dogs The dogs were medium sized and the cats were of normal weight and stature and I assumed that when the weather became extreme they would be brought inside for safety and comfort I barely spared them a glance trusting that they were cared for At the time I didnt think much of it Animals are a part of human life and in the lowincome neighborhood that my friend lived in it was common for pets to live in backyards or spend a lot of time outside She clearly seemed to love her cats even though they were not inside the house and it would be rude for me to question how things were done in her family In some Florida neighborhoods it is common for dogs and cats to spend their days outside the continuously warm environment with the occasional rain is perfect weather for those who cant afford to have more occupants in already small houses It was two years of being friends that led to our first sleepover That was when I started noticing a few odd things in my friends household For instance her family had recently found a kitten on the side of the road and had taken it in At first I thought it was a heartwarming act of kindness They allowed the kitten to sleep in their beds cuddle with them and receive affection However as soon as the kitten grew older they just put it back outside to fend for itself It struck me as odd but I dismissed it thinking perhaps they just didnt want a fullgrown cat inside This happened with several cats and they just found a new kitten a few months ago I didnt like it but it wasnt exactly illegal The straw that broke the camels back was in 2023 It was an extremely hot summer the hottest itd been in years I went over to her house per usual but this time with another friend We decided that before wed come in wed say hello to her dogs Usually she would tell us that the dogs werent important and would always steer us away But this time we wanted to play with them The dogs were confined in an unbearably small cageabout the size of a wheelbarrow The space was far too cramped for even one dog let alone three They had no shelter from the relentless 100degree heat and there was no shade to offer them any respite The food bowl was empty devoid of any evidence of kibble meat or any form of sustenance The water they did have was dirty contaminated with feces and entirely undrinkable Feces were scattered all around the cage indicating that they had been living in these conditions for a long time As soon as they saw us the dogs started panting and wagging their tails shaking with excitement at the sight of people They were desperate for attention for care for relief from their miserable existence It was heartbreaking No animal should have to endure such neglect These dogs werent just sufferingthey were being denied basic necessities space clean water food and protection from the elements My friends reaction to our concern was even more shocking When confronted about the state of the dogs she simply walked away without a word There was no explanation no sign of guilt or concern It was as if she didnt see anything wrong with what we had witnessed I was horrified I knew I could not ignore what I had seen This was not just a matter of differing opinions on pet carethis was neglect Leaving animals in these conditions without food clean water or shelter is not only cruel but could be considered animal abuse under the law This experience changed the way I felt about her from then on I had reported it to animal control but they did nothing and her family ended up moving the dogs into the garage a humid stuffy garage without windows to open and let air in but bigger than a wheelbarrow so progress is progress Animal control did not take the dogs away as I expected but instead gave a warning This is one of those stories with no real happy ending Some people dont deserve the love animals give so freely And sometimes walking away from a friendship is the only right thing to do We still keep in contact after all she was my best friend But every time I see her face Im reminded of those moments and it doesnt feel good,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 20:07:53 UTC,2,0,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING ANIMAL ABUSE,0,0
1j6femf,I stole from my patients,I used to work in a bougie Care Home several years ago This involved feeding elderly patients with dementia Well dementia can make feeding quite difficult and a lot of the patients dont eat much We had everything from quiche steak to the best desserts Most of the time they would have a few spoons and be done Now I know where your mind is going with this smiling_face_with_tear So I used to feed my patient and enjoy some of the food once they were done I would take 2 spoons and feed them from one side Then I would eat from the other side The dementia meant they couldnt really say anything And I would sit in a position to make sure I was not in view I would offer food multiple times even if they declined as well So I felt I was giving them my best I was barely 18 and Im so ashamed every time I think about it My hunger was stronger than my shame at the time And the fact it was the same platelike what was I thinking loudly_crying_face But honestly the food was sensational I still think about that damn chef Its not an excuse and I still have regrets I can never share this with anyone This is truly off my chest,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 11:41:03 UTC,467,34,0.95,,,0,0

1j6r9ab,My one attempt at healthy communication ended horribly and I feel like the worst friend ever,I was heavily bullied via social ostracism as a kid It also didnt help that I am very likely autistic and I have a very hard time picking up on unspoken social cues I also grew up in a bit of a turbulent environment where speaking my mind often ended in punishment Therefore my own communication habits are not the healthiest I tend to bottle things up for months and then crash and bedrot for days on end when it all becomes too much But I have a best friend who I finally felt comfortable attempting more immediate healthy communication with and its blown up so badly that Im almost wishing Id just kept my mouth shut instead Theyve been getting really into a TV show for about 5 months now which is great and Im truly happy for them A lot of the time theyd send me voice notes about it or wed call and theyd end up talking about it to the point of apologizing for overtaking the conversation and Id always say they had nothing to be sorry for because I love listening to my friends be happy about stuff Genuinely I do and it was literally all fine up until last week After months of searching due to unemployment I had a job interview lined up for the next day Of course I immediately texted my best friend and they congratulated me and said theyd send me messages of encouragement before the interview I thanked them and then they immediately proceeded to talk about the show again I didnt think much of it and listened as always because I enjoy it The interview day comes the next day and its HECTIC I was so busy that I was literally going from 530am to 530pm and by the time I got home I was ready to crash My interview was scheduled at 4 and theyd been texting me about the show prior to it so I figured Id get my messages soon Well long story short they never came I got home at about 530 immediately crashed and took a 2 hour nap and then woke up to chat with them only to have another conversation about the show Admittedly I didnt feel great about it but I thought it was just the lack of food and sleep talking so I brushed it off Over the next few days though I noticed that sometimes the things Id send them would just get liked and immediately moved on from in favor of talking about the show eventually I realized that this wasnt making me feel great so I decided to ask them if we could maybe tone down the conversations about this show and explain how it made me feel Sounds like a healthy way to communicate right Wrong As soon as I sent the message I realized how badly I fucked up They were rightfully upset that Id waited a week to tell them this and didnt give them the opportunity to correct themselves in the moment and for that I apologized I genuinely thought a week wasnt that much time and it wasnt something I was even mad at just mildly upset But then the whole conversation kept spiraling and I literally feel sick at the way I made them feel I thought that I was avoiding bottling it up and actually doing the right thing because I was communicating a relatively minor on my end issue early on but it turns out that by not saying anything immediately Ive basically reinforced their worst fears about themself Theyre now scared to talk too much to anyone about anything and now any mention of the show makes them feel sick They said they feel like a bad friend and part of them feels lied to because I always said it was alright how much they talked about it but it wasnt a lie It really was alright the job interview was literally the only incident that made me feel not great about it I kept apologizing because I never wanted them to feel like that around me but theyre still really hurt and now weve been taking some space from each other for about four days now I feel sick I feel like I ruined the one friendship where both of us felt safe to be ourselves Even if we manage to move on from this I know itll never be the same and its all my fault theyll never talk to me again without worrying that theyre being too much and thats the one thing I never wanted them to worry about with me because I know what its like to be too much for the people around you I wish Id kept my stupid mouth shut It was never even that big of a deal I couldve just dealt with it and bit my tongue but of course the one time I feel like communicating is the right thing it just ruins everything I hurt my best friend so bad and I didnt even mean to and now theres nothing I can say or do to fix it I thought I was finally doing things right but it all just went wrong anyway and now one of the people I care about the most is hurting because of me The guilt is eating me alive Ive been crying ever since it all went down and now I wish Id never even said anything,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 21:19:11 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j5jc5t,Im almost 22 and Ive never been on a date,Like the title says Ive never been on a date Women have expressed interest in me Ive had past relationships but they were all long distance Which means Ive never gotten to take a woman out for dinner or coffee Heres the kicker tho every time I tell someone that Ive never been on a date I get a variation of no way or youre lying or how Getting these types of reactions means that I am good looking to an extent I guess but it hasnt translated to any dates I will admit tho I am a late bloomer I was bullied mercilessly as a child was fat then skinny and now Im in the middle which is nice I know I need to put myself out there more but every time I do so I get burned rather quickly in spectacular fashion I may add Im also afraid of rejection which doesnt help My luck isnt the best either and considering how unavailable people in my city are I guess it makes sense I just feel so far behind my peers I feel weird I get everyone has their own timeline but at the same time when most people your age are in committed relationships or going out on dates its hard not to feel unlovedunwanted in addition to feeling like youre behind I also wonder if I should ever tell a woman this when not if the day comes Will she be turned off Will she be weirded out and think to herself whats wrong with this guy How has he never been on a date Thank you for reading and take care,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 09:05:42 UTC,2,3,1.0,,,0,0
1j5rl29,I feel like my boyfriends sex doll,My boyfriends of a year is only my 3rd sexual partner When we met he told me he hated getting oral but loved giving it When we first started having sex it was really good I was worried he told me he was a porn addict previously but the sex was very focused on my pleasure and I was pleased I did try to give him oral but he would stop it after a couple of minutes and move on to me During those attempts I could tell what he didnt like and did so I stopped doing the things he didnt enjoy when I would go down About a month into sex he one day pulled my hair and started face fucking me After he asked me if I liked having him control me when down there or if I preferred being in control I told him I was really uncomfortable being held down there and I was really uncomfortable being face fucked He claimed he liked me being in control Last 2 months or so sex has completely shifted He hasnt gone down on me I feel like a rag doll he uses He grabs my legs and moves me where he wants me and grabs my head and pushes me into giving him oral often while holding me down there Then last weekend happened I said I wanted to try anal but have been scared We tried it once before but it hurt and I cried out and he stopped It wasnt off the table to try again He woke me in the middle of the night while I was asleep on my side by entering me from behind on his side too It felt good and he and I have an agreement to wake up sex when we spend the night together even middle of the night A few minutes in he pulls out and aims at my ass He pushed in a little I cried out and pulled away no lube used and he has a big dick He put his hand over my mouth and grabbed my waist and pulled me hard back onto his cock I started crying from the pain but he just held me there while he finished with his hand on my mouth When he was done I told him it hurt and all he said was I never said no and rolled over and went to sleep Then he woke me up again a few hours later and repeated the whole thing so I was super sore and have been since I love him but I dont love feeling like his sex toy Edit Im sitting here crying I felt used but never really thought about the fact I was violated I grew up in an abusive household and sometimes boundaries and normal things dont feel normal and abuse and bad things do Ive been really emotionally numb to this all and I guess I needed a wake up call to see this isnt okay behavior,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 15:52:12 UTC,6402,948,0.94,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j5o8uu,I broke up with my girlfriend of almost four years and I regret it,Its almost been a year and I made a mistakeIn June I broke up with my girlfriend of almost four years because we were going away for college and we were both going out of state on opposite sides of the country I thought it would be the best thing for us but its been the opposite I really hurt her when we broke up The first few days I thought this was going to be the best thing for me and I just tried to push her out of my mind as much as I could but I just kept feeling like an asshole She loved me so much and I took it for granted She would do things for me all the time just because and never expect anything in return She would constantly put me ahead of her and also just loved me no matter what I was going through I couldnt stop thinking about her and during my first week of college I was so excited about what was going on in my life and I wanted nothing more than to just text her and let her know what was going on It bothered me that in the almost 3 months we had been broken up at that point she never once reached out to me I wanted to know how college was going for her I wanted to know how she was doing How could the girl who I once had this amazing love with not try to reach out to me once I texted her letting her know that I had been thinking about her and that I hoped she was doing well She kept things super brief and said she hoped I was doing well but I wanted to talk to her so much more so I poked about what she had been doing and in two months she had done so much and she was going to this great huge school and was doing all of this without me I know I shouldve been happy for her but it just made me sad and angry We didnt talk for a month after that until she sent me a picture of a tattoo she had gotten I was so excited that she finally reached out to me This was the first time since we had broken up that she initiated the conversation We talked for a little bit and it felt so great We fell back into conversation like back when we were dating It felt so good to talk to her again but at the same time it made me feel sick that I knew so little about what was going on in her life now and I was only hearing so little about it I sent her a text telling her how happy I was for her and how what shes doing seems like such a great experience for her and she never responded That hurt a lot I looked at her TikTok and Instagram for the first time in months and I just wanted to throw up She is living this whole life without me She looks happy and most of all beautiful Like how dare she be so beautiful and smile at people with smiles that were once mine I would go to her Spotify and I would be so paranoid that one of those playlists was dedicated to someone that wasnt me I felt so selfish and angry and mad at the world and at myself I had to push her out of my mind so I started seeing someone I wasnt even really interested in them Lookswise they were nothing compared to my exgirlfriend Their personality was so dull and boring compared to my ex and in the end I ended up just feeling like this huge dick for stringing someone along for months just to get over my exgirlfriend I went home for my Christmas break from my college and it got even worse Knowing that we were in the same town and just a drive away from each others houses made me feel insane I got so nervous that I was going to run into her any time I left the house I thought about going Christmas shopping in the mall she worked at so I could accidentally run into her and then would just get sad because I was becoming this huge creep I wanted to text her every day asking if she wanted to get coffee and I never did because nothing would hurt more than knowing she didnt want to see me I texted her Merry Christmas and she was nice about it but she didnt want to talk to me anymore after that And then I saw she went back to her college before me and it was painful seeing her with all her friends having so much fun and having so much fun without me Seeing her cozied up with a girl on her Instagram makes me feel like Im going to throw up I see them post together all the time and I just want to know if theyre dating How could she date someone so soon after 3 almost 4 years How could she be so brazen and post her and that girl getting coffee and going on dates together Does she not think Ill see it I think I would feel worse if it was a man The thought of some man looking at her the way I used to and touching her and being intimate with her makes me angry and sad and violent all at the same time I would stalk her pages all day while I was still in our hometown waiting for her to post something and getting nervous when she would How could she be having so much fun and be so happy all without me We were each others first love first kiss first everything And now I dont know if shes doing that with other people Things got a little bit better when I went back for my second semester of college but I still just cant get her out of my mind Im starting to see another girl now to try and get over my ex and shes again nothing like my exgirlfriend and I dont think there will ever be anyone like herWhen I first broke up with her I didnt think it would hurt this much I guess in the back of my mind I thought she wouldve fought for us I thought she wouldve texted me more when we were broken up I thought she and I honestly wouldve gotten back together at this point Im so insanely in love with her still and I brought this on myself but I thought I was doing whats best for the both of us I guess I didnt appreciate or realize the things that she did for me while we were together,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 13:50:08 UTC,0,16,0.41,,,0,0

1j5l5t1,My Mom hates me,Sorry for the bad writing i attempted to post it in an german subreddit first but they ave a limit of 3k letters max and also dont allow blocktext wich is what this would have turned into if i tried to stay within said margin plus deleting a paragraph So i had to use Google translate Sorry I 25f always have disputes with my 59f mother Whenever I dont do something the same as she wants she gets pretty acidic and even if I do it the same way as she wants she somehow always has something to complain about Example of today Because of the beautiful weather I should hang my duvet out of my window but the problem is that the winter garden roof is right in front of my window and I cant hang it out because it is a more or less flat level So I decided to hang the blanket over the edge of the winter garden roof mind you at one point that was quite clean in my opinion at least And if I had hung the blanket directly out of the window she would have been dirty or even dirty anyway I also had planned and also discussed with my mother that I would wash the blanket this weekend anyway Nevertheless she then sniffed me about half an hour later and she also found it very shit that I sucked at the same time as I was sucking We have a solar system that produces a very nice amount of electricity in very sunny weather and I thought that it would already be finished with sucking because I hadnt heard her vacuum cleaner anymore and then started sucking my room However she still has a problem with it because she apparently continued to suck again after a moment which I couldnt hear because of my loud sucker and also ran the washing machine which I didnt know anything about because I couldnt see or hear her from my room on the first floor and that I was not explicitly told that it would be hired In addition she also complained because I took a break when sucking I have a cold and dont have enough endurance to create everything at once My room consists of two adjacent rooms of which I usually only do one because I am more in this but this time I wanted to do both and only took a break in between After I had explained Mama that she told me that I always had an excuse I then started crying no idea why sometimes happens during such confrontations and Mama asked in a rather aggressive tone why I would cry now even though there is no reason for it and that we would only have a reasonable discussion Incidentally the howling is nothing that I have an influence I dont because it is to cry afterwards or something I have zero control about whether or when this happens In the surplus she also titled such moments as psycho shit and attempted manipulation Not today but in other similar situation Incidentally she mostly teemers my attempts to explain and or counter arguments or ignores them entirely I often have the feeling of being shouted at in these moments even though she only talks to me very quietly her words I dont even want to do something in the household anymore because it is almost always wrong or not right And almost every interaction with her consists that she tells me something what to do or indicate that something is wrongdirty or somehow not correct That would be okay but everything is just too much I dont want to come down to her or talk to her When I come home and your car is not there Im already relieved Is probably not your fault Im probably just over sensitive or overreact or something Also i havent stopped crying the whole time while writingtranslating this and my mom came in and asked me in a really passive aggressive tone what was up and why i am still crying I told her to leave and she left Idk what to do I feel like she truly hates me and idk why she does all of this like that Maybe it makes her happy When asked she always says that she doesnt but Idk if i can believe that,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 11:14:08 UTC,1,1,1.0,,,0,0

the ends of the earth for them once he had to deliver something car oil at 6AM for his sister n her husband 6AM Mf usually wakes up at 2pm ffs 4 he has this obsession w fixing up old cars he would spend loads of money on it and w literally his blood sweat tears and his time Yo i dont mind mf got a hobby i got a hobby too thats great for him but wht abt when i need to shower Do i have to go outside to ask you to watch over our son again with your ugly smug face again to sum up he has 2 obsession league of legends and his car None of which you can bother him at all My hobby is just gym JUST GYM FOR 1 HOUR At which i can ONLY work out when my son takes his afternoon nap I just want him to evenly schedule his hobby not to the point he doesnt have time for his son or me Do u think he

1j4b2z1,Im Leaving for College Soon But Its breaking me apart,This also gon be long i cant help it i am literally crying as i typed this TLDR Im leaving for college soon and while Im excited Im struggling with the thought of leaving my mom behind Weve always been close since my dad works overseas but lately Ive been unintentionally pulling away getting irritable and saying things I regret I thought distancing myself would make leaving easier but it only hurts more Seeing how much my mom will miss memade me realize I dont want to leave things on a sour note I keep having vivid dreams about my departure and the guilt of how Ive treated her is overwhelming I want to fix things before I go but I dont know how Im moving away for college in a few months and as excited as I am for this new chapter I cant stop thinking about how much Im going to miss my mom Shes been my biggest source of comfort my whole life and since my dad works overseas weve always had a strong bond But now that Im getting closer to leaving I feel this huge mix of emotions that I dont know how to deal with Lately Ive noticed myself pulling away a littlenot intentionally but I think its my way of trying to make leaving easier Instead its just making me feel worse Ive been more irritable and I hate that Ive raised my voice at times when I never used to I always used to listen to her life stories even if I had heard them countless times her rants too whenever she shouted for reasons I wasnt even wrong But now I am talking back to her get angry on her and say awful things when she tells her stories I say they are boring and please shut up I dont know why I am doing this I still want to listen to her rants and yapping but I am not able to I am going into that angry zone and I have done many mistakes I havent even apologized properly and that weighs on me Its like Im watching myself act this way but cant stop I know this is all part of growing up but the thought of leaving her behind even temporarily is really hard I dont have many close friends so my mom has always been the one I could talk to But over time I started keeping things to myself thinking I shouldnt burden her with my problems I used to be able to just rest my head in her lap and cry when things got hardwhen I got bullied when I felt alonebut I havent done that in years It makes me sad because I feel like Ive lost that connection a bit and I dont want to leave things this way And now when I probably need it the most I feel like I cant show her the weak side of me that I have long pretended to have erased The other day something happened that really got to me My mom was taking a nap and before sleeping she had asked me to grab some groceries While she was resting my little sister was joking around and said He left for college and my mom suddenly started crying in sleep She thought I had already gone I was still at home but seeing that broke me I rushed to get the groceries but I was tearing up the whole time It made me realize just how hard this is going to befor both of us and precisely the reason I was trying to distance myself from her that she doesnt grieve much but no now I feel that she will cry more that I left and our relation were sour and not mended I genuinely want to say sorry right now but I am stuck and I am going crazy At night I keep having vivid dreams about the day I leave and they feel so real I do have genetic hyperphantasia from my mom that too that I wake up feeling broken Every time its like Im reliving the moment before it even happens I know mom must be having those dreams too It makes me feel so helpless because no matter what I do that day is still coming I was going to leave this January but postponed it to August because in January we were close to ripping each other off that level of arguments But now things are settling down but still it isnt back to what it was last year I know I have to go and I know my mom wants the best for me She always encourages me and Im so grateful for everything shes doneraising me taking care of me making sure I dont feel alone I do feel but I pretend I dont to not hurt her I do have suicidal thoughts sometimes but I hold back that it will all fall into place soon however indefinite the soon is I just want to spend these last few months showing her how much she means to me and making good memories before I leave I just want to do the right thing but I feel so lost I thought distancing myself would help but it only hurts more Idk how to leave without hurting my mom How do I say goodbye without breaking her heart All of these are constantly revolving in my mind and Im going crazy I still have a few months but I dont know how Ill manage I want to mend things But I am thrown into my guilt For those whove gone through something similar how did you make the transition easier How did you make sure your mom knew how much you appreciated her before you left I dont want to take this time for granted and Id love to hear any advice on how to make these last few months meaningful for both of us I know now that pushing my mom away wont make leaving any easierif anything itll only make it worse I tried to make her love me less so she wouldnt hurt when I leave but all I did was create more pain for both of us I dont want her to remember our last months together with regret I just want to fix things before its too late And lastly Just to clarify this is about my bond with my mom as a parent nothing else Were Asianif I ever even thought otherwise shed personally set me straight with a slipper and more ultimate weapons My dad works overseas but is always present calling daily morning and night and supporting her even more than I do listening to her rants and all I love my mom because shes always been there for me and Ive supported her in return She doesnt rely on me for happinessI rely on her I know I have to leave one day but I just want to make things right before I go,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 19:09:23 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j786on,I 21 F got addicted to porn and read disgusting stuff when I was a minor and now I feel gross and disgusting,Throwaway account because I feel terrible about this When I was young 10 maybe and I got an Ipod I would love doing stuff on it But then I got into fanfiction and thus I got into porn I still love fanfiction to this day I also was able to gain access to porn sites Pornhub Xvideoes Spankbang etc My mom had to work long hours and my uncle mostly left me alone were both quiet it got more convinent when I got old enough to become a lackey kid 14 But that day I was in the mood for porn every chapter what I now know as PWP So I would type chapter large number and then put tits or ass and then search I was already seeing gross things I wasnt supposed to but then I found a website and it had adults engaging with minors I was aware that sort of thing was bad but this was written not visual I knew the visual stuff was terrible and never looked for that sort of thing But the written stuff I just kept reading it I justified it as its only weird if Im an adult I never visualized ACTUAL real life children I would think about other fictional characters not sure if thats better but I did But now Im an adult and I feel disgusting I NEVER want to hurt a child in that way I despise child molestors And yet I still read this stuff I stopped when I was about 1819 not sure spefically but I know I havent read that stuff in the past three years and I remember not being able to find the sites anymore which was good in the long run Lately Ive been feeling really gross Like Im disgusting and I should feel awful what I did Which I should Its gotten worse this past year I didnt really think about it I still read stuff where characters were underage but limited to just being in their teens someone on AO3 who does a bunch of Harry Pottercrossover girls stuff and another one who had his own website and was registered on Literotica I want to cut those people out of my reading too I feel horrible for what Ive done and read More context I live with my mother she knows about the video porn thing but not the written stuff Im a college student I cant drive I rideshare everywhere I WANT to get therapy but I dont want to spend money My mom has actually taken me to therapy a few times this problem hadnt affected me mentally yet for me to bring it up plus most of the time my mother was in room so I wouldnt have done so regardless I actually got diagnosed with anxiety But I assume the reason we dont make it a regular thing is because its expensive The best thing I feel I can do is go to hotlines Sometimes they do make me feel better Once I watched some YT video about someone who hurt animals and I thought I could handle it but the woman said this man also read stuff from one of the sites I found I never liked that I would avoid that if I saw it and I FELT DESPECIBLE The hotline got me a nice lady that told me some gentle things that made me calm down But then I read one of the guys I mentioned work on Literotica the characters were ACTUALLY OF LEGAL AGE and it felt like I relapsed Then I watched porn on a specific website for specific kink of me but when I was looking for something one of the videoes said teenage and I began to spiral Because of one hand not all pornsites are trustworthy but on the other 18 and 19 legal adult age could still be referred to as teenage so I was confused so I called them and the lady didnt want to help me and she transferred me to a warmline they were nice but they asked for my insurance which I wasnt expecting so I ended up feeling emotionally drained It came to a head when I woke up this morning and I was on my period and then I started feeling those thoughts that was disgusting while my body was in pain I couldnt call because my mother was still asleep So I texted my hotline and the woman said my problem wasnt something a hotline could fix so she sent me all these links to porn addiction stuff They either cost money or I felt they couldnt help me because they talked about this happening to men Alternatively they could help but my mother was still in the house so I still felt I couldnt do anything immediately And it really felt like no one could help me I even signed up for Betterhelp though I remembered they had controversy and signed out before telling my problem So I decided to post this on here I really dont want to hurt anyone I want to put that terrible part of my past behind me But sometimes I cant help but think about it and feel disgusting,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 13:58:23 UTC,0,7,0.5,,,0,0
1j354wi,Is It Normal for a Mom to Act Like This Feels Like I Have a Teenager for a Parent,What do i do Sometimes i feel like my mom can just be the worst She can be so rude immature and she acts like a teenager Am i wrong for thinking this I keep switching between self pity and guilt because i just have no idea if this is normal or not because all in all she is my mom and i love her very much but sometimes when i witness some of my friends relationships with their mothers i feel tears come to my eyes literally Basically for context i graduated from high school four months ago and im only going to university next year so taking a gap year to travel and work and im leaving overseas in three months So basically my day to day just consists of learning the piano trying to find a job reading a bit organising my OE and occasionally hanging out with friends Today i was watching Tv which to be honest i rarely rarely do and out of nowhere she comes storming in with a horrible attitude and my heart just immediately starts racing because for some reason I can never fully relax around her Im just always on edge even the sound of her footsteps gives me anxiety She starts complaining and getting angry at me basically muttering this lazy bitch etc to herself because she was working and didnt have time for lunch yet while i was sitting infront ofthe TV I mean am i wrong for getting a bit uncomfortable and weirded out by that Just because I feel like she shouldnt be comparing herself to me and it just feels very immature and strange like is it entitled for me to think yes well your the adult and im not sure why your comparing yourself to your teenage daughter Like she was trying to guilt trip me Shes just always angry and taking shots at me and it feels so weird because Im the one that has to endure her tantrums and Ive learnt not to react or give her my emotions and try and just stay level Its to the point where if she does decide to be nice to me i just get sad or even angry because its like i cant even enjoy it because i know it wont last Its like she flips a switch depending on her mood It reallly feels like im on eggshells when im in the same room as her and it almost feels stuffy and hard to breathe Like i just cant enjoy myself or let my mind be at rest im always aware of where she is and what shes doing and when she leaves the room i can breathe I understand to an extent why she is so angry and frustrated with me all the time but its just upsetting because i feel like i can count on one hand the amount of times she speaks to me nicely in a week To be honest my room is a pigstye and i know it and i hate it too but im just in a bit of a rut right now and i know its bad and ive been trying to clear it step by step but its very overwhelming for me and i dont blame her for being frustrated about it But I was finally makin some progress the other day and packing my dirty clothes into one basket and organising them in the other and then i go to bed and leave it for the next day to put away I wakeup and the clothes are thrown everywhere around the room and i hear her yelling that i shouldnt be using the baskets she needs for laundry or something like that To be honest i wasnt really even suprised or angry But today i decided to sort of get back at her a bit which i know is immature but i couldnt realy control my emotions and when i get angry i dont yell back or argue i just do something small to the other person which sort of calms down my head so i squirted a bit of ketchup from my lunch onto the carpet It was really only a dollar coin size but i go back to my room and i hear her storming down the stairs and throwing open my door and starting to scream at me about it I just really am at a loss and dont know if its me or if its her,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 07:04:41 UTC,1,2,1.0,,,0,0

1j62wut,nex fiancé ruined my life blamed me for it and then admitted he was never capable of it,just saw a post about their narc maybe being DL and im realizing mine definitely was and after everything he did and blaming me for it he said thats why he did it and couldnt have let us every happen or get married bc of his hidden desires exact quote at the bottom in the beginning he said he had a deep fetish he said it was humiliation at first then the real truth was later revealed to me and then it wasnt until after the break up he said there was sissy and cross dressing and that he might be gay which is so bizarre bc one he only ever told me about the real kink way later and never told me the full details of it and he loves women sexually and is very sexual and addicted to porn but he was interested in trans women and anal sex i guess its wild bc he always said he could never be in a relationship with a man bc he needed a woman who was submissive and he had control over basically he wanted a woman in her feminine energy but wasnt safe enough to let me stay there after our break up also he went on a power kick after i was trying to say goodbye like i guess trying to regain power and he was being agressive and telling me to submit and basically confirm that he was right and i was wrong and legit got hard from it the next day i said i will only submit to a man who protects and takes care of me and does not abuse me and he said he would still abuse me and i should stop whinning about it there were times he wanted to have sex with me while watching porn and wouldnt show what the porn was or giving him bjs and hjs while he watched porn ive posted my story lots but have left out this major detail bc it felt wrong to discuss but for reference we got engaged i uprooted my life to go move in with him in another state 6 days after the proposal and me thousands of dollars deep into the move he called it off unprovoked bc by this time i had been perfect according to his unreasonable standards but he still blamed me this is all after months of emotional and verbal abuse i lost my home a job a baby mental health love my best friend my safety the realization is he legit told me he loved his fetish and addictions more than me and he also said after he broke off our engagement and putting me through absolute hell and destroying my life and financially abusing me and me loosing my home to go move with him after our engagement AFTER blaming me for the reason why he did it and a couple weeks after i came back to my state and was recovering from the move he said So we get married have kids And I say by the way I love wearing diapers Dressing as a girl and letting dudes or someone fuck my ass I wasnt gonna let that happen and that he wasnt sure if he was bi or gay i couldnt tell if he was saying all of that as a ploy to make it easier to be friends with him bc he was actively saying he wanted me in his life and he said would it be easier if i were gay and then told me all those things idk if it was more manipulation or if its true i know his kink is a major thing and it wasnt something i was into and he wants to be with someone romantically who isnt into in but still have sexual encounters with people who are into his kink i can never tell when he was being honest or just saying something to get a certain reaction out of me there were several times hed say im going to go fuck this girl tonight bc you stress me out and then id find out he was home along and not with her his mom would tell me or he later would tell me he never did there were plenty of cases like this too he would just say things to make me believe it so i couldnt tell if he was saying he might be gay for that instance too idk in no way am i being insensitive to sexuality or kinks i was very supportive to him through it all but this is just making me realize he was never going to follow through and legit used me he basically admitted to putting me through hell abusing me very thoroughly blaming it allllll on me and my character flaws made me lose my home to move states with him tell me entire family we got engaged lose my job and spend thousands on moving lose a child all to cancel our engagement and move during a mania spike he had and BLAMES IT ON ME all while he was literally never going to be capable of following through there were so many signs too im realizing now that ive missed he used to straight up tell me that he was mirroring me and i thought that was weird bc women typically mirror the man he used to also say hed just find someone to marry him out of convenience bc he wasnt capable of love he was always so selfish in every aspect of our lives he always made it known to everyone and called me his wife and loved the image that it gave him but treated me like dirt this man was straight up telling me he was a narcissist and i missed the signs in a haze he emotionally verbally mentally and financially abused me for literally nothing bc i was kind and sweet and supportive and empathetic and showed him love he couldnt even fathom he literally watched me as i bent over backwards for him and took care of him and lost the stability in my life to create one with him while he was just belittling me and destroying my worth and esteem he needed control over me bc he lacked it in his own life and addictions and self and was never going to marry me or create the life together we planned bc his demons and desires would have never allowed it even when i was accommodating and understanding but the blame is all on me for loving him and having needs theres so many factors to this and so many versions of him its hard to wrap my head around it all,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:01:38 UTC,4,5,0.67,,,0,0

1j7qxko,Timeless heirloom,My birthday is coming up next month I m 32 plan to get myself a pink diamond tennis necklace or a pink diamond pendant Pink is my fav color and the meaning of love and what pink represents really means alot to me but also has alot of unrelated meaning like as a male learning to not give a fuck what other people have to say 6 years ago I bought myself an amethyst necklace from mexico I love it I also bought myself a pink diamond tennis bracelet Around that time Id thought Id have kids mainly a daughter and I could pass down my timeless heirloom as something to be remembered by by the one person in my life who will look at me like something they never ever want to lose 6 years later Im nowhere near a child and I still hold onto those heirlooms potentially bound to wound up in a landfill or on someones desk who just looks at it as costume jewelry Its interesting how much an item can tell a story more than a price I like to think items cost more than dollar value but rather hold a lifetime of sentimental value to the person who made it to the person who originally bought it,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 04:49:10 UTC,1,0,0.6,,,0,0

1j85hv5,I am a man I got sexually assaulted She twisted it and accused me everyone only believed her,Its been a few years since this happened I had to quit college and end my studies because of it I have mostly pretended it never happened but Ive recently been looking back and processing it and I need to talk to someone about it I dont have anyone to talk to about this so I decided to come here Many years ago I was 17 and had just started college I befriended a girl lets call her Emma Emma started dating this Bisexual girl lets call her Jenny and once she came into the picture the three of us formed a friend group We were a good friend group for a while and had lots of fun hanging out and studying together Still at some point Emmas and Jennys relationship started to go really sour Jenny had BPD and their relationship had started to become really unstable They had arguments almost daily even at our college And during these times I became the therapist whenever I individually met them they would rant to me about each other And Jenny and I really bonded and became good friends since she actually listened to my rants too The day it happened the school had organized a disco party Emma was working and had to get home get ready and head straight to the party So Jenny had invited me to hang out at her place before the party get ready together hang out and then head over to meet Emma at the party We were just hanging around typical college kid age things and everything was light hearted But suddenly things got really weird she started talking about sexual things asking me about my kinks and fetishes asking me about all sorts of sexual questions and it somehow evolved to her taking out her computer and showing me the kind of porn she watches and yes when I say showing I mean putting on the actual videos of her favourite porn and asking me to show mine From there it kept escalating into much weirder sexual things after the porn she started talking about Emma and telling me what they do in bed then she pulled out her phone and started showing me nudes of Emma without Emmas permission or knowledge of it The next part which I feel extremely uncomfortable thinking about and trying to forget Her parents were downstairs eating dinner after showing me a bunch of nudes of Emma without her permission she opened the door and at that point her parents could probably hear whatever we were talking about Then she sat down next to me started talking about how much she misses being with a guy put her hands inside my pants and Sexually Assaulted me while making remarks about how much she liked feeling me Eventually her parents started to come upstairs She stopped and at that point I said I had to go and went home skipping the party I didnt want any of that I only saw her as a friend and I didnt consent I justfroze Many people have asked me when I tell this why I didnt stop her and said to me that I Consented by not stopping around the part she started showing porn or Emmas nudes But I was dissociating the whole time I cant really explain it but I was in shock the entire time Afterwards the next day when I came to college she had told Emma at the party that she cheated on her told her I had made a move on her and she reciprocated it This broke our friend group entirely and I was left alone with no friends It all went completely sideways when a mutual asked me about what happened to our group and once I told her the story she asked me Isnt that sexual assault and thats when it hit me what it really was to which I said yes Not too long later that person talked to Jenny about it Jenny told her a completely different story that she was the victim of SA and I was the one who did it she twisted the whole story in a way where she told people I did all the things she did that night the kink questions porn begging to see nudes of Emma and then I assaulted her No matter how much I told the truth No one listened they all believed her It didnt take long for the whole school to believe her and paint me as a sexual predator I became an outcast and everyone treated me like a monster It led me really close to suicide and I dropped out of school and have never gone back not long after I dropped out I developed very heavy substance abuse and have been struggling with it until recently I am sober for around 9 months now I really dont know how I feel about posting this but I genuinely just needed to tell my story I just needed to vent Im sorry if this is too much I hope you all have a good day,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 18:23:02 UTC,426,32,0.96,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j4i0nn,I want to help people my entire life but the issue is I feel like I am the touch of death,For complete transparency I wrote this out first on wordpad can post the original if requested but since my grammar and wording is never great learning disability I ran it thru a AI grammar editor The message and feelings are still mine as I reread it to be 100 sure Just thought you all should no Im writing this because its been weighing on my mind for a long time It keeps happening and I cant shake the feeling that Im the common factor For as long as I can remember Ive wanted to make a difference in someones life In high school I dreamed of becoming a teacher to help kids At one point I even considered becoming a doctor or a nurse to be there for people in their worst moments But over the years those dreams fadedbecause every time Ive tried to help things have ended the same way It seems like whenever someone needs emergency medical care and I step in to help they dont make it The Moments That Haunt Me One of the first times this happened I was around 1820 years old I was walking home from Walmart when I heard a crash Looking over I saw a motorcycle had been tboned by a car and the driver was on the ground Without thinking I ran toward him weaving through traffic I took his hand and spoke to him trying to keep him calm while others applied pressure to his wounds He handed me his phone and asked me to call a family member to let them know he was going to the hospital I did exactly that then gave the phone back to him Soon after paramedics arrived and took him away Later I read that he had died from his injuries At the time I didnt think much of it beyond the tragedy of the accident A few years later I was at home when my stepfather suddenly jumped up and said Call an ambulance We did and while waiting I ran upstairs to grab him a shirt as asked I helped him put it on talking to him reassuring him that everything would be okay The paramedics arrived and took him away Shortly after he went into heart failure and died Then a few years after that I was living in an apartment building One day I glanced out the window out of boredom and saw my neighbors unloading groceries Out of nowhere the wife collapsed and her husband barely caught her in time I didnt hesitateI bolted out of my apartment without even locking the door ran down the hallway hit the elevator button and after a few seconds of waiting said Fuck it and took the stairs I got to them as fast as I could Her husband was on the phone with paramedics while I held her trying to comfort her as he gathered her meds and health cards The building superintendent came out just standing there saying Shes going to be okay Just being completely useless It took the paramedics over 30 minutes to arrive The moment I stepped back to let them work they had to use a defibrillator there heart had stopped She didnt make it The Fear That Lingers These are just a few of the moments that have left me feeling this way I may add more as I remember them But because of them I feel like I cant help peoplebecause when I do it only seems to end badly I honestly have never had someone survive going to the hospital after I help Its been about three years since I last experienced something like this and I hope I never do again But Im scared that if it happens again Ill freeze up That fear eats at methe fear that I wont be able to help that Ill hesitate that Ill fail someone when they need me most Im shaking as I write this scared of being judged of being called a coward But I needed to get this off my chest because its been haunting me for far too long I am shaking trying to hit the post button,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 23:57:50 UTC,6,2,1.0,,,0,0

1j4f34n,I only now realize that I was badly bullied in school,I graduated last year and am now atending a university The diffrence is astonishing I realized that the behavior I had to endure was way more off the charts than I thought I am transgender ftm and autistic In my old class was another autistic kid whose autism presented diffrently from mine Funny enough I was always excluded and people didnt like me for being weird and missing out on social clues But when I got diagnosed and received accommodations that was me getting favors and faking autism for attention I know of some rumors that were spread about me but I have no clue how or who started those Apperently I was a lesbian never was and some were convinced that I would get mad and loud when I get missgenderd I dont know why anyone believed that since I did get missgendered quite often and literally only corrected the people with a hey sorry it is actually him or sth One kid in particular seemed to have it out for and said some homphobic stuff though he only did it when I wasnt present others snithed or he thought I wouldnt hear him He actually once ran up to me while carrying a knife A joke surrrreeee My class loved jokes They would act as if they were jerking off in the back of the room or say something rather loudly etc when I held presentations I always went to the teachers and asked for help No one ever helped me Some wanted to but had to catch them in the act which wasnt that easy and the other teachers didnt seem to care enough Though every adult always reassured me that I would be fine and nothing would happen to me I wasnt the easiest kid to be around since I literally learned how to be nice in 10th grade and sucked a great deal before and during that learning But I was always willing to reflect and talk about my misstakes I am now in a much better place Everyone respects me and I feel comfortable learning again Though I am starting to feel angry that this extreme behaviuor was ever permitted and given space at that school I love some of my teachers they were the kindest people I ever met and helped me greatly Others not so much Bullying really sucks and I needed to get this off my chest,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:51:03 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0

1j3qh3b,I Am Watching My Best Friends Fiancé Ruin His Life Day by Day,Long time lurker first time poster I have reached a boiling point where I cannot keep this within anymore My wife and I have been watching my best friends life crumbles in front of us due to his fiancé and her manipulations For the remaining of my story I will refer to my best friend as T and his fiancé as Z T and Z met on Tinder during late 2021 and T introduced Z to me and our friend group in early 2022 Ever since I met Z my wife and I had identifed so many red flags about her Here is a summary of what I can recall 1 Z has a habit of trauma dumping her past to everyone she met Even during casual conversations when people asked about her life before meeting T she would reveal about her previous engagement where her exfiancé would beat her in front of her mom just all kinds of sob stories her suicide attempts and generally just all sorts of stories that Z loves telling people that she just met making every conversation with Z extremely uncomfortable for everyone 2 Over the course of their relationship Z had convinced T to cut off his friendships with all of his childhood friends who all warned T about Zs questionable character I remember that the day T told his childhood friend group that he no longer wishes to speak to them that whole group messaged me on Facebook warning me to watch out for Z and that she is bad news even though they have never met me my guess is that T talked about me with them given that T and I are really good friends who went through a lot in life together This is the beginning of Zs gradual removal of Ts friends and her plan to isolate him from his support system What I also noticed is that Z is unable to make and keep any new friends any new friend group that met Z through T eventually got so repulsed by her that they distanced themselves from T and Z 3 Z casually bragged to me and my wife that she read all of Ts personal messages on Facebook and texts to his friends even the things he said before they met My wife and I kept telling Z to be more respectful of personal boundaries especially when it comes to the past but Z did not care and kept reading Ts personal messages to friends and family til this day 4 T and Z bought a house together in 2023 and the moment they signed it off Z quit her job claiming mistreatment even though she always bragged that the job allowed her to nap in her own office anytime she wanted and everyone treated her like family there 5 Now that T and Z are a singleincome household with T working his ass off to cover their mortgage and living expenses Z always asked for T to take her to lavish restaurants frequent trips to Disney parks even having him take her to a week in Disneyworld in Florida after she left her job Every weekend she would have him take her to LA for a different expensive restaurant so that she could take pics and flex for her IG stories 6 Z got a diagnosis for Bipolar 1 sometime in 2024 Ever since she frequently asked T to leave his work early to come home because of her not feeling well for whatever reasons Note that because of this T eventually got flagged for declining performance at his work but despite knowing this Z still had T leave work early often for her 7 It is interesting to note that despite always claiming of not feeling well almost every day during the times that I would come over at Ts place to hang out I observed that Z was frequently able to drive herself late at night to play video games at her brothers house which is a half hour drive away and come home late just fine What pissed me off the most was that during my wedding which was the only time in life that I asked to spend a lot of time with T Z asked T to leave my wedding early because you guessed it she wasnt feeling well To make matters worse Z wore a white dress to my wedding and my wife and I got asked many questions from our friends about that but we just shook it off because we were speechless about that as well 8 While she was unemployed Z decided to go to college for an accounting degree even though she has no goals of working anywhere after She always openly bragged about how she had T doing her college homework and coursework for her because she has difficulty learning since English is not her first language 9 T eventually got fired from his job for his declining performance My wife and I was able to meet up at Ts house to provide T some guidance and support to look for a new job During that time Z told us that she already asked T for a boob job she claimed that she feels insecure in college for being flat chested and she also wants T to pay for a few other cosmetic procedures well knowing that T doesnt have a source of income anymore T and Z will get married at some point in 2026 and I feel like theres nothing I can do about it My wife and I know it to our core that Z is a terrible human being but T keeps giving her excuses and falling for her trauma dumping When my own family briefly talked with T and Z at my wedding they have also all noted that Z came off very disingenuous and manipulative Since my wife and I spent the most time with T and Z our friend group for the most part doesnt know as much about Z as we know I feel like I am watching Ts life crumbles in real time as Z keeps draining his life away for her own use I honestly wish I put in more effort in talking T out of dating Z when they first met I never expected T to end up with someone that feels no remorse ruining his life like this Guess since I cant talk to anyone else IRL about this aside from my wife I am better off letting this out on Reddit,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 00:41:23 UTC,2,6,1.0,,,0,0
1j7fdqt,My exgirlfriend gaslit me while relationship while cheating on me found out on my birthday,My m24 now exf26 girlfriend started dating in March last year I had just come out of a toxic situationship where I take part blame I was a bad communicator Im sure I still am but I gained some communication skills I really liked her found my now ex 3 weeks later I knew it would be a rebound but it helped so much Especially considering this girl had been my crush since 8 years ago when I had first started working with her We had so much fun early on trips going out eating out It started to feel less like a rebound and something of a real relationship Unfortunately it came to her moving out of her moms house She needed a place to go and me with my somewhat trust issues was scared to let her move in with her friends which were one girl and two guys She had been known to get around but I trusted her more than most people did and had hope She was very kind had many mental issues but nothing I couldnt stand I had grown up with childhood trauma and this seemed like nothing So me with my trust issues and wanting to move out of my moms house as well took her offer of renting a place together It seemed fun and I had just started a career job so it seemed like a good time Found out very quickly it would not be See my ex well call Fiona had severe insecurities and drinking issues not to mention drug addiction I had known to some extent but not to this severity The first week we moved in I wanted to have a get together party for our first place together Turns out Fiona hates having people in her space She was very quiet the whole night and near the end she stormed off to the room where Id get yelled at when I head to bed She scream at me in bed as I had work the next morning I told her sorry and wed talk about it tomorrow She got up and stormed out the room I was just happy for the quiet until I hear her screaming my name and yelling help Help I storm out seeing her wrist covered in blood with it spilling all over the floors I help her best I can she didnt hit an artery so it soon stopped but left a nasty scar After this night most nights especially when we went out I would get no rest being accused of cheating or just not giving her enough love Over the next few months one of our mutual friends decided a surprise birthday party for her I honestly wasnt thinking to hard about it I just thought maybe itd make her happy forgetting she didnt like people in her space Same thing happened She was upset the whole night stayed in the bedrooms and never came out Through out the night you could hear her screams saying get out of my house In the most embarrassing way possible Her sister was there and tried to calm her down the whole night which did not work I eventually got everyone out because the music was barely covering it up I went to bed again Same thing yelling at me She got up stormed out I was worried but thought that it was a one time thing Nope I instantly hear my name being screamed This time much worse I come out to see the cut is even deeper attempt to stop the bleeding but it just wont I call 911 while making a makeshift tourniquet to try and stop it The paramedics get her after the police which was someone I knew I told them about how she was saying before that she wanted to die I didnt think this was an attempt but a callout I took her to the hospital after the medics said she didnt need the ambulance after patching her up Stayed up all night at the hospital dropped her off at home then went to work I was miserable I couldnt stand this anymore I didnt want to break the lease but at the same time I also still cared for this girl I felt bad I needed a way out that night was my chance but you just couldnt leave her alone she cried and begged me So we continued our relationship A few months later same thing yelling at me and saying I dont give her enough affirmations and accusing me of deleting snapchats and sneaking people in when shes off at work Which led to a night that she destroyed my tv in the living room put holes in the walls and screamed at me in my face I was done I left to stay at my friends house Told her to leave wed figure out the situation after The day after she said she needed time to move and wanted to talk I went over and we talked the whole night She promised shed get therapy and help And I felt so terrible I truly loved this girl but it was such a toxic relationship I gave her one last chance We decided to stick together agreeing to talk things out more See I still have my trust issues and being accused of things makes me curious why its that in particular I memorized her password months ago but never really felt the need to look through her phone I had it just in case But I was working one night straight shift She went out with her friends Acted very strange to me and I just felt something was off I come home at 7am find her dead asleep Couldnt even wake her up to give her a kiss She had left her phone on my side of the bed I felt the urge to look through it Went through it for hours Finding hidden messages in messenger of her taking to her ex saying how she thinks about him everyday and that she needs him Other messages to her OTHER ex on Snapchat came across it by chance because it had been cleared and muted It was of last night being very flirty and him leaving hearts and her pictures with her hearting back Her saying I miss you and then a phone call about 6 minutes lasting I called this number I asked him to be straight up if shes cheating He sounded dumbfounded but said she wasnt and that they were just friends that use to date But I found pictures dating only right before we started dating that they were kissing and all over eachother I woke her up absolutely heated Ngl this was probably the angriest Ive ever been I told her what I had seen She of course denied it Eventually admitting that it was cheating but they never had sex Which I absolutely think is a lie But I said it was over and she took it so easily She nodded and called her mom got her stuff in the car then laughing about a joke she made saying shes tired of constantly moving All while I sit and wait for her to leave Also if I didnt mention this happened ALL ON MY BIRTHDAY She leaves not answering any of my questions like why how could you do this Since then Ive

1j72p6c,I was in an aya cult I told his wife and she didnt believe me,After returning home from an ayahuasca ceremony I got a message from a friend of mine whom I considered a spiritual brother He wanted to meet up I was still in that postceremony glowfull of energy despite the late hourand I wanted to socialize I live down a long dirt trail a 15minute walk from the nearest road When I got there he was waiting in his SUV I was excited to talk with him Right away he offered me some hard liquor saying This is what the indigenous people drink here Its very good for you But I had just returned from drinking ayahuasca and he knew that He wasnt speaking clearly but he started telling me stories about indigenous cosmology which fascinated meuntil the conversation took a turn He began talking about how husbands take other women and how normal it is Then he told me he needed someone spiritually on his level so they could have a deeper connection than with their actual partners I told him flat out I wasnt interested But I kept asking questions Does your wife know about these practices you do No no he said but its better for her Better for me too And for our children He started going on about how we dont marry the people we are equal towe marry the ones who are good for having kids That real spiritual connection is with extramarital lovers He kept inflating my ego using spiritual talk to manipulate me I asked if he had done this before Ive done it many times he admitted With many different women Then he put his hand on my leg I told him I was leaving But I made the mistake of trying to stay friendly Let me just show you one thing before you go he said He stopped me behind the car and hugged me Thats when I froze Trauma hit me like a wave This wasnt the first time something like this had happened to me and suddenly I was simultaneously trapped in his arms and in my past He pulled me tightly against him ran his hand down my back onto my hindquarters At the same time he started kissing melightly from my ear down to my collarbone My stomach churned with nausea I squirmed to get away He let go I was in full trauma response barely able to hold back tears Then he begged me not to tell his wife I barely managed a goodbye before I ran back up the hill to my house praying he wasnt following me A few days later I saw his wife Despite my own pain I felt it was my duty to tell her the truth about her husband Never mind my traumathis was her husband She deserved to know At first she seemed to believe me But later that day I got a message from her She repeated all his lies He told her I subconsciously wanted to be with him That based on our messages I must have known it was going to be romantic But that couldnt be further from the truth I was completely blindsided Now looking back I understand things I didnt back then At the time I was in a cult I believed that everyone in it was a good person incapable of this kind of thing If it were me now Id know better Id understand that if a married man asks a woman to meet him at 2 AM hes not looking to talk about life Full stop Today I saw both of them Seeing him again brought everything back how he lied how he got away with it how his wife believed him over me The anger and pain hit me like a tidal wave I wanted to punch his stupid mouth to do something to make him face the truth of what he did I even had a thought of roleplaying the situation in front of his wifeforcing her to see it so she would understand But I know deep down no matter what I do she probably wont believe me He has her wrapped in lies And Im the one left carrying all of this Ive been crying all day I feel so much anger hurt and grief I dont know how to process this,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 07:47:16 UTC,203,31,0.91,,,0,0
1j3jv17,I am in group chats and I think high school me would be proud,Back when I was in highschool I was a bit of an outcast I wasnt bullied not to my face at least was okayish socially kinda liked Always sort of something I had friends sure but I was never the number one choice Group projects I had to ask for partners no one ever asked me Same went for field trip sleeping arrangements and anything that had to be in pairs or above If we were a five people group and the project was for four Id be the one left out almost every time It would have been one thing if I was a lousy student but I had great grades so I know it wasnt about that I was also always the one to create all the group chats and always learned that there was one without me as well And sure people can do whatever they want but it still hurts when you find that out Some of these people are ones I kept in touch until today I am 24 now but again never the first choice And it might feel or seem small but I was never the one people set next to I didnt smell bad I asked about it wasnt an annoyance just another part of never being first Now dont get me wrong They were amazing friends that point aside Always there for me when I needed supported me when I came out and through a couple of years that were practically hell for my mental health defended me when I didnt know I needed defense They still support me to this day too Its safe to say I literally wouldnt have been here today without them Then college happened I started this year and the social aspect was my major fear Will I even have friends Or is it really something so awful about me that makes people feel less for me every time But college couldnt have been more different I found people that actually like me When we have classes together they search for me When I miss a day I get a text asking where I was because I never skip classes And even if they were a group before I joined they added me to their group chat without making a big deal out of it They didnt open a new group they just added me to their usual one We plan our schedules together so we share most classes we make plans I dont have to start chats I guess I am being chosen for the first time and not being left behind Its a point when I am positive that even if I dont have many classes with any of them in the future we will still keep in touch and stay friends There isnt much to this post aside from happy at where I came to but I felt like I had to get it out and tell someone,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 19:55:21 UTC,13,0,1.0,,Positive,0,0

1j2zd0k,I am struggling with the decision of accepting money from my dad when I plan on cutting him off again,For context I am 29 years old and I grew up in an extremely abusive household My dad nearly tried to take my life on several occasions and knew that my brother was sexually abusing me and did nothing about it My dad constantly threatened to either kill me or himself and would not let me move out or live my life even through my 20s He would pretend to be poor and ask me to help him with bills all the time but he was sitting on a half a million dollars and just didnt want to use it It got to the point that even in my early and mid twenties he tracked my location my credit card bank account etc and would abuse me choke me punch me threaten to kill me if I spent any money on anything Once I even asked to move out and he grabbed a kitchen knife and said hell either kill me or himself if I ever leave I ended up getting cancer and my dad never even helped me with any of my bills for treatment and still continued to ask ME for moneyhelp Fast forward to last year I finally ran away I changed my last name my phone number moved to a different city and took my dog and left I went one full year without contact filed restraining orders and everything My dog has been my only consistent family my entire life He has been the only support Ive ever had and is my emotional support dog He was just diagnosed with cancer and I BROKE down Out of sheer emotion I called my dad Which was the dumbest thing Ive ever done He was so elated to have me call him and back in his life that he offered to pay for my dogs surgery to help him be cancer free I let him and I was so happy to have support I NEED to cut him off again because hes already talking about wanting to leave his wife my mom and move in with me so we can leave happily ever after He makes comments like we can get a second puppy and raise him together as if we are a couple and we would live a life together My father is making me EXTREMELY SICK and I am reminded why I had to cut him off Anyway I was told my dog may need a round or two of chemotherapy Giving him chemotherapy could give him a matter of YEARS of his life back versus only months My dog is in EXCELLENT condition couldnt even tell he was sick He IS worth saving My dad is offering to pay for the chemotherapy Because he thinks he will be able to keep me in his life by doing so Am I a bad person if I accepted his financial help and then cut him off all over again right after Is that morally wrong Would I be the AH Im learning how to live life at 29 years old for the very first time and barely making it I was never taught financial literacy or how to manage my money because my dad did everything for me And didnt let me take charge of my own life I never knew how to cook or do ANYTHING They took my life away from me because they wanted me to live with them forever I need this financial help to save my very best friend but I also dont want to do something that would make me a horrible person I could TECHNICALLY afford his chemo but it would pretty much make me have 0 savings So WIBTA to take his money and then run I also considered telling him that Id only accept the money if he knew it was no strings attached and that he has to be fully aware that I am not letting him BUY a relationship with me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 01:35:42 UTC,0,1,0.5,,,0,0

1j560mr,I think i believe in fate because my first love came back into my life,I 21 fam dating my high school sweetheart again after years of not seeing or speaking to each other We met working a shitty fast food job in high school and I fell in love with her almost immediately Shes smart so fun to be around made me laugh and made me feel genuinely loved and appreciated for the first time in my life I felt more confident more comfortable around her Not to mention shes also the most gorgeous person ive ever seen We dated for a bit and then she broke up with me towards the end of our senior year I was heartbroken and went off to college still processing and dealing with the breakup As silly as it sounds and I know most people think this with their first love but I really thought i was going to marry this girl We chatted on and off throughout my freshman year just normal shit like hey how are you doing and we should catch up before I finally decided it was finally time to fully move on and forget about her so I blocked her on everything that summer and deleted her number While i still thought of her from time to time I wasnt angry or hurt about the breakup anymore I had accepted that 17yearolds know nothing about love and all I can do with heartbreak is learn from it Fast forward to the beginning of my junior year of college and Ive dated on and off for years now and was in the process of trying to end a terrible long term relationship I drove from college to my hometown around 3 hours to be with my friends after ending things while my new ex blew up my phone with calls and messages telling me what a horrible person i was for breaking up with her I was not she treated me terrible and refused to listen to me when I had an issue My friends and I decided to grab food and hangout in my car in one of the parking lots in our hometown We pulled in and I saw my first Exs car It had a very distinctive bumper sticker so I knew it was her I didnt get out or try to say anything but my heart skipped a beat I really truly believed I would never see this girl again I debated reaching out but in the end I unblocked her on snapchat and reached out with a simple hey were you at x lot the other night and we spent a few weeks catching up and then hung out for the first time in years She told me she missed me and had always regretted the way things ended between us I had no intention of trying to date again when I reached out but I admit I did miss her too That was about 9 months ago and one thing led to another and now we are fully back together and its been amazing I know its only been three years since we broke up originally and I will say that I still dont know anything about love Im a different person than I was in high school and so is she She makes me feel like the most beautiful person in the world and ive never come close to feeling this way for anyone but her All I do know is that as long as Im able I will do my best to love her the way she deserves because as far as im concerned she does the same for me I cant help but wonder how my life would be different now if we hadnt gone to that one parking lot that night Thank you for reading xoxo,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 21:01:47 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0

enjoy it and it gives me a lot of financial security My best friend Celia also does sex work and we share notes about the job and even have the same clients on occasion She met John first John is an obese 300lb man early 30s and a high maintenance client He was very recently divorced because he cheated on his high school sweetheart wife with another friend from high school He left his wife only to have his new girlfriend leave him about a month later for another man Why did he cheat on his wife Because she had gained so much weight that he no longer found her attractive I saw photos of her she was barely overweight He on the other hand nearly doubled his weight since they got married John is a home inspector for an insurance company He makes good money by inspecting a high volume of homes but part of the job is using all the data collected to write personalized reports on each home inspection When John was married his wife did the reports for him this was illegal because the information is supposed to be confidential but he was able to get away with it because they lived together and she used his work PC to help him out So he left his wife then his girlfriend of two months left him He was desperate to get her back any which way and knew she needed money so he offered to pay her to do the reports for him which worked out because his wife was no longer willing to do them He figured out a way to log into his work from her PC trained her up and used his position as her boss to make her spend as much time with him as possible so he could potentially win her back he would only ever pay her in person for example and coerce her into spending hours with him before he paid her the money This isnt important to the story it just gives background information on his history of inappropriate relationships and manipulating women In the meantime he started seeing escorts to fill the sexual void Eventually he met Celia and very quickly fell into limerance For the first time since his ex girlfriend left him John had a new woman to obsess over He shared his whole life story with Celia texted her all the time and visited her more often than he could afford She found him exhausting to see he had strangled dick syndrome from a porn addiction and struggled to get off but would urge her to keep trying He talked constantly about himself overshared about his childhood trauma and would stay longer than he paid for forcing her to have to kick him out each time She set boundaries about him texting her so much and taking so much of her emotional energy but he kept breaking them So she enlisted my help I have a few more years experience under my belt and felt confident that I could handle his neediness After she talked me up he agreed to meet me The appointment was a success I was able to work around his strangled dick problem and he began to see us both regularly But it became obvious that he was obsessive and inappropriate He talked about Celia nonstop and shared personal details about their time together with me He also shared private details about his exwife and exgirlfriend When he saw Celia he talked about me and overshared in a similar way It made her very uncomfortable and she set boundaries around it He didnt abide by the boundaries so she fired him He was devastated But I was able to distract him and help him process the heartbreak He felt betrayed by her because she treated him as a client and he felt like he deserved better treatment I gently defended her actions but not so much that it would offend him By this point I was earning steady money seeing him so I didnt want to risk jeopardizing that cash flow I could see that he needed the full girlfriend experience so I gave it to him He was very insecure so I often needed to reassure him that he could count on me that I would be a stable person in his life so long as he kept paying my rates for time together I allowed him to take me to dinner off the clock occasionally and texted him back on occasion I didnt get triggered by his incessant texting in the same way as Celia It worked out pretty decently for a few months I felt like I was meeting his needs and he seemed happier and more stable Unfortunately my carefully set boundaries started to erode He didnt see me as an escort anymore he saw me as a sugar baby Then as a girlfriend He told me he loved me Often He started celebrating anniversaries for us and booking me for holidays I too found his company exhausting The whining the complaining the bad decisions the love bombing the delusional thinking It started to be too much I felt like I was wearing a thick mask while I was with him forcing myself not to show my disgust I hated the way he bragged about how much money he made while breaking the rules to do it I hated his nice guy syndrome and how entitled he felt to attention from women I hated the way he would eat dairy despite being lactose intolerant I hated the way he binged on McDonalds after eating a large dinner with bottomless cokes I hated the way he touched me and kissed me I hated the self obsession and the victim mentality he had I couldnt stand his inability to take any personal accountability in his life I eventually learned that despite making over 300k a year he was completely maxed out in debt because he had a gambling addiction in addition to his sex addiction He learned to count cards at the casino and managed to con a younger card counter I think he was only 21 into lending him tens of thousands of dollars to invest into being an advantage player at the casino Unfortunately John lacked discipline and lost everything on slot machines To his credit he is planning to pay the kid back but learning about this made me incredibly nervous and I started to get the sense that I was in over my head I hated the way that he would talk about being sexually abused as a child without warning in excruciating and disgusting detail I hated that he would rather spend money he didnt have on escorts and gambling than see a therapist I felt gross and drained for hours or even days after seeing him and would sometimes have to turn down other work because I didnt feel up to it The last straw for me happened Feb 16 We were supposed to see each other on Valentines day but I fell ill with the flu a few days earlier He complained every day while I was sick and pestered me dangling the money for my overnight fee over my head He wasnt able to schedule another overnight until March so if I didnt see him by Sunday I would lose out on the 2000 Also he just really really really needed to get laid and if I didnt see him hed go see another escort So still feverish and really fucking ill I let him come see me Its important to note that the first time he booked me for an overnight he touched me in my sleep This is a hard NO for me and I let him know Subsequent overnights he did not cross that boundary But this night I woke up again to him assaulting my body in my sleep My heart was racing and I felt so violated that I wanted to cry I didnt want major confrontation so I just pushed his hands away and told him I was still trying to sleep But I spent the rest of the night on high alert only able to doze for short periods of time After that I knew it was time to stop seeing him Because we planned our appointments for each month up to two months in advance it did not seem appropriate to simply ghost him I struggled to find the right way to end it I knew he was obsessively attached to me and it would be chaotic no matter how gently I tried to let him go Then an opportunity presented itself He saw another escort and fell asleep in his car in her parking lot He woke up to the police questioning him and searching his car and phone He cracked under pressure and admitted to paying for sexual services He told them about me and about her They chose not to arrest him or press charges but when he related all the information to me I decided to seize this excuse to stop seeing him I told him that for my safety I did not want him to ever contact me again At first he said he understood and said goodbye And then for the next five days he bombarded me with texts and emails He also sent YouTube videos of him crying and begging snot dripping Or drunk and begging and crying Then sober and matter of factly laying out the reasons why my fears about his interaction with the cops was unfounded More texts more emails from different accounts I responded to none of it It made me feel even more disgusted by him honestly I hoped that he would eventually tire and just go the fuck away Then he emailed me a suicide note I didnt receive it until nearly four hours after he sent it because I was busy working It stated that by the time I received it it was already too late to stop him But then three hours after the email he sent me a YouTube video suicide note which seemed fishy It has my already frazzled nerves in shambles I worried that I could somehow be found responsible if he was found dead and they traced the cause back to me I eventually gave in and called the police I posed as a girlfriend and I hoped it would be a one and done call but they kept calling me back for more information I knew his address and full name and vehicle and they wanted copies of his suicide letters They tracked him down and it turned out he was absolutely fine He just wanted me to talk to him and was willing to do anything to make it happen I guess the cop successfully conveyed to him that he needed to stop harassing me because the emails texts and videos stopped He did message my friend but she told him the same thing the cop did that he had to stop harassing me through her or else wed go to the police I wish I had ignored his suicide note I feel tricked and Im still angry about it,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 08:03:59 UTC,562,36,0.93,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0
1j7ungd,A letter to the girl I loved the most but never met,Throwaway account for obvious reasons This message has been sitting in my drafts for a really long time I could never find the courage to actually send it to her I dont think I can even today So here I am sending this out in the void hoping that one day it reaches her somehow After checking out her WhatsApp DP for one last time I finally decided to delete her contact as I prepare myself to let go and move on with my life From strangers to friends and now back to strangers only this time with bittersweet memories of eachother Hey I have been really thinking about everything that happened recently and I honestly dont think I can continue like this anymore I know we already discussed this before but I hadnt fully processed my emotions at that time I really care about you a lot and love you beyond words can express but this onesided attachment is going to take a huge emotional toll on me I also really hated your nonchalant behavior that day and the way you were acting so cold towards me and pushing me away like you suddenly decided your feelings have changed and we cant fit into each others lives whereas just a few days back you were telling me how you would wrap yourself around me and wouldnt let me leave the bed and all like all such moments meant absolutely nothing to you Something which I never told you last year on 31st I was so fed up by everything that had happened between us in those last few days that I just kept drinking and drinking until I finally lost consciousness right there in the club My friends had to literally put me in a wheelchair and take me back to the hotel room At times they couldnt even feel my pulse and for a moment everyone thought I was a goner The only thing I remember before passing out is wanting to talk to you on call because I just wanted to hear your voice one last time I truly believe God gave me this second chance at life for a reason and I am going to make the most out of it With everything going on especially with you moving to UK this year we would be emotionally distanced even further and eventually things are going to fade away and we both know it It is the start of a new chapter in your life soon and for me too as I will have to learn to live without you Our lives are just pulling us in different directions at this point You were right We have very different personalities backgrounds values and our future goals dont align either That is a gap which is difficult to bridge I really respect your feelings and boundaries and I have finally come to accept the unfortunate reality that things have changed between us now I dont want either of us to continue holding on to something halfheartedly I truly believe that destiny brought us together and meeting you was a part of my journey I am really grateful to you because I never knew I was capable of loving someone so much and that too without expectations until I met you What we shared was real and meaningful and I will always cherish those memories After all we shared a bond that has lasted for almost a decade without ever physically meeting each other But despite all this things never really took off which is why I think maybe we were never actually meant to be together but only to be a part of each others journeys I will really miss you Janhavi I will miss our chats and vc and how I was always able to be myself around you I will miss waiting for your text for days and months every time we had a fight how my day used to light up after seeing your text first thing in the morning how my heart used to melt after hearing your sweet voice how I used to play your voice notes again and again every time I missed you how I struggled to keep up because you talk so fast how I used to secretly steal glances at you when we were on vc how my heart used to skip a beat after randomly receiving your text in the middle of the night how I used to play my favorite songs to you on Spotify to convey my deeper feelings how you used to always come back to me after every fight and we would start talking again like nothing happened how you used to secretly install Kik on your moms phone every night to chat with me and I used to stay awake waiting for you sometimes even till morning how you made chocolates on my birthday and then ate them yourself on vc how we used to send each other those disaster selfies how you used to fall asleep on vc while talking and I used to continue admiring you sleeping how Sab Tera is still my favorite song even today because it was the one you sang to me how we had Maggi at 3 AM on vc and you made fun of me for having a cupcake with it and so many more such cute memories that I cant even possibly list them all here but these memories will always be a part of me and I will carry them with me forever It was pure innocent love at its best My life somehow always felt complete with you and stupid me always believed you were the one and that you were my soulmate and that one day I would definitely marry you Its funny because I cant even tell you how many times I have rehearsed this whole scene in my head about how I would propose you But I was wrong In the end it was all in my head and you already had someone else in your life all these years I dont blame you though and neither do I hold any grudge against you because of it You will always be a huge part of my life regardless and someone who helped me understand love much more deeply and helped me grow as a person I will always be thankful to you for that I only regret that I never got to meet you in real life But then again I still believe you are an angel and it wasnt just your username and thats why I could never meet you You came into my life for a reason but now is the time for me to let go If it is meant to be I am sure God will bring our paths together once again maybe in this lifetime or the next But until then this is where we must both go our separate ways I wish you all the happiness in life and hope you can forgive me if I have ever hurt you in any way Good vibes only Goodbye my favorite stranger PS I am sorry for deleting our Spotify playlist yet again I know you said that when you cant talk to me you listen to it But baby I have to do this and it is what is best for both of us afterall,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 09:21:57 UTC,3,3,0.68,,,0,0

1j64p36,I think about the one that got away even though we were never together,Due to trauma I have an extreme flight feeling so that even though things are going good with my current partner I keep thinking about just packing my things and leaving I keep thinking about a FWB I was with prior that if we had tried a relationship probably we probably wouldve been great together I love my current partner and dont want to actually leave him and I cant say anything to either of them because I wont let my trauma response ruin a relationship and friendship I am working on it with my therapist I know that if I do pack up and leave and have something with the friend that the same feeling will happen with him because I need to work through the trauma rather than giving into it I dont really have any friends I can talk to about it because none of them will understand,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:27:03 UTC,3,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j5saoz,My girlfriend said shed cheat on me and now I feel worthless,IMTF 19 and my girlfriendF19 have been together for about 4 months now I know it isnt a lot of time but I really felt something for her She was the only person with who I could share my deepest secrets without judgement She knew me I didnt have to wear a mask around her and that made me comfortable We lived 8 hours away from each other We met every month or even more frequently I helped her with her struggles at the beginning She was freshly after a breakup with a guy she lived with she was extremely emotional since they guy seemed not to have cared for her He promised to visit her but didnt and only like 2 months after their breakup he started relentlessly calling her Nudging her to go to therapy etc He even joined her friend groups discord server and that made her so emotional she quit the internet for a week and only talked to me through phone I helped her through this period i was always calling her and wanted to spend every minute of my time with her First off it was good We talked we played games we watched movies She had her weird habits but i got used to them Eventually we started arguing a lot I mean I really did all i could for her She was my priority all of the time I called off parties to want to spend time with her I went on a 10 hour train ride just to see her and comfort her in a place she didnt really have a lot to do But the thing is she never really cared for me the way I did for her I reserved time for us during new years eve just so I could see her and she had a mood swing or something and called it off since she thought I was getting attached to quickly We were to meet about 2 weeks ago but she called it off too since our conversations wasnt good I am not going to lie It was not a pleasant conversation but a honest one nothing to get offended by Just us talking about us in a slightly sadder tone I get really emotional and jealous like she was talking to her friend that he has to watch something and that shes willing to watch the entirety of it with him I just thought well why doesnt she want to watch things with me Why does she want to visit him not me I was her girlfried at the end of the day and that guy called everything she recommended crappy Its like I gave her all this attention and she didnt even care enough to visit me This morning she wrote me an ominious message Would you still want to be around me if I had kissed someone else in the past month I replied that if she would give someone a kiss on a cheek or something which is kind of normal in my part of the world Id be okay with it but if it was romantic something that could be classified as cheating I would leave She then said that it is going to happen and that she would have done it a long time ago if it hadnt been for that that she doesnt go out much and is pretty asocial I mean that kind of broke me I never had any meaningful relationship I was always hiding a part of myself and when a person that accepted me came along they stab me in the back in such a heinous manner I already got cheated on once I know how it ends there is no redemption no coming back to what once was I really loved her gave her everything I could but that still wasnt enough,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 16:17:15 UTC,1,7,0.56,,,0,0

1j6rl5a,I dont know what to do And I need advice,I 27 father of three lives alone with my three children Thanksgiving month of last year the mother and I got into a heated argument which led to a back and forth physically the most I did was push her to get some space to walk away because I truly dont believe in hitting women unless its life or death Before that even happened two days prior to this she was already putting her hands on me which led to a big bruise on my back And a long scar going from my neck down to my back Once I pushed her away from me she instantly called the cops and said I was the one being belligerent and she wanted me removed from the house The police arrive and she Yes she showed them the camera footage of what had been going on and ofc she was deemed the main aggressor and was taken to jail Once she got out apparently she has a court order to stay off of the property and to have no contact with me Her name is still on the lease so she helps out by paying her half of the rent and once a week will ask if the kids need anything she has a friend that reaches out for her She currently has no where to live but she stays with a friend and still has her job as a nurse and is in school during the day She gave me the option of getting a hotel room to get the kids because its going on four months since she has seen or talked to any of them I thought the hotel option was a good idea and I even offered to pay for half the expenses But it never happens because she either to busy with school and work I would like too take her to court so she can at least help me by getting them and keeping them for a week I have managed to do what I can with childcare and anything else the kids need so I can work my self and I have managed to do this alone What do I need to do to get her to court so we can have our time with the kids individually I understand she is in a situation but I shouldnt have to suffer because of it I hope this doesnt sound bitter on my end but we are not together anymore so she is going to have to start riding her storms out alone now Im not complaining about taking care of my kids because I love them dearly and I dont find anything manly about complaining about something you helped bring into this world but I need a break some times and Im only asking for a week,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 21:34:05 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0
1j657gu,Am I being used,Am I being used Do I 26F need a reality check Ive been friends with my friend Blake 26M for over a year now We have been pretty close since the beginning When we first met we bonded over our shared love for playing soccer together and music I would say we have many similarities We both enjoy adult animation like Studio Ghibli raves and playing board games Since we shared many similarities we kept in touch daily through text messages phone calls and FaceTime We had a mutual friend named Jennifer Jennifer and I were very close until I noticed that whenever we spent time together she spoke negatively about everyone around her As a result I gradually distanced myself from her Around the same time Jennifer and Blake started dating Although I wasnt close to Jennifer and didnt personally like her I wanted Blake to be happy Blake and I maintained a consistent relationship and communication We talked every day even during our lunch breaks via FaceTime However things took a turn when Jennifer informed Blake that I had feelings for him and wanted to pursue a romantic relationship with him That was not the case and I was even in a relationship at the time As a result Blake ended our communication to preserve his relationship with Jennifer We did not talk for eight months However in January he reached out to me He told me that Jennifer suddenly broke up with him in December Since then weve been hanging out again In February we attended a rave and ended up having sex that night A week later we confessed to each other that we had both harbored feelings for one another since weve first met At this point I informed him that I didnt want to be a rebound and he responded by stating that he wasnt ready for a relationship and wanted to focus on healing I accepted his decision We continued spending time together and continued having sex However I later told him that I no longer wanted to have sex with him because I was struggling to separate our friendship and romantic feelings Around the same time his exgirlfriend Jennifer filed a protective order against Blake Sidebar Personally I have had past experiences with abusive men which may have influenced my perspective However I must admit that I am not entirely aware of the details of Jennifer and Blakes relationship Given Jennifers personality I cant help but wonder if this situation is a attentionseeking ploy On the other hand I have only heard Blakes side of the story However I suggested that we establish boundaries We agreed to refrain from having sex and I told him I need a break from constant communication I also told him to fine another trusted friend to confide in about the Jennifer situation because I havent healed from my own trauma from the abusive I had endured Blake expressed his agreement to the physical boundaries and expressed he didnt want to lose me again and our friendship Since implementing these boundaries our relationship has undergone a significant change We dont talk that much anymore and when we do the protective order case seems to be the main topic of discussion Although last night I visited Blakes place to watch Star Wars During the movie he asked me to engage in a platonic cuddle We did and he said Thank you I inquired about the reason behind his gratitude He mentioned that my presence was naturing and made him feel less lonely Am I only in his life because he feels lonely,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:52:22 UTC,2,4,1.0,,,0,0
1j7jwdn,I love my dog but I dont like her,My husband wanted a dog and I had never had one before Ive had plenty of pets in the past cats rabbits and fish and I loved each one of them deeply So we decided to get a dog He did the work of finding the exact dog he wanted and we drove three hours to adopt her Even though he took on most of the feeding exercising playing and training she bonded to me The bond feels like an obsession When Im around my husband doesnt exist to her She never wants to be more than three feet away from me and often shes touching me When I need a break I go into the bedroom and shut the door She just sits outside waiting I can put her in the office with my fiancé on the other side of the house and then go to the bedroom and shut the door But she waits at the office door whining and whimpering My husband tries to interact with her but she doesnt care She just wants me And I cant handle this level of attention You can take her outside but if she knows Im inside she wont leave the door If I leave she panics A few minutes later she calms down and does her own thing She never bothers my husband this much Ive heard mothers talk about feeling touched out with toddlers and thats exactly how I feel with my dog The difference is I dont think shell ever grow past this stage Shes a dog Weve worked with trainers to help her become more independent but it doesnt seem to work Im thankful that theres more nuance in the adopt dont shop movement Sometimes it might actually be better to get a dog from an ethical breeder as shelter dogs can come with their own set of challenges My dog has trauma and that trauma will stay with her for life It shows up in our relationship where were in a sort of quasicodependence Its frustrating because shes fine when Im not around My husband can take her places and shes as happy as can be If Im not home shes completely relaxed Its only when Im around that she becomes obsessed with me I dont get to experience the playful silly dog everyone else sees because in my presence shes consumed with me My husband takes her to his brothers farm and he sends me videos of her It breaks my heart because I want to see that happy playful dog too I want a dog I can sit outside with playing with toys and rolling in the dirt without her needing to touch my leg at all times But I never get that dog I love her so much but her constant affection drowns me I look forward to when she goes to the farm because I get to be home without her on top of me I dont love my job but I dread going home because at least at work I get some alone time I love my dog but I dont like being around her,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 22:44:06 UTC,24,21,0.79,,,0,0

1j44jhj,Today is the day that I drop the charges against my rapist,20 years ago I was a stupid teenager in love My boyfriend was 23 and I was 16 Things started out great but they progressively worsened as he introduced me to drugs By the end of it all I was working for an escort agency giving the boyfriend my money I was bullied and forced into fucking old men and I was scared to leave my relationship My parents finally found me I had run away and managed to get me help I turned things around and ended up doing well in life I never told anyone what had happened and I had planned to take it to my grave Fast forward 15 years 5 years ago a detective knocks on my door He wanted to know about my ex and the sex trafficking I reluctantly spoke with him and agreed to do some recorded phone calls at the police station in order to get a confession I also turned over my high school journals that detailed the abuse and rapes We recorded a twohour confession that detailed everything It felt like a slam dunk That was 2 years ago Guys its been 5 years and I am tired I am tired of waiting 36 months to hear back from the detective Im tired of having to tell and retell my story to different detectives The further I get away from it the less I remember and the less credible I sound Im tired of worrying about my safety and if people will even believe me And Im tired of getting my hopes up only to hear back from the DA that theyre working on more pressing matters I get that my case is old news and not a priority I dont begrudge the detectives for prioritizing more current relevant cases But Im tired of advocating for a win that I dont think Ill ever see So today I will be emailing the detective and asking them to drop the case I wanted to hang on because I wanted to get this dude on the sex offender registry so that other girls wouldnt have to go through what I did But I cant be a martyr and sacrifice myself any longer for this cause I have no one to talk to about this And I just need to say that Im sorry and I tried,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 14:39:44 UTC,922,95,0.95,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0
1j362xe,Feeling used the morning after,Ive been going out with my boyfriend both mid 20s for about half a year now He doesnt drink but Ill be honest I like to go out and have fun from time to time I dont drink often but sometimes when Im out with friends I can get a bit carried away I know my limits and never get blackout drunk but I certainly can get past the point of tipsy on occasion My boyfriend often likes to come along even though he doesnt drink When he does come along hes my dd which is very nice of him Being self aware of my flaws unfortunately doesnt make them go away When I drink I hate to be alone I get unbearably lonely when Im left alone drunk Im a happy drunk complete life of the party until theres nobody around then suddenly it is the most soul crushing experience Usually I can just go to bed the minute I get home and sleep through the worst of it but its not always what I end up doing When hes around and Ive gotten past the point of tipsy I end up practically begging him not to drop me off at home Usually I flirt and when I do he listens He takes me back to his house Of course we end up having sex every time Then in the morning I always wake up feeling used and bitter I know I shouldnt Im the one who initiates after all Its not like he would ever force himself on me But I feel like I cant say anything about it to him because Im the one who starts things and I would hate for him to feel bad about the whole thing All of my exes refused to touch me when Id been drinking and they hadnt so this is entirely new territory for me I know the real answer here is to stop going out drinking with him but we seriously always have fun when we go out Its just the after part that makes me feel bad,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 08:15:00 UTC,0,6,0.22,,,0,0

1j7f2kc,Unsure about my trauma,So I just made this account because there is something that has been troubling me for a while now And I obviously didnt wish to use my original account to post it In my dating years I had 3 accidental pregnancies and obviously I couldnt keep them so I went ahead with aborting them I understood that it was not the ideal decision and a lot of people would have opinions on it but it was the only right decision for me at that time Now it has been some years since this has happened and Im very happy with my partner today but there are days when this sadness comes back about those three incidents This sadness gets triggered by anything randomly For instance a friend decides to use birth protection and I dont know why I wake up thinking about that time when I had to do what I did Another time I could not go through the series which was depicting in some detail about a couple dealing with the abortion and the decision making around it While the abortion itself is a horrible experience to go through the last one that I had was extremely painful and terrible due to some situations My partner has been extremely supportive about this throughout the years but I find it difficult to not feel like a burden when all of a sudden one morning I am in a bad mood and they dont understand exactly how and why I am feeling like that So I guess Im just dumping my feelings here because Im not really sure what to do with them I dont want to burden my partner who already has a lot of pressure from work in everywhere else and I cant seem to make this sadness go away,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 19:12:06 UTC,1,10,0.6,,CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCEDEATH,0,0

1j7cxzj,I was dumped yesterday but I had been thinking about the breakup for a year it hurts so much,I 25F was in a relationship 25M for almost 2 years It started off very very well very dreamy and romantic where I told my friends that I had found the guy I had been looking for all this while etc etc 2 months after our first date i lost my job and i realised how emotionally unavailable he was because all he cared about was his job and his work stress he didnt know how to empathise with me or support me or help me out for context the city we live and work in is his hometown but i thought probably my expectations are a bit much because we are so early in the relationship But i have known since aug 2023 that this isnt right for me I am going to bulletise the problems spending time despite living in the same city he only saw me once a week frisat which i initially found weird but adjusted around it However because he is an insane workaholic we didnt do anything special just stayed in There were no date nights When we went out on date nights i planned all of them i initiated them and i convinced him I wanted to spend more time with him see him more but that he told was not possible because it messes with his routines A lot of his habits and ideas of how we should be were straight up selfish inconsiderate and disreputable tbh A twisted definition of ambition different definitions of meaning of life He has a well paying reputable steady job but he wants to start his own thing so that he is doing something meaningful in life What that means for us is insane working hours no downtime no quality time no matter how much i tried to adjust When breaking up he said the kind of relationship i want works for people who have job stability and dont want to do much outside of that and i disagree so much All i wanted was someone to spend my weekends with have that quality time Isnt that the bare minimum Also if he cant do this how will he ever be in a relationship For me i am super ambitious and have built a career in a foreign country from the ground up but for me ambition means being good at job and liking it enough to login every morning to do a good job Meaning of life doesnt come from the job as i work for the paycheck but meaning comes from travel experiences relationships and friendships His routine he was obsessed with his routines Wake up at 6 sleep at 10 gym at 7am work 89 kinda guy Which is ok routines are good but what that meant was he only saw me fridays and called me daily 93010 he didnt call me initially at all and we foughjt a lot to get here Anything outside of that was not possible This didnt emotionally sit right with me because i couldnt trust depend rely on him In fact when we were breaking up he told me he calculated the amount of time he spends with me or talking to me and thats about 12hweek which is not possible for him right now What this translated in my head was i am not worth the 12hweek his spending habits he lives at home with his parents earns a LOT more than me and saves and invests all that he earns to an obsessive degree He has enough to retire rn and i respect that But what that meant for us was he was extremely stingy and calculative We split stuff but he just wasnt happy spending on date nights dinners gifts Heck he even calculated the transport cost from his home to mine He even liked to lecture me about how i should spend money when i already live below my means because i have a loan He also said that he is saving enough for the both of us but that never gave me confidence because i saw that as an attack on my independence i cant live on the money he has earned or saved because it is not mine he will always reinforce that and i will have a lesser of a say in how we spend that money He definitely wanted a prenup if we were to marry which i dont mind but his general attitude towards money and being too calculative wasnt reassuring Basically these were longstanding problems which i identified very early on in the relationship and communicated why i find them problematic However after each time i communicated he gave me something new to cling my hope on to and i hoped things would get better because i genuinely wanted this to work They never got better we kept on arguing until yesterday when he asked the question and i agreed i felt a bit blindsided tbh because he never told me he is thinking about it too I guess there are 2 lessons for me 1 To be in a relationship and live in the present and not with the persons potential and what it could be 2 To not be so obsessed with the idea of relationships and building a life and the feeling of home with someone that i keep putting up with shit Having said all of this the feeling of loss is immense and i still miss him and have been bawling my eyes out when it was me who had been considering breaking up for the past year and i know in my heart he is not the one for me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 17:40:16 UTC,2,0,0.76,,,0,0

1j3o0z9,Selfhelp culture is built on guilt not actual happiness,Hello reddit here is something that grinds my gears Why do so many selfhelp gurus push the idea that every fun thing in life is an addiction that needs to be cut out Stop playing video games theyll make you addicted Stop drinking itll ruin your life Stop doing this stop doing that And then as if thats not enough they push this pseudostoic mindset of just focus on yourself and become the best version of yourself whatever that even means It all feels incredibly narrowminded and honestly kind of boring These people act like the only thing that matters is selfimprovement and constant progress But what if I dont want that What if I just want to be me What if I just want to relax and enjoy life Life is already hard enough as it is and it feels like these gurus prey on peoples insecuritiesespecially those who are strugglingand make them believe that the things they love are actually holding them back Theres this obsession with selfimprovement that often feels less about genuine growth and more about selling an idealized almost robotic version of existence Its weird because its marketed as freedombecome the best version of yourselfbut it actually sounds more like a prison of constant selfdiscipline Like whats the point if you cant just exist without feeling guilty for not grinding 247 Take guys like Andrew Huberman for example Sure he knows his neuroscience but does he really have life all figured out Because the way they present themselves youd think they had unlocked some secret formula to existence But to me it just seems sad Humans are so obsessed with being ultraefficient that they forget we only have a short time on this planet And after that A whole lot of nothing So why not enjoy the things that make life meaningful instead of obsessing over sacrificing everything in the name of selfdiscipline I get that addiction is real and obviously some habits can be destructive But whats the point of living if you cant just enjoy things sometimes Why does everything have to be about optimizing every aspect of yourself I think its okay to make sacrifices when they actually make sense but its also okay to say Screw it I just want to enjoy myself I dont knowthis mindset just annoys me Anyone else feel the same way,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 22:49:32 UTC,6,3,0.88,,,0,0

1j343pd,Good life but frustrated with my own development Looking for feedback,I male 30s have needed to emotionally vent frustrations about myself and stunted growth as a person I have to begin and say my life for outsiders looking in is great I have a fiance expecting a child both great careers and a home I just started picking up a sport which makes me appreciate life alot so what more could Ipeople ask for But Im sad and heres why Ive been in a similar career most my life and its almost like a golden pair of handcuffs at this point I sit at a computer for so long my posture has gotten terrible Ive tried YouTube channels with timers a self shocking watch back straps Yet it still shows up and bleeds to outside work I even have a standing desk Meals become easy to miss because I wrap myself in work which comes and goes So Im thinner build as result My own self communication and arguably articulation of thoughts has gotten worse from working remotely I rarely interact with anyone except my fiance I try not to use social media or be on my phone I want to reduce screentime but it at the same time im almost more isolated and out of touch with the world Ive never had a knack for learning names or being able to follow sports which is arguably the easiest conversation starter so thats a bit of a bummer The lack of exposure to people and social media Id arguably say has made me dumber as a person I get less time communicating forming sentences and even articulating my own biasededucated views on topics I find my self starting sentantices with I forgot or I think more often then Id like to admit So whats my deal Am I crazy Getting Alzheimers Uneducated Losing all enthusiasm to life Do other people feel this way I just dont get it I dont like living like this I recently bought things to get in shape but I still worry that Im too uneducated or fell too far behind from my single minded career focused brain I even get a small fear that Ill let my fiance down by not having meaningful communications if I stay on the track Im not sure if Im looking for advice someone to placate me or sanity check that people typically be human easier then me and that Im actually the issue Im aware I need to be my own change or see a therapist but why not ask a world of strangers first I guess,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 05:53:56 UTC,1,0,0.99,,,0,0
1j63eh6,I feel stuck in this life of disappointment,damn i will definitely be embarassed about this in the future but anyways ive always been a sensitive person i always cared about others and made sure to make them feel good and happy My middle school years werent the best i had to move out of my old house and i completely changed life by moving to a town 50 minutes far from my previous residence You can imagine that I an introverted and nerdy kid wasnt able to make many friends and so i got lonely In fact i was known as the lonely kid no one ever wanted to talk to me and sometimes even made fun of me i discovered some years later that everyone talked behind my back during those years and that was the reason no one even wanted to approach me And so i spent three years of my life by myself i spent my days alone definitely years that i wouldnt want to live again Once middle school ended i was full of hope that same summer i made some friends and had a lot of fun with them and so i was positive about starting high school And so once my first year of school started i tried to me more extroverted and social the outcome was awkard im not good at being extroverted Even tho i tried the outcome wasnt positive This time no one talked behind my back but i had trouble making friends and so i became the lonely kid once again I was depressed spent my days listening to music and sleeping all day just to escape that feeling of void that was suffocating swallowing me whole I was ready to end it all but i wasnt brave enough to even try so i kept living my life and eventually things got better I made new friends i became more social and felt truly happy after years of suffering I am happy about how i lived the rest of my teenage years but that feeling never got away I am now left with an overthinking mindset idk if i can call it like that which leads me to anxiety about all the friendships that i currently live i cant be calm because i sometimes think that everyone will sooner or later go against me and make me live the hell i went through one more time I cant trust anyone and this thing is making me mad because come on why am i so defensive why cant i just live my life like the others and not worry about this i dont truly know why i wrote this probably to feel better or to relate to someone here who perhaps lived my same experience Anyways i feel costantly feel this overwhelming sense of entrapment in my own life i feel like my past will always follow me no matter what i do No matter how many new people i will meet i will always have this anxiety that they will disappoint me and life is so hard this way I dont even know if someone will read this i will probably only get some upvotes and my post will be forgotten in this sub,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:24:33 UTC,2,1,0.63,,,0,0

1j62wut,nex fiancé ruined my life blamed me for it and then admitted he was never capable of it,just saw a post about their narc maybe being DL and im realizing mine definitely was and after everything he did and blaming me for it he said thats why he did it and couldnt have let us every happen or get married bc of his hidden desires exact quote at the bottom in the beginning he said he had a deep fetish he said it was humiliation at first then the real truth was later revealed to me and then it wasnt until after the break up he said there was sissy and cross dressing and that he might be gay which is so bizarre bc one he only ever told me about the real kink way later and never told me the full details of it and he loves women sexually and is very sexual and addicted to porn but he was interested in trans women and anal sex i guess its wild bc he always said he could never be in a relationship with a man bc he needed a woman who was submissive and he had control over basically he wanted a woman in her feminine energy but wasnt safe enough to let me stay there after our break up also he went on a power kick after i was trying to say goodbye like i guess trying to regain power and he was being agressive and telling me to submit and basically confirm that he was right and i was wrong and legit got hard from it the next day i said i will only submit to a man who protects and takes care of me and does not abuse me and he said he would still abuse me and i should stop whinning about it there were times he wanted to have sex with me while watching porn and wouldnt show what the porn was or giving him bjs and hjs while he watched porn ive posted my story lots but have left out this major detail bc it felt wrong to discuss but for reference we got engaged i uprooted my life to go move in with him in another state 6 days after the proposal and me thousands of dollars deep into the move he called it off unprovoked bc by this time i had been perfect according to his unreasonable standards but he still blamed me this is all after months of emotional and verbal abuse i lost my home a job a baby mental health love my best friend my safety the realization is he legit told me he loved his fetish and addictions more than me and he also said after he broke off our engagement and putting me through absolute hell and destroying my life and financially abusing me and me loosing my home to go move with him after our engagement AFTER blaming me for the reason why he did it and a couple weeks after i came back to my state and was recovering from the move he said So we get married have kids And I say by the way I love wearing diapers Dressing as a girl and letting dudes or someone fuck my ass I wasnt gonna let that happen and that he wasnt sure if he was bi or gay i couldnt tell if he was saying all of that as a ploy to make it easier to be friends with him bc he was actively saying he wanted me in his life and he said would it be easier if i were gay and then told me all those things idk if it was more manipulation or if its true i know his kink is a major thing and it wasnt something i was into and he wants to be with someone romantically who isnt into in but still have sexual encounters with people who are into his kink i can never tell when he was being honest or just saying something to get a certain reaction out of me there were several times hed say im going to go fuck this girl tonight bc you stress me out and then id find out he was home along and not with her his mom would tell me or he later would tell me he never did there were plenty of cases like this too he would just say things to make me believe it so i couldnt tell if he was saying he might be gay for that instance too idk in no way am i being insensitive to sexuality or kinks i was very supportive to him through it all but this is just making me realize he was never going to follow through and legit used me he basically admitted to putting me through hell abusing me very thoroughly blaming it allllll on me and my character flaws made me lose my home to move states with him tell me entire family we got engaged lose my job and spend thousands on moving lose a child all to cancel our engagement and move during a mania spike he had and BLAMES IT ON ME all while he was literally never going to be capable of following through there were so many signs too im realizing now that ive missed he used to straight up tell me that he was mirroring me and i thought that was weird bc women typically mirror the man he used to also say hed just find someone to marry him out of convenience bc he wasnt capable of love he was always so selfish in every aspect of our lives he always made it known to everyone and called me his wife and loved the image that it gave him but treated me like dirt this man was straight up telling me he was a narcissist and i missed the signs in a haze he emotionally verbally mentally and financially abused me for literally nothing bc i was kind and sweet and supportive and empathetic and showed him love he couldnt even fathom he literally watched me as i bent over backwards for him and took care of him and lost the stability in my life to create one with him while he was just belittling me and destroying my worth and esteem he needed control over me bc he lacked it in his own life and addictions and self and was never going to marry me or create the life together we planned bc his demons and desires would have never allowed it even when i was accommodating and understanding but the blame is all on me for loving him and having needs theres so many factors to this and so many versions of him its hard to wrap my head around it all,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:01:38 UTC,4,5,0.67,,,0,0
1j4bc76,My exhusband broke me,This is going to be a long onesorry in advance I 29F got divorced three years ago from my manipulative exhusband after being with him for 65 years We had no kids because he didnt want any responsibility Ive moved on from him in the sense that I dont want him back but I feel like the emotional and psychological abuse I went through changed me in ways I cant undo Whenever a potential new partner comes into my life I cant seem to accept them The moment I see something I dont agree with even if its small I start emotionally distancing myself to avoid getting hurt I dont even know what a healthy relationship looks like On top of that I live in a Middle Eastern country where everyone constantly pressures me to get married before I become too old It just makes me feel worselike the manipulation and mistreatment I faced really broke something in me and I dont know how to fix it What my ex did to me To summarize he cheated on me multiple times and I only found out about all of them at once He never got me giftsonly things he wanted me to have so he could show off his status He never initiated intimacy it was always up to me He didnt want kids but the moment he felt like I was pulling away he suddenly wanted thembasically trying to baby trap me even though it was obvious our relationship was already over When I needed helplike when my car wouldnt start or the faucets were burstinghe never answered my calls I had to handle everything myself He claimed he had OCD about cleanliness but would leave trash and dirty clothes everywhere expecting me to clean up after him just because I was a stayathome wife at the time Financially he cut me off except for food and clothes when I got a parttime job and started making more than him for like three months In my culture the husband is supposed to provide for his wife but as soon as I had my own income which was around 4k a year yes a year he refused to spend a single cent on me unless it was food or clothes had to pay my own cellservice gas etc which he previously paid for When we traveled it was never about meit was just because he wanted to see the world and his friends couldnt afford to go with him When I put effort into our relationshipplanning picnics buying games so we could play together setting up dates booking hotelshe ignored it all yes I slept in a hotel by myself which is a huge NONO in my culture because he wanted to hang out with his boys instead I tried everything to make it work and the only complaint he had about me was that I didnt clean enough He would literally swipe his finger over a light switch show me the dust and act like that was a real issue Our last conversation He told me I was perfect that he was sorry he cheated and that was it Only when he realized that I was really leaving him that he started crying in the corner of the apartment we had like a 3yearold toddler 2 days later he was like I did everything for you and its all your fault I cheated Where Im at now The cheating destroyed me I never even checked his phone because I respected his privacy and in return I got blindsided I lost myself completely People see me as this cheerful bubbly person but its just a facade so my parents dont worry about me After the divorce I moved back in with them which is normal in my culture My dad even built me a small studio flat upstairs so I have my own space But I stopped working so I have no income Even if I got a fulltime job the salaries here are terriblearound 15500 USD a year even though I have nine years of experience in marketing and content Realistically I should be making 20K30K but thats a whole other issue I just feel like I have nothing to live for My biggest dream in life is to have a family and kids but the dating scene is discouraging I do have hobbiesI love reading drawing playing video games watching animeTVmovies taking walks and doing athome pilates So its not like I do nothing with my life but inside I feel completely empty My struggle with marriage Im very traditionalnot because of my family but because I truly believe a husband should take care of his wife That doesnt mean I expect to be spoiled and contribute nothing but I dont think it should be my responsibility to cook clean and do everything 247 Most men here though want a wife to take care of them I keep getting set up with men through my family and its always the same storythey expect a woman to be a maid not a partner I feel like Im running out of time to get married and its making me anxious because I really want to build a family My thoughts are all over the place and I dont know what to do PS This is the first time Ive ever shared something this personal I dont even know if this makes sense English isnt my first language so sorry if its messy,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 19:19:44 UTC,58,24,0.94,,,0,0
1j5l5t1,My Mom hates me,Sorry for the bad writing i attempted to post it in an german subreddit first but they ave a limit of 3k letters max and also dont allow blocktext wich is what this would have turned into if i tried to stay within said margin plus deleting a paragraph So i had to use Google translate Sorry I 25f always have disputes with my 59f mother Whenever I dont do something the same as she wants she gets pretty acidic and even if I do it the same way as she wants she somehow always has something to complain about Example of today Because of the beautiful weather I should hang my duvet out of my window but the problem is that the winter garden roof is right in front of my window and I cant hang it out because it is a more or less flat level So I decided to hang the blanket over the edge of the winter garden roof mind you at one point that was quite clean in my opinion at least And if I had hung the blanket directly out of the window she would have been dirty or even dirty anyway I also had planned and also discussed with my mother that I would wash the blanket this weekend anyway Nevertheless she then sniffed me about half an hour later and she also found it very shit that I sucked at the same time as I was sucking We have a solar system that produces a very nice amount of electricity in very sunny weather and I thought that it would already be finished with sucking because I hadnt heard her vacuum cleaner anymore and then started sucking my room However she still has a problem with it because she apparently continued to suck again after a moment which I couldnt hear because of my loud sucker and also ran the washing machine which I didnt know anything about because I couldnt see or hear her from my room on the first floor and that I was not explicitly told that it would be hired In addition she also complained because I took a break when sucking I have a cold and dont have enough endurance to create everything at once My room consists of two adjacent rooms of which I usually only do one because I am more in this but this time I wanted to do both and only took a break in between After I had explained Mama that she told me that I always had an excuse I then started crying no idea why sometimes happens during such confrontations and Mama asked in a rather aggressive tone why I would cry now even though there is no reason for it and that we would only have a reasonable discussion Incidentally the howling is nothing that I have an influence I dont because it is to cry afterwards or something I have zero control about whether or when this happens In the surplus she also titled such moments as psycho shit and attempted manipulation Not today but in other similar situation Incidentally she mostly teemers my attempts to explain and or counter arguments or ignores them entirely I often have the feeling of being shouted at in these moments even though she only talks to me very quietly her words I dont even want to do something in the household anymore because it is almost always wrong or not right And almost every interaction with her consists that she tells me something what to do or indicate that something is wrongdirty or somehow not correct That would be okay but everything is just too much I dont want to come down to her or talk to her When I come home and your car is not there Im already relieved Is probably not your fault Im probably just over sensitive or overreact or something Also i havent stopped crying the whole time while writingtranslating this and my mom came in and asked me in a really passive aggressive tone what was up and why i am still crying I told her to leave and she left Idk what to do I feel like she truly hates me and idk why she does all of this like that Maybe it makes her happy When asked she always says that she doesnt but Idk if i can believe that,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 11:14:08 UTC,1,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j5l09y,15 Years in CanadaNow Im Jobless Broke amp Out of Options,After spending 15 years building a life here I never imagined I would end up with nothing forced to start over from zero again I have updated this post to clarify a few things based on feedback I take full responsibility for my situation I made many mistakes along the way whether it was not staying on top of deadlines assuming I had more time than I did or not making the best choices I have struggled with severe ADHD my entire life and since I choose to manage it without medication I often leave things until the last minute That habit has hurt me in more ways than I can count and this situation is no exception At the same time the immigration system has changed significantly over the years making it much harder for someone in my position to qualify In the end it was a mix of bad timing personal missteps and an immigration system that has only grown tougher for people like me I moved to Canada as an international student a little over 15 years ago I started from nothing learning English from scratch completing my academic English education and then going to university and college I worked multiple jobs as a developer while paying my taxes and contributing to the country I wanted to call home Despite all that I lost everything when my work permit expired a few months ago I did not qualify for enough points under the everchanging immigration system so as soon as my permit expired my job was gone Because my work permit expired I was not eligible for unemployment benefits had no options just the expectation to pack up and leave like I never existed The worst part is that this is not just about money or survival I genuinely loved my job I had amazing coworkers a great team and what I believed to be the perfect job in the perfect country I was lucky enough to have made meaningful contributions and had so much more to offer as a 32yearold with a bright future ahead of me That is why I have so many regrets about how things turned out and I know they will stay with me for a lifetime I would give anything to go back and keep doing what I love But because I wanted to do things the right way legally and honorably there just do not seem to be any options left Losing my job did not just mean losing income It meant losing my ability to stay afloat in the country I call home Even when I had a good income I was living paycheck to paycheck covering expenses for two people A large portion of my money went toward taxes rent and paying off debts that piled up after I lost my previous job during the pandemic Now with no work permit not even underthetable cash jobs would be enough to cover my expenses and those would not be legal for me anyway Over the years Canadas immigration system has become increasingly strict The requirements kept changing the point thresholds kept rising and options like employerspecific work permits which could have been a lifeline for people like me were removed in Ontario By the time I finally became eligible or was just about to things had already shifted again I know people who moved to other provinces because obtaining permanent residency was easier there but even that became riskier when some pathways suddenly disappeared Going back to Turkey is not just about starting over It is a nightmare waiting to happen My brother and I are both considered army escapees which means we would be forced into mandatory military service soon after arriving The Turkish army is notorious for its brutal conditions As ethical vegans and atheists we would be in an impossible position The army does not accommodate veganism and being openly atheist is frowned upon both socially and institutionally I know our time there would be unbearable in every way The system does not account for people like me those who have given everything to this country only to be left with no way to stay Is this how the system treats people who dedicate their youth education and labor to this country I do not want to sound ungrateful I have always loved this country and I still do I love its people and I consider Toronto my real home Leaving would feel like losing a part of myself forever But after all these years not having a viable pathway to stay just does not feel fair to me After more than two days without sleep with stress piling up and rent due while I have no income my mind is all over the place while writing this I also recorded myself talking about all of this for about half an hour right before writing this crying the whole time It felt like therapy in a way just letting it all out Now writing this feels like another form of that release I do not know what comes next but I needed to get this off my chest If nothing else I hope sharing my story highlights how the system fails people who follow all the rules and still end up with nothing I truly hope it will somehow help future people like me Thank you for reading I truly appreciate anyone

1j4s9h6,So are you gonna be our new besties The June 27th incident at Kings Island,Hey everyone For the second consecutive year I stayed at Great Wolf Lodge from 623627 I visited the park Kings Island on 625 amp 627 In a perfect world Id love to tell you about everything I did and the people I met But unfortunately the sense of joy rejuvenation and fulfillment I get by being there was tarnished by an incident that took place at the end of the trip and at park closing on the 27th This post is as long as it is to make sure I cover all the details of what happened as specifically as I can Its now been eight months since this took place so I needed some time before I went public about this What I hope to accomplish with this is to have a better understanding of the world from a unique perspective and to use this as a learning tool to learn from someone elses misjudgements Im posting this with the complete acceptance understanding that this story may bring some type of criticism in my direction and honestly to achieve some type of closure on this particular incident With all that being said Ill begin On the night of June 27th I was in the Fast Lane Queue for Orion to get a PostFireworks Night Ride That day I was wearing a white Ross Chastain Gone Fishing Busch Light Car TShirt Wrangler Jean Shorts and AllBlack Under Armour Mens Charged Rogue 4 Running Shoes I was at the top of the steps and happened to introduce myself to two young ladies who were sitting against the fence in the station To best describe it as many of you know theres a 34 foot gap between the station and the stairs before you actually enter the station If I was to guess I originally thought these two females were in their early 20s Im 28 for context but they ask me Are you gonna be our new besties No girl has ever asked me a question like that So Im of the impression that theyre attracted to me and assumed theyre of legal age so I jokingly responded Well Im gonna be leaving tonight unless you had something else in mind And even if things worked out I wouldnt have bothered because I have a 2 Hour Drive in front of me back home to Louisville after I do this Night Ride But the girls then look at each other very awkwardly and say something along the lines of Dude WERE 16 I profusely try to apologize but they begin to overreact and make a scene in the station escalating the situation and start running down the steps of the normal queue And I apologize to the greeter and to a ride attendant because I didnt know that they were underage As Ill explain later in more detail that part of the situation like all parts of this situation couldve been resolved with an apology and life couldve went on As this was misunderstanding Some may ask why I didnt just ask how old they were Ive been raised on the idea that asking women how old they are is inappropriate So I finished my ride which while it was spectacular Im kinda nervous about what happened beforehand as I head to my locker to retrieve my belongings Mine was on the section closest to the OnRide Photo Desk and Im not able to open it probably because the park is now closed so the rental by default has expired So while Im about to get someone to help me get this locker opened two teenage boys confront me very aggressively on the situation before the ride saying something in the realm of What are you doing touching up on these little girls You should know better You wear that cross on your neck and do something like that How would god feel about that For context I regularly wear either black or silver cross necklace Ive had many people make conversation about that Im disappointed in you Youre not going anywhere until you apologize They also asked if I was at Soak City earlier which I was to check it out for the first time and look through some of the shops But they claimed I made inappropriate physical contact with someone there to Which I didnt I know that isnt exactly what these two gentlemen said but its what I remember as my anxiety ramped wondering how do I get outta this dilemma that just got handed to me on a silver platter But a couple of things I never groped these women The park has security cameras everywhere including in the coasters stations so theres proof that didnt happen and I also attempted to explain to these two gentleman that I had no clue they were 16 Again I thought they were in their early 20s college age But they werent buying it as both told me BRO YOU COULD TELL Many women look older than they actually are So you really cant sometimes But they both proceed to exercise public humiliation on me by shouting how I was Touching up on little girls to everyone who was leaving Area 72 that evening Like theyre the men from Dads Against Predators on Locals Finally security steps in to figure out what was going on and by the request of these young men One guard originally begins to interview me but then attends to the younger gentleman who initiated the confrontation so another guard interviews me and I explain everything as detailed as I can and as calm as I can l which in the moment was pretty impossible to accomplish I finally got my things outta my locker then this guard escorts me to the front of the park to see what his supervisor or coworkers had to say on the matter and they told me Youre good to go sir nothing else is gonna happen Next time when youre having small talk just be more careful So I walk the path back over to Great Wolf where my car was parked I checked out from there that morning and was granted permission to keep my car parked there But as Im then at the NorthEnd of the parking lot in the small section that walks SoutheasttoNorthwest what appears to be a Black 2014 Honda Civic pulls up and its the teenagers again The gentleman in the passenger side ask for my name number address and zipcode Which I like this whole time cooperate and disclose it And many of you may ask why would you give your information to them They arent police or security I thought that being honest and cooperative would salvage my reputation in this situation And what if they can tell that Im lying So after doing so he says to me We just got banned for a month This is my favorite place to go to Have a good night I love you Then they take off into the night To be honest I shouldve walked down Columbia Road instead of the walk path to avoid the possibility of further encounters But at that point I thought the teens left at that point Or ask security to escort me to my car if theyre allowed to do that After filling up my car at the GoCo on Kings Mills Road I began my drive home I look over to my left on Southbound I71 to look at the park one last time despite it looking so spectacular in person at night I was unable to enjoy it because of what all just happened Heres how this situation shouldve been resolved If I were the girls Id peacefully and politely inform me Sorry to tell you but were actually 16 Then Id have responded My apologies I didnt know that Ill back off I apologize Then the girls shouldve said Youre fine Its all good Then life wouldve moved on and the situation wouldve never escalated to the point it did But to begin with if the girls never asked that question none of this would have ever happened to begin with If I were either of the boys I would have started with professionally and calmly said Excuse me sir you gotta minute to talk And I wouldve said Sure No problem They couldve have offered to buy me a Dasani then said Do you know why were wanting to speak with you Okay there was an incident involving several young ladies in the station a few minutes ago would you mind sharing your side of the story And I wouldve done just that So they have both sides of the story and develop a conclusion and they finished the meeting by stating Okay we believe you did make a mistake you didnt know their age just be more careful next time Thank You for talking with us and have a good night Theres a reason for the saying Cooler heads prevail You gotta assure everyones calm in order to then get to the bottom of any situation That never happened There also has to be a presumption of innocence established in the investigation process as well Thats why in the legal system All suspects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law Which thanks to security for helping with this incident and siding with me on this On June 28th one of the male parties in the incident made a post to this group that afternoon which was a motive to making this post in response I waited til now to conduct this post so I made sure I could tell my side in the most detailed and comprehensive way possible But prior to the post either being deleted or taken down I monitored it by reading all the comments throughout the time that post remained up To start I read that I was reported to Mason Police I was waiting to see if either they would call me for an interview I never did I thought about calling them myself but when talking to someone about the matter they recommended I didnt This individual also claimed in the comments I watched him do what he did But in the post he states 2 girls came running down the stairs Which implies that he was either at the bottom of the stairs or still at groundlevel And in addition to the wall that divides the FastLane queue to the regular queue after the show building there would be no possibility for him to have seen the incident unfold So it seems very contradicting Also another user had stated the girls wouldnt of lied about something like that This where I channel my inner Alex Jones and become a tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist In retrospect hindsight is always 2020 I believe the possibility that those girls asked me that question Are you gonna be our new besties to bait me Ill even go a step further that Im of the belief that they mightve been of legal age but claimed they were 16 as a convenient excuse to cause a problem Im not saying thats the case its complete speculation In todays society select people love to cause andor escalate issues to play the victim card because it gets them attention On top of that they also delivered misinformation by stating I had groped them Like I mentioned earlier there was a 4ft gap between us that wouldve been impossible And security cameras are everywhere and if footage was pulled up it shows I never did that So they lied about that to artificially make the situation look worse to garner more attention and spark more outrage This is why you have to hear both sides to the story then develop the conclusion Not just hear one side and ride with it Again what other reason would these two girls ask me that question In the minutes hours and days following this has greatly amp negatively affected my mental health as Ive had many thoughts rush through my head I thought maybe it was best I should wait a couple years before visiting again Im worried about the people around who witnessed what happened how will they think of me Whats the ride attendants at Orion gonna think of me Whats gonna happen if these teens see me again Are they gonna forget about what happened or will they try to engage in some type of conflict How will I be able to pick myself up from this And am I sure Ill still be a positive asset to society Thankfully I didnt have to wait too long to answer that last question On July 3rd I visited Ark Encounter and it felt therapeutic to be on I71 again then be around people again While there Id happen to see a mom try taking a family photo but she wouldnt be in it so Id ask Excuse me maam if you wanna be in the shot Ill take the photo And that situation happened 4 or 5 times that day and to see the sense of joy appreciation and thankfulness expressed by these families to me reassured that I was good person and a positive asset to society Ive talked to many people about this for advice and support While at the GocoPopeyesDunkin Donuts on Kings Mills Road to fill up and I talked to the guy working there about this and mentioned it was teens just looking to cause issues When I woke up Friday afternoon I talked to my parents immediately about this if I didnt theyd notice something was bothering me I also talked to select people at Work on XBOX and to other friends of mine and everyone unanimously have said that I did nothing wrong and agreed it was a misunderstanding I wanna thank everyone who Ive reached out to for support as this has been a difficult time Im surprised everyone has sided with me on this they didnt have to but Im grateful for helping me get through this I can only imagine the stress and anxiety women especially attractive women feel in public To go to any Zoo Bar Restaurant Bowling Alley Amusement Park Movie Theater etc has to be sometimes unbearable To always be looked at or to have someone always making advances towards you has to feel vulnerable and invasive With that in consideration I do whats necessary to respect womens boundaries when out in public So to even claim that Im a Predator is absolutely inaccurate As mentioned earlier this was a misunderstanding These girls asked a question that led me to assume they were attracted to me and of age I responded based off that then they blew it out of proportion and caused a huge mess at the end of what was supposed to be another fun and memorable multiday trip up there In conclusion the last absolute last things Id want to do is make enemies inside the gates of Kings Island Not within Mason Ohio not within Warren County not within the Cincinnati TriState Area and not within the State of Ohio period And the other last thing I wanted is to be on the radar of the City of Mason Police Department I imagine a day where I can call Mason Ohio home so I want to be on good terms with everyone I encounter To the other parties involved if they read this post I hope we can mutually apologize come to a better understanding of what took place so we can be on good terms with each other achieve closure and move forward on a positive note Im gonna be visiting the park again this year so I dont want us to cross paths and have any further conflict or sense of animosity or discomfort While Im not wishing ill will on anyone these four people possibly will be faced with a situation thats a misunderstanding as well If so Id want their situation to be handled calmly and smoothened out as well and as quickly as possible so they dont face any hate or animosity from the opposing parties of whatever situation faces them And I apologize to the two young men for getting banned Yall unfortunately were denied the opportunity to see the Fourth of July Celebration fireworks display and more valuable time to ride Orion The Beast or whatever yalls favorite coaster might be While I understand they were trying to stand up for whats right it still wasnt the correct way to do so and hopefully they learn from this as well For me I just use it as a learning experience to be extra careful on who Im talking to and not make decisions off assumptions Which I apologize to the young ladies for doing so Im someone whos very respectful to peoples boundaries and wouldnt wanna make decisions about that makes someone feel uncomfortable But I do hope they apologize for asking a question that expresses attraction only to turnaround and cause a scene that couldve been resolved with a simple apology Nobody wouldve gotten banned and security wouldnt have gotten involved Im gonna be presented with 1000 different situations and scenarios and Ill be fine in 925 of them Nobody is perfect Also its been important for me to allow time to heal the wounds as the situation shrinks farther in the past I come to Kings Island for peace and serenity not drama and distress And this sadly was drama and distress Ive met many people in my now four visits to the park and had wonderful converstations and engagements with those people both fellow guests and employees Its very unfortunate this all happened and was more heartbreaking that it happened at the very end of this trip I took I refuse to allow that to be the last memory I have of the park this year Thank you to everyone who took time outta their day to read this and whether or not youre going to the park today have a great day everyone,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 10:07:37

1j847qz,Is it considered sexual assault,I was on a second date with a guy who I liked We had met before once it was fun and we had hooked up but didnt have sex because I am a virgin and I had clearly told him I am not ready for sex This time he didnt give me the same fun vibe but I wanted to hookup with him again because it was fun the previous time and honestly I was trying to let loose a little since I have usually been very uptight when it comes to dating I went to his house after and ofc things escalated I accept that I showed equal interest unlike last time and I was teasing him and flirting with him and kissing him But this time it was more about him and he didnt seem that interested in kissing me again and again like the first time He slightly persuaded me to give him a blow job which I really didnt want to but after one point I couldnt say no But I wasnt able to and I kept gagging and i remember telling him i cant He then got in between my legs and I told him that I wasnt ready for sex He reassured me that he wasnt going to do anything and he was just teasing me I remember telling him multiple times that I didnt want to have sex and I wasnt ready I trusted him and let him slightly penetrate me without going in But then he kept pushing in further It was hurting and again i tried stopping him but not very firmly He asked me if he could just feel me from the inside but would not thrust I dont think I said anything to that But eventually we did end up having sex And in fact he kept asking me to help guide him which I did as well So now its a very blurry line for me because I said no and I told him that I wasnt ready but then I also gave him a helping hand and also didnt say no while we were actually having sex The next morning also I didnt say anything and I in fact kept kissing him But later after coming home and finally processing i confronted him on text and called his upbringing into question He lashed out at me and said that I could have stopped it at any time and he just wasnt the one who was into it Another thing to note with be that he didnt show me any comfort or affection or asked me how I was feeling after sex In fact he didnt communicate with me at all He tried to cuddle me once but I got up and went outside to process things after which he didnt hug me properly even once or tried to cuddle me We slept separately the entire night and i felt so vulnerable and sad I never expected my first time to be like this Now I am just confused and sad and regretful at this point Also he did not use a condom and it was much later that I realised and when I told him he said he will pull out which he did I asked him in the morning if I needed to take the morning after pill and he said no But I ended up taking one anyway after reaching home,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 17:30:18 UTC,0,12,0.5,,,0,0
1j4njl4,What is the actual contribution of entertainers and influencers to society,What is the actual contribution of entertainers and influencers to society Growing up I always thought about what my contribution to society would be I believed that a meaningful life should involve helping others in a tangible waywhether its building bridges being a doctor who treats patients a teacher who educates or even a wedding planner who helps people organize one of the most important days of their lives Even a makeup artist contributes by helping people feel comfortable in their own skin through skillful techniques But when I look at idols entertainers and influencers I cant help but wonder What is their actual purpose beyond surfacelevel happiness Sure they make people feel entertained maybe even inspired but does that really compare to professions that create real change And yet these are the people society worships the most They get millions live in luxury and are treated like theyve accomplished something greatwhile doctors engineers teachers and everyday workers struggle for recognition or financial stability It feels unfair that popularity is more valuable than actual contribution I know entertainment is a part of life and Im not saying its useless But on a deeper level I wonder what even is their life purpose If your whole job is just singing dancing or making videos whats the end goal Its not like theyre solving world problems creating lasting change or advancing society Does anyone else ever think about this Or am I just overanalyzing it,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 04:38:48 UTC,1,3,1.0,,,0,0

1j53tt6,TIL that my coworker had a Title IX case against him from my predecessor and hes still here,I dont really know what to make of this and I dont really have anyone to talk to about it I 23F started my masters this academic year and was brought in as a graduate assistant in one of the academic advising offices on campus Our office has a new director who comes from a high school administration background and relatively new advisors two of them both have been here five years max Until yesterday I didnt know why the previous GA left her role She clearly left in a hurry because my office her office still had wall decorations cork boards with posters and flyers supplies and cabinets chockfull of folders with papers guides flyers you name it its here It looked like the place was already in use is what Im getting at She created entire binders about our departments programs and even fully stocked the supply closet that we have I knew she hadnt left due to graduation it had to be either right before she graduated or she hadnt renewed her contract but I didnt know why Its not really my business but I was curious and wanted to be sure it wasnt for something nefarious So my suspicions rise when a classmate of mine M recognized the office that I said Im a GA for a handful of us are GAs most of them for our college but me in this advising office and she brought up that she used to work there in undergrad until she graduated last year M started asking about names from when she was there and it became apparent weve had a lot of staff changes in less than a year I thought Interesting I wonder why She also did not like most of the people advisorsdirector who arewere here I kind of shrugged it off figuring that she probably just had some bad experiences or that the leadership prior to our current director was suboptimal because I liked my coworkers Naïveté on my part Ill admit But something hasnt quite left me since that day M said the previous director lets call him Colin resigned after being caught in a relationship with a student I took this with a grain of salt because I hadnt heard that not even from the other student workers who like to gossip and M had made it clear that she didnt enjoy the office atmosphere Things came to a head for me yesterday when I met with the current director to discuss some issues with the website Things progressed to how she doesnt like how disorganized the supply closet currently is and her plans to clean it out with our administrative assistant over spring break She mentioned having so much stuff left behind by the previous GA like thick binders of whoknowswhat and not knowing what to do with them Theyre multiple 5inch binders stuffed to the brim Bringing up the GA snowballed until Director casually mentioned how my coworker lets call him Andrew one of the two advisors in our department was the one caught making sexual advances and toward the previous GA They had gone out for drinks afterhours unsure if it was with a group and he had texted her inappropriately about hooking up The thendirector Colin received word of this but didnt want to do anything about it He was promptly fired for his inaction once an actual fullblown Title IX case opened against Andrew The GA left after this incident and no one has seen her since She left everything behind Her friends harassed the office to try and hold Colin accountable but it wasnt until the case was opened that action was taken Im in shock and just dont know how to process these instances He came onto my predecessor yet she left and he is still working here I dont even know if shes graduated but it makes sense now why her stuff was left behind and why nobody talks about her aside from the student workers who dont know the truth,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 19:29:57 UTC,9,3,0.74,,,0,0
1j5u6ov,Why I dont support or celebrate Specific Group Celebration Holidays MenWomenMotherFatherPrideBlack Historyetc,I want to start by saying that this is a personal opinion and I understand and also support personal opposing views on this topic regarding individuals who believe the days to be an exemplification of feelings rather than the notes listed below In the past few weeks Ive been hounded on a LOT about not celebrating valentines day mothers day or International Womens Day by people other than the ones Id celebrate them for Ranging from people telling me Im an awful human being for not appreciating my mom or women in generaldespite this being wholly inaccurate to people threatening to assault me because i didnt do something special for my mom on mothers day I wanted to hear from random strangers online if my reasoning is sound and makes sense as toward why I dont celebrate them specifically as when I explain it in person people seem to get quite upset with me regardless I would like to note that around the holiday not on the holiday itself all the time just around that time period I still put more effort and care into the relevant individuals but I just dont like to celebrate the days themselves for the reasons listed below My reluctance to celebrate holidays like Fathers Day Mothers Day International Womens or Mens Day and others that specifically celebrate a group of individuals stems from a few key personal beliefs and feelings 1 Forced Social Expectations I often feel that these holidays create an obligation rather than a genuine expression of appreciation Society dictates that on this specific day I must express gratitude or admiration even if I already do so in my own way throughout the year It feels performativelike Im expected to participate just because its a designated date rather than acting on my feelings when they naturally arise 2 Commercialization Over Meaning These holidays have been heavily commercialized turning what should be a meaningful moment into an opportunity for businesses to sell cards flowers gifts and expensive dinners It feels less about genuine appreciation and more about fulfilling a marketingdriven expectation I dont like the idea of my relationships being tied to consumerism where love and respect are measured by the money or effort spent on a particular day 3 Personal Connection to the Honored Group Sometimes I dont have a personal connection that makes celebrating these holidays meaningful For instance if someone has a complicated relationship with their parents or lacks a strong figure that fits into the holidays framework these days can feel alienating rather than celebratory Its a reminder of what someone might not have rather than an opportunity to appreciate what I do 4 Selective Recognition Feels Arbitrary Why do we elevate specific groups on designated days while overlooking the everyday contributions of others It feels arbitrarywhy celebrate fathers on one day and mothers on another when both play roles throughout the year Why single out women for one day rather than advocating for equal treatment and appreciation daily It seems more symbolic than substantive and I prefer actions that carry meaning every day rather than confining appreciation to a calendar date 5 Pressure to Conform Theres an implicit pressure to participate in these celebrations whether its through social media posts attending gatherings or giving gifts If I choose not to theres often an assumption that I dont care or that Im being inconsiderate But in reality I simply prefer to show my appreciation in my own way at my own time without feeling compelled by external expectations 6 Not Everyone Experiences These Days Positively For many people these holidays can be painful rather than joyous Someone who has lost a parent might struggle on Mothers or Fathers Day Someone who has faced discrimination or hardship might not feel comfortable with the broad generalizations made on International Womens Day Mothers Day Fathers Day or International Mens Day These celebrations assume a universal experience that doesnt exist and Id rather avoid engaging in something that might inadvertently bring discomfort to others 7 Personal Values and Approach Ultimately I value sincerity over tradition If I appreciate someone I want to show it naturally in a way that feels right to me not because a calendar tells me to I dont need a designated day to tell my parents I appreciate them nor do I need a specific date to recognize the struggles and achievements of any group Id rather express my respect gratitude and admiration in everyday moments through my actions and words rather than as part of a structured societal ritual For these reasons I tend to avoid participating in these kinds of holidays Its not out of defiance or lack of appreciation but rather a personal preference for authenticity over obligation,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 17:22:18 UTC,0,3,0.46,,,0,0
1j5mwpv,Potentially ableist rant about ASD and Neurodivergence,Im frustrated with how ASD dominates the majority of neurodivergent discourse I get it I really do ASD is very misunderstood and it very often coexists with other ND types Buuuuuut it feels like everyone only talks about or thinks about ASD Heck even terminology seems ASD specific Sometimes I just want to find something about ADHD and I get told its an ASD symptom that can be present in others Erm no Its an ADHD struggle too based on self reports from those with a diagnosis Why are most ND struggles seen through the lens of ASD so much Im struggling to verbalise my thoughts and Im hoping someone gets what Im saying We need space for just ADHD just dyslexia just OCD Comorbidities are comorbidities Not the core of disorders Im sick of being told that something I deal with is actually an autism thing and I just happen to experience that just by chance No Im not autistic My struggles are not autistic traits They are ADHD traits Wed know that if we stopped calling every trait in an ND person an autistic trait Im sick of my symptoms being seen as an afterthought a fringe case of ASD symptoms Acknowledge my disorder for what it is Im tired of being an oh by the way addition haphazardly tacked onto an ASD discussion Yes it is ok to acknowledge that some things are ASD specific that I happen to do by chance No not every ND trait is autism specific My sensory issues are not ASD traits they are ADHD traits Stop telling me its okay to acknowledge that some things are ASD traits that others experience What are you implying And Im definitely not arguing everyone is a little ASD Thats stupid and if you manage to get that out of my rant I cant help you Im saying validate my struggles as they are Not because they overlap with ASD Whats funny is my friend who says this doesnt pick up on the fact that it hurts me when they say these things,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 12:55:47 UTC,1,5,1.0,,,0,0
1j4njl4,What is the actual contribution of entertainers and influencers to society,What is the actual contribution of entertainers and influencers to society Growing up I always thought about what my contribution to society would be I believed that a meaningful life should involve helping others in a tangible waywhether its building bridges being a doctor who treats patients a teacher who educates or even a wedding planner who helps people organize one of the most important days of their lives Even a makeup artist contributes by helping people feel comfortable in their own skin through skillful techniques But when I look at idols entertainers and influencers I cant help but wonder What is their actual purpose beyond surfacelevel happiness Sure they make people feel entertained maybe even inspired but does that really compare to professions that create real change And yet these are the people society worships the most They get millions live in luxury and are treated like theyve accomplished something greatwhile doctors engineers teachers and everyday workers struggle for recognition or financial stability It feels unfair that popularity is more valuable than actual contribution I know entertainment is a part of life and Im not saying its useless But on a deeper level I wonder what even is their life purpose If your whole job is just singing dancing or making videos whats the end goal Its not like theyre solving world problems creating lasting change or advancing society Does anyone else ever think about this Or am I just overanalyzing it,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 04:38:48 UTC,1,3,1.0,,,0,0
1j3ozsn,A Former Homophobes Guide to Pride,Below is an excerpt of my story about my coming out process and how I was baptized to save myself from my sins of homophobia A link to the full story can be found here A Former Homophobes Guide to Pride Yes the title is clickbait but it will be worth the read and maybe you even get a few laughs from it Once upon a time I was homophobic At a young age I knew that my brothers homosexual tendencies a euphemism that might be more familiar to some than others was going to be problematic given my familys and my own worldview My worldview believed that A he could change because homosexuality is a choice B if he acted upon his sexuality it was a sin love the sinner hate the sin This worldview allowed our family to isolate ourselves from the truth about the core nature of at least 10 of the population including one of our own flesh and blood One day we were hanging out at a reggaethemed party with a buffet of cannabis infused edibles and libations He hadnt had much exposure to cannabis so as I watched him eat about three brownies and a glass of THC lemonade I grew a tad concerned I failed to stop him from eating that third sorcerous pastry and the situation soon turned to the classic I dont feel anything these edibles aint shit then holy shit what have I done Having been there before myself more times than one should after such an uncomfortable lesson I grabbed the reigns and became his spiritual guide or trip advisor I took him on a walk away from the crowds and instructed him to look at the stars He would bounce between they look like LiteBrites remember LiteBrites Brian I loooooooved LiteBrites then to what if we only die because we accept that we die oh my god we are all going to die Whenever we got to the latter half of these dopamineinfused thought obsessions I would coach him to focus on different topics like back to the LiteBrites or the beautiful design of a parasol and why arent parasols popular anymore he loved umbrellas as a kid Eventually and what probably felt to him like an eternity we got to the point where we could coherently talk about deeper subjects such as our upbringing We talked about when we first started jerking off how we would hide our porn downloads from Kazaa how one time I was looking for my downloads and I stumbled upon a very different type of porn than mine In a single night we tackled topics that are typically done over years of bonding moments between brothers who share the same sexual orientation We were both blown away that we had never talked about this stuff we had so much in common but with a slightly different hue to our stories of puberty That night will go down as one of the greatest moments of bonding and connection Ive ever experienced Ill cherish it for the rest of my life One day while visiting my brother he asked me if I wanted to go to Gay Bro Dinner Party I asked him what Gay Bro Dinner Party was and he simply laughed and said I cant believe Im taking you to this Well Gay Bro Dinner Party is a dinner party with Gay Bro friends much like a BBQ or dinner with Straight Bro friends The conversations that go on at both of these dude parties are exactly what you would expect but more talk about cocks balls and asses actually thats not true the frequency of these topics at Straight Bro Dinner party is equal to that at Gay Bro Dinner Partybut the context is slightly differentkind ofagain we are all just a little bit gay deep down inside When I arrived at the party his friends immediately said you brought a straight person to Gay Bro Dinner Party What were you thinking In hindsight I think it was their way of warning me that they werent going to tonedown the banter and the thematic schema that goes on at Gay Bro Dinner Party would remain the same They were going to thoroughly enjoy watching me crawl in my skin In fact in my first effort of small talk I asked the bros how they all knew my brother and they responded in brofashion at a gang bang I gave a nervous laugh doing mental gymnastics to figure out if this was a joke I decided to just roll with it and pray they werent testing how committed I was to being openminded And with that icebreaker I signaled to them with my nervous laughter not knowing whether this was a true story or a joke that I was one of the cool straight guys they could trust Looking back Im pretty sure they were joking I think I mean thats something I would say to someone clearly on a journey to rectify their former antediluvian worldview But I digress For the full story you can visit this link,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 23:32:21 UTC,1,5,0.67,,,0,0

1j4xbz7,My wifes family are a bunch of ungrateful aoles,TLDR Wifes family felt entitled to my money to help with their mothers retirement and none of them have ever expressed one word of gratitude Not looking for advice just venting Backstory Im 65M wife is 61F Married 36 years Wife has three siblings one older brother one older sister one younger sister We were very close with all of her siblings and their spouses for many years we went on dozens of vacations with all of them always had gatherings at holidays spent weekends at each others homes etc Her brother and I were as close as we could be always hanging out playing music and having a great time I loved him more than my own brothers He began to hate me in 2020 because I had the gall to disagree with his political views When he found out I voted for Biden he screamed at me WERE FUCKING DONE at a family gathering Hes barely said two words to me since then Her older sister and her husband have had a simmering illwill towards my wife and I for many years Back in the 80s and 90s I was earning great money and we used to take them and their kids on vacations that were 99 percent paid by me because they didnt have two nickels to rub together If we bought a new piece of furniture or TV or whatever we would offer them our barely used stuff for free which they seemingly gladly accepted We did these things because we loved them Evidently they took our generosity as treating them like a charity case Now that they are both in highearning careers and dont need anything from us they basically hate us for treating them that way and now simply look down their noses sneer and snub us Her younger sister and her husband have always been good Christians but have become more fervent Evangelical Southern Baptist over the years I made the mistake of having a discussion about religious beliefs I am an atheist with the husband several years ago I know a thousand times more about his Holy Bible than he does and the discussion did not go well for him Ever since then they have done their best to ostracize us from the family at every opportunity Fast forward My wifes 80yearold father passed away a couple of years ago leaving his wife my MIL also 80 widowed They relied almost exclusively on Social Security for their retirement income After his death there was a shortfall in the MILs monthly SS income My wifes three siblings had a meeting and decided that the shortfall would be made up by the four siblings split evenly Each share came to 2500 annually to make up the MILs shortfall All three of the other couples are fairly wealthy with annual incomes in the 250350K range and all have 401k accounts over 1 million which they brag about My wife does not work I own a small business which has slowed dramatically since covid I make around 75k in a good year I would like to retire at some point so I am trying to save every dollar that I can in order to do so I will rely heavily on Social Security for retirement income The long and short of it is that I had to funnel 2500 per year into MILs retirement needs that would have otherwise gone towards my own retirement savings The way the siblings view it is your money is your wifes money therefore she needs to chip in to help her mom Fortunately two years into that arrangement the MIL sold her house she moved in with one of the siblings and netted around 200k She told my wife that with that money plus her SS income AND the 50000 she already had in savings I would no longer need to contribute to her income especially since her expenses were now basically zero So thankfully I only had to donate 5000 of my retirement money to the MIL The shitty part is that not one of the siblings or the MIL have ever expressed one word of thanks or gratitude to me even though they are well aware that the money we contributed came 100 from my earnings We still have to see them every now and then at weddings or funerals or whatever and they have never even acknowledged my contribution and sacrifice Their sense of entitlement is appalling especially in light of the fact that they all have a great disdain for me and consider me to be their asshole brotherinlaw,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 14:59:10 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j3dijb,My dad that mlested me growing up isnt my dad,Forgive my formatting Im on mobile Do not share my story anywhere TW Death Incest Pdophilia I dont honestly know where to start so I guess the beginning is where Ill go When I was very young my dad began molesting me from what I can remember I was around 3 or 4 I have three younger sisters that I grew up with and he molested them too as they got older but it was mostly me that got the brunt of it Last year my mom passed away of a stroke It was a very complicated time for me because although my abuser was arrested for what he did my mom had convinced my sisters and I to drop the charges right before she had passed away She would say awful manipulative things like You dont want your dad to die in prison do you to guilt us into dropping the charges She then proceeded to invite this man back into our lives by moving him back into the house we all shared at the time and my discomfort was ignored and brushed under the rug When my mom passed my dad went crazy and forced me out of the house My mom was a buffer between everyone and with her gone I didnt feel comfortable at the house at all and I had my boyfriend stay in my room with me because I felt safer that way Cue raging dad cussing me out for inviting another man over and threatening to call the cops and having him trespassed all crazy erratic shit I didnt understand So I moved in with my boyfriend yay All that drama didnt even end up mattering though because dad remarried and moved to a new state just 3 months after my moms passing Currently all my sisters are still living in that house together Now heres the fun part Im the eldest Growing up I was always told that my parents got married at the courthouse and had me before they officially hosted the wedding I was born in 99 and the timeline I was told was Met online in 97 Courthouse wedding in 98 I was born in 99 Wedding I was pictured in took place in 2000 I always knew I was in their wedding pictures and I never questioned what they told me they said the ceremony was delayed until my grandma could get back from doing government work overseas It all made sense to me growing up I never questioned it but it was all a lie So this weekend was a the year anniversary of my mothers death and I decided to get dinner with my sisters Were having a good time and everything but I forgot my jacket and my boyfriend stopped by the restaurant to bring it to me I get back to the table and my sisters got all quiet and said Hey weve got some news for you and its really heavy Long story short this man that Ive thought was my dad my whole life is NOT my biological father My sisters have been going through all of our moms things over the last year and kept coming across weird pictures and documents relating to me that didnt line up with what wed been told I wouldve thought they were trolling me if it werent for the fact theyd confirmed everything with my aunt my moms younger sister Who I just found out yesterday didnt know that I didnt know because my mom was not only lying to my siblings and I about it but lying to my aunt and all of our extended family too saying my siblings and I already knew Im going to visit my aunt in a couple of days to sit down and talk all of this out get the real scoop on my life because my whole worldview has been shattered On one hand Im grateful I was finally told but I turn 26 this month and thats an insane age to learn your dad isnt even your dad Not to mention what a horrible dad he was I feel this information to be both heartbreaking and freeing Im not related to this monster If I have kids I wont be passing along his DNA and thats comforting to me I dont want to make my half sisters feel bad for being related to him but I cant help feeling like this Ive always told myself I wouldnt have kids because this guy doesnt deserve his DNA being passed on and now I find out I have none of it This information was a gift to me On the other hand Im angrier at my mom than Ive ever been I mourned her death so severely I suffered because I felt so guilty that our relationship was so tumultuous in life And yet we never could have had an honest relationship because I now know she was never honest with me About almost anything I feel so much better and at peace knowing that it really and truly was my mothers fault that our relationship was so rocky How can you have an honest relationship with anyone that could lie about something so big Not to mention the fact that she was so manipulative and greedy doing everything she did just to invite this evil man back into our lives just because its what she wanted for herself to retire on his dime None of this is on me anymore and I feel so much lighter And before anyone asks yes a DNA test is in my future and Im starting therapy again soon I have no idea if my dad is even alive or still out there but Im going to find out Im not sure how to end this but let me just say this has been the craziest year of my life by far and Im glad I dont have to interact with either of my parents anymore or feel guilty about how I handled things when my mom was

1j58nr5,Ive been in a secret relationship for the past 9 months and Im afraid to tell my family,Hi everyone Last summer I 22F met a man on this app who is 45M The day after we met online we had a phone call and ended up spending nine hours on the phone The following month he flew out to see me and I spent that whole weekend with him We had an instant connection and even nine months later things still feel really great Him and I live only a few states apart so for the past nine months we have been traveling a lot just to see eachother We have been traveling back and forth so much that this weekend is our 20th visit with eachother and we have spent roughly 100 days together in person When we first started seeing each other I didnt tell anyone because I was too afraid of the judgment people would say I have no clue how people in my family or community might feel about our age gap Overtime it just got more and more involved but I still did my best to hide my relationship from everyone This upcoming May I need to find a new place to live and I dont really have many options The best case scenario is for my partner to move to my state and for us to live together That is a realistic plan for us but the only issue is that I dont think I can hide that from my friendsfamily I am also starting to think about just telling them since there are times where it is hard to have to hide my relationship especially when its such a big part of my life I am really worried about what my family might say I am worried they will look at me in a negative light I know that its just their opinions but it isnt easy to feel judgment I am really stressed and confused on what the right decision is Any advice would be greatly appreciated white_heart,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 22:55:24 UTC,0,8,0.47,,,0,0

1j4hyop,Im a rent man and I think I have a crush on my client,Warning slightly sexually explicit Probably NSFW I dont really know how to say any of this but I know I need to write it somewhere Ill probably delete this at some point after Im 27M and Im a rent man Another term for what I do is male escort But I live in a small sleepy town and we just dont call ourselves escorts I decided to get into this because I needed some money to help me finish my degree Im also in good shape so I thought it would be an easy side hustle I didnt dont have a partner and I havent been interested in dating Business is generally very slow When I first started I only had 1 client who I would visit every week After that she moved away and I had two more clients that I would see periodically It was always a very clinical and mechanical experience Get in do what needs to be done get out Things were quiet for about a year and a half I wasnt really providing services anymore But a few months ago I got a message on my profile from a lady who was interested in my services She was just reaching out asking how it works We spoke for a bit and we decided to meet up My services are customisable and she selected a variation of the boyfriend experience I went to her house and I was Surprised She had a really nice place In a rich neighbourhood Im sure this might not be out of the ordinary for other male escorts but my previous clients werent situated in rich neighbourhoods I didnt grow up rich She was very welcoming She was a few years older than me She seemed to have a successful career We sat in the living room and just talked She told me that shes had sex for her whole adult life and shes enjoyed it for the most part But shes had some kind of sexual awakening recently and shes looking for someone to explore this with She said she doesnt even care if we didnt have sex that night She wanted to talk to make sure that we would be a good fit for what she had in mind and if I was okay with it That was also a first for me My previous clients didnt really care what I was okay with Anyway Lots has happened since then I see her maybe once every two weeks And its always an incredible experience I cant explain it Sometimes we have sex Sometimes we dont Sometimes we eat pizza and watch movies sometimes we drink and have sex Its so passionate Sometimes its primal Sometimes its lazy and intense Its not the mechanical sex that Im used to She truly turns me on She likes it when Im satisfied Sometimes we just talk and nothing else Ive opened up to her about my life She pays me every time Ive even started insisting that she doesnt need to But she believes in me and my future and wants to support me in finishing my degree The problem is I no longer see this as a professional relationship I really like her And she seems to really care about me as a person We know so much about each other but I feel so weird to say that were friends She pays me for my time so are we really friends And sometimes I let my mind wander What if we were more Shes quite an incredible woman And weve had many deep conversations Shes been through a lot One of the topics that came up was her previous relationships Because I was wondering why she would approach a service instead of exploring this with perhaps a romantic partner And I guess long story short she was in a relationship with a man who absolutely destroyed her She no longer trusts people enough to share her life with She wants to be alone Forever But she desperately wants to explore her sexual side I guess thats where I come in By the way I know who this man is Its a small town Fck you for what you did You had such a great woman Whats wrong with you I havent heard from her in a while And I desperately want to reach out to her Im trying not to lose myself in this situation I keep telling myself shes just my client and nothing more This is just me doing my job But I know that I feel a certain way Unfortunately I dont think shell ever see me as anything more,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 23:53:55 UTC,1128,76,0.94,,,0,0

1j3kz2n,It hurt and I will never forget what they did,I was about a freshman when it started I went to a school and said school was a Christian School But it really was anything but what youd expect I will never forget what happened in those 3 dreadful fucking years I stayed in that god damned school They made me distrust anyone who worked in education they made me hate anything relating to going to school In the span of 3 years of being suicidal and slicing my arms they only started to give a damn when my grades went up Freshman year ignored Sophomore year ignored Junior year Seen but only because my grades went up I admit I didnt have the best grades I didnt get medals like my classmates but thats not the point In sophomore year we had a new student First thing they did Announce that they should help the student take away all the sharp objects from her They didnt do that with me They didnt announce jack shit They let me hurt myself By the end of the year my own best friend even got help I didnt know she was struggling we were always the outcasts But then she got help The principal came in on the first week my best friend didnt come to school anymore and told everyone to make little notes that are positive addressed to each other but in reality it was really just for my best friend The principal told everyone to make friends with her so they did She was involved more but I wasnt Anytime she had announcements about me it was reprimanding the other students for speaking in our mothertongue with me and not in English because NotAWinterTale can only speak english Which is false I speak 5 total languages They never set up a guidance councilor for me Anytime I tried to look for one I got brushed off and was told to just pray to God That was the only thing they ever tell me Pray to God of course That doesnt address anything The principal talked to me told me a story about a deceased student She was physically disabled but always came to school happy She told me that she had it worse than I did and I should be happy for that The principal in the same day told me to stop crying otherwise she wouldnt talk to me anymore She also told me all the professors thought I should be in a different section The one where they put the dumber kids Which I found very insulting because they hadnt even tried to help me in any of my problems just ignored me and moved on It was painfully obvious when a professor didnt like me They never responded to me or acted with me the same way as other students But still really fucking disgusting to me How dare she compare my problems to a deceased student That was extremely disrespectful and told me all I needed to know I couldnt trust the principal at all Every fucking day for 2 years I came to school with new scars They never checked on me that responsibility for some reason befell my own few friends Other students Not the teachers The students 4 people who saw me But then the pandemic came and we were all forced to go to school online My grades went up It only got easier because I didnt feel any pressure Nor did I have to work with others who only wanted to delegate me stupid tasks or have me do nothing at all or some professor not answering my question properly but just making it more complicated it was easier because I could search up the topic at the same time and get the answers I needed But then they my grades went down again I was called in for a private meeting with the principal a professor and two guidance councilors I am not ever forgetting what they told me Is there something wrong NotAWinterTale You know that you can talk to us Your grades are going down Your grades in the first and second quarter were really good and it concerns us that it went down again If theres anything we can do to help tell us I had never felt angrier at them Two fucking years of being ignored of cutting my arms and being suicidal enough to have nearly jumped off the damn building they only started to give a fuck the year they see I fit their expectations of being smart I never forgot what happened or what they did That stuck with me for years Im still crying about this years later Because of them I feel like I dont deserve help unless my performance is above average that I meant nothing all because I struggled and couldnt do it They always made me feel ashamed that things didnt click for me Now I feel vindicated now that I know I have AuDHD and while I know it probably isnt an excuse I feel happy to know its not because I was stupid and didnt try hard enough I am told I deserve what they never gave me but sometimes those words arent enough to erase the pain that school gave me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 20:41:10 UTC,3,0,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0
1j789eo,I think Im falling out of love,Im so lost I know relationships are never easy but Im just starting to think that maybe we didnt meet at the right time in each others lives I have so many insecurities in regards to being included in outings Her communication is really lacking and forgoes telling me how she feels about things Our most recent disagreement has been in regards to travel we cant come to a compromise and find a balance between her travelling with her and also my friends with time for us to spend together We promised wed travel with each other after this year fell through for similar reasons Instead I had to leave it at she will go with her friends instead of me Im hurt because it feels like she doesnt want to go away with me but shes hurt because I think that Shes promised to do better and apologised so many times for not communicating I feel like our bad times are more frequent than the good I want to push through because she is so loving caring and sweet but Ive got a massive piece missing rn and if I explain this to her she breaks down and stops talking entirely Im stuck I know I am so far from a bastion of perfection in this relationship but I just cant help but be frustrated and saddened by this Today I was sick and quite feverish so I spent a while thinking back to a past relationship While Im absolutely over that girl I just couldnt help but reminisce about how that short relationship three years ago made me feel I do hold it in very high regard because I was in the wilderness prior to it alone and totally confused about my place in the world before she showed me so Im now quite nostalgic about what she was for me especially now my needs just arent being met That girl and I met in the wrong time and the wrong circumstances to last but we ended very amicably I know its horrible and so unfair for my gf as well as the previous girl to keep thinking like this I love spontaneity and random intimate things and I have told her this but never does she ask me to come over for a karaoke drive at midnight with the windows down Never does she say she wants to spend the night with me somewhere random I sometimes ask but its usually a no I feel like Im right back to where I was preprevious relationship and Im lost and so sad I want to make things better and I know constantly comparing my last relationship to my current is really poor I know Im focusing on the negative things she does I know I could be better but Im so fucking demotivated bc she just doesnt talk and we just dont go out to do things Then a rift forms and I have to be the one to try and pull it back and then shes extremely upset and scared that I might leave her or she thinks shes a bad person I cant say how I really feel because of that It takes days for our usual fun side to return and then theres a couple weeks of good Rinse and repeat Longterm relationships are loads of battles to stay in love Some are so much harder but I do love her Though is it worth losing parts of who you are when Im this age Im emotionally exhausted by the constant confusion and stress of slow and lacking communication as well as my physical needs just not being met Im 23 so Im not looking to waste her or my time any longer if this just wont work I like solving things but this feels like its becoming bigger than me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 14:02:11 UTC,2,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j5ez5s,I treated my for a broken handwrist as a kid and didnt knowrealize it until i was older very long read oof,i honestly really should probably talk abt this bc it honestly was actually pretty tramuatizing enough that i feel like i may have locked away some memories of what happened bc of just how awful some of the experience was my memory is somewhat spotty bc of how scary it all was but ill try my best to explain my friend had a Halloween party at her house we decided to play something that involved running which was a rather stupid decision as everything was slippery and dark outside i was running nearon ground that was steeply raised up a bit for a buliding to be bulit flat on i slipped and fell despite the mud when i instinctively reached out to brace myself by putting my hand out towards the top of the small slope i got hurt really really badly i had never been in such pain before i dont remember how quickly it arrived exactly but it was pretty quick to show up i started crying a soon as the pain hit and the girl i had been running behind took notice and from what i can remember asked if i was ok the other girls i was playing with eventually noticed and the escorted me to the house and to my friends mother who is a vetvet tech she wrapped it in blue vet wrap in the kitchen and asked if i wanted to go to the doctor and child me refused out if fear of possibly having to get surgery and probably bc i didnt want to inconvenience anyone the vet wrap was uncomfortable and irritating but honestly the splint i got for a broken foot abt 2 years ago was worse and it was by an er doc too and while child me had to experience that awful splint the vet wrap did make my hand feel better i felt like i could pick it up and move it safely so i ended up staying inside sitting on one of their couches in the living room and resting my arm on the arm supports watching tv with my friends mom i wasnt rly interested in the show but that was the least of my worries then i think at one point she brought me food like a hotdog or smth which had ketchup bc my autistic ass wouldnt eat meat unless ot had ketchup on it the other girls went outside after everything calmed down somewhat tho my friend stayed a bit longer from what remember to make sure i was ok eventually they came back inside for an event i forget if it was planned or started bc it was dark and I was stuck inside basically it was a game where someone would get wrapped on toilet paper to become a mummy they included me in it by loosely wrapping parts of my armhand that i was willing to move and then we eventually all went home i dunno when any of this next stuff happens exactly but ill try to explain it in order i was cyberschooled then and at first i was fine until i needed to write something im right handed and my right hand was the one that was injured i remember my mom yelling at me because i refused to use my right hand and i think i asked if she could write for me she told me to use it and i remember crying and saying I cant I cant i tried to move it even slightly in order to try obeying what she said but the pain was terrible horrendous unbearable i cant think of words that can extensively describe how much pain i was in i dont quite remember it all but i think when i tried to use my left hand to write i was yelled at too and my mom minimized my pain by saying smth along the lines of it isnt that bad and i was also condescendingly asked if i wanted to go the doctor which i again refused fearing surgery and also bc having my parents yell at me made me upset all this time i remember i still had that blue vet wrap on my hand was shaking and in so much pain i forget if my mom did the usual let me feel it thing but if she did i most definitely refused and probably yanked it away based on the fact I still had that vet wrap on i think it was probably the next day i was allowed to write with my left hand but not without being scolded i remember writing down things in notebooks for fun with my left hand and i even decided that a character id made had my left hands handwriting i eventually got better writing with my left hand and honestly really had fun with it while i wrote and did things with my left hand i also did not use my right hand or bend my wrist at least i did as little as possible i kept on using the vet wrap to stablize it until it wouldnt stick no more then i found some wrap i has gotten from when i sprained my leg and so i it instead and remembered how i treated my sprained leg used that was refrence for resting my hand and also didnt move it bc it was painful i dont remember much else abt the recovery i think i stopped wrapping it and started using my right hand again as soon as the pain lessoned which probably was after like a month or two perhaps ik it takes longer for a broken bone to recover but the pain does go away pretty quickly honestly i remember my mom expecting me to recover from my sprain in about a week and was upset i still refused to use it and instead write with my left hand i did keep on writing with my left hand sometimes for awhile after that just for fun which ironically probably helped my right hand recover lol i dont quite know how long after it was but i think it was a decent chunk after but within the same year i once again slipped and fell and i forget which handi landed on but based on the pain and how caught myself the same way again i think it was my right which i once again assumed was a sprain but only a minor one so i again pulled out the wrap i had and i think for abt a day or 3 days wrapped my hand i remember not having much pain and wondering if it still needed wrapped the next day but i still ended up keeping it on i think and until i was a teen it never hit me that the pain i feltin my bones was not a normal sprain thing but probably a broken bone and it really hit me after a horse broke my foot 2 years ago that yea that probably wasnt a sprain bc like it was while less pain that pain i got from my broken foot felt literally like a lesser version of the pain i felt in my hand when i was a kid tbh im not completely sure if i did break my hand as ive never rly had it inspected for past breaks unlike my foot it doesnt rly act up when the weather changes or from overuse etc at least i think so i never rly took notice of anything like thay as a kid because i was never aware or looking for anybpain related to broken bones so im open to anyone suggesting its something else not for legitimate medical advice as well ik i shouldnt get it from here and its already healed just out of curiosity i wonder if it was like a pinched nerve maybe but it didnt feel like one at all ive unfortunately had and continue of have pinched nerves in my neck

1j4mzu2,My ex best friend tried to ruin my life because my brother rejected her 10 years ago She wont stop,This started years ago now and Ive pretty much let it go but I never talked about it fully with people out of trying to not pull people into it when it was happening so here goes WarningIts long lol I met this friend through another friend and we quickly became close We ended up working together as well for my parents another area of my life I needed to have boundaries but I was 19 and thought it would be fine would hang out after work we called each other twin because we had a lot in common We got hired for a creative project together as we were both into photography We worked on personal creative projects together we were together CONSTANTLY We were teenagers and as teenage girls often are we were constantly talking about different guys we were interested in and I found out she was interested in my brother They went on a date and my brother very quickly realized they were not compatible This is where I can pinpoint a change in our friendship She stopped asking me to hang out I would ask her to hang out and she would be busy She would constantly hang out with our mutual friends At the time I thought reaching out and asking if I had done anything wrong to warrant not being invited places I had previously been invited to was the right choice and got told dont worry about it everything is good I was getting married at the time and had already asked her to be my maid of honor so I assumed that maybe it was a rough patch I was stressed etc tip dont assume everything is fine shes in all my wedding photos now lol The REAL switch to trying to ruin my life was after I got married I have been photographing for years and decided to try to pursue it as a business as my parents business had closed She HATED that because she did photography too and suddenly any similarities we had were me copying her I posted a story on IG about prices she posted the original is always better than the copy One of her friends that I didnt know was her friend at the time modeled for me and she posted that people always try to undercut your business At one point I posted something I dont even remember what it was at this point and she posted within 5 minutes and said Okay shes obviously copying me right Now full transparency I did not handle this well I tried to talk it out with her tried everything I knew and she would smile to my face and tell me everything was okay and then continue to do this I found myself looking at her posts constantly because she would never say what I had done to hurt her to my face but would post consistently so I felt like at least I could try to piece together what had gone wrong and also if she felt I had been copying her I wanted to make sure I didnt post anything similar to her because I genuinely just wanted it to stop We talked a couple times tried to make amends but she still would post about me often A couple years later I did a photoshoot with another photographer modeling for me for a concept around a pregnancy loss I have chronic health issues and so does this photographer and I decided to center it around healing It was a beautiful project The DAY I posted about it she posted a video on TikTok that said if you want to be me just say that I didnt follow her but with her being a contact in my phone sometimes her videos would still pop up That was it After all the posts and all the years of just dealing with it I was done She had tried to isolate me from members of my husbands family she had deleted texts and then posted screenshots of our conversations and I had just turned the other cheek but if she could somehow take a photoshoot about MY pregnancy loss and make it about her I was done I blocked her on everything And then I started seeing friends of hers looking at my posts so I blocked several of them as well Im 28 now and have a wonderful life with my husband and our son I do photography part time now so I can stay home and take care of him I have talked to her once since and I asked her why she did all of that She told me that it was because she had a hard time with her dynamic with my brother and my family after working for my parents I asked her specifically what I did and all she said was that I was clingy and she wanted other friends I personally have let a lot of it go but theres always little reminders of it because our circles are so intertwined and tonight I feel like its okay to talk about to strangers on the internet because I never said anything to anyone else when it was happening except for my husband and a few friends never did anything about it and just prayed she would stop So theres that Just a big ol get it off my chest The biggest thing I learned from it is friends that arent willing to talk through it are not friends I want to have and that sometimes you just need to block and walk,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 04:08:07 UTC,1048,17,0.99,,,0,0

1j7qxvt,I want to contact someone from my past but am scared of being rejected,I 23f havent spoken to an old friend of mine in almost six years and have some unresolved feelings regarding him We met in middle school and became friends pretty quickly It was never the type of friendship where I hung out with him outside of school or knew his favorite color or anything yet I always felt pretty close to him and there was never a quiet moment During middle school everything was pretty smooth sailing However in the beginning of high school we started having more minor arguments At the time I couldnt pinpoint my intense emotions regarding him but I now realize that I definitely had feelings for him but had too little experience and too many insecurities to even acknowledge it Even though we argued often he normally was a very kind and considerate person Things came to a head when he said something hurtful to me during an argument and I distanced myself for a while out of fear of being disliked He did try to approach me like normal during this time but would get frustrated when I distanced myself I found out later on that he confided in some close mutual friends about this too We eventually reconciled and discussed the issue but it was never quite the same Then we graduated and I havent seen him since It was kind of hard to deal with because he was the type of person that felt like the world kept purposely inserting him into my life I feel like I lost someone who I shouldnt have Briefly after high school he unfollowed me and removed me as a follower on social media but did not block me Hes the type of guy that still follows his exes and ex friends so I dont understand why After the last six years of no contact I tried to follow him on social media a few months ago and he accepted and followed me back I dont even really care if he never liked me in that way because I never thought that he did I want these unresolved feelings of confusion to go away and to understand his point of view during that time He isnt the type to shy away or be closed off about his emotions so I know hed be truthful However it has been so long since weve spoken so I am scared of how he will react He is someone I miss being around a lot,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 04:49:43 UTC,1,0,0.6,,,0,0
1j796vy,I fear any possible future relationships for 1 particular reason,Im in my early 20s and Ive technically only had 2 relationships I say technically because the first was so onoff that it didnt even count as one plus she ended up cheating But what Ive noticed since the that one is that I tend to be overcaring sometimes clingy and think about whoever I have feelings for constantly as if an image of her is burned into my mind no matter where I look or even if my eyes are closed Ive been through some brutal ones where a girl I met at university a mates mate but single was so unbelievably beautiful funny wellmannered and smart that it was painful to keep thinking about her until I asked her out but she polited declined The other relationship was when I met an American girl studying here who actually liked me for who I am which was a surprise considering I believe myself to be the equivalent of Rocky Dennis in terms of looks but with the way I was around and to her I realise now I was too overcaring right at the start treating her as an already long term girlfriend when we just started dating for 2 days And then after a while of dating she tells me something resulting in a glorious stab in the heart where she quite literally said over these past few weeks dating you has made me realise I miss my ex and proceeded to fly back to Murica reddit wont let me say it properly for some reason THE NEXT DAMN WEEK FFS so naturally I crashed out and drank a lot So referring to the title of this the one main thing as to why I dont want a relationship is that I dont want to lose her ruin her life or make her detest me because of how I am with overcaring I hate it but better to stay alone than to ruin someones life And for those of you who say work on changing yourself trust me Ive tried but its pretty hard when you have little experience in the dating scene because you look like a damn goblin from clash of clans,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 14:50:04 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0

1j6wnuu,Teen Nightmare,Teen Nightmare This happened many years ago I dont want anyone to get in trouble or press charges I just need to finally be able to speak about what happened I was 17 at the time and I volunteered as a Sheriff explorer during this time I met a deputy who in the beginning was really nice to me I had just graduated highschool but my 18th birthday wasnt until a few months later I was scheduled to go on a ride along we were required to go on patrol at least once every three months or so and he volunteered to take me on this day This first time went fine I was super shy but he got me to open up he talked about himself and asked me about what my plans were after graduating It wasnt until the second time I went on patrol with him around a month later that things took a turn I knew he had a girlfriend she was only two years older me but this time around he started talking about how things were rocky between them I didnt think much of it I thought he was just venting and no harm done However he was being super touchy and was flirting and at that time I was too shy to say anything He ended up kissing me out of nowhere and he just smiled and said he needed to know if I was attracted to him Im not going to lie I was he was good looking but I asked him about his girlfriend he said she wouldnt care He offered to take me home after the shift and he did but not before he ended up taking me to an abandoned field and said he just wanted to talk We ended up making out in his car and i told him i didnt want to have sex that it was as far as i would go he said it was fine but kept pushing and pressuring for more He said if i really had feelings for him i would be willing to go all the way He took me home after about an hour and explicitedly told me that if i was asked by any other deputy to just say were friends I liked how special he made me feel and the red flags were there but i honestly thought he wouldnt force me to have sex with him since at that point he did stop when i told him to even if he continued to ask From this point on whenever I would patrol with him things would go further Until finally one day after my 18th birthday he said he would take me home but instead he hopped on the freeway towards his apartment I was scared but at that point I felt speaking up would get me abandoned somewhere unfamiliar or worse We made it to his place and he gave me a beer and led me to his bedroom I felt like I couldnt say no he told me to relax that I would like it that it was just my nerves We ended having sex but I finally was able to tell him he needed to stop that he was hurting me but all he would say was just let me finish its OK youll like it in a minute No amount of pleading worked until he finally rolled off me By then I was shaking and oddly felt numb about the whole thing He took me home and again told me to say we were just friends He would lose his job if anyone found out making me feel guilty I ended up quitting the program a few months later and foud out he was being investigated for misconduct on a whole different issue I regret keeping quiet but at the time I was confused and developed feelings for him Other deputies became suspicious since they noticed he would go out of his way to talk to me but no one ever asked me personally if anything happened I know this is long and confusing but it feels good to finally speak about it Ive held this in for 16 years I had posted and then deleted I freaked out a bit that it was shared but if it helps anyone else in a similar situation so they speak up then it is what it is Also for clarity he was nine years older than me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 01:41:28 UTC,1,0,0.99,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j6c8nk,A man tried to get into my house today I did everything wrong except lock the door,It was just my almost 2 year old son and me in the house Dogs were outside and I was at the kitchen table doing my makeup getting ready for work as I was supposed to leave in 2hrs The doorbell rang and I ignored it for a couple minutes Its not uncommon for solicitors to try and sell shit I slowly walked up to my front door peephole and looked out There was a man standing with his back to the door blocking most of my view and then a second man was out at my curb back also facing my door kinda looking around I started to get nervous and slowly turned the lock on the front doorknob so he wouldnt hear I was on the other side Important to note my moms transmission went out last week so shes borrowing my car No cars in the driveway or in front on the street But the TV was on playing a kid show for my toddler so he wouldnt miss my presence as much while getting ready I watched him for a bit and decided hed probably leave soon and started walking away Thats when I heard my glass door open I thought Id hear him knock next but instead I got to watch as my front door knob started jiggling like someone was trying to get in And then I froze Instead of getting my husbands gun to protect myself and my child I did nothing I just froze He fiddled with the door knob for a bit and then eventually walked away I peeped out the kitchen window and watched as this dude met up with his buddy and then they started walking away I texted my husband instead of calling the police Hes the one that did He told me to call them because they wanted to ask me questions and so I did Then when I tried to call my phone said I had to connect to a wifi or network to make a call My bill is paid every month on the 2nd and I was connected to wifi Just another thing that was going wrong The police had to call me back and ask if I was ok to even talk to them When the police did show up they said the guys were solicitors and its illegal in the city to do that We even have 2 no soliciting signs taped to the glass door She said her partner found them up the street and was kicking them out of the neighborhood Since there was no proof they tried to enter the house nothing could be done The only thing they could do was drive up to the company and tell them that if they walk onto our property again they will have trespassing charges filed and the company will receive a citation At the end of it all Im extremely shaken I didnt do anything right except lock the door I didnt tell them to go away I didnt call 911 I didnt get a weapon I just locked the door and then watched as they tried to get in texted my husband and then did what I was told I cried for a long time after Im still not doing great If I hadnt locked that door I really dont know what couldve happened If youve read this far thank you I just really needed to get this off my chest and out,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 07:46:11 UTC,502,57,0.95,,,0,0
1j85hv5,I am a man I got sexually assaulted She twisted it and accused me everyone only believed her,Its been a few years since this happened I had to quit college and end my studies because of it I have mostly pretended it never happened but Ive recently been looking back and processing it and I need to talk to someone about it I dont have anyone to talk to about this so I decided to come here Many years ago I was 17 and had just started college I befriended a girl lets call her Emma Emma started dating this Bisexual girl lets call her Jenny and once she came into the picture the three of us formed a friend group We were a good friend group for a while and had lots of fun hanging out and studying together Still at some point Emmas and Jennys relationship started to go really sour Jenny had BPD and their relationship had started to become really unstable They had arguments almost daily even at our college And during these times I became the therapist whenever I individually met them they would rant to me about each other And Jenny and I really bonded and became good friends since she actually listened to my rants too The day it happened the school had organized a disco party Emma was working and had to get home get ready and head straight to the party So Jenny had invited me to hang out at her place before the party get ready together hang out and then head over to meet Emma at the party We were just hanging around typical college kid age things and everything was light hearted But suddenly things got really weird she started talking about sexual things asking me about my kinks and fetishes asking me about all sorts of sexual questions and it somehow evolved to her taking out her computer and showing me the kind of porn she watches and yes when I say showing I mean putting on the actual videos of her favourite porn and asking me to show mine From there it kept escalating into much weirder sexual things after the porn she started talking about Emma and telling me what they do in bed then she pulled out her phone and started showing me nudes of Emma without Emmas permission or knowledge of it The next part which I feel extremely uncomfortable thinking about and trying to forget Her parents were downstairs eating dinner after showing me a bunch of nudes of Emma without her permission she opened the door and at that point her parents could probably hear whatever we were talking about Then she sat down next to me started talking about how much she misses being with a guy put her hands inside my pants and Sexually Assaulted me while making remarks about how much she liked feeling me Eventually her parents started to come upstairs She stopped and at that point I said I had to go and went home skipping the party I didnt want any of that I only saw her as a friend and I didnt consent I justfroze Many people have asked me when I tell this why I didnt stop her and said to me that I Consented by not stopping around the part she started showing porn or Emmas nudes But I was dissociating the whole time I cant really explain it but I was in shock the entire time Afterwards the next day when I came to college she had told Emma at the party that she cheated on her told her I had made a move on her and she reciprocated it This broke our friend group entirely and I was left alone with no friends It all went completely sideways when a mutual asked me about what happened to our group and once I told her the story she asked me Isnt that sexual assault and thats when it hit me what it really was to which I said yes Not too long later that person talked to Jenny about it Jenny told her a completely different story that she was the victim of SA and I was the one who did it she twisted the whole story in a way where she told people I did all the things she did that night the kink questions porn begging to see nudes of Emma and then I assaulted her No matter how much I told the truth No one listened they all believed her It didnt take long for the whole school to believe her and paint me as a sexual predator I became an outcast and everyone treated me like a monster It led me really close to suicide and I dropped out of school and have never gone back not long after I dropped out I developed very heavy substance abuse and have been struggling with it until recently I am sober for around 9 months now I really dont know how I feel about posting this but I genuinely just needed to tell my story I just needed to vent Im sorry if this is too much I hope you all have a good day,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 18:23:02 UTC,439,32,0.96,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j7mx83,Witnessed a personal tragedy today I feel really bad for her,Her husband died today She had been faithfully taking care of him for a while now His body was lying in the middle of their small stuffy overheated living room She had been doing cpr on him following the 911 operators instructions Hed been sick for a long time Agent Orange lung cancer from his time in Vietnam Even so she was not prepared for his passing in any way Shes one of those women that is unable to function on her own She always depended on her husband to tell her what to do While we were waiting on the coroner to arrive several of us were in the crowded living room trying to comfort the new widow The conversation drifted through various death and healthrelated subjects all of it floating past the dead person on the floor like he wasnt even there and he really wasnt There was no sense of a person under that white sheet Their two small dogs both gave off a sense of a soul that awareness of being just like the living people in the room did That personshaped lump under the sheet could have been rolled up bedclothes for all the awareness it gave off He his soul his essence the thing that made him him was no longer there It really brought home to me that the physical body is not really the person Its just what people see Its the soul the part of a person you cant see that makes you you A family friend came to take her and her two little dogs to his house Shes lost grieving and woefully unprepared now adrift without her longtime safe harbor Shes in her late 70s I doubt if shell live there in that house alone Shell probably sell the place I wonder if she will forever see her husband lying on that tiny living room floor first as she was desperately doing cpr on him and then as the EMTs draped that white sheet over him covering his face Hes gone now everyone told her Hes not suffering anymore And he did suffer for years always struggling to get enough air into his lungs even while breathing pure oxygen So its her and the two little dogs now Her family friend will have to emotionally carry her through the next days and weeks of the funeral Social Security VA death certificates all the financial insurance and vehicle paperwork they failed to set up ahead of time in order to avoid just such a situation as this I guess it can be understood that one or both of them just couldnt bear to think about the end for him even though it was staring them squarely in the face It IS an awfully hard thing to think about and accept She did all she could to care for him knowing how it would eventually end while desperately denying it Now shes broken I dont think with her dependent personality that she will ever fully recover I truly hope though moving forward that she invests as much care and loving into herself as she did her husband She has severely neglected herself her health appearance everything in favor of caring for him I hope she realizes its her turn now to care for and love herself Life goes on That fact may be the hardest part of any of this for her,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 01:10:18 UTC,595,31,0.97,,,0,0
1j4an82,I loved her but I was never enough,One night at a bar I met her She was different Beautiful poetic full of life in a way I hadnt seen before She looked at me like I mattered and for the first time in a long time I felt seen We worked in the same company but had never noticed each other before that night From that moment on my life revolved around her We werent officially together but we acted like we were Shed come over almost every night wed talk for hours fall asleep in each others arms It felt real It felt worth fighting for But she kept saying she wasnt ready for a relationship I told myself to be patient to wait until she healed from her past But months passed and nothing changed Every time I tried to define what we were she pulled away And yet she always came back She had a drinking problem I picked her up from bars when she was too wasted to get home I held her hair back when she was sick tucked her into bed made sure she was okay I cleaned up the messes she madeliterally and figuratively And still I wasnt enough She had a kid and I got along with her so well I ignored the fact that she still lived with her exhusband in the same apartment One night after yet another drunken call she told me she had kissed another guy A few months later she admitted she had slept with her ex And yet I stayed Not because I had no selfrespect but because I loved her Because I convinced myself that maybe love was enough But it wasnt I convinced myself we werent dating I guess she convinced me too The night she finally agreed to date me it wasnt out of loveit was out of guilt Because I cried in front of her Because I was breaking Because she saw what she was doing to me It wasnt the kind of love I wanted It wasnt real And yet I held on for months hoping things would change They didnt I should have left the first time she hurt me I should have walked away when she made it clear I was just convenient But I didnt And it cost me more than I ever imagined I dont know why Im writing this Maybe just to get it out of my system Maybe because deep down I still love her Or maybe I just need someone to tell me that it wasnt my fault,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 18:52:30 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j40w00,Sad and stuck,Throwaway acc I F29 feel stuck in my life and feel sad Ive felt like this for a number of years In fact it started when I started my current role in healthcare after qualifying form university Ive thought about a career change so many times and have dabbled in a few things but havent fully dove into anything bc as much as I dislike my job Im good at it and earn a decent salary Its also a safe job Long story short I come from a poor working class background mum with mental health issues parents divorced and live separately Mum is on benefits and dad works a minimum wage job I come from a background where we dont just abandon our parents and I love them and want to help them Im however an only child Ive been married to an amazing person a number of years ago and as amazing as he is he too is burdened with family issues We also live with the inlaws His mother became disabled last year and a lot of her care is depended on him He also holds responsibility for his disabled sister as well He does a lot for everyone hes practically had to be the dad of the family since his dad wasnt around much when they were younger But now I see it taking a toll on him and he wont admit it only in snippets he says I sleep so much bc Im so stressed I try to support him as much as I can but hes doesnt want me to get more stressed with my family stress too I believe my stress comes from having a poor relationship with money But lets not deny that you need money to survive in this world However I feel this huge financial burden that I need to provide for my parents especially as they near to pensioning ages and I really dont want their financial stress when we have children bc no doubt it will happen I had a plan of my job role for this year and it was going to allow me to be in a higher position and earn more money However this now is either not going to happen or will be delayed Then I questioned myself do I even want it Or am I doing it to save my family from poverty The problem is that I dont want know what I want to do I went into this career path when I was younger but I regretted it so much Due to stress Ive developed PCOS and Im 2st heavier than my previous baseline Im always tired my husband is always tired and I feel that we dont enjoy life as much bc of all responsibilities and we dont even have children yet Adding children onto this will just cause misery Im sure of it I just dont know what to do Were all trying our best but before being married even in a relationship when I felt stuck I would change my environment and look for things to do I cant do it as much anymore bc its not a me decision anymore its a we decision and although we have plans to move out were saving up and you know what the housing market is like so it will take a while Anyways thanks for reading this if you got to the end heart_hands_medium_skin_tone,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 11:24:13 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j6yegx,i think i ruined the friendship between my sister and her best friend,another long post for context myf18 sister17 and her best friendf15 almost 16 lets call her Dana have been friends for almost a decade theyve always spent a lot of time together because our moms were friends the last few years have been very very rough for Dana and weve always been here for her especially my sister and that made them even closer so today during lunch my sister came to my mom and asked her if she could go out for a party night with Dana and her friend group BUT here in italy there are two stages of the party the first one is open to everyone the second one is only 18 and she wanted to go right to the second one that begins around midnight my mom immediately said no and my sister started whining saying that Dana went there too a few weeks ago and guess how she did that fake ID and some connections and that surely didnt help to have a yes as an answer a few hours ago i was with my sister and Dana just talking until my sister asked my thought about going to that party at that hour and i said honestly i dont approve that not because youre going there but because youre gonna do it illegally and she got angry saying that she wanted to do that experience because shes a teenager and blah blah blah to which i replied yeah youre a teenager and have to do your experiences but you can make them on the first half of the night where you can go without any problem and i think she expected me to be the cool older sister because she got angry and it only got worse when my brother21 also said he agreed with me so she went upstairs and i stayed with Dana so i started talking with her about all this the conversation then went to my sisters general behaviour and we went to my room to talk more liberally after a while we were talking about how she my sister almost never wants to go out unless one of us has weed or cigarettes and stuff like that and thats when i told her something i had forgot last august they both were at home my best friend was there as well and we were all chilling in the backyard when Dana told my sister that she had to go to herDanas place that she promised that but my sister was whining about it saying she didnt feel like it but not giving a reason to break the promise so they came up with a deal Dana would have gone home and my sister would go there about a half hour later so Dana left i stayed with my best friend and my sister who started saying things like i dont wanna go i dont feel like it and i replied other things like why dont you tell her if you stand her up without saying anything ill tell her and she freaked out saying that if i did i would be a bitch and i just rolled my eyes after a while she left and went to her room and i immediately gave my best friend a i know how this will end up look but didnt say anything almost a hour later Dana calls me and says your sister isnt answering my texts and calls where is she i took a deep breath and face palmed mentally before answering shes in her room ill go check on her and so i did i muted myself and went to my sister who was awake and told her Danas on the phone what do i tell her and she replies tell her that im asleep my heart dropped and i didnt know what to do so i just played along unmuted myself and said shes sleeping Dana was so disappointed and told me to wake her up so i started shaking my sister trying to wake her up but she just pretended to fall asleep again and again and i heard Dana say look never mind let her sleep i asked her if she was sure and she said yes and i just said okay then bye love im sorry and hung up i looked at my sister and said a few things like youre an asshole youre a shitty friend so returning to two hours ago i told Dana about it even though i probably shouldnt have but i just thought it was the right thing to do her face dropped and she became visibly sad and disappointed said something like i dont even know what to say i cant think or look at her the same and i felt kind of guilty but still thought that she had the right to know we smoked two cigarettes and she went to sleep saying that she would figure out what to do about all this again shes clearly disappointed and tired of my sister being disrespectful its currently 4am and im sorry for ruining her mood but also scared of my sisters reaction in case she finds out that Dana knows ive already made a post about my sister and her behaviour english is not my first language so sorry for any mistakes andor things like that i just didnt want all this to eat me up,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 03:16:28 UTC,0,3,0.5,,,0,0

1j4eq01,Rant for my Anger Stage of Grief,I still wish he would come back dont get me wrong That hasnt disappeared just yet and I suspect it wont for a little bit I started doing dance classes again and my first couple of classes were hard I hadnt danced in awhile and the emotions were still heavy In fact I went home and bawled in my roommates arms because I was just hit with memories of my favorite routine of chatting with you after class and looking forward to being with you online when I got home But the drive was hard and not quiet since I had a comfort song blasting and me just yelling into the car how much I loved you and what an idiot you are to walk away I had another class just yesterday and I felt incredibly good doing it since it was a familiar choreo I smiled I was proud of myself I laughed with my friends And when I got out I felt angry I was angry because I disliked how you made me feel hurt unseen invalidated and frightened during our breakup Angry that you decided to give up Im not going to try to convince you to stay so okay Ill go Especially since youd do that explosive reaction again with the justification being you had no choice to in order to be heard Ya know my counselor said thats what people who do the abuse in abusive relationships say If only she didnt do trigger then I wouldnt of hitscreamedthrowetc her I know youre not abusive though I know youre flawed and that response is something you can work on if you recognize it to be I wanted to do that with you I wanted to work me On us But no you gave up and walked away And although I know we had good times I now notice a lot more things in our relationship that werent that great Things I wish a partner would do for me The slow roll into complacency How I feel fooled being charmed by you That I tell you how I feel when Im in some mood is not your responsibility to fix and to please let me figure out how to make myself feel better and Ill tell you But no you make yourself take responsibility anyways and feel bad about yourself and frustrated at me when you cant solve it right away What the hell Dont you listen And I tell you my love language is words of affirmation and I barely hear any compliments from you I dont remember the last time you called me beautiful or cute I dont ever remember you telling me you appreciate me unless I ASK or do it first by giving you all my words of praise If youre proud of me or happy Im yours I said those things to you all the time The random I Love Yous because I feel it in that moment Things I brought up Id like to do but it gets overlooked and forgotten and then you get mad at me when I try to remind you and more angry when Im sad you dont remember And how I see you were also not telling me things that made you irritated and let build up but fault me for being the only one who does it I also told you Im scared youd talk to me like you talk to your parents You gave me that wtf face like youd never And yet there you were screaming at me assaulting me with words trying to blame me and all your what about you arguments Also how we agreed to disagree early on in a convo before our fight that giving someone the same energy they give you is a choice and can be potentially hazardous in a relationship Especially during an argument Communication is important but whats the point when you assume your partner is intentionally attacking you when its anything but I shouldve known better I shouldve known when I saw those signs Youre so frustrating How did I deal with all that And you know whats more frustrating ITS ALL SOLVABLE They were things we could work on Things we could put out onto the table talk about our grievances and set out a plan to address them I think at one time I said maybe we should see a Couples counselor to better understand each other but that was swept aside I know I can be frustrating too I know it do things that make you mad But no one deserves to be treated the way you treat me during arguments You once brought out something in me that made me hate myself in an argument All because it was so heightened and just not healthy because I was trying to match your energy I hated it I dont like being so angry Id say things I regret and would hate myself for later along with the fact Im sure it hurts you Why would you want that dynamic Why are you okay with that Its unhealthy How did it feel when I said I felt hurt attacked and frustrated like you but didnt want to scream or escalate things so I cried instead You probably thought I was pathetic And so fine Go find someone else who can match your energy without feeling shitty about themselves and about hurting you Find someone who argues the same way you do and see how disrespectful exhausting and hurtful it is Because thats not what I want,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:35:59 UTC,1,0,0.67,,,0,0

1j5l09y,15 Years in CanadaNow Im Jobless Broke amp Out of Options,After spending 15 years building a life here I never imagined I would end up with nothing forced to start over from zero again I have updated this post to clarify a few things based on feedback I take full responsibility for my situation I made many mistakes along the way whether it was not staying on top of deadlines assuming I had more time than I did or not making the best choices I have struggled with severe ADHD my entire life and since I choose to manage it without medication I often leave things until the last minute That habit has hurt me in more ways than I can count and this situation is no exception At the same time the immigration system has changed significantly over the years making it much harder for someone in my position to qualify In the end it was a mix of bad timing personal missteps and an immigration system that has only grown tougher for people like me I moved to Canada as an international student a little over 15 years ago I started from nothing learning English from scratch completing my academic English education and then going to university and college I worked multiple jobs as a developer while paying my taxes and contributing to the country I wanted to call home Despite all that I lost everything when my work permit expired a few months ago I did not qualify for enough points under the everchanging immigration system so as soon as my permit expired my job was gone Because my work permit expired I was not eligible for unemployment benefits had no options just the expectation to pack up and leave like I never existed The worst part is that this is not just about money or survival I genuinely loved my job I had amazing coworkers a great team and what I believed to be the perfect job in the perfect country I was lucky enough to have made meaningful contributions and had so much more to offer as a 32yearold with a bright future ahead of me That is why I have so many regrets about how things turned out and I know they will stay with me for a lifetime I would give anything to go back and keep doing what I love But because I wanted to do things the right way legally and honorably there just do not seem to be any options left Losing my job did not just mean losing income It meant losing my ability to stay afloat in the country I call home Even when I had a good income I was living paycheck to paycheck covering expenses for two people A large portion of my money went toward taxes rent and paying off debts that piled up after I lost my previous job during the pandemic Now with no work permit not even underthetable cash jobs would be enough to cover my expenses and those would not be legal for me anyway Over the years Canadas immigration system has become increasingly strict The requirements kept changing the point thresholds kept rising and options like employerspecific work permits which could have been a lifeline for people like me were removed in Ontario By the time I finally became eligible or was just about to things had already shifted again I know people who moved to other provinces because obtaining permanent residency was easier there but even that became riskier when some pathways suddenly disappeared Going back to Turkey is not just about starting over It is a nightmare waiting to happen My brother and I are both considered army escapees which means we would be forced into mandatory military service soon after arriving The Turkish army is notorious for its brutal conditions As ethical vegans and atheists we would be in an impossible position The army does not accommodate veganism and being openly atheist is frowned upon both socially and institutionally I know our time there would be unbearable in every way The system does not account for people like me those who have given everything to this country only to be left with no way to stay Is this how the system treats people who dedicate their youth education and labor to this country I do not want to sound ungrateful I have always loved this country and I still do I love its people and I consider Toronto my real home Leaving would feel like losing a part of myself forever But after all these years not having a viable pathway to stay just does not feel fair to me After more than two days without sleep with stress piling up and rent due while I have no income my mind is all over the place while writing this I also recorded myself talking about all of this for about half an hour right before writing this crying the whole time It felt like therapy in a way just letting it all out Now writing this feels like another form of that release I do not know what comes next but I needed to get this off my chest If nothing else I hope sharing my story highlights how the system fails people who follow all the rules and still end up with nothing I truly hope it will somehow help future people like me Thank you for reading I truly appreciate anyone who takes the time to respond with feedback suggestions or criticism,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 11:03:23 UTC,10,50,0.55,,,0,0

1j6tw9e,i impulsively sent a personal letter to a situationshipfriend he told me i should do something with it,hello i hope im not going against any rules by posting this i intially wanted to post this to try and figure out how to turn this personal letter into an artistic creative thing that i can put out into the world but for now its just a letter that is true off my chest this is a letter i have sent a friendlover that is very important to me we have a weird secretive relationship dynamic somewhat of a situationship but much more communicative and relationshipy its weird the letter talks about it a little bit the thing is after he read it he told me that the letter was personal authentic and very beautiful that i should think about maybe doing something with it in the futurecreatively he meant we are both creative people studied creative writing together thats how we met anyways heres the letter keep in mind it is translated as it is originally in a different language Hi this letter contains things that are important to me that you know Every time I initiate a hang out with you to talk about things I end up not saying everything I want to say maybe because I forget or feel better at that moment when Im with you and dont want to create a worse mood for either you or me again dont want to be a burden so I end up not saying anything and end up regretting and getting upset when things dont work out between us So I want to take a moment here and write to you everything I can remember that I usually think and feel about us and hope that with all the recoil you probably get from this letter you can also take a moment of your time and read without too much pressure of responding quickly I want to start by saying that you are a person who is very very important to me I have said it many times and I have no problem saying it again simply because it is true you are the first person that I have ever felt true pure love a feeling that I thought people invent in movies that made me think it was not something that was even possible to feel You made me feel it It is real You know how sentimental and emotional I am it is very easy for me to look at a picture of us from a month ago and feel nostalgic because I miss a specific day that I had a really nice time with you Like for example on your birthday when you invited me to sleep over at your place and told me that I was really cute and that you wanted to kiss me in front of everyone These are things that are hard for me to forget and I hope I never forget because it makes my heart feel good Sometimes I am completely reluctant to mention things like this or talk about it at all because the fact that I talk about it means that in moments like these have a lot of weight It makes me very vulnerable and its scary I prefer not to mention any good moment we had not to say I love you not to say I miss something that happened two days ago and that way if you dont say something nice back I wont be offended by it I wont think its not mutual I wont think Im taking everything too personally and that for you Im just another person to have fun with every now and then even though i know if it was just fun it would have ended a long time ago for you But I choose to say it anyway because I want you to at least know how much good you can do even if you dont mean to I choose to get hurt a little every now and then I think you are very talented You write in a way that is very impulsive for better or worse In the pieces you wrote it is very clear that what you write comes from that moment deep inside and it is not calculated it is simply what is happening in your heart at that second and you bring it out Another talent you have is the way you get to know people Something that I am very jealous of but I feel I am lucky to experience it as a friend and even learn from you You ask bizarre questions that no one thinks to ask go into strange depths and we would sometimes laugh at you at that moment in class because it is really very funny that you ask things that no one thinks are interesting enough but it is a trait that I appreciate very much I think that I will move here in this letter between things that you might be flattered by and things that you have a chance of being offended by It is important for me to point out that it is okay to be offended just as it is okay to be flattered by everything I write but you should know that everything I write is things that I think and feel There are no facts here And there is not even a single intention to hurt If I could I would write this in a letter and bring it to you physically but right now we are after a not very pleasant interaction that was on through messages as there is every now and then between us And right now I am not in the mood to see you because I feel like I will cry and I will not be able to say anything coherent Maybe I am too sensitive and take everything too hard Maybe you love me but dont like me very much and sometimes try to hurt me It could be both Sometimes I feel like you really want to hurt me That you know exactly what combination of words will hurt me the most and you choose them specifically I dont think its bad intentions I think its more of you trying to defend yourself Maybe I say things that I think come out well but they hurt you and then you who feel attacked try to attack back because that way youll have the power and you can hurt and leave Sometimes we encounter a situation of unpleasant messages and at the peak youll say something like youre gonna stop answering me or something more cynicalpassive aggressive to imply to me that youre not going to answer anymore no matter what I say Sometimes Im in a good mood and after a conversation like that with you i get very sad in a restless way like i have to talk it out And when you cut off at the peak of this conversation I have no way to explain anymore no way to resolve no way to do anything All thats left for me is to sit with myself with the feelings I have about myself about how much I may have hurt you with the words I used incorrectly about how much I want you to understand that I dont think such bad things about you And to sit with myself with the feelings I have for you that with how much I love you you are the person who most manages to hurt my most sensitive points Once in a conversation of this style you managed to throw into the air that it would be better if we ended the relationship After that when we met and I mentioned it you said that you said it in the heat of the moment and that you didnt really mean it I think you did mean it just at that moment And then at some point when we managed to talk and get along again you regretted meaning it I think that both of these situations are correct and that they dont necessarily contradict each other Sometimes I really have thoughts like Wow maybe I should really end this relationship Sometimes I feel like the relationship with you is doing me a lot more harm than good Sometimes I feel like you hate me Detest me And maybe you stay in touch with me because its easier than breaking up And maybe thats true sometimes I dont know But I also dont think it necessarily contradicts other good feelings you might have for me sometimes In any case I can understand Theres not a single person in the world that I can say 100 that will never get on my nerves accidentally hurt me get tired of them and I also told you I think that if I spend enough time with anyone at some point Ill want to not be around them On the other hand youre one of the only people I prioritize spending time with And the only person I want to be around even if Im very hurt and were not at our best terms I think something happened the day we started hooking up for the first time That day I went out with you and a friend for a walk in the city we went into your old school the friend stayed outsid we were left with just you with the stories and experiences you had there with all the nostalgia from there and I was there and listened to you and I really enjoyed experiencing something sentimental with you A big part of your life you spent there and then I was there with you and somehow managed to be a small part of all of it of you Later that day after we hooked up when you walked me to the train and we were both very nervous because we had arranged to meet the next day but we were both afraid that suddenly we wouldnt want to meet again when the time came Because we both had that similar problem that weird avoidant way of dealing with life And then the next day came we still wanted to and it happened and it didnt exactly stop for a very long time Usually when I want someone as soon as they show interest in me back I stop wanting them It didnt happen with you You shared your flaws with me and not only did I identify with a lot of them but it only drew me in more I really fell in love with a person and not just an idea I think thats why its so easy for me to get hurt by you I love you very much The whole person that you are Im very attracted to you Physically emotionally mentally In just about every way What you think of me how you think of me is very important to me I really care about you and your opinions Sometimes you say things about me that you think Im not intelligent or things like that I say very directly that these are things that hurt me Insult me You take it more lightly and with a laugh and with a certain detachment towards me and how I feel I think you might have the feeling that youre above me in all sorts of ways That you have more power over certain things That your opinions are more important or true than mine And that facts are perhaps more important or true than my feelings Sometimes you are the most sensitive person in the world looking for a hug love intimacy making me laugh when Im not feeling well And sometimes you treat me as if you are a person who doesnt know how to be a friend That you have no ability to understand or contain my difficulty my feelings I think a lot of it is also my fault Every time I told you that you were crossing a certain line thats all it was I tell you that youre crossing a line And thats it there were no consequences beyond that I say my piece carry on as usual as always and then it repeats itself Again things are said again Im offended again I dont want to talk to you again in my life and then I come back to you the second theres a chance because I want you in my life Its like Im giving up a lot of myself so that I can feel good sometimes with you Ill say something now that if it wasnt clear before it can be very recoiling and disgusting to hear at least for me My relationship with you and you in general is very addictive to me Im addicted to you You feel like a drug to me and I cant find a better or worse way to say it thats how it feels to me When Im with you and everything is good everything is the best in the world When its bad its very bad there was another time at some day I was at your place I think a few days after we agreed not to sleep together anymore of course we met and slept together because how could we not There was one moment you put your head on my chest as if I were a pillow we just sat like that in bed for an hour cuddling calm comfortable quiet pleasant Why do I get so hung up on these moments Its like if Im not bipolar enough on my own theres another layer of bipolarity in our relationship I remember especially at the beginning of this relationship when I was at your place and I felt so nice and comfortable I didnt want it to end simply because it was the peak of the day for me The moment I had to go home just being on the drive back home alone sleeping alone suddenly that was the lowest point of my life Ive slept alone my whole life Why does it feel so heavy now Its like craving you helped me survive a little longer every time And this is the most unhealthy thing Ive ever experienced and the most disgusting thing Ive ever said Its embarrassing to admit it at all especially when Im sure its not mutual For a very long time I was emotionally dependent on you like if you were in a good mood it would be great for me but if you were feeling bad and would withdraw from the world I could easily take it personally Because when Im in a bad mood I still want to be near you I still want to talk to you And its disgusting to me Why is it different only with you Why am I not interested in sleeping with anyone except you Why did I think for years that I wasnt interested in sex at all and that I could easily live without it and then after I met you I became a nymphomaniac Why can I just say bye to people and leave without a hug but with you this intimacy is so important to me I dont even have one answer really I have no idea why its like this On the one hand I think if I kept my distance from you I would get used to being without you it would have been hard at first but little by little I would stop wanting anything like this with you and then maybe I would be able to quit you On the other hand Youre funny You love Why would I keep my distance just because its a little hard sometimes Im in these dilemmas every now and then But I really dont want to lose touch with you Sometimes I think you dont see or appreciate things I do for you take me for granted Why not actually you said so yourself no matter when you text me I will answer if you need a favor i will do it if you want me to come to you and be with you there will never be a situation in life where I will say no I havent given you a single reason to make you think that Im not simply there whenever you need or want So maybe its my fault Maybe Im too accessible not enough hard to get and its too convenient its easy to take it for granted I dont know Maybe youll read all of this and think Im a psycho Tell me that you think it would be best and most worthwhile to end the relationship and Ill understand from that that you dont want anything to do with me and Ill be offended and well never talk again and all that this relationship will be is some cute memories from time to time that are accompanied by a bad taste from how it ended Maybe youll read all of this and say nothing pretend you never got it maybe youll even see that you got this letter tell yourself wow this is really long Ill get to it someday and forget about ever getting to it Maybe youll read this and tell me what you think and feel too Share your side Tell me that everything is okay its okay what I feel its okay that Im an addicted psycho and that Im too important to you to lose touch with me over stupid things that can be solved in an instant with a little communication and the right mood I dont know what youll choose but everything is legitimate and Ill understand in the end even if not at that moment I love you I would be happy to talk whenever there is a problem I just want us to really be able to talk I am not here to apologize and I do not demand any forgiveness from you Whatever happened was Do you want us to stay in touch I would be very happy Just please try to pay attention appreciate me respect boundaries If situations arise where you feel that I am attacking you that I am unpleasant that I am unbearable that I am repulsive inconsiderate offensive tell me Lets talk about it It doesnt have to be at that moment when you are at your wits end you can do it at any moment but lets try to communicate more healthily and hug after that and be good please i love you id like to know your thoughts about this if it made anyone feel anything or anythig like that after he read this letter he has said that relates understand and he was the one to tell me to maybe do something creative about it in the future i never even thought about it until he sais it as it was a very personal thing that was meant for his eyes only thanks for reading,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 23:21:26

1j7mx83,Witnessed a personal tragedy today I feel really bad for her,Her husband died today She had been faithfully taking care of him for a while now His body was lying in the middle of their small stuffy overheated living room She had been doing cpr on him following the 911 operators instructions Hed been sick for a long time Agent Orange lung cancer from his time in Vietnam Even so she was not prepared for his passing in any way Shes one of those women that is unable to function on her own She always depended on her husband to tell her what to do While we were waiting on the coroner to arrive several of us were in the crowded living room trying to comfort the new widow The conversation drifted through various death and healthrelated subjects all of it floating past the dead person on the floor like he wasnt even there and he really wasnt There was no sense of a person under that white sheet Their two small dogs both gave off a sense of a soul that awareness of being just like the living people in the room did That personshaped lump under the sheet could have been rolled up bedclothes for all the awareness it gave off He his soul his essence the thing that made him him was no longer there It really brought home to me that the physical body is not really the person Its just what people see Its the soul the part of a person you cant see that makes you you A family friend came to take her and her two little dogs to his house Shes lost grieving and woefully unprepared now adrift without her longtime safe harbor Shes in her late 70s I doubt if shell live there in that house alone Shell probably sell the place I wonder if she will forever see her husband lying on that tiny living room floor first as she was desperately doing cpr on him and then as the EMTs draped that white sheet over him covering his face Hes gone now everyone told her Hes not suffering anymore And he did suffer for years always struggling to get enough air into his lungs even while breathing pure oxygen So its her and the two little dogs now Her family friend will have to emotionally carry her through the next days and weeks of the funeral Social Security VA death certificates all the financial insurance and vehicle paperwork they failed to set up ahead of time in order to avoid just such a situation as this I guess it can be understood that one or both of them just couldnt bear to think about the end for him even though it was staring them squarely in the face It IS an awfully hard thing to think about and accept She did all she could to care for him knowing how it would eventually end while desperately denying it Now shes broken I dont think with her dependent personality that she will ever fully recover I truly hope though moving forward that she invests as much care and loving into herself as she did her husband She has severely neglected herself her health appearance everything in favor of caring for him I hope she realizes its her turn now to care for and love herself Life goes on That fact may be the hardest part of any of this for her,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 01:10:18 UTC,597,31,0.97,,,0,0
1j31y7l,Grindr broke my brain and its affecting my relationship,So I 20M and my boyfriend 32M have been in a relationship for about a year Before I started dating him I was very active on Grindr and had multiple hookups Just to give you some context I really think my boyfriend is an attractive man and he is very sweet and kind to me Yes we do have a big age gap which I initially liked because Ive always been into older men but now I feel kind of insecure about it since he already works has his own apartment and can do whatever he wants while Im in college living with my parents But thats not the problem Recently Ive been feeling very turned off by him Its not that the sex isnt good but I really miss going out with different guys and I dont know why I mean I still think hes attractive but I kind of want to sleep around again even though I felt very empty when I did that before Its also been almost two months since we last had sex I study medicine and dont have much time to see himwe usually only see each other on Sundaysso its not like Id have time to go on multiple dates or anything again But I think the issue is that our relationship has reached that phase where the initial spark has faded a little Sometimes when Im at the gym I catch myself looking around at other guys My TikTok and Instagram feeds are basically just shirtless men and I still follow some of the guys I used to flirt with so their stories catch my attention At the same time while part of me wants to break up and go back to Grindr I also really like him and I know he really likes me This is my first real and longest relationship so I dont know if what Im feeling is normal And even if it is normal what should I do Id really appreciate some advice and Im happy to answer any questions you might have,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 03:51:00 UTC,0,5,0.42,,,0,0

1j3dijb,My dad that mlested me growing up isnt my dad,Forgive my formatting Im on mobile Do not share my story anywhere TW Death Incest Pdophilia I dont honestly know where to start so I guess the beginning is where Ill go When I was very young my dad began molesting me from what I can remember I was around 3 or 4 I have three younger sisters that I grew up with and he molested them too as they got older but it was mostly me that got the brunt of it Last year my mom passed away of a stroke It was a very complicated time for me because although my abuser was arrested for what he did my mom had convinced my sisters and I to drop the charges right before she had passed away She would say awful manipulative things like You dont want your dad to die in prison do you to guilt us into dropping the charges She then proceeded to invite this man back into our lives by moving him back into the house we all shared at the time and my discomfort was ignored and brushed under the rug When my mom passed my dad went crazy and forced me out of the house My mom was a buffer between everyone and with her gone I didnt feel comfortable at the house at all and I had my boyfriend stay in my room with me because I felt safer that way Cue raging dad cussing me out for inviting another man over and threatening to call the cops and having him trespassed all crazy erratic shit I didnt understand So I moved in with my boyfriend yay All that drama didnt even end up mattering though because dad remarried and moved to a new state just 3 months after my moms passing Currently all my sisters are still living in that house together Now heres the fun part Im the eldest Growing up I was always told that my parents got married at the courthouse and had me before they officially hosted the wedding I was born in 99 and the timeline I was told was Met online in 97 Courthouse wedding in 98 I was born in 99 Wedding I was pictured in took place in 2000 I always knew I was in their wedding pictures and I never questioned what they told me they said the ceremony was delayed until my grandma could get back from doing government work overseas It all made sense to me growing up I never questioned it but it was all a lie So this weekend was a the year anniversary of my mothers death and I decided to get dinner with my sisters Were having a good time and everything but I forgot my jacket and my boyfriend stopped by the restaurant to bring it to me I get back to the table and my sisters got all quiet and said Hey weve got some news for you and its really heavy Long story short this man that Ive thought was my dad my whole life is NOT my biological father My sisters have been going through all of our moms things over the last year and kept coming across weird pictures and documents relating to me that didnt line up with what wed been told I wouldve thought they were trolling me if it werent for the fact theyd confirmed everything with my aunt my moms younger sister Who I just found out yesterday didnt know that I didnt know because my mom was not only lying to my siblings and I about it but lying to my aunt and all of our extended family too saying my siblings and I already knew Im going to visit my aunt in a couple of days to sit down and talk all of this out get the real scoop on my life because my whole worldview has been shattered On one hand Im grateful I was finally told but I turn 26 this month and thats an insane age to learn your dad isnt even your dad Not to mention what a horrible dad he was I feel this information to be both heartbreaking and freeing Im not related to this monster If I have kids I wont be passing along his DNA and thats comforting to me I dont want to make my half sisters feel bad for being related to him but I cant help feeling like this Ive always told myself I wouldnt have kids because this guy doesnt deserve his DNA being passed on and now I find out I have none of it This information was a gift to me On the other hand Im angrier at my mom than Ive ever been I mourned her death so severely I suffered because I felt so guilty that our relationship was so tumultuous in life And yet we never could have had an honest relationship because I now know she was never honest with me About almost anything I feel so much better and at peace knowing that it really and truly was my mothers fault that our relationship was so rocky How can you have an honest relationship with anyone that could lie about something so big Not to mention the fact that she was so manipulative and greedy doing everything she did just to invite this evil man back into our lives just because its what she wanted for herself to retire on his dime None of this is on me anymore and I feel so much lighter And before anyone asks yes a DNA test is in my future and Im starting therapy again soon I have no idea if my dad is even alive or still out there but Im going to find out Im not sure how to end this but let me just say this has been the craziest year of my life by far and Im glad I dont have to interact with either of my parents anymore or feel guilty about how I handled things when my mom was

1j4ido9,I hate women approaching me,I 19M hate women approaching me Throughout my life I was considered to be ugly I was told by multiple people and girls would treat me like dirt and constantly remind me Im ugly throughout my life Over the past 2 years I made a decision after being insulted brutally on a friend app called Wizz more like a dating app I was really skinny and hence I decided to eat more and bulk up to gain some muscle mass as well as starting skincare and hopping on minoxidil for better hair quality for my facial hair scalp hair and eyebrows too along with multiple other changes Anyway these 2 years increased my looks considerably to the point where I almost looked like a different human being During this however my self esteem was still incredibly low For the past few months I noticed a girl that was constantly staring at me and I first thought oh she must think Im ugly hence shes staring Later on she started laughing with her friend group while looking at me so I thought wow she must think Im extremely ugly This was not new to me More recently she added me over Snapchat which she got from a friend of mine as Ive found out recently and she had a little conversation with me Ill call her J J sent a snap of herself and told me she had seen me around and that she really liked me This however triggered me and I remembered the treatment I had received up until now especially the treatment on Wizz In that moment I snapped and insulted the mole on her cheek as well as her forehead and told her Id have to be blind or in a coma for her to ever have a chance with me This was quite recent More recently Ive had a female cashier give me a discount on some shopping I was doing to make a milk cake because Im handsome It honestly disgusted me and I genuinely just left the shop without any of the ingredients It hasnt been long since Ive become apparently attractive and Im getting a whole lot more attention from girls and I hate it Fuck these girls They treated me like shit for all these years when I was ugly and now they think they have a chance when Im attractive Makes me want to punch them all in the face I notice a lot of little changes in my daily interactions even with my family Its revolting,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 00:14:36 UTC,0,86,0.21,,,0,0

1j6xt9p,i 19F at the time was kidnapped and raped by a siblings friend 32M and now hes trying to come back into my life,im going to try keep details to a minimum as i dont want anyone to recognise me from this post so identifying details like genders names ect will be changed i would also like to note that i do suffer from a form of neurodivergence that can make me incredibly naive at times in the few months preceding this kidnapper event i had a partner who i suffered quite a traumatic miscarriage with he ended up cutting me off the day i was in the hospital it was terrifying and incredibly lonely at the time a sibling of mine whom i live with had been having some friends over often and naturally i started getting to know them and would hang out with their friends too this was something i did often as i was struggling heavily with the grief of losing both my pregnancy and essentially being broken up with and left to think about it alone After hanging out with my siblings friends for a few weeks Taylor M32 started giving me gifts I have quite an interest in sterling silver religious jewellery and he had given me a few pieces during this time of us hanging out a silver chain with a saint pendant a very dainty 14k gold bracelet another small silver bracelet I thought nothing of it its quite common amongst us here to exchange gifts often among friends and family so i didnt see it as anything more than that as i myself have given people fine jewellery randomly before One day he asked me if i wanted to go to his home to see his pets and just chill and do some art I agreed as he had some very unique reptiles which i was curious to see After getting to his house it was then that things took a really bad turn He sexually assaulted me on several occasions I was not allowed to leave the house unless he was supervising me and it would only be to his garden that i could go I was also not allowed to wear any clothes in his home he would take them from me under the guise of washing them and not return them unless he wanted me to go outside with him He allowed me to return to my own home on two occasions however he was present the entire time and would not let me out of his sight and would regularly complain about how we needed to leave back to his home He would regularly belittle my appearance try to convince me that i would have to laser remove all of my tattoos as they looked disgusting he told me that my earrings were disgusting and masculine and how he couldnt believe anyone would ever have had sex with me because of how gross they were He would force me to stand on weighing scales when i didnt want to so he could know my weight and then proclaim to me that well have to fix that I know that people will probably wonder where were my parents in this situation and the reality is that they were on vacation They left the family home for multiple months at a time and whenever my mother would call me he would answer the phone on my behalf and tell her how i was happy and i was okay and convinced her that i was his girlfriend even though i was being held against my will and assaulted in his home I asked on several occasions to go back home and he would tell me maybe next week and next week would just never come and even then i had no clothes so i simply couldnt leave i managed to escape because i had a large concert planned and after arguing with him for days he finally let me leave so i could go to the concert as soon as i got home i messaged him and told him never to speak to me again or i would be calling the police for a few weeks after this he harassed me on different platforms he posted pictures of me he had taken against my will on social media saying for people to look at his girlfriend he would change his profile pictures to pictures of me or would make profiles in my name in the end i ended up blocking him and changing all of my social handles that brings us to now its been about 10 months since this happened i did not go to the police as i did not want to have to relive what happened to me he also told me many stories of violence he had committed against women who had called the police on him in the past we also had no text conversations at all prior to me being harassed by him amp i truly just believe the case would get thrown out i have had a reoccurring nightmare about him breaking into my house killing me almost every night for the past few weeks i confessed this to my sibling who introduced me to him and was told that he had been trying to contact my sibling he was claiming to have purchased gifts for them and sending them photos of the gifts he had bought and how much he had paid and that this had been happening for weeks and my sibling had been simply ignoring his messages i feel sick why would he do this why would he want to come back into my life after the terror he put me through he told me on several occasions that he in his own words felt like he was the predator and that i was the prey and it was his natural instinct to hunt me down he also told me how he had only been coming to hang out at my house because he had been fantasising about me i dont know what to do in this situation all i know is that im scared and i feel like i have no one to tell who can truly understand my story or my fears of him trying to pry his way back into my life and into my home,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 02:43:48 UTC,1,6,0.67,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0
1j88jdy,i feel like I dont have a right to be upset but I am,So a bit of background information which is needed for this all to make sense My first proper relationship was when I 17F was 13 with a boy the same age as me and for this to make sense in my head Ill make a fake name Leon Leon and I started dating the week before I turned 14 and had been intimate within a month baring in mind this was my FIRST relationship and probably his 10th Within 3 months of us dating he was cheating on me with other girls and it wasnt just like 14 year old cheating it was like sending intimate pictures of himself to these girls Obviously me being like head over heels first relationship I was easily influenced into thinking that this was okay We were so toxic and my mental health got so low I wasnt allowed to leave the house he would break up with me when I went to my friends house who was a girl and I am straight he would pressure me into doing things I didnt want to do I obviously thought this was all part of relationships as my parents live together and barely speak to eachother so Ive never really experienced what normal love is like We dated for a bit over a year and this was a constant When we finally broke up he was straight to another girl Obviously being a heart broken 15 year old I was going out with my friends to get over this I went to meet my friend and ended up at her friends house who were boys I posted a photo of us on BeRealface_with_tears_of_joy and he sent me threats saying he will leak personal photos of me and then got these girls who he knew I was TERRIFIED of as they used to bully me to make me never want to go to school again with my anxiety and stress at such a high I did stop going to school and only went in every now and again and to take my GCSEs During that 2 years we had been on and off getting back together would be intimate would message for months saying how much we missed and loved eachother then he would get with another girl and then come back everytime it didnt work with her For the last couple of months of school I became super close with this group of girls fake names Grace Mary Laura Laura I have known since I was born like we were basically sisters Would go on holiday together we like did everything together and we had finally become close again Mary I was so close to like we got close so quickly and were inseparable Then Grace we were also really close and we had so much fun with eachother and we knew the ins and out about eachother that we wouldnt tell the other girls I would tell her things about my ex and about how much I wished I could get back with him because of how much I loved him and shed always listen in full confidence and we would trust eachother with everything Literally 2 days before prom they had this party that I wasnt invited to but my ex was Obviously I was upset but it wasnt them that planned it so it wasnt their fault We were getting our nails done for prom and they then were talking all party like what they were going to wear where theyre spending the night and that obviously upset me and hurt as they were doing it so blatantly in my face because I wasnt going bearing in mind I still wasnt at school full time so they could easily talk about it when I wasnt there That night I ended up in hospital and not one of them checked up on me they werent at the party it was the day before but my ex did which obviously made me feel AWFUL as he does not care that much about me The next day they went to the party blah blah and then it was prom We went together and had a good time until the after party when one of our mutuals told me he was hammered that they were talking about how I was faking being in hospital and that I was basically just an attention seeking wh0re Obviously I have literal documents and stuff of all the medication and treatment I had to have that night so I was not faking and if I was doing it for attention I wouldve done it so blantantly to make them feel bad and I never even mentioned it to them I left it and then 2 days later we went on a leavers trip to a theme park all was fine again and I had an amazing time until the bus ride home when they didnt save a seat for me we were an inside group of 4 but had a larger girl group of about 10 so I had to sit by myself They then were shouting about planning anotjer party but the main girl saying it was Laura I just sat back and let them do this hoping they would invite me but that never happened I looked like a fool 2 days later the party was going to happen and it was in a heatwave and we have a lake about 45 mins away from where I lived and we all planned to go together I called Mary and I told her how the girls who bullied me was going to be there and she reassured me that everything was going to be fine My grandma had to drive me to the lake and I was waiting for the girls and when they got there I messaged Mary and Laura asking to meet them and then they just flat out left me I was stranded in this town with people who hated me My grandma had left and I was just sat balling my eyes out and I was so embarrassed I just blocked them all and got picked up luckily The minute I blocked them I was so happy I literally did not care at all that I had no friends anymore I started working at the local primary and fell in love with it My life has been on such a high since June 2024 But I found out yesterday again being no contact with them all including my ex since June and hearing nothing about them Grace is dating Leon I really just dont know how to feel Ive been so happy recently and for the whole of the day I just havent been able to feel anything Working today was the first time I just wished I wasnt there and I just wanted to curl up in a ball and cry Im not sad about it but it just feels like a bit of a kick My family are just telling me to be the bigger person and I am but it almost feels like Im not allowed to be upset about it I just dont know how to feel rn and any advice would be so so appreciated I just feel a bit lost and now I dont know what Im supposed to do The thought of them together makes me feel ill and I know in a couple months Im going to have to see them at this local festival I work at and Im terrified because I know it will just upset me and I wont have work to distract me as it will be during the summer holidays Please let me know

1j4e57g,Hooked up with moms friend,tldr My moms friend helped me through a tough time and get into college We got really close and weve been hooking up since No one knows She worked with my mom They grew close over the years and became even closer the summer before I left for college because my parents were going through a nasty divorce She threw me a birthday party when my parents were too busy fighting in court to remember She made a big effort to be there for my mom and by proxy she was also there for me We grew close because she would bring over dinner and eat with me drive me places pick me up and bring me home and even helped me with school My mom picked up another job to help pay for the divorce lawyer so she was gone a lot She helped me prepare for my college interviews wrote me references and connected me with people she knew Most nights shed feed me dinner clean up and make sure I was home instead of out partying then lock up our house and sometimes sleep there on the couch or my moms bed until my mom got home I always was attracted to her since she was younger than my mom but still had that fit work out milf type of look I would check her out often and even use her as the focal point of my masturbation It got to the point where I snuck into her laundry basket a few times to check out her used lingerie We grew closer and talked about sex It started from her giving me advice on navigating the dating world and a girls perspective I felt comfortable with her helping me figure out these social situations since she is young and attractive I just figured she understood I complained about girls friends anxiety She was a great listener and I would love receiving comforting hugs from her I would always get aroused from talking with her about things One night when we hugged she felt my hard arousal accidentally press up against her but nothing happened My fantasy was just that a fantasy until I went to college My parents were still dragging the divorce out so she graciously helped me shop pack and even dropped me off It was only 45 mins away from home I wanted to go further away but Im just lucky to even get into college with all the stress Her texts were often and short so it wasnt unusual for us to be casual with each other One night I got really drunk and texted her pretty late thinking she wouldnt get it until later in the morning I mentioned how I thought about her during random hook ups or masturbation Well to my surprise she replied and we engaged in a little back and forth This happened a few times over the course of my first semester and I did try to push the flirting boundaries when we talked about intimate things It usually started with reminders for me to practice safe sex and then lead to talking about sex in general I could tell she was really careful about being intimate with me A few times it slipped into flirty territory There was a blizzard as everyone was leaving for winter break I could have taken the train but I texted her that I didnt have a ride home because I wanted to spend time with her It was late and the storm was pretty bad by the time she dropped me off She insisted that shed come in and make me dinner At some point a bottle of wine was consumed She mentioned that my mom was working until 10pm that night so she stayed up with me to watch a movie We ended up talking about all the things that happened that semester and I admitted to her her my lack of confidence with girls I joked that if only I could get some practice in real life instead of watching porn I could find the clit Well one thing led to another and we spent a lot of break together Since coming back to school shes been driving here and getting a hotel for us once a week Im afraid that I wont like girls my age anymore after this and that shes making it so fun and easy that Im not making an effort to meet girls my age Not really sure what to do but needed to get this off my chest Its just nice having someone to have sex with so easily instead of putting in effort to flirt play games go out drinking and risking being with a random girl,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:13:00 UTC,0,2,0.33,,,0,0

1j4f39s,Is my relationship doomed,I 25M have been with my gf 26F for 3 months now and I dont know if Im overthinking this and self sabotaging my relationship or if there are larger issues As I mentioned in another post weve disagreed about washing rice before and someone gave me some solid advice about how to talk to her about it I felt we had a positive and productive conversation but it all started because she got mad that I washed the rice for a certain dish Shes also recently got upset with me over a project she asked me to tackle just assembling a lamp we bought at the store I made the mistake of trying to screw in a screw that had a defect and got stuck She wasnt screaming or anything but she was upset that I tried to use it anyway I got it out and replaced it and the lamp turned out well She has childhood trauma to do with strict parents who would severely punish her if she didnt do things the exact way they wanted and so I think she gets stressed when something isnt going to plan I feel like an idiot when these sort of things happen Theyre such simple mistakes easily avoided and yet I make them Shes also been stressed with her kitten that still needs to get spayed shes been in heat alot and she yells at the cat when she wont be quiet I think this isnt right and have tried gently mentioning that her cat is just doing what cats do and she needs to try and ignore her I made a larger mistake the other day when I asked to try her THC vape She said that beginners should always be in a safe place and try to relax I asked in jest do I feel safe here And she asked the same I thought about it a bit and promptly got distracted by other thoughts I have ADHD and sometimes this sort of thing happens Im still ashamed of it because when I realized I trailed off and said I do feel safe here She made a a comment stating That took a long time for you to figure out I didnt respond I knew I got distracted and I started silently panicking thinking I do feel safe here but nothing I say now will convince her I wouldnt have tried the THC if I didnt I wouldnt leave my knife at home if I didnt I wouldnt be with her if I didnt but I gave some lame excuse about thinking too deeply about it and tried to laugh it off I feel like an idiot She makes me happy Shes important to me Im worried that her trauma will drive us apart I dont know what to do to work through this,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:51:13 UTC,0,3,0.33,,,0,0

1j5o8uu,I broke up with my girlfriend of almost four years and I regret it,Its almost been a year and I made a mistakeIn June I broke up with my girlfriend of almost four years because we were going away for college and we were both going out of state on opposite sides of the country I thought it would be the best thing for us but its been the opposite I really hurt her when we broke up The first few days I thought this was going to be the best thing for me and I just tried to push her out of my mind as much as I could but I just kept feeling like an asshole She loved me so much and I took it for granted She would do things for me all the time just because and never expect anything in return She would constantly put me ahead of her and also just loved me no matter what I was going through I couldnt stop thinking about her and during my first week of college I was so excited about what was going on in my life and I wanted nothing more than to just text her and let her know what was going on It bothered me that in the almost 3 months we had been broken up at that point she never once reached out to me I wanted to know how college was going for her I wanted to know how she was doing How could the girl who I once had this amazing love with not try to reach out to me once I texted her letting her know that I had been thinking about her and that I hoped she was doing well She kept things super brief and said she hoped I was doing well but I wanted to talk to her so much more so I poked about what she had been doing and in two months she had done so much and she was going to this great huge school and was doing all of this without me I know I shouldve been happy for her but it just made me sad and angry We didnt talk for a month after that until she sent me a picture of a tattoo she had gotten I was so excited that she finally reached out to me This was the first time since we had broken up that she initiated the conversation We talked for a little bit and it felt so great We fell back into conversation like back when we were dating It felt so good to talk to her again but at the same time it made me feel sick that I knew so little about what was going on in her life now and I was only hearing so little about it I sent her a text telling her how happy I was for her and how what shes doing seems like such a great experience for her and she never responded That hurt a lot I looked at her TikTok and Instagram for the first time in months and I just wanted to throw up She is living this whole life without me She looks happy and most of all beautiful Like how dare she be so beautiful and smile at people with smiles that were once mine I would go to her Spotify and I would be so paranoid that one of those playlists was dedicated to someone that wasnt me I felt so selfish and angry and mad at the world and at myself I had to push her out of my mind so I started seeing someone I wasnt even really interested in them Lookswise they were nothing compared to my exgirlfriend Their personality was so dull and boring compared to my ex and in the end I ended up just feeling like this huge dick for stringing someone along for months just to get over my exgirlfriend I went home for my Christmas break from my college and it got even worse Knowing that we were in the same town and just a drive away from each others houses made me feel insane I got so nervous that I was going to run into her any time I left the house I thought about going Christmas shopping in the mall she worked at so I could accidentally run into her and then would just get sad because I was becoming this huge creep I wanted to text her every day asking if she wanted to get coffee and I never did because nothing would hurt more than knowing she didnt want to see me I texted her Merry Christmas and she was nice about it but she didnt want to talk to me anymore after that And then I saw she went back to her college before me and it was painful seeing her with all her friends having so much fun and having so much fun without me Seeing her cozied up with a girl on her Instagram makes me feel like Im going to throw up I see them post together all the time and I just want to know if theyre dating How could she date someone so soon after 3 almost 4 years How could she be so brazen and post her and that girl getting coffee and going on dates together Does she not think Ill see it I think I would feel worse if it was a man The thought of some man looking at her the way I used to and touching her and being intimate with her makes me angry and sad and violent all at the same time I would stalk her pages all day while I was still in our hometown waiting for her to post something and getting nervous when she would How could she be having so much fun and be so happy all without me We were each others first love first kiss first everything And now I dont know if shes doing that with other people Things got a little bit better when I went back for my second semester of college but I still just cant get her out of my mind Im starting to see another girl now to try and get over my ex and shes again nothing like my exgirlfriend and I dont think there will ever be anyone like herWhen I first broke up with her I didnt think it would hurt this much I guess in the back of my mind I thought she wouldve fought for us I thought she wouldve texted me more when we were broken up I thought she and I honestly wouldve gotten back together at this point Im so insanely in love with her still and I brought this on myself but I thought I was doing whats best for the both of us I guess I didnt appreciate or realize the things that she did for me while we were together,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 13:50:08 UTC,0,16,0.41,,,0,0

1j4t1hf,I am probably the 100th survivor of a serial predator,Throwaway account for obvious reasons his initial is changed for safety and Ill try not to include too many specific details but this is a long one Here goes I started dating D after meeting at a bar and things were amazing at first as they usually are with narcissistic abusers After a short period his mask started to slip He would sext me about his far out fantasies some weird but benign others dark and twisted Sometimes I said no but often I played along because some of the things he was suggesting I was fine experimenting with or could see myself potentially liking And he was crazy hot and the most charming person Id ever met And I knew he had been a player but I didnt mind So had I so it felt like a good match I was falling in love with him and he so he said with me We became official and things immediately took a turn for the worse The first night he beat me up and raped me I was on psychedelics that he encouraged me to take and he convinced me afterwards that I had consented to the whole thing That it was BDSM That anything I didnt like was fine but wasnt his fault Mind you BDSM requires specific lucid ongoing and enthusiastic consent and a safeword which we did not have I think my brain chemistry was permanently changed that night because I sobbed in his arms and allowed myself to believe him The gaslighting heavy swings between silent treatment and intense attention casual cruelty in our conversations and lovebombing increased from there Later on D coerced me into group sex within which I was sexually assaulted by a stranger multiple times at his direction before he assaulted me damaged property and ran before the police were called He convinced me again that he thought I had consented to everything He masterfully gaslit and lied and manipulated me and my memories felt untrustworthy He convinced me I was going to ruin his life if I pressed charges Under the trauma bond that had formed that I mistook for love he convinced me to rescind my statement to the police And we made up The last time I saw him was the worst night of my life and the last time he raped me I had been drinking all night at his direction and once we started he did not stop Not when I was choking and struggling under him not when I was crying and begging him to stop not when I went limp not when I had lost a pint of blood not when I passed out I am lucky to be alive But in the morning the trauma had taken most of my memories I pretended I was okay but he knew what he had done When I realized I had to seek medical attention the next day he told me I was overreacting and ignored my pleas for aftercare I begged him for compassion and promised hed done nothing wrong but he refused As the days passed my memories started to return As they did I started to try to hold him accountable But as Im sure many of you know narcissism does not allow for accountability Every attempt of mine to break up with him was foiled until he finally decided to break up with me My horrific memories continued to return to me and so I went to the police Anyone want to guess how that went When they closed my case citing insufficient evidence I was devastated But I felt more than anything that I needed to warn the next woman I posted my experience anonymously and a woman came forward that he had drugged and SAd years prior More secondhand stories started coming out of the woodwork So I posted him again My case was closed but my experience was real and I realized people needed to know he was going to do it again and had probably done it before Yeah not probably Definitely Dozens of women in a weekend in my extended circle of mutuals and more outside of that started sharing their experiences of abuse at Ds hand Everything vile under the sunsexual harassment druggings assault blackmail theft manipulation coercion violence and rape Over MANY years D is a true serial rapist abuser and predator His disarming charm and looks and fake feminism and subsequent manipulation and gaslighting had not just worked on me but friends and roommates and coworkers and romantic partners It has been overwhelming and heartbreaking and sickening But when I went to the cops I thought I was alone When I shared my experience I thought I was alone And now I know Im the farthest thing from alone And you bet litigation and a reopened case are incoming But Im writing this post because I learned tonight about some of the things he did to another exgirlfriend Worse than he did to me worse than you can imagine For a lot longer My body has been shaking non stop and I am livid after seeing photo evidence and hearing her story Every time I think this whole situation cant get worse it does I am so beyond angry at him I am so disgusted with myself that I allowed him into my bed and into my lifethat I stayed after he showed me his true colors My belief system is so deeply rocked to my core that a human being can be this consistently evil and on top of that not get caught for a decade I am terrified that he is going to come after me for exposing him to the larger community And I am furious at all of the people around him who had to have enabled his horrific behavior His family members who know of his history of abusing women his male friends who listened to female friends try to share their experiences and brushed them off or gaslit them His roommates who participated in or witnessed his crimes and kept quiet The fucking POLICE who have done nothing to keep my city safe from this man or take my reports seriously or compassionately despite him having multiple prior arrests and restraining orders against him And most of all heartbroken at all the women before me who felt so alone and like they couldnt come forward And I feel guilty that Im just a little bit angry at all of them too because I wish just one of them had felt like I did that I had to stop this from happening to the next girl Because I was the next girl And Im forever changed I dont know where to go from here other than to a courtroom but so much work lies ahead of me Of us Im in therapy and taking each day as it comes Several of the other survivors whove had years to heal are standing behind me and helping holding the pieces together but its hard And after what I heard today I feel broken But Im also spiritually wound tighter than I ever have been Maybe the universe somehow connected us to give him one last chance to learn empathy and be a good person and partner and give me one last chance to step away from men who disrespect my boundaries the first time And we both failed But the result of those failures is broken cyclesI will never let a man disrespect me again for the rest of my life and D will not be able to continue his pattern of abuse Perhaps our paths crossed for me to be my own savior whilst being his undoing All I know for sure is that I am not fucking alone anymore None of us are alone anymore And Im hopeful that our power in numbers will deliver him the consequences he deserves Thank you for reading Please MEN and women and everyone in between believe women when they come forward Believe them the first time This incredibly fucked up situation should never ever happen again And to survivors everywhere you are not alone,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 11:03:57

1j73e1b,I killed my dog and its been haunting me for a long time now,A bit of backstory I used to live in the countryside with an older relative and she had a habit of acquiring pets she was unable and unwilling to take care of eventually we ended up with four dogs two small and two large The problem is that every time we would open the front gate to take the car out the dogs would run out into the brush and potentially put themselves in danger so wed lock them in a tiny cage for a few minutes while we drove out and then come back in and let them out into the yard The two large dogs started to get too big and the relative refused to buy a new larger cage for them and told me to figure it out it was my job to lock up the dogs and this relative could basically boss me around all she wanted eventually I started putting one of the smaller dogs in an open plastic barrel while the others stayed in the cage but she learned to jump out so I would put a lid on it for more than five minutes I hate myself for it but I am an extremely almost medically forgetful person And one day I simply forgot about the dogs and went to work truly believing that I had let them out as usual I came back to find that the dog had suffocated in the covered barrel I cant explain the emotions I had in that day but that happened when I was 16 and it still makes me nauseous to think about Ive had a very hard life but for some reason I think that this day was the worst day There was a lot of screaming and crying from both the relative and I and she made me wrap the dog in an old dog food bag and carry it to the car so that I could dump it far from our property unceremoniously It still fucking haunts me Everyone tells me it was an accident but I still have nightmares about it All I can think about is how horrible it must be to be a tiny innocent thing suffocating in a plastic barrel on a hot day It eats me alive Everything makes me anxious I dont want to be responsible for something like that happening again I want to have kids one day but how can I knowing that theres a possibility that they can meet a horrible end just because my mind is in the clouds The only time I spoke of this event was the day it happened to various online friends and then I never spoke of it again since until now Im laying in bed and trying to sleep and maybe it would help if someone knew Im sorry Lila I didnt mean to,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 08:38:30 UTC,0,1,0.33,,CONTENT WARNING ANIMAL ABUSE,0,0
1j4zka7,Ive been selfprescribing my adhd with crystal meth for little over a year now and its changing my life,In my younger years Ive struggled with drugs Ive done everything you can think of but the only drug that scared me to my core was meth The first time I smoked it my brain said This is what youve been looking for your whole life so I was a functional meth addict for 3 years would go on weeklong benders every 45 months then I quit cold turkey with all substances for 5 years started getting muscular at the gym got my life stable and manageable Now I own my own landscaping company and I flip homes life is good But it was getting overwhelming The paperwork that comes with selfemployment is the bane of my existence Especially because I was diagnosed with severe ADHD as a child So about a year and a half ago I went to my doctor to get diagnosed again so I can get prescribed some kind of medication I knew I was going to need something to keep my business growing without completely crumbling it under my lack of focus I went through the long process and got denied because by divine providence I smoked weed for the first time in years about 5 days prior I was infuriated So I finally said fuck it and looked up old contacts and bought 3 grams of meth the next day I still remember holding that bag like I was Sméagol with the One Ring lol The deep whisper that calls to all addicts beckoned me to go all in to smoke that shit right up But by that point I had already realized the simple joy of living a true peaceful life and I knew I would throw it all away if I started back up again I bought a milligram scale and started off with 25 milligrams The realization of seeing what 25 milligrams of meth looked like made me understand the sheer power of amphetamines For years people were smoking grams of this shit Consuming it like candy yet all you ever need is a crystal the size of a grain of sand I put them into individual pill cases and started to take one a day If I havent taken a dose before 10am then I would skip taking it altogether Ive tried Adderall in high school from friends and I really enjoyed how it made me focus meth felt cleaner more aggressive Over time I started to remember my appointments without having to write them down My sleep schedule became predictable as I never sleep during the day anymore And my willingness to work harder is becoming effortless Sex is always amazing and I stopped drinking again because Ive become sociable without the need for alcohol The best thing that has happened is that Im more aggressive with business negotiations Im less nervous and Im not afraid to assert my dominance when I feel it is necessary Now I can never think of ever smoking this stuff again I know Im the exception and Im not telling you to use drugs Meth is powerful and will destroy your life before you realize whats going on But I just needed to tell someone Ask me anything you want Btw I still havent finished the 3 grams I first purchased a year ago Itll probably last me another year before I have to go back out on the streets for more,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 16:34:54 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j7rz52,It feels like getting shot out of nowhere,I have jumpscare intrusive thoughts about suicide Id be scrolling on my phone doing dishes at work studying driving and all of the sudden I get hit with the most horrid depressing and dreadful thought of committing suicide via handgun The world just stops spinning in those few seconds I start to tear up and breathe rapidly My tinnitus gets louder and I cant hear my real life surroundings anymore I practically undergo 80 of a panic attack Then my vision is flooded with graphic visuals of myself lying against the wall with a hole through my forehead and letters to my family by my side Sometimes its a shotgun and my entire face will be gone instead My brain sometimes plays a sequence of me shting myself with the gun I also see my mom panicking when she found my body If shes not there I see my body laying there waiting until the morning when my mom checks on me There really is no way to make this thought end I just have to go with the flow and eventually it stops which is when I go through my routine reassurances that everything is fine because everything actually is fine My life is good I started having these thoughts like 2 months ago after I googled ways to commit suicide out of curiosity These thoughts happen about every other day These thoughts are so vivid to the point it feels like a hallucination Ive never been diagnosed with schizophrenia and I cant root these thoughts into anything trauma related I just remember looking up ways to commit suicide out of curiosity,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 05:59:21 UTC,5,0,0.86,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0

1j76jal,I have repeatedly tried to systematically ruin my own life,I 27F have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and after that all to puzzle pieces fell into place All the emotions the feeling of not fitting in anywhere the emptiness and distortion of my self image I have repeatedly done stuff that I knew would ruin my relationships or sabotaged my self thinking I could prove I was unlovable or unworthy Because my logic was if that cant handle me at my worst they dont deserve me at my best Or that I wasnt good enough for them and couldnt understand why they cared about me A month before my 15th birthday I tried to end my life and my boyfriend at the time had an ex that had ended her life a few years earlier A week before he had told me he didnt love me anymore but wouldnt break up with me at the time bc maybe the feelings will come back I knew ending my life would make him come to a decision but thats not why I did it He did not come to visit me at the hospital but his best friend did A few days later I kissed a new guy and a week after that I started dating that guy And so on and so forth I often ended it with one guy and started dating a new one a week or two after This pattern lasted from 13 years old to 17 years old when I got into a relationship with a guy who was 5 years older than me In my country youre legal at the age of 16 On my 18th birthday I moved in with him and within 2 months I was pregnant with my son We can call this guy Aaron Arron was a drug addicted alcoholic and violent POS He severely beat me raped me and cut me off from my friends and family I was a terrified pregnant 18 year old with no one to turn to I left him almost two years after we moved in together I called my mom after not talking to her or my dad for almost a year And I asked if I could come visit I moved back to their house a week after At the beginning of 2018 I moved from my hometown to a little island where I met my now husband 37M and father to my two younger sons I admit I tried repeatedly destroying this relationship he never gave up just kept on loving me through all of it Christmas 2023 I had a mental breakdown planning how to kill myself and writing letters to my family But making my child cry while he was playing with his new toys made me get some help I was in the psych ward for 8 days didnt get to see my children other than FaceTime and I celebrated new years alone I was diagnosed with CPTSD depression anxiety and borderline personality disorder I had a ADHD diagnosis from the age of 15 I started therapy February 2024 and DBT group September 2024 And I have finally started getting back to my feet learning how to feel emotions again and not look at myself with resentment and disgust I have not had a big emotional breakdown or reaction since October 2024 and I am so proud of myself I started ADHD medication for the first time in 13 years and it has helped me keep up everything in the house and following my kids closer Im so grateful that I didnt go through with my plan and I thank my children and husband every day for being mine and that I love them more than anything,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 12:24:08 UTC,4,2,0.75,,,0,0

1j68jjz,Just another confused and lost person,I usually dont post about this kinda stuff online or really talk about it out loud with anyone to be honest Its often just a page on a random notebook where I braindump anything and everything that crosses my mind at the moment when I feel like its too much to handle Today is different I decided to expose it exactly because I never did Been trying different stuff to see if something changes in hope that any change could chain more and eventually things get better Ive always felt sort of an inadequacy around life if that makes sense A feeling that I never really belong anywhere or am passionate about anything Im currently 30 years old and so far Ive been navigating passively I wonder if there is such a thing as not really fit to being alive Dont get me wrong this isnt a cry for help and Im not planning on hurting myself in any way Also Im not trying to throw a pity party Im coming from a place of trying to figure this out logically Like I said Im currently 30 Turned 30 this year I still live with my parents am unemployed but am currently studying computer science at an university Never really been into a relationship but I do have some good friends and a loving familt for the most part Still there is something wrong with me I look around sometimes and hear shared experiences from other people about romantic adventures or success on their jobs and I feel like I want that Its not jealousy mind you its more of a self questioning as to where have I been if not doing all that stuff My current situation is my fault and I understand its not good and even then I dont have the strength or willpower or whatever you may call it to change it Its like part of me wants to experience the world and I guess a good way to explain it is I want to want to do stuff but I dont know what or how to start Starting things is another problem of mine I know what needs to be done and even so starting things is so difficult that its insane Normally that could be ruled out as being lazy or procastination but frankly Ive putting things off for 30 years the problem has to be something else right Currently I know that I should be sitting down to work on programming projects to create portfolios and help me get employes but doing so is hard Not as in programming is hard its not that Im also not scared of making mistakes I embrace them as an opportunity of learning Its a mix of not knowing where or how to start and perhaps a disbelief that it is going somewhere I even thought at some point this might be related to me playing too much games or watching too many shows but even if I cut all that off I still wont do what I need Ill spend time laying in bed overthinking planning too much for stuff I never have the guts to get done I guess you could call me a leech but I dont feel like its the case I dont take pride nor plan on taking advantage of my dads kindness forever but I just feel lost Its always been hard for me to set goals to achieve because I feel like I dont really have anything I can feel content with so little and thats maybe the reason why I never try and get more I dont consider myself ambitious Having fancy stuff or being famous or helping people None of that stuff really pushes me forward And those are the common stuff that people want so how can I move forward without a good reason to There are things Im interested in yeah Like learning languages But also some stuff Id love to try and have no money for right now like woodworking maybe music and theater I still feel like a kid frozen in time watching it go by and desperately trying to grow up but failing miserably And although I umderstand there is no point in thinking too hard about my past mistakes that led here Im scared that Im forever trapped in this loop of not being able to move on I want to escape but am not sure what I should do Therapy would help I feel but Ill only be able to afford it when I manage to get a job Im hoping Ill manage to get my first internship this year and maybe talking to someone would help me figure things out Sure I have friends but I dont feel like I have a safe space to be vulnerable with them or anyone else in my family I always thought back then that I would have this figured out by now Sometimes I think all its needed is a small change that gets other things in motion so lately Ive been trying to do that Doing things differently trying to experimenting new stuff I recently created a routine to try and force myself to do stuff It hasnt helped much so far because even if I write things down I end up forgetting to look at the list or just cant bring myself to do it but on good days I actually get a small amount of stuff done Im the kind of person who tries to understand and look for a purpose on everything and this here is kind pointless This post went nowhere and is not going anywhere Kinda like my life so far Its funny to think that But thats why I decided to do it Im not sure things will work out and despite hearing positive encouragement from my friends still cant see much of a future for me but Ill keep doing what I can and trying my best even if its not the most optimal for a normal human being If you actually managed to read this far my apologies for this mess I wrote as the thougts came no organization or anything I hope someday I understand myself and

1j6qxcs,I cant get over my ex,I cant get over the guy I was in love with 3 god damn years ago and it makes me sick So I was never really in a relationship with this person we actually never even hang out together We met in 2022 and we had a friendship that you wish on everyone but the friendship got stronger and so did our feelings At first he started getting feelings at the time it was not appropriate because I was still in a relationship I broke things off so I could be with him but when that happened he didnt have the same feelings anymore and everything went downhill Im not gonna explain everything that happened in those 6 months but I can say that nothing went back to how it was Because I was still in love with him when he basically ghosted me at the time I never got the closure I needed I think And I begged him to let me stay in his live as friends and now that Im hearing myself I sound so stupid After everything that happened in those 6 months we kissed etc for like 2 more times and that made it even worse to get over him Like I said we stayed friends and talk like 3 times a year new years birthdays and holidays I even got a new amazing boyfriend whom Ive been together with for almost 2 years and who I really love and could see myself marrying one day But I still think about him the ex Last week he even responded on a story I posted on Snapchat and we exchanged maybe 10 sentences I wake up the next day and he deleted me from snap I would like to think his new gf made him do it because it would honestly hurt more if he did it himself So now 1 week later and everyday Im thinking about it and everything that happened almost 3 fk years ago So my question Reddit users is why cant I get over him Why cant I get over the memories that we made Why not after everything this person has put me through English is not my first language so Im sorry for my grammar Side note 15 years ago he moved to another city so I havent seen him in 1 year And I see him maybe once I year now I was supposed to see him last week but he couldnt come,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 21:03:59 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j3qcal,Nobody will ever love you like a mother loves their child Why is this phrase so maligned,Ive been searching on Reddit for a few minutes and everything that comes up is about raisedbynarcissists narcissism narcissism cptsd victims of abuse more and more narcissism I cant take it anymore because this is not my experience AT ALL My mom says this to me but what I hear when she says this is that this is realistically how life is going to be or is playing out for me and everyone else and this is just a factual statement OBVIOUSLY for victims of parental abuse this is patently false but Id like to see the opposite expressed somewhere so here goes my attempt My mom is a lovely person Shes always tiring herself out helping others supporting others lifting them up Im sad and she says she doesnt mind staying awake at night to talk to me Im not a nuisance to her Im cared for and loved In many ways this has put me off of romantic relationships If no one is ever going to to put it bluntly coddle me and carry me through life like my mom has what does romantic love have to offer me IF its not pure and unconditional and unstoppable what good is that kind of love I know I know what Im asking is a tall ordeal but still I just wanted to let people know that sometimes that sentence is true and other times it is abusive But I dont think it has to be one specific thing all the time Context is required in my case my mom is a genuinely wonderful person who only wants whats best for me is supportive hears me out when I have issues Even if she doesnt know how to adequately be supportive of my specific needs but thats for another rant Shes always there for her friends in practical and more emotional ways and she takes care of all of us Shes always looking out for me and my dad and her mother and people she used to work with text her constantly because she just plainly made their lives very happy She wasnt bossy or punitive at work although she praised a job well done she could see the good in every person and tried to help them in the ways she could She believes there is always a place for everyone and just because someone is doing bad at one task doesnt mean they are invaluable She understands people She cares most of all and shes genuine and so it is really weird to me to go online and only read about how abusive that sentence is because my mom is not like that so why would she say it I do have issues with taking things literally btw and suspect to be on the autism spectrum Maybe my whole family is Idk we just do things differently between me mom and my dad uuuf rant over really needed to say this,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 00:34:50 UTC,3,3,0.71,,,0,0

1j5ez5s,I treated my for a broken handwrist as a kid and didnt knowrealize it until i was older very long read oof,i honestly really should probably talk abt this bc it honestly was actually pretty tramuatizing enough that i feel like i may have locked away some memories of what happened bc of just how awful some of the experience was my memory is somewhat spotty bc of how scary it all was but ill try my best to explain my friend had a Halloween party at her house we decided to play something that involved running which was a rather stupid decision as everything was slippery and dark outside i was running nearon ground that was steeply raised up a bit for a buliding to be bulit flat on i slipped and fell despite the mud when i instinctively reached out to brace myself by putting my hand out towards the top of the small slope i got hurt really really badly i had never been in such pain before i dont remember how quickly it arrived exactly but it was pretty quick to show up i started crying a soon as the pain hit and the girl i had been running behind took notice and from what i can remember asked if i was ok the other girls i was playing with eventually noticed and the escorted me to the house and to my friends mother who is a vetvet tech she wrapped it in blue vet wrap in the kitchen and asked if i wanted to go to the doctor and child me refused out if fear of possibly having to get surgery and probably bc i didnt want to inconvenience anyone the vet wrap was uncomfortable and irritating but honestly the splint i got for a broken foot abt 2 years ago was worse and it was by an er doc too and while child me had to experience that awful splint the vet wrap did make my hand feel better i felt like i could pick it up and move it safely so i ended up staying inside sitting on one of their couches in the living room and resting my arm on the arm supports watching tv with my friends mom i wasnt rly interested in the show but that was the least of my worries then i think at one point she brought me food like a hotdog or smth which had ketchup bc my autistic ass wouldnt eat meat unless ot had ketchup on it the other girls went outside after everything calmed down somewhat tho my friend stayed a bit longer from what remember to make sure i was ok eventually they came back inside for an event i forget if it was planned or started bc it was dark and I was stuck inside basically it was a game where someone would get wrapped on toilet paper to become a mummy they included me in it by loosely wrapping parts of my armhand that i was willing to move and then we eventually all went home i dunno when any of this next stuff happens exactly but ill try to explain it in order i was cyberschooled then and at first i was fine until i needed to write something im right handed and my right hand was the one that was injured i remember my mom yelling at me because i refused to use my right hand and i think i asked if she could write for me she told me to use it and i remember crying and saying I cant I cant i tried to move it even slightly in order to try obeying what she said but the pain was terrible horrendous unbearable i cant think of words that can extensively describe how much pain i was in i dont quite remember it all but i think when i tried to use my left hand to write i was yelled at too and my mom minimized my pain by saying smth along the lines of it isnt that bad and i was also condescendingly asked if i wanted to go the doctor which i again refused fearing surgery and also bc having my parents yell at me made me upset all this time i remember i still had that blue vet wrap on my hand was shaking and in so much pain i forget if my mom did the usual let me feel it thing but if she did i most definitely refused and probably yanked it away based on the fact I still had that vet wrap on i think it was probably the next day i was allowed to write with my left hand but not without being scolded i remember writing down things in notebooks for fun with my left hand and i even decided that a character id made had my left hands handwriting i eventually got better writing with my left hand and honestly really had fun with it while i wrote and did things with my left hand i also did not use my right hand or bend my wrist at least i did as little as possible i kept on using the vet wrap to stablize it until it wouldnt stick no more then i found some wrap i has gotten from when i sprained my leg and so i it instead and remembered how i treated my sprained leg used that was refrence for resting my hand and also didnt move it bc it was painful i dont remember much else abt the recovery i think i stopped wrapping it and started using my right hand again as soon as the pain lessoned which probably was after like a month or two perhaps ik it takes longer for a broken bone to recover but the pain does go away pretty quickly honestly i remember my mom expecting me to recover from my sprain in about a week and was upset i still refused to use it and instead write with my left hand i did keep on writing with my left hand sometimes for awhile after that just for fun which ironically probably helped my right hand recover lol i dont quite know how long after it was but i think it was a decent chunk after but within the same year i once again slipped and fell and i forget which handi landed on but based on the pain and how caught myself the same way again i think it was my right which i once again assumed was a sprain but only a minor one so i again pulled out the wrap i had and i think for abt a day or 3 days wrapped my hand i remember not having much pain and wondering if it still needed wrapped the next day but i still ended up keeping it on i think and until i was a teen it never hit me that the pain i feltin my bones was not a normal sprain thing but probably a broken bone and it really hit me after a horse broke my foot 2 years ago that yea that probably wasnt a sprain bc like it was while less pain that pain i got from my broken foot felt literally like a lesser version of the pain i felt in my hand when i was a kid tbh im not completely sure if i did break my hand as ive never rly had it inspected for past breaks unlike my foot it doesnt rly act up when the weather changes or from overuse etc at least i think so i never rly took notice of anything like thay as a kid because i was never aware or looking for anybpain related to broken bones so im open to anyone suggesting its something else not for legitimate medical advice as well ik i shouldnt get it from here and its already healed just out of curiosity i wonder if it was like a pinched nerve maybe but it didnt feel like one at all ive unfortunately had and continue of have pinched nerves in my neck

1j7ungd,A letter to the girl I loved the most but never met,Throwaway account for obvious reasons This message has been sitting in my drafts for a really long time I could never find the courage to actually send it to her I dont think I can even today So here I am sending this out in the void hoping that one day it reaches her somehow After checking out her WhatsApp DP for one last time I finally decided to delete her contact as I prepare myself to let go and move on with my life From strangers to friends and now back to strangers only this time with bittersweet memories of eachother Hey I have been really thinking about everything that happened recently and I honestly dont think I can continue like this anymore I know we already discussed this before but I hadnt fully processed my emotions at that time I really care about you a lot and love you beyond words can express but this onesided attachment is going to take a huge emotional toll on me I also really hated your nonchalant behavior that day and the way you were acting so cold towards me and pushing me away like you suddenly decided your feelings have changed and we cant fit into each others lives whereas just a few days back you were telling me how you would wrap yourself around me and wouldnt let me leave the bed and all like all such moments meant absolutely nothing to you Something which I never told you last year on 31st I was so fed up by everything that had happened between us in those last few days that I just kept drinking and drinking until I finally lost consciousness right there in the club My friends had to literally put me in a wheelchair and take me back to the hotel room At times they couldnt even feel my pulse and for a moment everyone thought I was a goner The only thing I remember before passing out is wanting to talk to you on call because I just wanted to hear your voice one last time I truly believe God gave me this second chance at life for a reason and I am going to make the most out of it With everything going on especially with you moving to UK this year we would be emotionally distanced even further and eventually things are going to fade away and we both know it It is the start of a new chapter in your life soon and for me too as I will have to learn to live without you Our lives are just pulling us in different directions at this point You were right We have very different personalities backgrounds values and our future goals dont align either That is a gap which is difficult to bridge I really respect your feelings and boundaries and I have finally come to accept the unfortunate reality that things have changed between us now I dont want either of us to continue holding on to something halfheartedly I truly believe that destiny brought us together and meeting you was a part of my journey I am really grateful to you because I never knew I was capable of loving someone so much and that too without expectations until I met you What we shared was real and meaningful and I will always cherish those memories After all we shared a bond that has lasted for almost a decade without ever physically meeting each other But despite all this things never really took off which is why I think maybe we were never actually meant to be together but only to be a part of each others journeys I will really miss you Janhavi I will miss our chats and vc and how I was always able to be myself around you I will miss waiting for your text for days and months every time we had a fight how my day used to light up after seeing your text first thing in the morning how my heart used to melt after hearing your sweet voice how I used to play your voice notes again and again every time I missed you how I struggled to keep up because you talk so fast how I used to secretly steal glances at you when we were on vc how my heart used to skip a beat after randomly receiving your text in the middle of the night how I used to play my favorite songs to you on Spotify to convey my deeper feelings how you used to always come back to me after every fight and we would start talking again like nothing happened how you used to secretly install Kik on your moms phone every night to chat with me and I used to stay awake waiting for you sometimes even till morning how you made chocolates on my birthday and then ate them yourself on vc how we used to send each other those disaster selfies how you used to fall asleep on vc while talking and I used to continue admiring you sleeping how Sab Tera is still my favorite song even today because it was the one you sang to me how we had Maggi at 3 AM on vc and you made fun of me for having a cupcake with it and so many more such cute memories that I cant even possibly list them all here but these memories will always be a part of me and I will carry them with me forever It was pure innocent love at its best My life somehow always felt complete with you and stupid me always believed you were the one and that you were my soulmate and that one day I would definitely marry you Its funny because I cant even tell you how many times I have rehearsed this whole scene in my head about how I would propose you But I was wrong In the end it was all in my head and you already had someone else in your life all these years I dont blame you though and neither do I hold any grudge against you because of it You will always be a huge part of my life regardless and someone who helped me understand love much more deeply and helped me grow as a person I will always be thankful to you for that I only regret that I never got to meet you in real life But then again I still believe you are an angel and it wasnt just your username and thats why I could never meet you You came into my life for a reason but now is the time for me to let go If it is meant to be I am sure God will bring our paths together once again maybe in this lifetime or the next But until then this is where we must both go our separate ways I wish you all the happiness in life and hope you can forgive me if I have ever hurt you in any way Good vibes only Goodbye my favorite stranger PS I am sorry for deleting our Spotify playlist yet again I know you said that when you cant talk to me you listen to it But baby I have to do this and it is what is best for both of us afterall,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 09:21:57 UTC,4,3,0.84,,,0,0

throw away account n such Not really curating this post just typing about whatever comes to mind Ive never really been the happiest of people Even in my youth I remember being melancholic more than not Didnt have the best upbringing not the worst by a long shot either My parents fought with each other all the time if I didnt have someone over I remember hiding in my room hearing them arguing downstairs hoping against hope it wouldnt lead into my room with them competing for my favoritism There were times either my mom or dad would try to drag me out of the house to stay at a hotel with them because the other parent was crazy and untrustworthy Events like this were common place once or twice a month in the house up until I was around 14 when it all kinda just died out My parents stopped fighting daily maybe once a month or so until not at all They never even acknowledge the horrors they would put me through They just tell me it wasnt as bad as I think but it totally fucking was It was hell not to mention how often they would remind me how abnormal of a human I am Ive been diagnosed either adhd and I highly suspect I have highfunctioning autism I never really managed to fit in around others as a kid often doing things my own way Friends were hard and socializing was harder My parents would try with all their might to assimilate me into normal behavior My mom didnt let me shop for my own clothes until I left the house I bought some shirts with some cats on them with one of my first paychecks maybe 16 yrs old She took and hid them from me because she was afraid people would think Im girly or gay which blew my mind My dad wasnt the most supportive of my interests either I recall a time when i was in grade school I really liked filming and doing stop motion Lego things I probably just caught him at a bad time wasnt very many good times forgot what I asked but I remember his reply was along the lines of it doesnt matter anyway it wont go anywhere in regards to my shortlived hobby I dont think I picked up that camera again after that I wish I did Cant blame myself there i guess I was young and impressionable I wonder often how things play out if he never said those words Probably not much different but maybe instead I just spent most of my time online hiding behind headphones blocking out the screaming Didnt have many friends growing up Id typically just pick one person I liked and puppy dog around them I was pretty shy and often to target of harassment from some of the meaner kids in school I got used to being the butt of jokes and such pretty early It didnt bother me much but it definitely scared me off from trying to form connections That said I managed enough I had a lunch table to sit at most of the time I wasnt usually the star attraction but the folks there didnt seem to mind my presence I recall once I didnt really feel comfortable sitting at any table so I sat at an empty one This prompted the principal to come over and with good intentions have me sit at a table with a bunch of strangers I didnt really know Horrifying experience That said I didnt really spend too much time hanging out with friends irl I unfortunely found connections on the world wide web Despite how strict my parents could be they let me have unfiltered internet access from the very get go when i got my first laptop at 12 or so They never monitored my activity or set restrictions on screen time or anything Longstory short I end up in some unsavory online spaces I met people who at the time I thought were nice friends parental figures people to talk to when I didnt have parents I could It wasnt until a bit later in my life I realized how groomed I got I never thought much about it at the time It seemed like people finally enjoyed my company wanted to invite me to chat and stuff I didnt see the harm at the time at all Just some textbased roleplays maybe a picture or two without my face Whags the harm Now in my adulthood I feel like Im able to see the effects more My libido is so high yet the thinking about sex makes me extremely uncomfortable in a way thats hard to describe I get jealous disgusted confused lustful etc etc etc whenever I see or am reminded of the mere concept of penetration Whats worse is I think its effected my love language too I feel I have a really difficult time feeling like Im showing I love someone if Im not having sex relatively often I doubt myself and if Im able to provide and be a good partner I know theres so much more to a relationship but my brain always defaults back to thoughts along these lines I hate it but the nature of the issue causes me to love it Its such a conflicting mess of sexual frustration I have no idea how to do a segway here so 3 Anxiety is a big thing in my life It wasnt so bad when I was younger mostly manifesting in social anxiety around new people or crowds Nowadays I sometimes feel anxious just leaving my apartment Going to the store is a massive panic attack and I have no reasons why I desperately want to put myself out there meet new people and enjoy this life I have but the exhaustion from the anxiety and depression just constantly kick my dick straight into the dirt Depression is the worst Its only gotten worse since I broke up with my seven year long partner we were engaged too at the time The break up is a long story with no heroes and only villains and victims I dont want to dive into it here Im a bastard theyre a bastard Point is Im a total bastard livid with regret over such minute details I miss my ex I care about them but I dont trust them anymore and I loathe the mere memory of them Its such a dissonance I cant think back to the early days and not wonder if any of it was real at all Im sure there was true love between us sometime I wonder when we lost it and I fear they mightve never felt love for me like I did for them We were young when we met Stupid too probably Grew up and got distant yadayada happens I still miss them their quirks and such The way they talked and the way they ate Even the things that annoyed me I miss its wild how much I miss the things that pissed me off Anyway this post is going a bit long Its bedtime for me Thanks for reading my cool epic post Might post more vents like this,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 04:05:50 UTC,7,0,0.9,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0
1j3qcal,Nobody will ever love you like a mother loves their child Why is this phrase so maligned,Ive been searching on Reddit for a few minutes and everything that comes up is about raisedbynarcissists narcissism narcissism cptsd victims of abuse more and more narcissism I cant take it anymore because this is not my experience AT ALL My mom says this to me but what I hear when she says this is that this is realistically how life is going to be or is playing out for me and everyone else and this is just a factual statement OBVIOUSLY for victims of parental abuse this is patently false but Id like to see the opposite expressed somewhere so here goes my attempt My mom is a lovely person Shes always tiring herself out helping others supporting others lifting them up Im sad and she says she doesnt mind staying awake at night to talk to me Im not a nuisance to her Im cared for and loved In many ways this has put me off of romantic relationships If no one is ever going to to put it bluntly coddle me and carry me through life like my mom has what does romantic love have to offer me IF its not pure and unconditional and unstoppable what good is that kind of love I know I know what Im asking is a tall ordeal but still I just wanted to let people know that sometimes that sentence is true and other times it is abusive But I dont think it has to be one specific thing all the time Context is required in my case my mom is a genuinely wonderful person who only wants whats best for me is supportive hears me out when I have issues Even if she doesnt know how to adequately be supportive of my specific needs but thats for another rant Shes always there for her friends in practical and more emotional ways and she takes care of all of us Shes always looking out for me and my dad and her mother and people she used to work with text her constantly because she just plainly made their lives very happy She wasnt bossy or punitive at work although she praised a job well done she could see the good in every person and tried to help them in the ways she could She believes there is always a place for everyone and just because someone is doing bad at one task doesnt mean they are invaluable She understands people She cares most of all and shes genuine and so it is really weird to me to go online and only read about how abusive that sentence is because my mom is not like that so why would she say it I do have issues with taking things literally btw and suspect to be on the autism spectrum Maybe my whole family is Idk we just do things differently between me mom and my dad uuuf rant over really needed to say this,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 00:34:50 UTC,3,3,0.71,,,0,0
1j46iy7,I am in a situtionship and dont know what to do,I 14M and my friend 14F have been friends since childhood People say that we are both attractive for our ages and because of that we often get shipped as a couple by our other friends It doesnt bother me that much because I am used to hearing stuff like this My father however gave me some requirements for marriage and they are odd One of the requirements is my partner cant be the same age or older than me The thing is when we started talking over text things escalated Now we call each other romantic names And the topic of us having children came up more than once And there is also my friend 2 years older than me Lets call him WILLIAM and WILLIAM has feelings for my friend F But the guilt is eating me out My parents gave me freedom and I am misusing it Though we read in different schools our friends and mutual friends know about us Her friends often flirt with me for being very handsome Though my face is one of my biggest insecurities Yesterday I was in the bathroom of our community hall And I saw her She said hello I said too We talked and she started flirting with me I didnt find it weird since she has done it more than once so we were in the bathroom and she suddenly asked me Will you kiss me I paused And when I did she came over and gave me a kiss on the cheek I blushed so hard that when my mom noticed she said what happened why are you blushing I couldnt tell her the real reason so I made one up Next day she messaged me to meet in the same place I went thinking she surely couldnt do it again When I met her we talked for a few mins and she asked if I could kiss her as well I didnt wanna hurt her but at the same time I am afraid of my parents So I kissed her on her hand She was happy I was too but deep down I was dying Now I am sitting in my room thinking should I confess my feelings for her or should i tell abt my feelings to WILLIAM I have to make a decision quick because this secret is something I cant hide forever,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 16:07:06 UTC,0,2,0.17,,,0,0
1j623o7,I just broke up with my partner because they didnt even realise theyd cheated on me,Life is feeling real batshit today Came across my partners alt account on social media Open to public viewing They described it as an orgasm journal where they seemed to be exploring self pleasure Cool love that Very datadriven Cut to a post about collective episode with another online user They had been exploring what sounds to be a lot like mutual masturbation where youre turned on by the idea of someone watching viewing things through a datadriven lens in the name of research Naturally I lost my shit and messaged them We called and I told them all of the assumptions Id made They didnt say I was wrong just said its research I feel like Im getting pulled into insanity and delusion here It feels like kink gone wrong What do you mean its research Research is ethical Having sexual conversations around topics that arouse you with another person for the purpose of sexual pleasure sounds like infidelity to me I cant believe I had to tell this person who most of the time has their head on square amp thinks intelligently and rationally that this constitutes as cheating Its not research or data what are you talking about Theyve just posted after our break up yes Im going to stop looking but its been 12 hours please let me wallow that theyre open not poly Fast fucking turnaround when we were in a monogamous relationship literally 8 hours ago We were in a long term relationship and I cannot for the life of me process that this is the way it ends Can someone please tell me Im not going insane Edit just to clarify weve had in depth conversations around our expectations of a monogamous relationship I didnt specifically set a boundary of I am not comfortable with mutual masturbation online in the name of research because thats very specific and not at all a normal conversation to have lol but I did explain what would be uncomfortable or dealbreaking for me and I would fully put the onus on them to have needed to clarify in this situation instead of going in blind because I think its very clearly something I would take issue with based on every other conversation weve had on the subject,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 22:25:00 UTC,2953,110,0.97,,,0,0
1j5fth6,I hate my parents for not letting me have surgery for pectus carinatum,First of all I want to apologize for my poor English since Im doing this through a translator Im a 19yearold guy who has had pectus carinatum his whole life It has brought me a lot of teasing and stares and even though I have the mildest case I have a small bananashaped protrusion on my sternum Ive wanted surgery since I was 14 As a first option they wanted me to wear a compression brace for a year which is complete nonsense I knew it wouldnt fix what I have and even the doctor said so I fought for years to get surgery until one day they took me to the subcapital to see a doctor The doctor told me it was a very mild case and that the surgery was very simple they would cut two cartilages push the sternum inward and that was it This happened in June 2024 I was very excited about the idea of having a normal chest My experience with this condition has been horrible and has caused me a lot of insecurity Every time I wear a tshirt the lump is noticeable making me look much fatter than I actually am Ive been training for five years and its horrible to see how I cant make progress in my chest because this damn protrusion sticks outits all Ive seen in the mirror for five years Going back to what I was saying my parents postponed the surgery until 2025 I got angry with them and gave them an ultimatum Either I get the surgery or I leave the house I want to clarify that this was the only thing I was asking for the only thing I wanted Im the youngest child and I have a 29yearold sister who is studying her second degree because she realized that the first one wouldnt get her a job My father has always helped her with her apartment and university expenses Ive always known she was the favorite and I wasnt asking for muchjust this surgery Today we went to see a doctor in our city and instead of agreeing with the previous doctor he said they would have to break my abdomen cut all the cartilage and insert a prosthesis I suspect this was all planned because my father is a doctor and I have a feeling he talked to this doctor to make me change my mind or to have an excuse to say no I walked home because I was so angry at them Ive been fighting for this surgery for about five years and they found the perfect excuse to deny it Tonight at dinner I ate in my room Im so tired of themthey are the most vile cruel and arbitrary people I know I hate them for making me go through my entire adolescence and now my adulthood with this lump in my chest just because they dont want me to have surgery They have no idea how much Ive suffered or how much I wish with all my heart to die I wish I could just wake up one day and no longer exist in this horrible world I hate the parents I got and I hate my sister for being the favorite If I could Id take a gun and blow my brains out so I wouldnt have to endure this anymorebut I will make them pay As soon as I get a job Ill leave this place and never speak to them again When theyre old Ill put them in a nursing homeand Im being generous I should let them rot in their own filth Ill update if theres any news,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 05:01:13 UTC,25,1,0.87,,,0,0
1j68tj9,My mom is abusing me and Im tired of it,Im 14 years old and have told two of my friends briefly about this but I feel like Ill annoy them if I speak about it more I just want to get this off my chest and put my experience somewhere in hopes itll make me feel better Im also posting this here because I dont want anyone to try and intervene itll just make everything worse Content warning for violence as well but suicide is mentioned first so I used that flair sorry My mom is an okay mom most of the time but shes very quick to anger and has total freakouts over small things that always result in herself threatening to kill herself or saying shes going to kill herself I have a little brother who is 13 and my mom is 45 with a history of suicidal thoughts and one attempt before we were born which she told us about Whenever we get into huge fights she usually takes my stuff and threatens to destroyburn it she never does she never lets me talk and always screams over me and then of course she threatens to kill herself and says its because of me and my brother and she says we ruined her life I can understand why she resents us to an extent my brother and I are rape babies and we look like our dad On the topic of him hes an abusive rapist who wasis addicted to drugs and who hasnt been in our lives since I was 3 He has gone off the radar for a few years and nobody knows where he is My mom keeps threatening to send us back to him and has shown us her text in him multiple times telling him shes done with us and that he needs to come get us He never has obviously The last few times weve gotten in fights I never even yelled once and just keep talking calmly because I heard that helps calm angry people down it doesnt work she just keeps yelling and theres even been a few times when I do raise my voice that she literally covers her ears and says lalalala like a toddler until I stop talking After she threatens this she usually leaves the house and says shes never coming back and says we can live with our grandmother She says either that shes gonna drive off a cliff into a brick wall etc etc or that shell just straight up abandon us and start a new life somewhere Then shell come back some time later and act like nothing happened very rarely shell apologize but if I ever try and bring up what shes done again when shes calm shell just get enraged again Ive tried talking to her about it through text only once when she was out of the house sending her a lengthy few paragraphs about my concerns but she responded back basically just shaming me and when she came home she was angry and she said she showed the text to all of her friends which are mostly my friends parents and she said they dont like me anymore and I wont be able to hang out with any of my friends anymore I started avoiding all of my friends and eventually began online school because of this and now my mom claims all my friends and their parents miss me and they dont understand why I dont talk to them anymore I dont know what to believe anymore When she isnt in these weird freak out modes shes an okay mom but she snaps at random stuff before flipping like a switch and being happy again Just yesterday she was yelling and slamming around her computer because she couldnt upload her photos to Facebook shes a photographer A few people had just been over to fix our dryer about an hour earlier which has been broken for months so mid yelling at her computer she just got up and went to go text out the new dryer and then when it worked she was all smiles and apologized for yelling She also frequently tells me and my brother that were the only thing keeping her alive and that she would probably kill herself without us and shes told us multiple times that she doesnt own a gun because shes afraid that when we grow up and move out shell kill herself because she has no one to rely on anymore This scares me and I want to move away for college when Im grown I planned on leaving this household as soon as possible but I dont really want to anymore because she keeps saying things like that She says stuff like that and says she loves me and my brother but then says the exact opposite when she gets really angry and says she wants to die because of us and she blames everything shes mad at on us stressing her out Shes also gotten physical with me and my brother multiple times like digging her nails into the back of my neck and holding my face into a pillow because I wouldnt give her my phone because she said she was gonna break it chokeholding me and dragging me out of me room before locking me out of my room and tearing it apart because I hid my art tablet from her and more Shes done stuff with my brother too and Im ashamed to admit this but I dont know what because whenever shes mad at him I just hide in my room so I wont get punished for helping him He does the same when she does that stuff with me I only know she hurts him because I can hear it I dont want to call the police Im scared and I dont want to live with my grandma or in a foster home or anywhere else and I dont want to be separated from my brother and pets She actually encourages me to call the police on her and says shed rather go to jail than live with us I just want to explain to her how her her actions hurt me and my brother and I want to get her to stop Theres been periods of times where everything has been fine for a while and my family is just a normal happy family and I cry sometimes thinking about how thats what my family could be like if my mom wasnt the way she was I know Im doing it to myself at this point by not calling the police but Im just scared and keep hoping things will change Right now is one of those times where everythings fine my mom is currently talking to my brother offering to clean off the couch and sit and braid his hair while they watch the movie together Were all acting like nothings wrong I just wish my family could be this way all the

1j560mr,I think i believe in fate because my first love came back into my life,I 21 fam dating my high school sweetheart again after years of not seeing or speaking to each other We met working a shitty fast food job in high school and I fell in love with her almost immediately Shes smart so fun to be around made me laugh and made me feel genuinely loved and appreciated for the first time in my life I felt more confident more comfortable around her Not to mention shes also the most gorgeous person ive ever seen We dated for a bit and then she broke up with me towards the end of our senior year I was heartbroken and went off to college still processing and dealing with the breakup As silly as it sounds and I know most people think this with their first love but I really thought i was going to marry this girl We chatted on and off throughout my freshman year just normal shit like hey how are you doing and we should catch up before I finally decided it was finally time to fully move on and forget about her so I blocked her on everything that summer and deleted her number While i still thought of her from time to time I wasnt angry or hurt about the breakup anymore I had accepted that 17yearolds know nothing about love and all I can do with heartbreak is learn from it Fast forward to the beginning of my junior year of college and Ive dated on and off for years now and was in the process of trying to end a terrible long term relationship I drove from college to my hometown around 3 hours to be with my friends after ending things while my new ex blew up my phone with calls and messages telling me what a horrible person i was for breaking up with her I was not she treated me terrible and refused to listen to me when I had an issue My friends and I decided to grab food and hangout in my car in one of the parking lots in our hometown We pulled in and I saw my first Exs car It had a very distinctive bumper sticker so I knew it was her I didnt get out or try to say anything but my heart skipped a beat I really truly believed I would never see this girl again I debated reaching out but in the end I unblocked her on snapchat and reached out with a simple hey were you at x lot the other night and we spent a few weeks catching up and then hung out for the first time in years She told me she missed me and had always regretted the way things ended between us I had no intention of trying to date again when I reached out but I admit I did miss her too That was about 9 months ago and one thing led to another and now we are fully back together and its been amazing I know its only been three years since we broke up originally and I will say that I still dont know anything about love Im a different person than I was in high school and so is she She makes me feel like the most beautiful person in the world and ive never come close to feeling this way for anyone but her All I do know is that as long as Im able I will do my best to love her the way she deserves because as far as im concerned she does the same for me I cant help but wonder how my life would be different now if we hadnt gone to that one parking lot that night Thank you for reading xoxo,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 21:01:47 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0

1j6pk4i,I recently found out my abusive brother might have a baby,My F20 oldest brother OB M31 is an abusive misogynist He genuinely thinks that women his girlfriend his wife his mom doesnt matter should be beaten andor be physically intimidated when he has any even the smallest disagreement He was kicked out of the military for beating his wife he somehow got honorable discharge from what my mom says My mom also has video evidence on OB practically dragging his girlfriends down the stairs in front of her children my brother only went after single moms With that said lets get into the main reason Im scared for this child I recently found out my OB is a child predator and that the reason OB was kicked out at 14 almost 15 wasnt because of no reason It was because my mom walked in on us with our pants down in my closet when I was 4 3 years later OB got my name tattooed on his arm I dont really remember it that well because I had pushed the memory deep down in the back of my mind because I thought it was my fault I remember thinking all I have to do is push it all the way back behind the wall into my subconscious because I heard thats how others got rid of the bad feelings or bad memories I think its because I heard that there was 2 sides of the brain I remember thinking Why didnt I just say no It wasnt until years later OB had moved back into our house when I noticed weird things OB would do like how I mentioned he only goes after single moms or moms who recently left an abusive relationship only for them to leave OB because I never wanted my children to be put back into that situation luckily the Girlfriend he practically dragged down the stairs has a new boyfriend who said Ill make sure he doesnt goes anywhere near my family again I would notice things like how OB treated me like OB would his girlfriends or how OB would stare at my chest or at me in a weird way like a dog would a squirrel or almost like how they describe jaws eyes but I thought I was just being crazy Then OB offered my underaged friend alcohol if she got into his car and went on a drive with OB to nowhere is particular After a couple of years OB was kicked out again for trying to beat my dad for telling OB to stop yelling at my mom about how OB crashed his car while drunk and the entire time the way OB was talking to her it sounded like he was trying to blame her or the mechanic who fixed his car my mom said the next day OB went back to the mechanic and yelled at him then OB got upset that the best mechanic who worked there wouldnt fix his car and told him to go somewhere else And then as soon as she raised her voice above him to get him to stop screaming and yelling he immediately started the crocodile tears The story OB told us was actually ridiculous OB apparently hit a boulder in the middle of the road and swerved off the road into a ditch My parents visited the crash site of where the supposed boulder was and all they found were swerve marks to a ditch As for the road it looked completely fine for a road that had a boulder land on it a couple hour prior we live in a part of America where the roads dont get that much maintenance and when we do its noticeable and definitely lasts longer than a day After a little while the whole p diddy thing came out and something about it made me snap and I kept thinking about predators and how they are disgusting creatures At the time I had recently bought some shrooms bars from a local store The more I thought of the p diddy situation the more the memories of my own molestation started coming back I started getting angry a lot and eventually I told my mom She said that when she found us she didnt think anything had happened yet and that OB was just about to do something I asked her why she didnt call the police because OB would have still attempted to molested a 4 year old child She said it was because of my dads crazy exwife Sometimes I wish I could go back in time and stop it I was littarly just playing with my toys before OB came home from school and immediately ran to me like I was present under a christmas tree I still remember the conversation we had OB he said something along the lines of we should take off our pants or something about a game I wasnt really paying attention when he initially walked in because I was focused on my toys Me But why OB Because I want to show you something Me starts to take off pants OB If you kiss mine Ill kiss yours Me senses something is off and starting to get scared but why I dont want to OB its not scary see does what you think he said he would I genuinely feel sick thinking about it Then I geuss he heard my mom or he had locked the door OB You need to get your pants on shes not supposed to see us Then my mom walked in and stopped when she ws my still trying to button and zip up my pants Mom what whatthe Fuck then she started yelling at OB WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU DOING TO HER then she grabbed him and pulled him out of the room I dont really remember much after that but I do remember the couple of times I would think about it and get a disgusting feeling or like shame before I had successfully pushed it down Now I dont know what to do its not exactly like I can go to the police and get justice when it was a long time ago and there is no actual proof the court would listen to My family has cut him off though which is good because I was scared of what OB would do if OB moved in with my nana and papa theyre 80 and my aunts have mobility problems the only person who would be able to defend them is my uncle who isnt exactly the athletic type and is much older than OB Edit I fixed the spelling and grammar mistakes,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 20:00:55 UTC,6,2,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0
1j4ipqp,Its a real story I have sleep paralysis and it getsnsfw,Im not sure where to post this but I really need advice thats why I made an account just fot this because Im starting to question my sanity I recently started living alone in my first apartment Im extremely careful I always lock the doors and windows at night and I dont have any pets I used to have occasional bouts of sleep paralysis during a stressful phase but they were relatively harmless dark figures just staring at me hearing weird noises etc But since Ive lived here its different Now I wake up several times a week in the middle of the night completely paralyzed I can only move my eyes hear and feel And every time I see this big dark shadowy figure in my room But it doesnt just stand in the corner It slowly comes towards me It pulls my blanket away then my pants and then it starts touching me in a way that feels far too real It starts touching me with its mouth It licks me sucks me as if it is completely obsessed with my vagina And the most disturbing thing is I feel EVERYTHING Every detail Much more intensely than any real human contact I have ever had It brings me to orgasm over and over until the sensations are so overwhelming that I pass out And when I wake up in the morning my blanket is actually at the foot of the bed or on the floor my pants exactly where it threw them For the ones who wants to imagine it the figure is black shadowy with glowing white eyes but sometimes they look red and it is very large It has a somewhat human shape but also somehow not There is a dark aura around it like black smoke The hands are very large and the fingers are extremely long The only thing I remember is that in one of my earlier sleep paralyses years ago I saw these hands or very similar looking hands trying to grab me But I was able to free myself from the paralysis in time bec my sister suddenly came in my room and turned the lights on Its mouth is not visible but when it begins with the act I can make out the outline of the mouth and it has a very long tongue You can then imagine where the tongue goes It doesnt say anything or even talk to me I know it might feel like a particularly realistic sleep paralysis but how can things be moving in my room Im scared It happens almost every night and although it doesnt hurt the thought that it might do more at some point scares me What if its not just a hallucination And before anyone asks No Im not desperate or lonely Im single right now but Im happy with it I dont miss anyone feel untouched or crave closeness Ive had relationships in the past but right now Im enjoying my own life so I understand even less why this is happening But my biggest concern is that deep down Im starting to enjoy it There are moments when I catch myself thinking Dont stop Keep going And that terrifies me even more I have a disturbing theory What if it isnt just a sleep paralysis I know its not a dream bec Im fully awake Im just unable to move or make a sound What if it is some kind of entity or demon that possessed me I know how crazy this sounds but if you were in my shoes would you really rule it out I feel like I cant talk to anyone about this Its so humiliating and the worst part is what if it keeps coming to me every night until the day I die bec I dont do anything about it Im desperate and conflicted because as terrifying as it is it also feels good And Im starting to crave it I dont think a real man could ever satisfy me again like this Ive tried to relax before sleep and I dont have any stress in life at the moment but it still visits me almost every night And like i said Im extremely embarrassed to talk to other people in real life because Ive started to enjoy it and I dont have any money for fancy therapies What if this continues for years I feel everything and when I wake up in the morning my intimate area feels a bit numb and tingly as if someone had been fiddling with it so its not fake its really happening to me I almost always pass out from all the orgasms Being satisfied so intensely every night can be dangerous right Idk Have any of you ever experienced something like this Am I just crazy or is something going on here that I cant explain,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 00:30:48 UTC,35,89,0.62,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j3tlhm,We Need Modesty Back,We Need Modesty Back I feel like in a situation where a man gropes a woman in a bikini theyre both at fault She knows shes practically half naked which is perverted and she attracts perverted behavior from another perverted person So the man acting on temptation is wrong the woman provoking the temptation is wrong and the mentality that I can walk around in anything I want because I just want to be sexy is wrong because it all comes from immodesty and its not accidental its intentional You know sexy means sexual Its meant to provoke sexual feelings So thats lust You cant dress yourself in lust and expect not to attract it and then push all the blame on the predator when you made yourself the bait Dont get me wrong both people are responsible for their own foolish decisions but I believe more modesty will reduce any forms of sexual misconduct Sidenote I want to be clear that in no way am I justifying or excusing the actions of predators or those who commit sexual assault They are fully responsible for their sin and the harm they cause This post is not about blaming victims but rather about acknowledging the responsibility we all have in our own actions including how we dress and how that can affect others The Bible calls us to be mindful of how our choices can impact the people around us both in terms of their temptation and their spiritual growth This is about promoting accountability and mutual respect not shifting blame,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 03:16:23 UTC,0,10,0.32,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0
1j5tjlt,My boyfriend is watching his ex and has the urge to jerk off,For some context my boyfriend 23m and I 24f have been in a relationship He was after me for 1 year dated for 1 year broke up and have been dating for 6 months now I have an autoimmune disease that is mostly affected by my mental health and can create severe illnesses and damages to my body Since Ive been dating him Ive been noticing my health getting worse and worse To add more to the story I found out he was attracted to his workcolleague and made some sort of move check my other post to figure out some more about this if interested but it will add more to the story and will help you gain a better understanding Plus my boyfriend since the start of our relationship has told me how hes a man who doesnt watch corn and has been flexing it to his guy friends and all So my boyfriend has been recently saying nonstop how hes open for me to check his phone he has actually said it so much it was beginning to be suspicious I had been noticing him becoming more irritated with me by the second without me doing nothing and I asked him I told him that I knew there was something he was hiding that was making him so anxious with me all the time thats when I began suspecting and he denied all of my comments saying it was because hes been so busy with work After some days he started saying it again telling me that I could check his phone whenever I didnt trust him He was always used to me saying no since I was keen on not doing so since I felt like doing that There must be a lack of trust in a relationship and thats how they fall apart So he didnt expect me to say yes this time I did due to all my suspicions at the moment He watched me and didnt dare say a word I gave him some time to be honest with me before looking through his phone and he reassured me there was nothing I went to his recently watched in tiktok and I found gems there He watched these typical girls with boobs bigger than their heads move their butts and boobs sensually Then there were many replays of this girl we both knew he talked to before ever getting with me He didnt say anything and denied ever doing anything with her videos only getting hard and then looking for other stuff to jerk off which I think is a complete lie but still Not only did he break promises by telling and promising me that he didnt watch corn or other girls but also lied to me about it until I figured it out He was never honest and I believe that he still is hiding things from me just because I didnt figure them out yet It was already bad that he did this but worse when it was his ex situationship I need some help and opinions to clear my mind I dont know if Im crazy or being rational I would appreciate other peoples experiences dealing with wrong people and then finding a good person for you I need to believe that this is not the love I deserve and that theres many guys out there that wont do this to me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 17:00:28 UTC,0,31,0.33,,,0,0

1j6ol0l,The work I did for CPS still hauntsrevisits me 10 years later,I worked for Child Protective Services in a metropolitan area of the US for 12 years I did both long term case management and later investigations that led to the removals of children With about a decade of time and reflection Ive come to realize the following I was a young woman with lots of privilege who did not understand the lives or needs of the people over whose lives I made decisions for This now causes me great pain Turns out I was dissociating through most of it due to secondary trauma and moral injury The ability to dissociate although we just saw it as toughing through back then was seen as showing that you were a great worker and could get shit done I wanted to do good in the world and I wanted to help children And I did But I also caused harm because I had too many cases not enough supervision and no real selfawareness It took years of therapy to understand and grieve the harm I had caused and the harm caused to me I dont even remember the first few years of my childrens lives because I was so dissociated I often have to look at a photos to remember events with them I still get flashbacks of things I was exposed to and am swapped with pain Sometimes it all comes back Just this week I was contacted by a former colleague and a child who was on my caseload many years ago The colleague reminded me of a child death case we worked on It was particularly searing because we both had children that were about the same age as the child who died She also reminded me about the death of another colleague through an aneurism and the suicide of a couple others Yes our work had a death count The girl now an adult reached out to me to say she is doing well and to thank me for helping her find an adoptive home Its a mixed bag And these memories reinforce in me the idea that nothing in life is guaranteed and Im just trying to do the best I can each day I screw up and I repair where I can I put kindness and compassion into everything I do but that isnt always enough I dont really have a purpose for this post Just wanted to get it off my chest,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 19:17:14 UTC,566,28,0.98,,,0,0
1j5ij2t,I wish I had ignored his suicide note,TLDR I am a sex worker and I let a client get too obsessed He threatened suicide when I ended things with him and I went to the police on the off chance he was serious It turned out to just be another ploy to try and get me to talk to him Lets preface this with I am an independent sex worker I do in person sex work by the hour and its my job because I enjoy it and it gives me a lot of financial security My best friend Celia also does sex work and we share notes about the job and even have the same clients on occasion She met John first John is an obese 300lb man early 30s and a high maintenance client He was very recently divorced because he cheated on his high school sweetheart wife with another friend from high school He left his wife only to have his new girlfriend leave him about a month later for another man Why did he cheat on his wife Because she had gained so much weight that he no longer found her attractive I saw photos of her she was barely overweight He on the other hand nearly doubled his weight since they got married John is a home inspector for an insurance company He makes good money by inspecting a high volume of homes but part of the job is using all the data collected to write personalized reports on each home inspection When John was married his wife did the reports for him this was illegal because the information is supposed to be confidential but he was able to get away with it because they lived together and she used his work PC to help him out So he left his wife then his girlfriend of two months left him He was desperate to get her back any which way and knew she needed money so he offered to pay her to do the reports for him which worked out because his wife was no longer willing to do them He figured out a way to log into his work from her PC trained her up and used his position as her boss to make her spend as much time with him as possible so he could potentially win her back he would only ever pay her in person for example and coerce her into spending hours with him before he paid her the money This isnt important to the story it just gives background information on his history of inappropriate relationships and manipulating women In the meantime he started seeing escorts to fill the sexual void Eventually he met Celia and very quickly fell into limerance For the first time since his ex girlfriend left him John had a new woman to obsess over He shared his whole life story with Celia texted her all the time and visited her more often than he could afford She found him exhausting to see he had strangled dick syndrome from a porn addiction and struggled to get off but would urge her to keep trying He talked constantly about himself overshared about his childhood trauma and would stay longer than he paid for forcing her to have to kick him out each time She set boundaries about him texting her so much and taking so much of her emotional energy but he kept breaking them So she enlisted my help I have a few more years experience under my belt and felt confident that I could handle his neediness After she talked me up he agreed to meet me The appointment was a success I was able to work around his strangled dick problem and he began to see us both regularly But it became obvious that he was obsessive and inappropriate He talked about Celia nonstop and shared personal details about their time together with me He also shared private details about his exwife and exgirlfriend When he saw Celia he talked about me and overshared in a similar way It made her very uncomfortable and she set boundaries around it He didnt abide by the boundaries so she fired him He was devastated But I was able to distract him and help him process the heartbreak He felt betrayed by her because she treated him as a client and he felt like he deserved better treatment I gently defended her actions but not so much that it would offend him By this point I was earning steady money seeing him so I didnt want to risk jeopardizing that cash flow I could see that he needed the full girlfriend experience so I gave it to him He was very insecure so I often needed to reassure him that he could count on me that I would be a stable person in his life so long as he kept paying my rates for time together I allowed him to take me to dinner off the clock occasionally and texted him back on occasion I didnt get triggered by his incessant texting in the same way as Celia It worked out pretty decently for a few months I felt like I was meeting his needs and he seemed happier and more stable Unfortunately my carefully set boundaries started to erode He didnt see me as an escort anymore he saw me as a sugar baby Then as a girlfriend He told me he loved me Often He started celebrating anniversaries for us and booking me for holidays I too found his company exhausting The whining the complaining the bad decisions the love bombing the delusional thinking It started to be too much I felt like I was wearing a thick mask while I was with him forcing myself not to show my disgust I hated the way he bragged about how much money he made while breaking the rules to do it I hated his nice guy syndrome and how entitled he felt to attention from women I hated the way he would eat dairy despite being lactose intolerant I hated the way he binged on McDonalds after eating a large dinner with bottomless cokes I hated the way he touched me and kissed me I hated the self obsession and the victim mentality he had I couldnt stand his inability to take any personal accountability in his life I eventually learned that despite making over 300k a year he was completely maxed out in debt because he had a gambling addiction in addition to his sex addiction He learned to count cards at the casino and managed to con a younger card counter I think he was only 21 into lending him tens of thousands of dollars to invest into being an advantage player at the casino Unfortunately John lacked discipline and lost everything on slot machines To his credit he is planning to pay the kid back but learning about this made me incredibly nervous and I started to get the sense that I was in over my head I hated the way that he would talk about being sexually abused as a child without warning in excruciating and disgusting detail I hated that he would rather spend money he didnt have on escorts and gambling than see a therapist I felt gross and drained for hours or even days after seeing him and would sometimes have to turn down other work because I didnt feel up to it The last straw for me happened Feb 16 We were supposed to see each other on Valentines day but I fell ill with the flu a few days earlier He complained every day while I was sick and pestered me dangling the money for my overnight fee over my head He wasnt able to schedule another overnight until March so if I didnt see him by Sunday I would lose out on the 2000 Also he just really really really needed to get laid and if I didnt see him hed go see another escort So still feverish and really fucking ill I let him come see me Its important to note that the first time he booked me for an overnight he touched me in my sleep This is a hard NO for me and I let him know Subsequent overnights he did not cross that boundary But this night I woke up again to him assaulting my body in my sleep My heart was racing and I felt so violated that I wanted to cry I didnt want major confrontation so I just pushed his hands away and told him I was still trying to sleep But I spent the rest of the night on high alert only able to doze for short periods of time After that I knew it was time to stop seeing him Because we planned our appointments for each month up to two months in advance it did not seem appropriate to simply ghost him I struggled to find the right way to end it I knew he was obsessively attached to me and it would be chaotic no matter how gently I tried to let him go Then an opportunity presented itself He saw another escort and fell asleep in his car in her parking lot He woke up to the police questioning him and searching his car and phone He cracked under pressure and admitted to paying for sexual services He told them about me and about her They chose not to arrest him or press charges but when he related all the information to me I decided to seize this excuse to stop seeing him I told him that for my safety I did not want him to ever contact me again At first he said he understood and said goodbye And then for the next five days he bombarded me with texts and emails He also sent YouTube videos of him crying and begging snot dripping Or drunk and begging and crying Then sober and matter of factly laying out the reasons why my fears about his interaction with the cops was unfounded More texts more emails from different accounts I responded to none of it It made me feel even more disgusted by him honestly I hoped that he would eventually tire and just go the fuck away Then he emailed me a suicide note I didnt receive it until nearly four hours after he sent it because I was busy working It stated that by the time I received it it was already too late to stop him But then three hours after the email he sent me a YouTube video suicide note which seemed fishy It has my already frazzled nerves in shambles I worried that I could somehow be found responsible if he was found dead and they traced the cause back to me I eventually gave in and called the police I posed as a girlfriend and I hoped it would be a one and done call but they kept calling me back for more information I knew his address and full name and vehicle and they wanted copies of his suicide letters They tracked him down and it turned out he was absolutely fine He just wanted me to talk to him and was willing to do anything to make it happen I guess the cop successfully conveyed to him that he needed to stop harassing me because the emails texts and videos stopped He did message my friend but she told him the same thing the cop did that he had to stop harassing me through her or else wed go to the police I wish I had ignored his suicide note I feel tricked and Im still angry about it,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 08:03:59 UTC,567,36,0.93,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j4a10l,In an instant I saw two lives change forever in two completely different ways,I have been trying to process and work through what I saw yesterday but it has been really hard The event itself was a lot but now Im dealing with the whys which make me feel guilty since what happened has nothing to do with me I was just a witness I tried writing through it but it hasnt been enough so Im trying again thinking that if I get it in front of others I can start to live past it Yesterday evening I was sitting on this big rock while I was waiting for the bus A little ways down the road there was a taxi van He was either backing out or adjusting his Uturn but obviously reversing and not moving super fast From where I was sitting I didnt see how fast the bike courier was going when he hit the front side of the van And the biker immediately went under the front wheel of the van and I could hear him and his bicycle crunch under the tire The position the biker was on the ground was how he stayed for the whole 20 minutes that he was out there He never moved So Im almost positive he died during the collision or if there was some way he survived he could have been fully paralyzed But there werent many people to see the accident head on like I did A man in his Jeep came out and a few security from the booth around my stop is near a campus came out to help They checked for signs of life and directed traffic around him and had someone call 911 Police came and did much of the same The fire department came and started doing CPR but they didnt take off the mans helmet The ambulance came and I didnt see any defibrillator or adrenaline unless they did those things in the back once they loaded him on the gurney and took the man away But even after they put him in the ambulance it didnt leave or take off There wasnt a rush It felt like I was out there for two hours but it all happened in about 20 minutes And its hard to think about the collision and how if the biker hasnt passed away Im sure the injuries will last a lifetime And I think about the taxi driver who just sat in the van with his head down and how he will most likely lose almost everything because of an accident I dont know why I had to see it but I did and I dont know what to do with it if anything at all,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 18:28:08 UTC,7,2,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCEDEATH,0,0

1j6zmot,I 35m think my Brother 32m hates me,I dont know what spurred this on our relationship was always seemingly good I 35m think my Brother 32m hates me Ive been in a rough phase of my life moved back in with my parents had just a terrible string of events dovetailing with my business failing and the loss of my Father all in short period He died suddenly Im still working through that I was the one who took him to the hospital a few times that week but the last time it was a serious emergency and he didnt get out He died a few weeks later after being in a coma for the time This sort of at least in my opinion galvanized us into having a closer bond Or so I thought Dad dying was only a few months ago It hasnt been a year yet But Im still trying to pick up the pieces and start moving forward And it was like our relationship with each other improved over it We were a very loving family before but this hurt us and we leaned on each other more Then I learned the other day my Mom brought the hypothetical prospect of me being homeless I dont intend to be homeless But she brought it up to him or he brought it up to her and he flat out told her that if I ever end up homeless I am not going to be living in his and his wifes house For the record I didnt ever ask or mention this But this conversation took place behind my back and he apparently said that I was never going to be allowed to live with them They have a very large house btw essentially half the rooms are empty at any given day That shocked my Mother to hear that and she told me And quite frankly it shocked me too I am not going to be homeless But to hear someone you thought you could rely on if things ever went to total shit say that its sad But what made me more sad was remembering a conversation I had with him a few months before He told me his wife 31 fs best friend 30 f who has a kid and either got kicked out of her own house or cheated or something became a single mother My brother told me he was actively considering moving her and the kid INTO their house She who has had numerous problems from heavy drug use alcohol use partying hard who has seemingly reformed her ways was welcome to live with them It didnt end up happening because she QUICKLY found a new guy But that was a total shocker to me that I who has had no problems with drugs and alcohol who helps take care of his kid who buys her toys and plays with her who has bought them gifts every holiday is lower on the totem pole than the single mom best friend of the wife It totally blindsided me and I feel betrayed Im not at any risk of being homeless but the conversation came up between my Mom and him and thats how it went To think your own brother wont be there for you but will be for some sketchy broad is totally insane And for me its like Im feeling just heartbreak resentment sadness disappointment all mixing together I love him I still do but I feel like I just got betrayed Betrayed over something that hasnt happened yet But that he thinks so low of me is shocking really I dont know what to do,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 04:27:13 UTC,2,5,0.75,,,0,0
1j6vvos,I hate Childrens Sevices,I have to get something off my chest its been bothering me for a while Department of Childrens Services Australia are the most incompetent useless stupid government agency Ive ever had the displeasure of working with whom Im sure hire only the worst and dimmest of candidates and have fostered a culture of ineptitude and apathy throughout the system I have nothing but complete and utter contempt for the department and their so called social workers as I can say truthfully and without hyperbole or exaggeration that I have not seen them make a good call on a child or family situation in the 30 years Ive been cursed with their association I am a psych and behavioural analyst and run a disability and aged care support company in remote Queensland I am involved with the department because I provide therapeutic placement for children with disabilities My company as best as I can tell is one of the very few with capacity for kids with serious behaviours of concern certainly the only one that I am aware of in my or any surrounding regions judging by how far some kids come to be placed with us The ignorance on display from DoCs staff is breathtaking They dont listen They dont understand disability which to be fair I dont really expect them to not really but they just are not willing to learn Somehow the decisions they make seem tailored to be cruel and hurtful to parents for no good reason and they are openly hostile and dismissive to families they have independently decided they dont like Vague examples for privacy Single mother with 5 month old baby Has 2 other children in placement Meetings for one occur in Town A Meetings for the other occur in Town B She lives in City C The meetings are set for 8am for one and 9am for the other Town A is 90km 56mi from City C and Town B is 107km 66mi from City C Town B is 193km 119mi from Town A She has no car and relies entirely on public transport to get around This is utterly impossible There is a department office 7 minutes from her house by bus They flat put refused to entertain the idea of having meetings at that office or even just Zoom meetings She had to attend in person Every failure was used as evidence of inability to manage her time and proof she shouldnt have her children Child with serious behaviours of concern violence property destruction suicide ideation who was surrendered by family was placed with us on short notice because previous two placements claimed no capacity Probably because of the damages combined between the two of them No behavioural plan was supplied despite them having one and being requested for 7 weeks in the end I had to go behind their backs and track down the practitioner that wrote it myself DoCs severely downplayed the behaviours upon placement and frankly if we werent so good at our jobs and able to adjust so fast serious harm absolutely could have happened due to the lack of accurate information provided We got lucky those first few weeks Their sole focus is on reunification with the family Their solution was to force them together every weekend No support no plan just shove a violent individual in a house with a shellshocked family for 2 and a half days the siblings of which actively and with good reason do not want them there for a couple of days and hope for the best When sexual assault claims were made by a sibling DoCs ignored it and tried to push for the next weekend anyway It took a call to Childrens Safety who in turn made a stern call to DoCs for them to decide against that decision for a weekend I sat with the case workers and supervisors and went through the complex disabilities and mental health issue for this individual and explained what realistically needed to happen for reunification What to expect A recommendation for steps to take moving forward I thought it went well A follow up meeting with the school a mere 2 hours later and the case worker said that a fidget spinner should keep them occupied for 4 hours and thus solve the school attendance issues Moronic No attention paid whatsoever They openly blame the parents their lack of parenting for the issues Stay at home dad mum has a pretty unusual job that has her travel often but pays very well They mock her in meetings talking about how shes living her best life on holidays when shes away for a week working I am so frustrated They are now looking at foster care options Removal from a therapeutic placement where they have made real progress for example nearly 100k in damages zero school attendance between 2 placement over 3 months compared to us where we have had maybe 500 in damages and school attendance every day at first with support and now independently between an hour and 4 hours and we have had them for 6 months to be put with some unsuspecting and unqualified family for 700 a week Absolute madness I just want to scream into the void The family is actively working with us the school is actively working with us but DoCs DoCs dont give a shit And they hold the cards They claim they care but when it comes to complex disability they actively ignore vital information and forge ahead like it was a typical kid damn everyone else Sorry I got a bit ranty They just piss me off so much,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 01:00:02 UTC,2,0,0.76,,,0,0

1j45av7,Coworker shared with me that her niece is being molested and no one is doing anything about it,This happened two years ago and I still cry when I think about this I had a coworker at one point who had very thin boundaries she would consistently causally trauma dump at work without regard to how it affected others and mostly coped with her trauma through drinking Im fairly certain she was drinking at work but never saw her take swigs Just saw her acting intoxicated and smelling like alcohol I grew up with an alcoholic parent so her behavior was fairly uncomfortable for me to be around meaning I did not get close to her even though she shared many very private things with me I almost wish I had invested in her more just so I would know more about her family maybe I would have had enough information to intervene if I had befriended her One day her niece came in to work with her This little girl was probably about 5 When she walked in the door she had her hands cupped around the sides of her face so she could only see the ground in front of her She made no eye contact and would not verbally respond to anyone including her aunt This was the angriest child I have ever seen She glared at everyone held her hands in fists for almost the entire time she was there stayed completely silent and kept her back to the wall for the majority of the time she was in the shop Ive been through a lot of trauma therapy and it was very obvious to me that this child was hypervigilant if not in fight or flight After the child was picked up by another family member I stepped outside for a smoke My coworker the aunt of the child was already outside smoking I sat down next to her and she casually said to me my niece told her friend that someone licked her hooha It was like cold water had been dumped over my head as she told me more about it I felt so sick for so many reasons A FIVE YEAR OLD told their friend that someone licked their private parts that friend told her mom who told my coworkers nieces parents And no one was doing anything actionable No therapy no intervention no questions Just shrugs and hope thats not actually happening After my shift I called child services and went to the police station by my work I tried everything I could to get a report filed a welfare check done literally anything Because I didnt have the name of the childs parents the police AND child services told me I didnt have enough information to complete a report I called so many times with different ideas of how I could make a legitimate report but I simply didnt have enough information I think about this multiple times a week sometimes every day for the entire day I myself am someone who survived CSA I have complex trauma and I know what its like to be a child in a setting where no adults are protecting you even when they know whats going on Our boss commit suicide that same week so everything at that work place became even more chaotic very quickly I left because I could not cope with the instability Part of me wishes I had stayed just to garner more information but that work place was so toxic that I started to experience suicidal ideation I had to leave for my safety Now that Im farther removed from the experience I feel like I could have pulled myself up by my bootstraps and stayed long enough to get more info for the sake of this little girl Im not sure why Im sharing this Yesterday this popped up in my head for the millionth time and I had such a strong reaction to the memory that I vomited I will never be able to get the image of that little childs angry face out of my head I dont think Ill ever forget her and I will always wonder if there is something I could have done to help,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 15:14:05 UTC,10,6,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0
1j3d6a0,The first time I ever hugged my dad was to stop his suicide attempt,This happened just a few months ago but everyone around me hasnt mentioned it since the night it happened My dad was neglected physically and from what Ive gathered in conversations sexually abused as a child His mother started him on hard drugs before the age of 10 By age 14 he was dealing to her He hasnt had anything close to an easy life But he wanted nothing more than to turn his life around when he had me He and my mom had me at 18 and 19 and were married about 4 months after my birth As far back as I can remember their marriage always had issues It wasnt easy for my mom being married to an addict He stayed clean for the majority of my childhood but I know he had relapses along the way Despite the issues my parents have built a good life for me and my siblings Moneys tight sometimes but we never are in need of anything My dad is clean and works a good paying job my mom works at the elementary school in our small town But the last two years Ive seen a huge change in how my dad was acting He was irritable constantly arguing with my mom and threatening divorce This all came to a breaking point one night when my parents both considerably drunk were having some meaningless argument fueled by alcohol and resentment In the middle of the argument my dad just got up and left the house I watched him walk into the garage shutting to door behind himself I figured he was just taking some time to cool off so I didnt think much of it About 20 minutes later my mom came to me crying telling me to go check in on him I now know that he had been mentioning taking his life to her in private I went and opened the garage door and found my dad crying at a table with a ladder and rope in the middle of the garage I didnt even look at him I was staring at the ladder I didnt know what to say His first response to me walking in was being angry with me He told me if I thought that he was going to kill himself that way I was wrong He said he had much better methods of doing so I didnt leave and I didnt respond I sat down on the other side of the garage and we sat in silence Eventually he began crying profusely and telling me he didnt know how to deal with himself anymore and I started crying too He told me I didnt have to worry about him put the ladder and rope away and told me to go back in the house But it still didnt feel right to me Before I went inside I walked over to him without saying a word and hugged him We stayed that way for a few minutes both crying When we stepped back he grabbed a pistol from his waistband and handed it to me I took it inside without a word and made sure it was put back into the safe with the ammo separate We never mentioned this night again and its been eating me alive from the inside out,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 15:22:38 UTC,0,2,0.5,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0

1j42ewg,It feels like I was SAd even though it probably wasnt sa,The whole thing happened over 10 years ago and I had actually repressed the situation pretty well until my ex messaged me again recently Now I think about it every day and have panic attacks because of it Back then we werent together yet but he knew that I was in love with him One evening we were at his best friends place and the two of them were smoking a bong They wanted me to smoke as well I asked what it was and they said weed Being stupid I took a hit but whatever it was it definitely wasnt weed At first I got extremely dizzy then I couldnt move anymore and I started panicking inside because I couldnt speak or even breathe After about 10 minutes his best friend told him to check if I was still breathing which he did When he confirmed that I was still breathing the other guy left the room to go to sleep Thats when my ex started undressing me and then had sex with me It must have lasted for several hours and towards the end I was somewhat conscious again and could have said something But I didntI just couldnt At some point he stopped and I went home I had never felt as horrible lying in my own bed as I did after that night Afterward I desperately wanted to be with himprobably because I thought it would somehow undo what had happened About a year later we actually got together But maybe Im overinterpreting the situation After all he knew I loved him so maybe he thought I wanted it too Ill probably talk to my therapist about it but Im afraid Im making it into something bigger than it actually was Besides it was my fault too I dont know I just wanted to get it off my chest,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 12:55:19 UTC,0,4,0.25,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0
1j59s2n,Influencer Marketing Agencies Are a Scam I Worked for 3 of the Biggest Ones,I worked at three of the biggest influencer marketing agencies over the last decade and now that I dont its finally safe for me to speak the truth without risk to my career I need to expose that whole industry as a scam and no one is talking about it Influencer Marketting agencies make almost all their money NOT from sponsorships but from influencers paying them monthly fees to FIND them sponsorships that never happen I was shocked each time I got a new job at a new influencer marketing agency to discover they all work the same way colleagues who mentioned it were fired or made redundant Its kind of like a pyramid scheme Out of thousands of influencers paying monthly subscription fees almost no sponsorships actually happened in the years I was there All of our workload was dedicated to finding more influencers to sign up rather than sponsorship companies Think about it why would we need sign ups in the first place if we can find sponsors Wed obviously take a cut of sponsorship as that would make more money right Whats going on is dishonest amp takin advantage of the poor Most people think that a large following of 500K followers makes that person wealthy The reality is that 99 of people with 500k followers on insta and tiktok and in many cases youtube shorts make nothing Ive worked with influencers sleeping in cars couchsurfing living below the poverty line for years incredulous to the fact they arent making anything while my colleagues persuaded them to continue building a following and that sponsors were just around the corner We would be told to persuade these people to by dangling carrots like this Many of them worked 20 hours a day to build a following often from uplifting or positive content and werent narcissists it is not a pleasant life and I knew of so many like this I dont like how the industry is taking advantage of these people Websites like SocialBlade are hilarious the number of times Ive seen them claim people are making 500K per year but in reality theyre earning nothing It happens all the time The key is that most audiences arent monetisable no matter how big they are and the ones that ARE monetisable eg technical topics are nigh on impossible to persuade sponsors to bite because theyre all so stuck in the past they think of social media as something free and will only pay to advertise on TV or via traditional routes To make things worse 99 of companies reaching out just want free advertising They offer exposure or a cheap free product and refuse to pay They all think that someone with a large social media following is a philanthropist millionaire or can eat free products didnt work full time to build that following and doesnt need income Meanwhile marketing agencies exploit this situation by selling influencers false hope and taking their money with no return It has to be biggest public perception vs reality mismatch Ive ever seen on such a grand scale No one is talking about this Agencies wont talk about it because their income comes from maintaining the lie Influencers themselves wont talk about it as they fear it might destroy their chances of getting a sponsor in future which is never going to happen So I had to get this off my chest now that I dont work for them anymore Im frankly amazed these companies havent been shut down Im sorry but I cant name myself or the companies for obvious reasons but theyre all the same afaik and I cant give examples of specific social media accounts for similar reasons unfortunately Therefore you dont have to believe me on this but I speak the truth amp just happy to get this off my chest My advice to you if youre unable to find sponsors for social media following Dont waste any more time on it Views cant pay your bills Dont waste your life Dont trust any social media marketting agency that requires a monthly subscription fee from you if they are genuine theyll operate on a percentage of sponsorship deals that they obtain for you NOT a monthly fee from you Dont trust when anyone tells you youre just marketting wrong its impossible to have no income on 500k followers they dont know what theyre talking about unfortunately Most influencers even in the 500k braket make NOTHING but none will admit it for fear of it sabotaging their future chances Spend your time reskilling to do something else that will make a living dont fall for this scam Even monetisable accounts with monetizable topics are VERY HARD to get sponsors for thats why so many dont have a sponsor for years Dont fall for the if I get a big following I will automatically find ways to make an income trap There Off my chest,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 23:45:44 UTC,17,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j5fjlk,I hate how I obsess over people I care about and its ruining me,Every time I get close to someone my mind starts obsessing over them and I absolutely hate it This is the third time its happened and I feel like its destroying me because with the first two I ended up pushing them away and we eventually became strangers again Right now Im obsessing over a really close friend in our small friend group of three Weve known each other for almost three years give or take and were so close we even refer to each other as siblings But recently something changed ad Ive started obsessing once again I cant stop thinking about them I always want to talk hang out or just spend time with them And when they spend that time with someone else I get jealous to the point where it physically hurts and I even feel betrayed in a way Before you think Im completely nuts I know this isnt okay I dont start arguments and I never tell them how I feel because I know I dont have the right to control who they spend time with or talk to I would never want to make them uncomfortable or make them feel like they owe me anything But that doesnt stop the thoughts from eating me alive I cannot help but wish I had them all to myself Sometimes instead of hanging out Ill say Im tired or I dont feel like going out when in reality I do want to spend time with thembut I just cant handle it mentally So instead I drive alone late at night trying to escape the overwhelming thoughts I dont want to lose yet another person because of my own obsession I am trying my best to stop but so far Ive made little to no progress,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 04:44:45 UTC,3,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j6sqzk,Years ago I had a close call with a motorcyclist Now I cant stop worrying about it Am I overthinking,I recently remembered an event from the past and I havent been able to stop thinking about it It happened a long time ago so its possible that what I remember is not exactly what actually happened A few years ago in 2022 when I was 14 I was coming home from school with some friends when an idiot thought it would be funny to open my backpack and ring a doorbell without telling me Immediately afterward everyone started running I quickly zipped up my backpack and for some reason I dont remember I decided to cross the road to the other sidewalk instead of running forward Maybe it was because there were too many people in front of me making it difficult to run quicklyI dont know I really dont remember The thing is as soon as I stepped onto the road an older man on a motorcycle appeared right in front of me just a few meters away I moved away as fast as I could and got back onto the sidewalk where I had been before I think I remember the driver swerving a little when he got scared after seeing me though Im not entirely sure about this I didnt hear any noise that would suggest the man had fallen nor did I hear a scream of painjust a Me cago en la madre which roughly means For fs sake in Spanish which I believe means he kept driving I think The problem is that I dont know if I started running once I stepped back onto the sidewalk which could have prevented me from noticing an accident if it happened But its more likely that I stayed still after stepping away from the roadat least long enough that I would have noticed if anything had happened Im not sure what exactly happened in that moment It all happened so fast and its been a few years since then When I saw the idiot who opened my backpack again all he did was laugh I guess he saw what happened in some way and thats why he made fun of me when we met again Or maybe I told him about it and then he started laughingI dont remember I also seem to recall that I had two other friends behind me on the other side of the road and when they caught up with us they were laughing too If what I remember is correct that would mean nothing actually happened I got home feeling like an idiot but at no point did I think I might have caused an accident Ive walked through that area dozens of times since then and while I wasnt specifically looking I never noticed any signs that an accident had happened I also searched online for news from that year in my city and I didnt find anything similar to what I experienced I never heard anyone mention that day again which reinforces my belief that nothing actually happened I recently remembered this incident and I think Im becoming paranoid Im scared by the possibility that the man could have had a serious accident or that someone nearby might have been hurt since it was a very busy area at that time with lots of cars and many kids coming back from school Ive been really worried for the past few days and I honestly feel bad about it Do you think Im just being paranoid I need someone to reassure meIm a bit scared,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 22:27:28 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j5kpxw,I feel such deep gratitude towards someone and cant share it,When I was 17F I met someone A woman Online I never met her in real life even years later We only spoke on the phone once for an hour years later It was basically a purely texting relationship It was a blogging site one of those where you just wrote an online diary basically We hit it off as conversation partners but it wasnt more than that for around a year We didnt even talk that often but when we did it was magical She was much older than me and I knew it from the beginning She was 31 when we met It was weird for me to talk to someone older but it just worked and I didnt think about it much so I rolled with it We talked almost exclusively about a shared hobby A year later I was having a complete breakdown It was my first major mental health breakdown I think I was just lost in transitioning from school life to college life I suffered alone for a year I didnt really have a support system and after that I decided to open up about it in my online diary I didnt know what I expected if I expected anyone to care But she suddenly supported me She talked to me a lot She said she had been through the same things so she understood what I was feeling And thats how it started she explained to me A LOT about how mental health works When I was a teenager I didnt believe in mental health Till it bit me in the ass I mean I had this major breakdown and suddenly my nonexistent mental health incapacitated me I had severe fatigue panic attacks even diarrhea So the woman basically taught me some basic concepts explained some basic things to me I started to read up on therapy psychology wed discuss issues It was also magical she just got me Id never had the privilege of having anyone in my life who understood me gave me a manual to myself I internalized my familys approach of youre just a lost cause hysterical little shit and theres nothing left to do with you but ignore you when you get difficult And with her I suddenly understood that I wasnt hysterical That my feelings had a cause That I could actually fulfill my needs and there would be no breakdown So she taught me how to relate to myself in a healthier way how to be on my side always And the best part She never actually lectured me on anything never made me do anything never got mad at me for not trying anything And she was always respectful to me despite the age difference She never played the Im older and I know better card even though she was definitely older and knew better She just explained how things work for her and how she thought it worked for me too because were so similar and I could take it or leave it She just treated me the way that I understood how to treat myself Like shed do or tell me things thatd calm me down or help me get out of despair or a panic attack and I made a mental note oh thats what I need when Im having a panic attack Yes this works for me when Im overwhelmed Ok thats what Ill ask for when I need support next time I think I was going through this very major and lifechanging breakdown for about a year My health was never the same after that still isnt 13 years later but I was slowly learning to live with this new version of myself I felt more stable but I still needed a lot of support And she was there I dont think Id be alive or relatively sane right now if it wasnt for her during that first year if it wasnt for her guidance and gentleness I really had no one especially no one who understood me like she did Shes the one who made me try therapy Not by talking about it she never went to therapy herself but a couple of months after we started talking about my mental health I was reading some posts about therapy and understood that what I felt with her I could find in therapy And I got really interested in it with her I couldnt ask for more or for a more stable presence With a therapist I could get that presence for an hour a week on a regular basis Well I never found that therapist with whom I had this magic Never found anyone even remotely not hurtful actually I have a bad trauma from therapy by now tried 20 therapists The woman was really the only person in the world who got me to relax and listen to her without fighting and rejecting right away Others would just trigger me hard trigger a defensive response and then hurt me when I couldnt accept what they were saying even though I was fighting myself hard not to push them away With her it felt like she was going through the minefield of my psyche knowing exactly where to go and where not to go and how to neutralize at least some of the mines without setting an explosion off And the most awesome effect was that the neutralization usually had ripple effect shed make one small thing feel slightly better and I could feel the chain reaction of things correcting themselves months later things that were unrelated to the first conversation It went on for years I mean she wasnt my therapist but We talked about our lives hobbies mental health It was always the olderyounger dynamics but not in a bad patronizing way shed just explain things but she never pushed She never said that because Im younger I dont get to have a different opinion Never laughed at me Never tried to make me respect her She didnt need to Ive never respected anyone like this in my life She doesnt have a conventional successful life never married never moved out of her familys apartment she didnt even work most of her thirties for reasons I didnt fully understand but never pushed her to share But I respected her more than anyone who had all those She was very smart driven understood things deeply always treated people with respect everyone she had this quality of attracting people to her like she didnt wait for anyone to start talking to her like I did if she saw someone she found interesting shed just initiate And she treated vulnerability with care Doesnt matter what happened between us doesnt matter if I hurt her unintentionally Id never do anything bad to her intentionally doesnt matter what was happening she never used any one of my open wounds never chose to set any of the mines just to hurt me back And she could do it at any moment She spoke my language she knew how to put things exactly in a way that her words would have the most effect so she could destroy me She never ever even tried in all those years Not even when the relationship went sour and she was annoyed with me for years Shed snap at the small things once she started aggressively attacking me in a discussion about Harry Potter Not memy thought process Thats when I knew it wasnt just a rough patch but truly over but she never went for my traumas Not even when she didnt enjoy me anymore As I said the way she treated me had a ripple effect fixing things without her even trying Through the years the way she treated me talked to me I developed that inner compass as I call it basically this feeling that in my life Im the one who always knows best Even if I make mistakes Im still the one who knows best and Ill course correct if I make a mistake I dont mean that I feel that Im always right about everything just in my life in things that concern me It was very different from what my family told me youre incapable of anything you should listen to us you dont have a brain That inner compass made me finally start living my life Not what my family thought was best what I felt like doing And the most beautiful part of it was that these things were not what the woman wanted either They were truly mine I moved to another country something I always wanted She clearly couldnt understand my decision but that didnt matter It was mine I started speaking another language English more because thats what I always wanted and she couldnt understand it either And it didnt matter I knew what I wanted And a thousand choices like that that she watched me make and kept her mouth shut enough Because of this inner compass I feel like there will always be a part of her in me wherever I go As Ive said the relationship went sour With years I understood that this dynamics of her keeping me at arms length I never knew much about her her struggles she never let me support her doesnt work for me anymore And I wanted to actually talk on the phone actually meet her All I could get out of her was one phone call and after that she was always not in a good place for a call I finally was brave enough to admit to myself that I wanted more of her and that Im an equal in this relationship and an adult too so I have the right to pursue it and wanted to have a relationship She was vague about it And then her reaction made me not sure about it too At some point she did try to rely on me more and I didnt get it I guess and it hurt her immensely and when I understood that I hurt her it was hard to forgive myself she was someone I NEVER wanted to hurt Not for any reason And then we talked about everything the dynamics my feelings our wants and desires and just like that it was over slowly quietly not really too painfully and immensely painfully for me at the same time but I mean she didnt really hurt my feelings I was just hurting because it ended It was 7 years after we started talking But I could never forget her Id text her sometimes just to know how she is Nothing too personal just to know if she was ok Shed get annoyed at me for that I couldnt really understand why Shed say something about me trying to be a peoplepleaser and showing that I still care when I dont At some point I asked her if I should stop texting her because I clearly annoy her She said yes I tried I tried for two years And then I texted her again and said that Im not a child anymore I was 28 at the time and I dont want to live in a world where we dont talk We didnt have to be best friends but I was certain we had to talk Sometimes About anything At some point And she agreed It was weird and I was the one texting her mostly And then it fizzled out I never talked to her about it There was nothing left to talk about nothing left to say But I still think about her when something good happens in my life When something bad happens and I handle it like a capable adult without falling apart When I manage to choose myself instead of caving in Yesterday was one of those days I couldnt keep it in the last one was a year ago and she did acknowledge it even if briefly I texted Hey its one of those days when I cant help it but want to wish you the best So here I am wishing you the best Youre incredible and I feel so lucky to happen to live on this Earth when you exist She read it immediately and left me on read Im not sure why She used to tell me that she doesnt know what to say when people tell her good things and she used to do it with me too But she usually acknowledged it Now she didnt Did she think I was weird for texting it Did I make it awkward Was it too much I guess Ill never know But ChatGPT told me to try and write it in a journal so here I am on this sub trying not to bother the most magical connection of my life with my gratitude Ive been in love I have parents siblings well cousins Ive had best friends And this connection was everything in one an older sibling whos almost like a parent whos also my best friend and with whom Im absolutely in love She was my first adult love the love when you dont just fall for someone because you think theyre perfect but the love when the more you see the imperfections the more you respect and love the person You understand how difficult their life is and respect how beautifully theyre fighting and what a strong and capable person they are despite all their limitations My life and mental health are in no way perfect Ive made a lot of mistakes some

1j4oji3,Im growing sick of my mentally ill sucidal partner and Im too scared to end things,Headline says a lot Im dating someone that is very very openly suicidal and refuses to get help for it Seems like no matter what I do nothing gets through to him about finding help speaking with someone far more qualified than I am or even admitting he needs to get things under control before he puts himself in even worse health I constantly have to hear him complaining about how everything is everyone elses fault the world turned its back on him and how nothing matters since nothing goes right for him anyway Its wearing me down Hard I try so hard to see things on the other side and keep suggesting that he sees someone about this because I can only do so much but now its to the point where I want to slap the shit out of him and try to literally knock some sense into him before having him committed against his will so someone can drug him enough to where hes far less annoying Only thing is I love him so much that I cant do anything but go along with it because im petrified of waking up one day after being honest with him and finding out he did himself in I have no one to talk to about this My friends keep telling me to leave him and they see how tired I am from dating him and constantly trying to keep his spirits up I know were heading down that road if this keeps up but I also know that if we do end things Ill always be dreading that phone call letting me know he took his own life I also know that once this is over ill never date again because ill never be able to open myself up to potentially dating another selfish suicidal asshole who only thinks about themselves I also know that without him ill likely be so stressed and lonely ill have a broken heart to deal with and thatll do me in Im finding my own therapist to talk to about all of this but goddamn it I cant handle another night of him being brutally honest about wanting to die and I just sit here and quietly take hearing about it My love life hasnt ever been perfect but I was hoping so badly this would be the one relationship to finally break my streak of finding someone to be with that wasnt me clinging on to the first person who gave me some sort of genuine attention I should have known finding love that would stick around was never meant for me I dont even know why I bothered in this relationship I should have known the happiest ive ever been in life with someone by my side would also be the most miserable ive ever been I dont know what else to do Only thing I can think of is just staying the course and seeing what happens Typing all this out helped but I know this time tomorrow morning ill wake up and realize im still going to be with someone that refuses to help himself and its just a matter of when not if,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 05:38:58 UTC,4,1,0.83,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0

1j7ungd,A letter to the girl I loved the most but never met,Throwaway account for obvious reasons This message has been sitting in my drafts for a really long time I could never find the courage to actually send it to her I dont think I can even today So here I am sending this out in the void hoping that one day it reaches her somehow After checking out her WhatsApp DP for one last time I finally decided to delete her contact as I prepare myself to let go and move on with my life From strangers to friends and now back to strangers only this time with bittersweet memories of eachother Hey I have been really thinking about everything that happened recently and I honestly dont think I can continue like this anymore I know we already discussed this before but I hadnt fully processed my emotions at that time I really care about you a lot and love you beyond words can express but this onesided attachment is going to take a huge emotional toll on me I also really hated your nonchalant behavior that day and the way you were acting so cold towards me and pushing me away like you suddenly decided your feelings have changed and we cant fit into each others lives whereas just a few days back you were telling me how you would wrap yourself around me and wouldnt let me leave the bed and all like all such moments meant absolutely nothing to you Something which I never told you last year on 31st I was so fed up by everything that had happened between us in those last few days that I just kept drinking and drinking until I finally lost consciousness right there in the club My friends had to literally put me in a wheelchair and take me back to the hotel room At times they couldnt even feel my pulse and for a moment everyone thought I was a goner The only thing I remember before passing out is wanting to talk to you on call because I just wanted to hear your voice one last time I truly believe God gave me this second chance at life for a reason and I am going to make the most out of it With everything going on especially with you moving to UK this year we would be emotionally distanced even further and eventually things are going to fade away and we both know it It is the start of a new chapter in your life soon and for me too as I will have to learn to live without you Our lives are just pulling us in different directions at this point You were right We have very different personalities backgrounds values and our future goals dont align either That is a gap which is difficult to bridge I really respect your feelings and boundaries and I have finally come to accept the unfortunate reality that things have changed between us now I dont want either of us to continue holding on to something halfheartedly I truly believe that destiny brought us together and meeting you was a part of my journey I am really grateful to you because I never knew I was capable of loving someone so much and that too without expectations until I met you What we shared was real and meaningful and I will always cherish those memories After all we shared a bond that has lasted for almost a decade without ever physically meeting each other But despite all this things never really took off which is why I think maybe we were never actually meant to be together but only to be a part of each others journeys I will really miss you Janhavi I will miss our chats and vc and how I was always able to be myself around you I will miss waiting for your text for days and months every time we had a fight how my day used to light up after seeing your text first thing in the morning how my heart used to melt after hearing your sweet voice how I used to play your voice notes again and again every time I missed you how I struggled to keep up because you talk so fast how I used to secretly steal glances at you when we were on vc how my heart used to skip a beat after randomly receiving your text in the middle of the night how I used to play my favorite songs to you on Spotify to convey my deeper feelings how you used to always come back to me after every fight and we would start talking again like nothing happened how you used to secretly install Kik on your moms phone every night to chat with me and I used to stay awake waiting for you sometimes even till morning how you made chocolates on my birthday and then ate them yourself on vc how we used to send each other those disaster selfies how you used to fall asleep on vc while talking and I used to continue admiring you sleeping how Sab Tera is still my favorite song even today because it was the one you sang to me how we had Maggi at 3 AM on vc and you made fun of me for having a cupcake with it and so many more such cute memories that I cant even possibly list them all here but these memories will always be a part of me and I will carry them with me forever It was pure innocent love at its best My life somehow always felt complete with you and stupid me always believed you were the one and that you were my soulmate and that one day I would definitely marry you Its funny because I cant even tell you how many times I have rehearsed this whole scene in my head about how I would propose you But I was wrong In the end it was all in my head and you already had someone else in your life all these years I dont blame you though and neither do I hold any grudge against you because of it You will always be a huge part of my life regardless and someone who helped me understand love much more deeply and helped me grow as a person I will always be thankful to you for that I only regret that I never got to meet you in real life But then again I still believe you are an angel and it wasnt just your username and thats why I could never meet you You came into my life for a reason but now is the time for me to let go If it is meant to be I am sure God will bring our paths together once again maybe in this lifetime or the next But until then this is where we must both go our separate ways I wish you all the happiness in life and hope you can forgive me if I have ever hurt you in any way Good vibes only Goodbye my favorite stranger PS I am sorry for deleting our Spotify playlist yet again I know you said that when you cant talk to me you listen to it But baby I have to do this and it is what is best for both of us afterall,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 09:21:57 UTC,2,3,0.63,,,0,0

1j7f4bn,i am the result of my dads selfishness,its 1 in the morning right now and i really need to get something off my chest Back when my dad was in his 20s he got married happily and had 1 son and 1 daughter on the way they used to be financially stable and was able to live pretty comfortably not rich but comfortable but one day my dad decided to travel to a big city to find a better job this is where the problem starts he met my mom and fell hard for her as soon as he met my mom he filed a divorce letter to his ex wife who was pregnant at that time he left his wife just to be with my mom also abandoning his 2 children my mom didnt know this at the time and thought he was just a nice person eventually she did eventually find out about the family that he left behind when they were engaged however because the wedding is so close she didnt wanna cancel the wedding and decided to go through with it bad decision imo but whatever my dad and mom managed to run a very successful business like upper class stuff they got married and had me 20m ive always thought that i had a very spoiled life being able to afford things most people would kill for and even going to an expensive private school my dad did not pay a single penny for child support it was my MOM who sends his ex wife money keep in mind i was kept in the dark about this until my parents eventually divorced when i was 1314 for reasons i dont feel comfortable explaining i was eventually told that i have half siblings from my dads previous marriage and whats worse is learning that they are financially struggling all because of my dad abandoning his own family just to have me and now he did the same with me i havent seen my dad in months now and we are living with less money than we had i feel guilty the fact that i was born into a family where i was fed with a silver spoon while not knowing the financial struggles my half siblings are in if my dad was not an asshole i wouldntve existed by now to add salt to the wound my dad remarried and tried conceiving a baby through IVF i was so fucking pissed hearing that he abandoned my 2 older half siblings to have me and now hes abandoning me for an ivf baby my mom says that despite all of this i should still love my father as hes your father afterall but i just cant i really really cant,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 19:14:17 UTC,13,4,0.86,,,0,0

1j4q5vg,54 and struggling,Hi I when I was 12 I was playing in an arcade on the slot machines and a guy came up to me and started feeding my machine with cash I went back every week and he paid whilst I played This happended over a period which I cannot remember and then one day he started to stroke my penis Nobody had ever touched me here before so naturally my body reacted and I got erect even though i was scared as hell I continued to go back for six months then one day he took me to a cafe on the pier and bought me dinner Burger chips etc He undid my zip on my trousers and got my cock out and jerked me off and I came my first ever ejaculation I keep blaming myself because I kept going back to get jerked off and fed My mom was single parent and dad moved away I was left alone for hours when she was working I now realise I was groomed and sexually assaulted I still have these feelings of excitement when I remember this first time which then turn immediately to disgust at myself for saying nothing and letting it continue I have had therapy when i was 16 Long story but I was addicted to the machines by now and another guy started doing the same and pay me 40 for the privilege The money just went back on the machines This second guy groomed me so much I ended up going to his flat to see his spectrum computer and he continued there which turned to blowing me and paying me 40 The last time i went he raped me I ran away after and stayed out late and the police were out looking for me I was scared to go home as much bottom was so painful The police found me hiding under the pier and took me home I told them and mum that I had realised I was late home and rather than face the music stayed out as I was scared of getting into trouble So naturally I was in a vicious circle the later it became The accepted it and nothing was said about the assault I dont remember how I dealt with the pain but my brain has blocked some stuff out FF three years and the police turned up at myself home and said I had been exposing my penis to the public I seriously honestly have no recollection of this at all They cautioned me and my mum shouted and screamed when they went asking why until I broke down after she said has someone hurt you She got the police back and I made a statement To this day Ive never been told what happened the guy Whethery they caught him or not but I never had to go to court For years I thought they filed it nfa as I was just a dirty rent boy who deserved what he got I feel let down by the police as I know now that I was a child and it was grooming secual assault and rape I am a gay man and have never been able to take it sorry for the crudeness due to the memory I know its not everything but I know Im a disappointment for not being a real gay man When I have these feelings of not being good enough for anyone or deserving of anything I struggle and want to run away As i am a let down to others for not getting over it Ive been in a relationship for 28nyesrs and my partner he knows everything but I still regularly have these days of being not enoug people pleasing and feeling like everyone would be better without me For some reason I just had my first nightmare in over 35 years and it started with the first day of being touched at 12 and ended with the rape and police I woke up to my disgust with an erection which soon went down when i was awake I feel sick and cant believer my body reacted in this way to a traumatic memory I have felt guilty all these years that the guys who assaulted me made me erect and ejaculate but the therapist said it was just a natural reaction to being touched down there And Ive accepted it wasnt my fault Until now That dream has taken me back over 40 years and to wake up erect makes me wanna kill myself What sick fuck am i Or was it my 12 year old inner person that made meerect I am due at work in a cople of hours and cant face the world I am disgusted with myself again after all the years of counselling and accepting i was a child and they were adults and as such I took no blame whatsoever But this fucking nightmare has moved the goalposts Why the fuck would I wake up sexually excited over something so traumatic The only thing I can think of is yesterday my partner and I and his sister found out their dad my dad in law has secondary cancer and metastatic cancer which is obious a traumatic Could this trigger earlier trauma But the sick feeling of waking up with an erection makes me feel so low i cant tell anyone I wont kill myself dw I am a people pleaser and would never put my friends and family through that I have cptsd as 8 years ago my best mate took his life and I found him So I could never put others through what I have So in not killing myself I am a failure to me twice As I am pleasing others instead of me I just wanna go back to the day before yesterday when I felt a normal person Instead a funked up freak of nature,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06

1j54p4q,I hate one guy at work,TW Violence and threats I work at a care home for people with various physical and mental disabilities The one thing I absolutely hate is how passive management is with the participants They let them make any decision they want even if it ends up with someone falling down the stairs with little to no consequences The one guy they are horrible with and let him get away with anything He is extremely violent and has hurt me and others on numerous occasions The only consequence he faces is when he breaks things he just doesnt get to use it till its fixed or replaced Which is nothing the worst part is this guy is smart and knows he can do whatever he wants and get away with it The worst time I experienced this was when me and another staff took him out to buy him candy with his own money He wanted to buy a knife it was a butter knife and we said no It took alot just to get him away from the knifes and out the door We managed to get him some of his candy and as protocol we gave him some Still mad with us daring to say no he threw the candy at me and tried to run back to the store to get the knife so I can stab you fckers I had to do a hold to stop him from going too far and hurting someone else However the hold we are trained to do doesnt restrain both hands so they decided to scratch at my arm hard to the point I was bleeding It took a long time to calm him down and get him back in the car The part that broke me was the fact he wanted me the one shaking and crying to apologize and my coworker who did nothing but call management to let them know what was going on also tried to get me to apologize I couldnt cause I went completely nonverbal and just got in the car I missed a week of work cause I was terrified of that participant and was locked up in my room I filed a report for injuries but nothing came of it Now I just hate the participant Ill never do anything to hurt or try and upset him but I will always hate him and wish for his downfall One thing I want to note is that I understand alot of the people I work with cant control how they act This one in particular also struggles to control their anger However Ive seen them handle no from their parents and staff he likes and he was completely fine He just doesnt like me and gets upset any time I ask him to do something or deter him away from dangerous things Im not rude about it I always ask very nicely Im just not a guy or pretty enough so he hates me TLDR I despise a guy cause he can get away with anything he wants including hurting others and he knows it,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 20:06:44 UTC,0,2,0.33,,CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCEDEATH,0,0

my chest and put my experience somewhere in hopes itll make me feel better Im also posting this here because I dont want anyone to try and intervene itll just make everything worse Content warning for violence as well but suicide is mentioned first so I used that flair sorry My mom is an okay mom most of the time but shes very quick to anger and has total freakouts over small things that always result in herself threatening to kill herself or saying shes going to kill herself I have a little brother who is 13 and my mom is 45 with a history of suicidal thoughts and one attempt before we were born which she told us about Whenever we get into huge fights she usually takes my stuff and threatens to destroyburn it she never does she never lets me talk and always screams over me and then of course she threatens to kill herself and says its because of me and my brother and she says we ruined her life I can understand why she resents us to an extent my brother and I are rape babies and we look like our dad On the topic of him hes an abusive rapist who wasis addicted to drugs and who hasnt been in our lives since I was 3 He has gone off the radar for a few years and nobody knows where he is My mom keeps threatening to send us back to him and has shown us her text in him multiple times telling him shes done with us and that he needs to come get us He never has obviously The last few times weve gotten in fights I never even yelled once and just keep talking calmly because I heard that helps calm angry people down it doesnt work she just keeps yelling and theres even been a few times when I do raise my voice that she literally covers her ears and says lalalala like a toddler until I stop talking After she threatens this she usually leaves the house and says shes never coming back and says we can live with our grandmother She says either that shes gonna drive off a cliff into a brick wall etc etc or that shell just straight up abandon us and start a new life somewhere Then shell come back some time later and act like nothing happened very rarely shell apologize but if I ever try and bring up what shes done again when shes calm shell just get enraged again Ive tried talking to her about it through text only once when she was out of the house sending her a lengthy few paragraphs about my concerns but she responded back basically just shaming me and when she came home she was angry and she said she showed the text to all of her friends which are mostly my friends parents and she said they dont like me anymore and I wont be able to hang out with any of my friends anymore I started avoiding all of my friends and eventually began online school because of this and now my mom claims all my friends and their parents miss me and they dont understand why I dont talk to them anymore I dont know what to believe anymore When she isnt in these weird freak out modes shes an okay mom but she snaps at random stuff before flipping like a switch and being happy again Just yesterday she was yelling and slamming around her computer because she couldnt upload her photos to Facebook shes a photographer A few people had just been over to fix our dryer about an hour earlier which has been broken for months so mid yelling at her computer she just got up and went to go text out the new dryer and then when it worked she was all smiles and apologized for yelling She also frequently tells me and my brother that were the only thing keeping her alive and that she would probably kill herself without us and shes told us multiple times that she doesnt own a gun because shes afraid that when we grow up and move out shell kill herself because she has no one to rely on anymore This scares me and I want to move away for college when Im grown I planned on leaving this household as soon as possible but I dont really want to anymore because she keeps saying things like that She says stuff like that and says she loves me and my brother but then says the exact opposite when she gets really angry and says she wants to die because of us and she blames everything shes mad at on us stressing her out Shes also gotten physical with me and my brother multiple times like digging her nails into the back of my neck and holding my face into a pillow because I wouldnt give her my phone because she said she was gonna break it chokeholding me and dragging me out of me room before locking me out of my room and tearing it apart because I hid my art tablet from her and more Shes done stuff with my brother too and Im ashamed to admit this but I dont know what because whenever shes mad at him I just hide in my room so I wont get punished for helping him He does the same when she does that stuff with me I only know she hurts him because I can hear it I dont want to call the police Im scared and I dont want to live with my grandma or in a foster home or anywhere else and I dont want to be separated from my brother and pets She actually encourages me to call the police on her and says shed rather go to jail than live with us I just want to explain to her how her her actions hurt me and my brother and I want to get her to stop Theres been periods of times where everything has been fine for a while and my family is just a normal happy family and I cry sometimes thinking about how thats what my family could be like if my mom wasnt the way she was I know Im doing it to myself at this point by not calling the police but Im just scared and keep hoping things will change Right now is one of those times where everythings fine my mom is currently

1j65iqy,I got terminated from my volunteer position with no explanation,So I 18f just finished volunteering for the day at my workplace animal sanctuary yesterday when I got a message from my boss to see he sent me a termination letter nothing in the message either just the letter itself and they have ignored me since Also sorry this is a long one I just have a lot of things in my head I need to sort out So a bit of backstory since I was around 14 Ive been dealing with the struggles of depression anxiety and adhd and ended up leaving school in yr10 because of it Took a while to figure out but I ended up going to tafe to complete my cert ii and iii to become a qualified zookeeper as Ive always loved animals and cant see myself doing anything else Because of tafe I had to start volunteering to complete the practical component of my course and ended finding this amazing sanctuary to work at So I ended up starting there in early February 2024 and fell in love with the place and the people I was originally going once a week but started going twice a week in around November bc I loved it so much and wanted to be there more They always told me they loved how I would be there consistently every week and I would pride myself on it as it was a big commitment for me as I lived an hour away The environment there was great honestly I couldnt have asked for it to be any better The owners always quite involved and prided themselves on this and wanted us to feel more like family rather than a workplace Because of this I became quite close with the people who were on my days and considered them my second family The owners also lived on site and their kids were always around because of this I became quite close with them as well even buying them small presents for their birthdays and helping them with their homework I suppose Im telling you this so you understand how close I was with them their family and the other volunteers so you can understand how hurt I am by the way theyve handled this situation Even on my bad days they were half the reason Id get up in the morning even when I didnt want to drive or talk to people Id still show up bc I didnt want to let them down as again I seen them as my second family and greatly valued their opinion So fast forward back to yesterday it was completely normal Nothing out of the ordinary we were still talking like normal doing all our tasks as normal having lunch together like normal I even got a last minute tour and stayed back to finish it up which brought in a fair bit of money for them Also just a note its a nonprofit all the money from tours goes right back into the sanctuary to care for the animals food and water vet bills etc So just my little routine afterwards I stop on the way home to go to the bathroom get food etc So I was checking my phone like normal and seen he sent me an attachment funny thing is I thought he was sending me a dumb reel or something Boy did I have a rude awakening when I read termination letter So naturally I read through it and start crying because again that day was normal there was not even a hint that something like this was coming Luckily I had one of my friends with me so I didnt do something dumb like driving with so many tears in my eyes I could barely see and probably getting into an accident In the letter he basically highlighted the fact that he wants to maintain a positive workplace and while he values my input he needs to put the sanctuary first blah blah blah the typical things in a letter that would put the blame on me so he doesnt seem like the bad guy So one important thing to mention they say this to everyone but from the start they said that theyre the kind of workplace to make sure everyones included and dont like people to form cliques However I became really close to two people in particular specifically because theyre great friends and have done so much for me Now while I was really close with these two I feel we included everyone when we could Especially since some days at the sanctuary wed be so busy wed barely see each other that day So wed always go out for lunch however wed always ask everyone if they wanted anything and never ate out always came back to be a part of the whole team Wed all have a break at the same time Now obviously being friends wed hang out after work but again wed ask some people if theyd wanna come if we werent going too far away And we would call and stuff but I feel its normal for friends to do that So one thing I could see where they wouldnt have been to happy with this is that we were doing an animal course about 5 hours away You have to finish the online part first before you go do the practical bit So one of my friends told the boss that we were going to be doing it he already done it prior and was just driving us and unlike the last time it was done they didnt put it on the group chat or anything for people to say theyre interested I think they assumed wed tell people that we were doing it and ask if theyd want to come Mind you this was about a month in advance so plenty of time for people to do the online section I will say this course ends up being quite expensive so some people werent able to do it due to financial reasons anyway Anyways long story short one other person from the sanctuary ended up doing the course btw the course only has 4 spots for the Prac part We had a great time and included him in nearly everything we did he traveled separately to us so was only left out of stuff we did on the way We even had a game night and everything and really the only people who were left out were the people who couldnt come but wanted to which I dont blame them for I can only assume that this is the reason they fired us my friend that drove was quitting next week was going to be his last however they messaged him yesterday basically telling him to not come back and my other friend also got a letter similar to mine Again I was completely blindsided by this as yesterday and even the last few weeks were completely normal No they didnt even try to chat with us saying something like hey this is what we can see is happening and we dont like it can you just try to include the other people more Something like that and I wouldnt have been as devastated The only other thing it might be is that I would make some pretty crude jokes although I wasnt the only one that would say them and me and my boss would say them to each other and everything were Aussie btw its part of our culture I suppose if we dont know you or dont like you well be quite civilpolite to you but if we do like you then youll probably cop it although I dont think this was the problem bc again it wasnt just me making these jokes I guess what hurts the most is that I really respected my boss and viewed both of them quite highly Like theyre great people at least I use to think so theyre great parents really community oriented and from what Ive heard quite highly regarded in our field So basically for him to not even have the decency to even send me a message along with the letter it is what hurt the most So naturally I sent them both a message asking them to give me a call bc for my own peace of mind I really need an explanation Both of them I assume accidentally opened the message and I can see they read it however they both ignored it So I sent them an email this morning however still waiting on a reply Ive never been through a breakup but I imagine itd be like this except instead of breaking up with one person Ive just lost my second family With no warning no explanation Anyways thanks for listening to me ramble sorry it was so long Im just kind of at a loss for now Hopefully Ill stop crying and get out of bed soon Thank youse heart_hands TLDR I was volunteering at an animal sanctuary when I got a termination letter from my boss with no warning no explanation I feel like Ive lost my second family,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08

1j3bpsl,My wife had an affair when my mum died and blames me for the relationship breakdown,Hi all I 30m started posting some of these incidents in AITAH but it soon became clear that in some of these cases she very clearly is TAH and theres no point in even asking So Ive come here just to list all the effed up things that have happened to me in the final months of 2024 I anticipate this will be very long have fun So for some context In late 2023 my wife and I bought a house and I was spending a lot of time for a couple of months working on the house almost every evening and weekend I could spare During this time my wife started going out with some new friends including this guy J Randomly one evening she looks a bit funny and says to me I dont trust myself around him I hear this my heart sinks a bit but I feel like we have a strong relationship and I tell her I trust you not to do anything stupid just be sensible about what time and how you spend time with him She liked this and we moved on but I decided to keep an eye on the situation She started spending more and more time with him and these new friends going out and getting drunk while I was working late on the house It was starting to make me uncomfortable and eventually I said so I didnt ask for anything I just expressed my feelings She said she understood but theyre just friends and theres nothing to be worried about They keep hanging out until one day his partner a woman married to another man forbade him from speaking to my wife because she was jealous So he ghosted my wife and she got really upset It hurt me to see how upset she was for two reasons 1 My wife is upset thats upsetting 2 Shes so upset it feels weird and shes acting like a breakup She asked me to proof read a message she wanted to send and I read a bit and had to put it down I said this is a breakup message I refuse to do this She remained adamant they were just friends and nothing more I accused her of having an emotional affair again she denied it and was adamant they were just friends and that I need to get over this Some weeks later J comes back on the scene having broken up with his previous gf My wife says shes going to talk to him but be very boundaried I tell her that Im uncomfortable with all of this if shes going to see him she should be careful A week or two later she comes stumbling in at 5am I ask where shes been and she explains that she has been out with J went back to his place at around 2am and they played guitar I was hurt and upset this was the antithesis of everything we discussed I said you cant do that to which my wife took great offense accusing me of controlling her and being misogynistic To be clear I never forbade her from seeing him I never tried to tell her what to do beyond please be careful and dont do anything silly and please respect me That time I said you cant do that was the first and only time I specifically said what she could and couldnt do And to me its obvious I wasnt controlling her I was just not saying the quiet part out loud which is you cant do that unless you want to ruin our relationship She is adamant nothing happened and weirdly I believe her The issue for me is that she did the opposite of what we both agreed she disrespected me and my feelings and she is putting our relationship in jeopardy To her the issue is that I tried to control her by being upset and that Im putting restrictions on her She pointed out shes a grown ass woman and she can spend time with her friends if she wants to My being upset about it is a mode of control and I need to stop In principle I have no problem with her seeing her friends but this guy makes me uncomfortable So that all happened we were on the rocks she is clearly having an emotional affair at the very least but adamantly refuses to acknowledge it Im trying desperately to find a way to move forward and recover our relationship if we can Then October 2024 My mum died suddenly I wont go too much into it but it happened very sudden shocking it sucks My dad died when I was young so a lonely time as well This is where my wifes behaviour started to seriously turn Im going to list the major events as I remember them in the order they happened I will also try to list areas where I was less than perfect but to be perfectly honest I dont think there are many Like really I have to keep checking myself surely it wasnt all so one sided surely I contributed meaningfully to this Just doesnt seem to be the case Anyway here goes The day after my mum died we are at the pub with a friend we are talking about it all My friend asks my wife how shes doing and she says Im worried everyone is going to forget that my mum died For context her mum passed away 34 years ago from a long contracted period of illness It spanned over COVID and lock down I lived in their house with them over all of lockdown and helped look after her mum watching her die and taking care of her for over a year My wife had been dealing with this tragic and difficult loss for some time so I had some sympathy to her reaction But bottom line its a shitty thing to say to your partner who lost their mum one day ago that youre concerned youre not going to get as much attention any more That my loss will overshadow hers It speaks volumes and sets up what is to come A day later she says shes going to go and see this J guy I mentioned above The one Im really uncomfortable with I made it very clear that I am uncomfortable with this and now is not the time to be testing me like this I know hes just your friend and theres nothing actually happening Im an idiot but this does upset me and I dont need to deal with this right now Id appreciate it if she didnt go She said she understood but not to worry this is the last time shes going to see him really Their relationship has petered out more or less so it will just be the occasional coffee which is all shes going for Oh and they had plans to go see a jazz band in a few weeks time but shell cancel that on account of the funeral Shes barely going to see him so dont worry I said it was fine I saw it as if shes being truthful then I can accept the cost of one more uncomfortable period if the payoff is they really do just leave each other alone for a while She went and came back a couple hours later no big deal So the following week we had a spa trip booked I bought it for her for Christmas We decided to still go in spite of everything because why not I need it It was great Had a lovely time reconnected I was able to relax and destress a bit But on the last day were in a hot tub together sharing a cocktail and shes on her phone Shes messaging J and arranging to meet the next day I took offense and said I thought you werent seeing eachother any more Its just to study Im falling behind on my thesis So the next day she gets up early and leaves we agree shell be back at lunch Im very unhappy about all of this and just basically sulk all morning I leave my phone upstairs and try to get on with my day as best I can waiting for her to come home and talk about it 3pm comes and goes I take a nap 5PM comes and goes I check my phone a couple messages and a couple missed calls Apparently she decided to stay out for lunch and asked if it was ok When I didnt reply she decided to stay out for dinner and drinks too She didnt get home until after I went to bed I spent the whole evening feeling miserable and hurt I dont need this She comes home and I confront her asking if she thought any of that was ok Turns out its all my fault because I didnt reply to her and my lack of immediate response was me emotionally blackmailing her to come home It really wasnt I just didnt want to have my phone on me and was expecting her to be home at the agreed time Maybe a little silly and selfish in my part Maybe But Im grieving and shes already pushed my boundaries I needed some alone time to deal with it I had no idea I was emotionally blackmailing her So anyway she stays out all day with the person that makes me uncomfortable days after my mum died days after she promised she wouldnt and Im the asshole for not keeping my phone on me in case she decided to change her mind Great A week goes by and its the day before were due to leave for my home town ready for the funeral in a few days She asks me if we can hold off going for one extra day so she can go to this jazz thing with J I say wtf you said that wasnt happening Thats why you saw him earlier because you werent doing this She says she knows but she really wants to go I confront her and say I really dont feel like Im your top priority No youre not my top priority Please elaborate Well I just dont see it as a hierarchy Everyones in a circle around me and youre all equal priority You J etc Right but Im your husband and my mum just died Does that not put me ahead of anyone else No Looking dead in my eyes No Fine Go to your jazz thing idgaf She says might as well the damage is already done by me even asking right Yeah The damage is already done I cant believe what she said to me so cold so heartless so unempathetic so selfish Btw this woman is a qualified therapist let that sink in Hope you dont get her as your therapist good lord So she fucks off the next day and I delay my departure for her social plans I contemplated going down without her but the ensuing drama and questions from family would not be worth it It was my mums funeral after all not my marriages The funeral goes fine the week is fine She doesnt say or do anything shitty I focus on the funeral and family and everything and mostly not think about the fireball train wreck that is now my marriage On the drive home my wife decides to tell me that she thinks her ex boyfriend from school days is the one that got away Im dumbfounded because 1 What a thing to fucking say as I drive us home from burying my mother 2 Its just patently untrue So completely ludicrous that Im not even bothered by the notion that she might be serious It is at this point that it dawns on me that she may be hurting me on purpose The next day we are having coffee and she says to me I never wanted this house I never wanted this dog and I dont want kids Lets be clear I did not push her to get the house or the dog If anything she pushed for both of them but it was pretty mutual She is now tearing up the entire foundation of our marriage She is lighting fire to the entire future plans we had The house and dog that I poured my heart and soul into for her for us She never wanted apparently Just brutal Savage She acted shocked when I started crying I didnt expect it to upset you this much Incredible The next day I go to my friends place and just cry on her for hours I am in a complete state Its all too much overwhelming awful and just confusing Why is she being so mean I wondered if she hated me then I thought maybe shes trying to get me to break up with her Shes clearly having an affair of some variety My mum just died Maybe she just doesnt want to be the person to break up with their partner when their mum died Especially a partner who cared for her dying mother And especially because she was having an affair Shed be seen as such an asshole so rather than just admitting everything and being an asshole she decided to torture me until I pulled the plug myself Not her fault then is it Anyway that thought occurred to me But Im in no state to decide the fate of my marriage Im grieving Im distraught Im reeling from the various harrowing incidents listed above Barely enough time to process one before another comes along It may seem obvious to you and me now but at the time I just couldnt see clearly what was happening or exactly why My friend gave me some advice that I didnt need to decide anything right now that settled me Took some pressure off At around this point my perception of time gets a bit funny Mixture of grief and brain fuckery So now Im pissed at her I dont trust her I feel badly hurt She says shes going out with J again I say I dont care Resigned to this shitty behaviour unable to reason with her unable to discuss it unable to make the call and leave She comes back at 4 in the morning high AF they had taken MDMA together The oxytocin drug Under the influence of this drug he confessed his feelings for her She was totally shocked by this and said it was all a little uncomfortable Ok I said Whatever The next day were driving somewhere and I really cant remember what she said but it just set me off I think it was something along the lines of I dont know why youre so upset with me I was furious I was worn down I was mistreated For the first time I raised my voice I was shouting at her Listing all of these shitty instances that were cutting me up whilst I grieved I raised my hand clenched my fist and brought it down on the steering wheel in anger It made a dull bang noise This was the start of a new narrative from my wife The scary aggressive husband narrative The perfect excuse in her eyes to leave me without raising questions about her betrayal and complete lack of empathy Youre scary she said I was cowering in the passenger seat she said Youre just like my aggressive father she said I tried defending myself but please remember I was in a complete mess mentally and emotionally I started to believe her Maybe I did lose control maybe I am one of those guys Maybe I threatened her I thought that yes it was an outburst but no it wasnt threatening Im not a big scary person Im just a human being that has been deeply hurt and wounded when theyre at their most vulnerable But maybe thats not a good enough excuse Maybe I crossed a line She sowed the seeds of doubt in my vulnerable mind I started doubting my memory of events did I black out for a moment and do something really scary She told me that I was potentially abusive To be clear shes not accusing me of being abusive shes accusing me of maybe becoming abusive in the future And she cant take that risk Im not safe to have children with you know the children she said she didnt want before I ever shouted I believed her What a monster I was How could I be so terrible I never thought I was like this No wonder she was having an affair for the last several weeks I shouted at her and hit my hand on the steering wheel in frustration She lent into it but not too far She was manipulating me telling me its ok You just need to go to therapy and sort yourself out As long as Im going along with her narrative shes all ok my side If I ever doubt her Im terrible and hurtful and potentially abusive She decided it was time to end things she had the get out of jail free card she wanted She didnt leave me for another man and emotionally abused me when my mum died she saved herself from an potentially abusive relationship My greatest crime was hitting a steering wheel One of the last things she said to me She spoke with a friend of hers who had broken up with her partner of 8 years had two wild years and then they got back together for several years I asked what she meant by wild years just connecting with lots of people So she turns to me and says I think were a lot like them you know I wanted to say I bet she didnt abuse her partner I bet she didnt hurt him when his mum died I bet she didnt manipulate him into believing he was abusive And the sheer audacity of sitting there and looking to me to approve of her fucking a bunch of people for two years before I take her back I said nothing she nudged me Desperate for me to implicitly condone her actions and behaviours by giving even the slightest inkling that I might take her back when shes done fucking around I turned away and left I was done Not two days after our official break up she declared herself in a relationship with J But to her family she accused me of being aggressive and scary and forcing her to leave She denies having had an affair pretending that her and J are not an item She goes to my friends and asks them to meet her new partner J Again implicitly asking them to condone her actions by meeting this J guy My friends all refuse and begin to cut contact with her Theyve seen what shes done They knew what she was doing to me before I did They wont tolerate her BS I love my friends My wifes sister knows everything she heard it all from my wifes point of view and STILL she took my side Then she heard what I had to say boy was she pissed She told her whole family the truth my wife tried to convince them that her sister was a liar That she didnt understand Shes pregnant btw My wife just tried to turn her family against her pregnant younger sister In her attempts to not be seen as a terrible heartless B that would abandon her husband when he needed her most she turned herself into an even worse monster An abuser according to some A liar a manipulated a nasty piece of work Sometimes you meet your destiny on the path to avoid it Im 2 months free I dont want to let another human being close to me like that again but maybe that will change with time My therapist and my wifes sister whos also a qualified therapist both said that she has been emotionally abusive to me Coercive controlling behaviour I dont know about that but I know Ive been treated unfairly Thanks for reading this far I hope it was entertaining X,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04

1j2zw99,My boyfriend keeps bringing up future relationship milestones and I dont know if hes being serious or not,I 17f have been dating my boyfriend 18m for the past few months and its been perfect it feels natural and not rushed and so far weve established that we want to have a long term relationship together but obviously we dont know how long that long term is going to be I would like to see us reach future milestones because he is the loml and I couldnt imagine life without him but he has told me that he has certain views on things like marriage because his parents got divorced when he was four and says that marriage is something that he maybe doesnt see in his future because of the fear of ending up like his parents But in the past week he has maybe multiple remarks about future milestones one day we were laying in my bed and he saw my baby pillow and was reading it and saw the part that said The proud parents of this baby A amp A and said just imagine this happens to us its gonna say The proud parents of this baby C amp C because like my parents me and my boyfriend have the same first initial Another time we were on the phone and he said Ive been thinking a lot lately what are your thoughts of the idea of us getting married some day which caught me off guard because he said that he maybe didnt see himself getting married Hes also brought up promise rings with my friends at work because me and him work together and they have told me about it And today while we were out to eat he brought up moving in together after I graduate I love my boyfriend so much but I dont understand why the switch from having these certain views to changing those views and talking about that stuff and I dont know if hes joking about it or actually being serious I want to believe that he is but with what he has said in the past is confusing me Im going to bring this up to him but I dont know what to say exactly Is it a sign that he may be changing his views and considering a future with me or is it something I should be worried about,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 02:03:11 UTC,1,14,0.6,,,0,0
1j64p36,I think about the one that got away even though we were never together,Due to trauma I have an extreme flight feeling so that even though things are going good with my current partner I keep thinking about just packing my things and leaving I keep thinking about a FWB I was with prior that if we had tried a relationship probably we probably wouldve been great together I love my current partner and dont want to actually leave him and I cant say anything to either of them because I wont let my trauma response ruin a relationship and friendship I am working on it with my therapist I know that if I do pack up and leave and have something with the friend that the same feeling will happen with him because I need to work through the trauma rather than giving into it I dont really have any friends I can talk to about it because none of them will understand,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:27:03 UTC,3,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j359c4,Im retrospective I did cheat on my expartner and thats the best thing Ive ever did,Ive been dealing with some complicated memories and feelings lately and I feel like its finally time to try get this out there Ok so some context Around 2 years ago I currently 25 f was in a relationship with a girl lets call her H for almost 5 years at the time I used to feel like we were inseparable played video games together liking the same stuff and daring to go out into a world specially after I grew in quite the conservative household H was a bastion of courage to get myself out there Eventually polyamory came into the question and we were both on board and started a weird relationship with another girl lets call her N This lasted for like 2 months Honestly things werent that bad N really helped me to start understanding things about my sexuality I never did plus she was and still is probably one of the only persons that understands all of my simpsons references Then a party came around and another girl S appeared We all got drunk and it was clear S was very into us What at first was uncomfortable flirting quickly worked on H before I knew they were both kissing in front of me wich I hated but then H hitted me with the join us or we are over Afraid like the little idiot I was I complied joined in what is to this day one of my most shameful nights not only in bed but because they made me lie to N For the next few months I was like dead in life following H and S with everything be it more parties slandering and victim blaming N or hearing them play with other girls At this point is where O appears O was the first shining of light in a dark time we clicked immediately we talked a lot enjoyed many things together and Honestly just understood each other a lot At the time I thought hey if we are already in a open relationship whats wrong with me having another partner well the things was I wasnt it was one of those situations were the relationship was open for a person but not for the other H and S had both other partners but it was a problem when I did because then I stopped being their little errand girl The breakup was nuclear it was 2 months of whole on fighting and cussing at each other O was there for me the entire time and helped me understand a lot of my own feelings While at the same time I had to see H become the worst version of herself getting drunk and violent Probably only didnt hit me because S stopped her cause oh boy she did in previous fights I parted ways with both of them moved cities to be closer to O and let me tell you life has never been better O helped me rebuild a bridge with my family to rebuild a sense of self confidence Where I have been fearful or anxious before O was only supportive and understanding She helped me see many things of my previous relationship how they were the stoy of lies manipulation and isolation that i refused to see in the past with O I feel loved not like a versión of me wich I could growing into but as truly me O has encouraged me to get into a masters degree and Ive encouraged to fix the relationship with her family too And while I miss the friend H was from time to time I am happy to be where I am I wish both H and S a happy life together too I hope they dont get to toxic to each other and to grow into better people too To N I wish I could apologize properly but understandably she blocked me from any form of contact and Honestly I dont blame her hope she is having a great time living all the adventures she wanted too And as for meHonestly O is the love of my life and even of weve been together for little more than a year and a half ive decided once I get my masters degree and get the chance to compete for better paying jobs I will marry this person and try to live our best life together I swear i will try to make O the happiest on earth because honestly she already made me the happiest Ive never wanted to live my life as much as I do now and its all thanks to her We are playing yakuza like a pirate and going to watch the new gundam movie next weekend Soni think we are on a great start for a rest of out life If theres is anything to learn here just remember you do not deserve the minimum effort nor crumbs of affection you all deserve to be loved for who you are Dare to break free form your status quo and be happy believe you deserve to love and be loved Pd please dont cheat on your partners even polyamory has to be properly consensuated and agreed upon or else is cheating too,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 07:13:28 UTC,0,0,0.17,,,0,0

1j4f39s,Is my relationship doomed,I 25M have been with my gf 26F for 3 months now and I dont know if Im overthinking this and self sabotaging my relationship or if there are larger issues As I mentioned in another post weve disagreed about washing rice before and someone gave me some solid advice about how to talk to her about it I felt we had a positive and productive conversation but it all started because she got mad that I washed the rice for a certain dish Shes also recently got upset with me over a project she asked me to tackle just assembling a lamp we bought at the store I made the mistake of trying to screw in a screw that had a defect and got stuck She wasnt screaming or anything but she was upset that I tried to use it anyway I got it out and replaced it and the lamp turned out well She has childhood trauma to do with strict parents who would severely punish her if she didnt do things the exact way they wanted and so I think she gets stressed when something isnt going to plan I feel like an idiot when these sort of things happen Theyre such simple mistakes easily avoided and yet I make them Shes also been stressed with her kitten that still needs to get spayed shes been in heat alot and she yells at the cat when she wont be quiet I think this isnt right and have tried gently mentioning that her cat is just doing what cats do and she needs to try and ignore her I made a larger mistake the other day when I asked to try her THC vape She said that beginners should always be in a safe place and try to relax I asked in jest do I feel safe here And she asked the same I thought about it a bit and promptly got distracted by other thoughts I have ADHD and sometimes this sort of thing happens Im still ashamed of it because when I realized I trailed off and said I do feel safe here She made a a comment stating That took a long time for you to figure out I didnt respond I knew I got distracted and I started silently panicking thinking I do feel safe here but nothing I say now will convince her I wouldnt have tried the THC if I didnt I wouldnt leave my knife at home if I didnt I wouldnt be with her if I didnt but I gave some lame excuse about thinking too deeply about it and tried to laugh it off I feel like an idiot She makes me happy Shes important to me Im worried that her trauma will drive us apart I dont know what to do to work through this,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:51:13 UTC,0,3,0.33,,,0,0
1j4i0nn,I want to help people my entire life but the issue is I feel like I am the touch of death,For complete transparency I wrote this out first on wordpad can post the original if requested but since my grammar and wording is never great learning disability I ran it thru a AI grammar editor The message and feelings are still mine as I reread it to be 100 sure Just thought you all should no Im writing this because its been weighing on my mind for a long time It keeps happening and I cant shake the feeling that Im the common factor For as long as I can remember Ive wanted to make a difference in someones life In high school I dreamed of becoming a teacher to help kids At one point I even considered becoming a doctor or a nurse to be there for people in their worst moments But over the years those dreams fadedbecause every time Ive tried to help things have ended the same way It seems like whenever someone needs emergency medical care and I step in to help they dont make it The Moments That Haunt Me One of the first times this happened I was around 1820 years old I was walking home from Walmart when I heard a crash Looking over I saw a motorcycle had been tboned by a car and the driver was on the ground Without thinking I ran toward him weaving through traffic I took his hand and spoke to him trying to keep him calm while others applied pressure to his wounds He handed me his phone and asked me to call a family member to let them know he was going to the hospital I did exactly that then gave the phone back to him Soon after paramedics arrived and took him away Later I read that he had died from his injuries At the time I didnt think much of it beyond the tragedy of the accident A few years later I was at home when my stepfather suddenly jumped up and said Call an ambulance We did and while waiting I ran upstairs to grab him a shirt as asked I helped him put it on talking to him reassuring him that everything would be okay The paramedics arrived and took him away Shortly after he went into heart failure and died Then a few years after that I was living in an apartment building One day I glanced out the window out of boredom and saw my neighbors unloading groceries Out of nowhere the wife collapsed and her husband barely caught her in time I didnt hesitateI bolted out of my apartment without even locking the door ran down the hallway hit the elevator button and after a few seconds of waiting said Fuck it and took the stairs I got to them as fast as I could Her husband was on the phone with paramedics while I held her trying to comfort her as he gathered her meds and health cards The building superintendent came out just standing there saying Shes going to be okay Just being completely useless It took the paramedics over 30 minutes to arrive The moment I stepped back to let them work they had to use a defibrillator there heart had stopped She didnt make it The Fear That Lingers These are just a few of the moments that have left me feeling this way I may add more as I remember them But because of them I feel like I cant help peoplebecause when I do it only seems to end badly I honestly have never had someone survive going to the hospital after I help Its been about three years since I last experienced something like this and I hope I never do again But Im scared that if it happens again Ill freeze up That fear eats at methe fear that I wont be able to help that Ill hesitate that Ill fail someone when they need me most Im shaking as I write this scared of being judged of being called a coward But I needed to get this off my chest because its been haunting me for far too long I am shaking trying to hit the post button,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 23:57:50 UTC,5,2,1.0,,,0,0

1j45av7,Coworker shared with me that her niece is being molested and no one is doing anything about it,This happened two years ago and I still cry when I think about this I had a coworker at one point who had very thin boundaries she would consistently causally trauma dump at work without regard to how it affected others and mostly coped with her trauma through drinking Im fairly certain she was drinking at work but never saw her take swigs Just saw her acting intoxicated and smelling like alcohol I grew up with an alcoholic parent so her behavior was fairly uncomfortable for me to be around meaning I did not get close to her even though she shared many very private things with me I almost wish I had invested in her more just so I would know more about her family maybe I would have had enough information to intervene if I had befriended her One day her niece came in to work with her This little girl was probably about 5 When she walked in the door she had her hands cupped around the sides of her face so she could only see the ground in front of her She made no eye contact and would not verbally respond to anyone including her aunt This was the angriest child I have ever seen She glared at everyone held her hands in fists for almost the entire time she was there stayed completely silent and kept her back to the wall for the majority of the time she was in the shop Ive been through a lot of trauma therapy and it was very obvious to me that this child was hypervigilant if not in fight or flight After the child was picked up by another family member I stepped outside for a smoke My coworker the aunt of the child was already outside smoking I sat down next to her and she casually said to me my niece told her friend that someone licked her hooha It was like cold water had been dumped over my head as she told me more about it I felt so sick for so many reasons A FIVE YEAR OLD told their friend that someone licked their private parts that friend told her mom who told my coworkers nieces parents And no one was doing anything actionable No therapy no intervention no questions Just shrugs and hope thats not actually happening After my shift I called child services and went to the police station by my work I tried everything I could to get a report filed a welfare check done literally anything Because I didnt have the name of the childs parents the police AND child services told me I didnt have enough information to complete a report I called so many times with different ideas of how I could make a legitimate report but I simply didnt have enough information I think about this multiple times a week sometimes every day for the entire day I myself am someone who survived CSA I have complex trauma and I know what its like to be a child in a setting where no adults are protecting you even when they know whats going on Our boss commit suicide that same week so everything at that work place became even more chaotic very quickly I left because I could not cope with the instability Part of me wishes I had stayed just to garner more information but that work place was so toxic that I started to experience suicidal ideation I had to leave for my safety Now that Im farther removed from the experience I feel like I could have pulled myself up by my bootstraps and stayed long enough to get more info for the sake of this little girl Im not sure why Im sharing this Yesterday this popped up in my head for the millionth time and I had such a strong reaction to the memory that I vomited I will never be able to get the image of that little childs angry face out of my head I dont think Ill ever forget her and I will always wonder if there is something I could have done to help,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 15:14:05 UTC,9,6,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j40w00,Sad and stuck,Throwaway acc I F29 feel stuck in my life and feel sad Ive felt like this for a number of years In fact it started when I started my current role in healthcare after qualifying form university Ive thought about a career change so many times and have dabbled in a few things but havent fully dove into anything bc as much as I dislike my job Im good at it and earn a decent salary Its also a safe job Long story short I come from a poor working class background mum with mental health issues parents divorced and live separately Mum is on benefits and dad works a minimum wage job I come from a background where we dont just abandon our parents and I love them and want to help them Im however an only child Ive been married to an amazing person a number of years ago and as amazing as he is he too is burdened with family issues We also live with the inlaws His mother became disabled last year and a lot of her care is depended on him He also holds responsibility for his disabled sister as well He does a lot for everyone hes practically had to be the dad of the family since his dad wasnt around much when they were younger But now I see it taking a toll on him and he wont admit it only in snippets he says I sleep so much bc Im so stressed I try to support him as much as I can but hes doesnt want me to get more stressed with my family stress too I believe my stress comes from having a poor relationship with money But lets not deny that you need money to survive in this world However I feel this huge financial burden that I need to provide for my parents especially as they near to pensioning ages and I really dont want their financial stress when we have children bc no doubt it will happen I had a plan of my job role for this year and it was going to allow me to be in a higher position and earn more money However this now is either not going to happen or will be delayed Then I questioned myself do I even want it Or am I doing it to save my family from poverty The problem is that I dont want know what I want to do I went into this career path when I was younger but I regretted it so much Due to stress Ive developed PCOS and Im 2st heavier than my previous baseline Im always tired my husband is always tired and I feel that we dont enjoy life as much bc of all responsibilities and we dont even have children yet Adding children onto this will just cause misery Im sure of it I just dont know what to do Were all trying our best but before being married even in a relationship when I felt stuck I would change my environment and look for things to do I cant do it as much anymore bc its not a me decision anymore its a we decision and although we have plans to move out were saving up and you know what the housing market is like so it will take a while Anyways thanks for reading this if you got to the end heart_hands_medium_skin_tone,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 11:24:13 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j6vvos,I hate Childrens Sevices,I have to get something off my chest its been bothering me for a while Department of Childrens Services Australia are the most incompetent useless stupid government agency Ive ever had the displeasure of working with whom Im sure hire only the worst and dimmest of candidates and have fostered a culture of ineptitude and apathy throughout the system I have nothing but complete and utter contempt for the department and their so called social workers as I can say truthfully and without hyperbole or exaggeration that I have not seen them make a good call on a child or family situation in the 30 years Ive been cursed with their association I am a psych and behavioural analyst and run a disability and aged care support company in remote Queensland I am involved with the department because I provide therapeutic placement for children with disabilities My company as best as I can tell is one of the very few with capacity for kids with serious behaviours of concern certainly the only one that I am aware of in my or any surrounding regions judging by how far some kids come to be placed with us The ignorance on display from DoCs staff is breathtaking They dont listen They dont understand disability which to be fair I dont really expect them to not really but they just are not willing to learn Somehow the decisions they make seem tailored to be cruel and hurtful to parents for no good reason and they are openly hostile and dismissive to families they have independently decided they dont like Vague examples for privacy Single mother with 5 month old baby Has 2 other children in placement Meetings for one occur in Town A Meetings for the other occur in Town B She lives in City C The meetings are set for 8am for one and 9am for the other Town A is 90km 56mi from City C and Town B is 107km 66mi from City C Town B is 193km 119mi from Town A She has no car and relies entirely on public transport to get around This is utterly impossible There is a department office 7 minutes from her house by bus They flat put refused to entertain the idea of having meetings at that office or even just Zoom meetings She had to attend in person Every failure was used as evidence of inability to manage her time and proof she shouldnt have her children Child with serious behaviours of concern violence property destruction suicide ideation who was surrendered by family was placed with us on short notice because previous two placements claimed no capacity Probably because of the damages combined between the two of them No behavioural plan was supplied despite them having one and being requested for 7 weeks in the end I had to go behind their backs and track down the practitioner that wrote it myself DoCs severely downplayed the behaviours upon placement and frankly if we werent so good at our jobs and able to adjust so fast serious harm absolutely could have happened due to the lack of accurate information provided We got lucky those first few weeks Their sole focus is on reunification with the family Their solution was to force them together every weekend No support no plan just shove a violent individual in a house with a shellshocked family for 2 and a half days the siblings of which actively and with good reason do not want them there for a couple of days and hope for the best When sexual assault claims were made by a sibling DoCs ignored it and tried to push for the next weekend anyway It took a call to Childrens Safety who in turn made a stern call to DoCs for them to decide against that decision for a weekend I sat with the case workers and supervisors and went through the complex disabilities and mental health issue for this individual and explained what realistically needed to happen for reunification What to expect A recommendation for steps to take moving forward I thought it went well A follow up meeting with the school a mere 2 hours later and the case worker said that a fidget spinner should keep them occupied for 4 hours and thus solve the school attendance issues Moronic No attention paid whatsoever They openly blame the parents their lack of parenting for the issues Stay at home dad mum has a pretty unusual job that has her travel often but pays very well They mock her in meetings talking about how shes living her best life on holidays when shes away for a week working I am so frustrated They are now looking at foster care options Removal from a therapeutic placement where they have made real progress for example nearly 100k in damages zero school attendance between 2 placement over 3 months compared to us where we have had maybe 500 in damages and school attendance every day at first with support and now independently between an hour and 4 hours and we have had them for 6 months to be put with some unsuspecting and unqualified family for 700 a week Absolute madness I just want to scream into the void The family is actively working with us the school is actively working with us but DoCs DoCs dont give a shit And they hold the cards They claim they care but when it comes to complex disability they actively ignore vital information and forge ahead like it was a typical kid damn everyone else Sorry I got a bit ranty They just piss me off so much,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 01:00:02 UTC,2,0,0.76,,,0,0

1j3l1jy,My brother 32M keeps setting me 26F up for abuse from my mom 60sF and I dont know if its intentional,For context my mom hates my dad 65M with an extreme almost irrational amount of resentment I was never allowed to see him after their divorce and my mom has always been abusive toward meaccusing me of trying to steal my dad from her even when I was a child Meanwhile she worships my brother and treats him like a king which is common in our culture Growing up my brother bullied me but as adults he seems to have changedor so I thought He encouraged me to reconnect with my dad even telling me to sneak out to visit him knowing full well that my mom would explode if she found out Recently my brother has been spending a lot of time at my dads restaurant lets call it Bos because he gets free food there and he kept inviting me to come I resisted at first but eventually gave in because I needed a break from home and I could actually study and eat there But heres the problem every time I go my brother immediately tells my mom He asks me to go waits until I do and then betrays me The first time he blurted it out in front of a cousin and my mom lost it on me I blocked him for a week but had to eventually forgive him since we still live together I thought maybe it was a mistake Then it happened again This time he acted super nice to me all weekend made me breakfast and even walked me to my car before we were supposed to meet at Bos But then at the last second he bailed on me saying hed study at homesomething he never does I went to Bos alone and four hours later he called me As soon as I picked up my moms voice came through his phone asking Where are you Before I could even lie he said Shes at Bos I dont understand why he keeps doing this He used to hate my mom and call her crazy but suddenly hes been defending her saying shes just mentally ill and that we should pray for her Its a complete 180 from how he talked about her just weeks ago Ive given him the benefit of the doubt because he struggles with school and responsibilities and I suspect he may have a learning disability But at this point Im not sure if hes just naïve or if hes actively setting me up What do you think Am I overreacting or is this deliberate,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 20:44:10 UTC,65,36,0.88,,,0,0

1j6i1fv,My gf violated me last night,So my girlfriend 32 and I 30M have been together for almost a year now and everything is going really well There have been Ups and Downs in our sex life in the past because of several health reasons but recently we both feel like our sex really took off I was kind of inexperienced before I met her so there are a lot of firsts for me A few weeks ago we started experimenting some more and talked about things wed wanna try and even watched some video footage of those things to get some ideas and stuff I told her that Id experimented with butt play on myself in the past and I would like to try that during sex not talking about pegging here We ended up buying a whole bunch of toys and stuff for both of us including some buttplugs Last night we ended up really tipsy and horny so I suggested giving it a try We did And at first it was really nice and hot We both enjoyed it and had some fun UNTIL all of a sudden I felt the plug pop out We stopped and looked around everywhere but the plug was nowhere to be found That was the moment we realized the moderately big plug even though it had a wide base got sucked up my butt and was in fact stuck there I straight up fucking panicked and my gf said she could see the terror in my face I instantly felt sick and started sweating felt like throwing up So it was like do we go to the ER or what do we do I preferred not becoming one of those embarrassing sex accident ER stories So we decided to try and get it out ourselves I kneeled on my bathroom floor with my upper body leaning over my bathtub because I felt like Ill throw up And yeah My girlfriend basically had to use half her hand trying to fish it out real deep up my butt It hurt like shit and when it finally got out I was grossed out felt violated exhausted and traumatized I ended up in fetal position in my bathroom with my girlfriend nearly crying for having to hurt me My butt still hurts today and was bleeding a bit this morning and Im severely traumatized Even though Id love to keep trying this I dont know if Ill ever be able to trust a plug again My girlfriend did an amazing job being there for me and preventing me from going into a full panic attack so we kinda bonded over this even more All in all a very traumatic but kind of funny story I wanted to share,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 14:15:20 UTC,0,14,0.32,,Positive,0,0

1j3pwgn,my friend left me and i dont know what to do with myself anymore,my friend left me and i dont want to be here without him i would normally never turn to reddit for help but im here right now i female have been struggling so much lately i large factor of struggling is about this one guy i bet you hear that so much but this is the only time in my life that ive ever ran into a problem like this i guess i can full on lore drop here i met this guy that ill call steve in early 2023 ever since i met him i had this deep connection with him i have serious feelings for him and ive never crushed on somebody before it took me up until october 2024 to tell him about how i actually feel i visited him at his college right before i told him its the main reason why i told him in the first place when i told him he never really told me about why he didnt like me back steve has always been a very private person but i assumed this would be different after i opened up to him i was struggling so badly i eventually told him that i needed to stop talking to him when i told him that which was in november of 2024 he finally told me that he was gay i really dont know why he was keeping that bit of information from me for so long he had talked to me about liking girls before so i just assumed that he couldve been bi because he did kind of give off gay vibes me not talking to him only lasted like a week and a half because i took a gummy and texted him i tried to tell him that i needed to stop again but he just kept on texting me and i felt bad for just not answering him this man has been the light of my life for such a long time it feels texting him was one of my favorite aspects of the day and it was what got me through dark times because it felt like he was there for me fast forward a few weeks he tells me about this guy that he was talking to he told me that he had been talking to this guy for 3 months and that this was the first time he has ever really liked someone back he randomly texted steve saying that he only had platonic feelings for steve and steve got so upset he sent me a voice message of him almost on the verge of tears i told him that i shouldnt be talking to him about this but i did anyways because i loved him i tried my best to help him through the situation i shared what i did when he told me that he didnt like me back and i told him that i would be there for him day and night which he never ever took advantage of even though he said that this was one of the darkest times of his life all was good until last month steve was starting to act really weird towards me he said that hes sorry if he has been weird he was never answering me despite texting me 247 days prior so i confronted him about it he told me that he went on a date with another guy i ended up leaving him on read and he said I was going to send a text to you in the morning but honestly it just feels more right to do one now Im sorry I was slightly inebriated in my last response and thats not fair for you I do just want to let you know I am doing well enough mentally right now Like am I the best lve ever been no but Im definitely very much in a manageable position right now I know whatever I say or do wont stop your anxiety but I want to ensure you that if there was something going on I would let you know You are a very close friend of mine and you are definitely someone I come to when things are not right The reason I initially said I was just busy yesterday and not what I was actually doing was because I didnt want to make you uncomfortable for anything like that But it is for the best for me to be honest with that kind of stuff and lll make sure to keep you in the loop As for the insert boy name here stuff I dont really want to concern you with a lot of it because it honestly does depict me at my worst sometimes I try to handle most of that without mentioning anything because its usually easier and I dont like getting people involved that shouldnt have to be I hope this kinda helps digest a little bit i still left him on delivered because i just couldnt handle the pain he has put me through i texted him almost a week later stating that i am in so much pain and i cant take it anymore every single time that i try to make it clear that im deeply struggling he never seems to care although hes said that he cares for me deeply just last week i had this very depressive episode and he asked me how things were going and i said not well i genuinely think i am the most depressed ive ever been right now i am at my lowest point i can barely eat sleep or focus im just empty i cant even get up and be productive i dont even feel like im living im just existing you wouldve thought that i wouldve been so happy and excited on saturday but i didnt even care about being at insert my favorite place here im starting to lose interest in everything and after i said that he didnt answer as a follow up message i said im taking this radio silence as a strong sign and i dont want to hear some excuse like sorry i forgot to respond or i couldve sworn i responded originally i had a way bitchier intro to this message but thats not me all the times you said that you cared about me i knew they were all lies i knew i shouldve listened to my gut the entire time i really really really wish i wouldnt have responded to that one message in february of 2023 i feel like all of our friendship has been is me constantly doing shit to be such an amazing friend for you but you NEVER returned the favor and im sick and tired of it i made you all those bracelets i made that painting for you i always checked up on you i sent you a heartfelt message on your birthday but did you ever do anything like that for me sorry for doing so much for people and expecting something small back every single one of my friendships ends like this all youve ever done is just constantly lie to me and i bet you think that i just havent noticed cooking dinner till 11pm going home because you have a headache immediately passing out when you go to bed ill try my best to respond to you any of these sound familiar im so tired of how horrible of a person youve been towards me i try my absolute hardest for you ive gotten out of bed eaten kept my grades up tried to take care of myself picked myself up off the ground and smiled just for you maybe im just too generous loyal compassionate empathetic and sympathetic as a person i genuinely dont know why you still talk to me or why i still talk to you ive given our friendship so many second chances but this is my breaking point im so fucking sick and tired of everything i really hope that when i do end up taking my own life that not a single tear falls from either one of your eyes i always wanted to tell you that id make the sky so pretty and orange for you but i dont want to do that anymore notice how i didnt even mention my feelings for him in that message once now that we arent talking i dont know what to do with myself anymore ive grown so attached to this man and i dont know what to do without him he has been my rock ever since we met he was all i had and now i have absolutely nobody ive been lonely my entire life and i would say that it got worse when i started having feelings for him but now that hes gone my loneliness is ten times worse i am seconds away from writing my notes and saying goodbye i am so picky with who i want to be with if they arent aligning with what i want to do in my future i wont be happy with them long term i dont date just for fun i date to marry the reason i grew so attached to steve was because he aligned with my future im so alone and empty with him gone and i feel like it would be a better place if i said my goodbyes i dont want the space if thats what hes giving me i unfollowed him on everything but i havent blocked him i just dont want to keep going if it means that im not friends with him

1j6pwmy,My sister invited our brother to her wedding even though she knows how I feel about him,Recently my sister got engaged and she asked me to be a part of her bridal party Initially I was very excited to have a role in her wedding kind of still am but now Im feeling iffy because she invited our brother who I dont have a positive relationship with For context Im the youngest out of the three of us and we were raised by a single mother who worked a lot Because of this my sister took a lot of responsibility over us when our mother couldnt Shes like a second mother to me and my brother even though she shouldnt have been My brother on the other hand was kind of a weirdo growing up He dressed alternatively and had nerdy interests something that youngerme at the time thought was really cool and was all around awkward I was maybe 8 and he was 14 when he started getting curious with his body and that eventually led to him sexually assaulting me It didnt happen for long thank god but the experience left a disgusting stain on me Eventually I realized that what had happened to me was wrong and it wasnt until I was 13 that I finally had the chance and courage to talk to someone I was removed from my home and placed in a childrens psych unit and my case was being handled by a social worker Of course they informed my mother who then told a few others my sister included I didnt know this at the time but some of the adults around her pressured her into convincing me to recant my statement So when she visited me she asked me to do just that I was obviously so betrayed and angry she was my role model and the one person I relied on the most at the time I cant recall the rest of our conversation I just remember leaving the visitation area and completely losing it in my room But I was young impressional and ruminating a lot at this time so I did end up recanting my statement My case worker didnt agree with my decision but respected it anyway For the sake of procedure my case was still investigated but without the victims statement it fell through It didnt erase anything that happened to me but it felt like it did with how everyone else around me went about their lives like nothing happened It was jarring and fucked with my head and I slowly started believing that I made the whole thing up for attention My memory wasnt the best and it couldve just been a messed up dream I had I started feeling disgusted and I couldnt trust myself anymore and I began spiraling Fastward to when I was 17 I was hospitalized for almost taking my life For some reason this was much more serious than before I was finally put on medication and was put into a program for other atrisk teens It was through group therapy I started thinking about getting closure for myself so after a lot of mental and emotional preparation I confronted my brother At the last minute I decided to record the conversation without him knowing and I actually got a confession I went to my social worker and after a few days he was removed from the house After that I was both relieved and stressed by the events that came next To be honest I didnt follow too closely with the court proceedings I couldnt bring myself to care what happened to him all I remember was being interviewed by SVU and getting monthly check ups by social services But the whole ordeal was mentally and emotionally draining for me and my family My mom couldnt believe it at first and briefly experienced religious psychosis but no one took it harder than my sister I guess she felt guilty because 1 such a serious thing happened between two of her siblings right under her nose and 2 she didnt have my back when I first came forward about it I dont blame her or anyone really for not noticing what was happening I cant bring myself to blame anyone no one wants to believe that someone you love is capable of something as horrible as sexual assault A few years have passed since then and Ive been working on improving my mental health My sister was my rock throughout the process the most understanding of me and my circumstances and after a while I thought I had made peace with the whole situation until her wedding My sisters decision to invite our brother after years of nocontact between the two of us kind of blindsided me Not because I didnt expect her to but because she didnt tell me Now heres the thing I would never ask my sister to choose between me or our brother I understand that she loves the both of us despite what had happened so to ask her to do that wouldnt be fair But I wouldve liked a headsup I had to ask her myself if he was coming and Im glad I did The thought of walking into the venue and seeing him in the crowd without warning wouldve sent me into a panic And because of this I started to rethink my relationship with her Shes done a lot for me and Ill go as far as to say that she has a bigger impact on me than our mother does I want to give her some grace for this but I still feel so uncomfortable with his presence Hes also still in good standing with our extended family who dont know of the situation so the possibility of them joking around and having fun with him without knowing what hes done doesnt sit right with me I most likely wont do anything regarding my sisters wedding because I dont want to ruin her big day but itll probably change the way I see her Like I said I wont ask her to choose between me or him but that doesnt mean I cant Its a scary realization that my relationship with my sister can change I really dont want it to but I cant ignore how shes willing to look past what our brother has done to me when I havent I want to start by having a proper conversation with her about this first though after the wedding I want to fully understand her side of the story and her perspective before making this big decision I honestly dont know what to expect or hope for but I feel like if I dont do something then all the improvement Ive made will come undone and I dont think Ill recover this time,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 20:16:48 UTC,289,94,0.97,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0
1j61gx2,I need advice,To start off Im 27f with a 22m boyfriend Weve been together for almost 3 years and we met due to working together I still cringe at our 5 year age gap I have a friend that is 30f and I dont know if I am a complete ahole for wanting to cut ties with her or maybe I already accidentally did The last time I saw her I ended up staying for a weekend which was fun at first and we tried to drink but we both fell asleep too fast which her boyfriend got mad about I did not like this boyfriend 36m due to him constantly sleeping with his ex and being so obvious about it but shed be in this denial or whatever and cry to me constantly about it He was also somewhat a neglectful parent to his daughter from what my friend would tell me So anyways the next day came and I agreed to stay an extra day to watch her two daughters and figured Id be getting paid because we discussed it prior Well I didnt and during this I ended up getting bed bug bites on my neck hands and ankle area Pretty much where my skin was exposed Since leaving there I still feel like I have bugs on my skin and Im honestly afraid to ever go back I dont know why I pick and choose when to be confrontational because I just let left and didnt say anything I dont know whether to say anything at all Weve talked about bedbugs before and shes said shes gotten rid of them so I dont know what to say Fast forward a few days and she tells me her and her boyfriend 36m broke up and shes back together with an ex 32m This ex 32m was sleeping with a 17 year old girl and my friend 30f let both of them move into her home with her two children before they both just dipped and apparently had left the place trashed and thats when the bedbugs originally came about around this time too Oh and that man32m knew her children for a few months and was having them call him daddy I felt so uncomfortable witnessing all of this and then seeing what she allows herself and her children to be put through willingly For months I was telling her xyz was not right and shed be defending herself and him 36m until they broke up At that point is when she is like oh I could never be with someone who does xyz and completely shitting on this man talking about everything she defended and excused when she put up with it for months and would have continued to put up with it if he 36m didnt have his baby momma over again to stay the night after she had been begging him to stop for months doing that for months So Im just over it Im like why are you actively choosing to put yourself through these things I dont like to sugar coat things because why the hell should I act like neglecting a child is okay just to be a girls girl Their relationship wasnt abusive or anything like that a lot of accusations of cheating coming from both amp issues starting a few days after they began dating which is never a good sign but neither were afraid of each other it wasnt like that and she will put up with almost anything to keep a guy around and thats my issue I used to think she was a good mom but I dont think shes that great anymore I used to praise her when she would say she wouldnt let strangers around her kids and doesnt let anyone else watch her kids until I realized shes letting men she just met meet her kids inside her home and be around them unsupervised I used to think she was a good mom until I realized she raises her daughters through sugar and electronics and doesnt really watch even though around her children All of these realizations have come to me now after she broke up with her long term boyfriend of 2 years34m and have gone through 45 relationships in a year and I dont think shes the person I thought she was and I feel awful but I dont want to be around someone like that So she has her new boyfriend ex boyfriend 32m currently living with her again and I sent her a message a couple days ago saying I think that hes a pedophile and I dont want to be around him to which shes never responded but has sent other things I know that once her and her current boyfriend 32m break up or start having issues she will be wanting my pity party but I cant do it anymore I feel like I have no empathy for her anymore If we had more to talk about than her and her relationships I feel like it wouldnt be such an issue but she has no subsidence to her at all if it is not about a man Any advice on what you would do in my situation Its not my life so I dont know why Im so bothered,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 21:57:32 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

up bro 3 idk if im wrong or just exaggerating but he prioritizes his family over me and my son If there was a fire he would save his 4 brothers and 5 sisters instead of his wife and son He would go to the ends of the earth for them once he had to deliver something car oil at 6AM for his sister n her husband 6AM Mf usually wakes up at 2pm ffs 4 he has this obsession w fixing up old cars he would spend loads of money on it and w literally his blood sweat tears and his time Yo i dont mind mf got a hobby i got a hobby too thats great for him but wht abt when i need to shower Do i have to go outside to ask you to watch over our son again with your ugly smug face again to sum up he has 2 obsession league of legends and his car None of which you can bother him at all My hobby is just gym JUST GYM FOR 1 HOUR At which i can ONLY work out when my son takes his afternoon nap I just want him to evenly schedule his hobby not to the point he doesnt have time for his son or me Do u think he listens Nah Everytime i told him this hell be like this is the only time i can do this while im working at sea i cant do this stuff im like HELLO cars and games are forever Your wife and son could leave you or die anytime wtf is his mindset mahn istg hes still acts like a teenager I literally feel like i have 2 sons as of this time 5 his dirty clothes and socks Need i say more I feel like almost every wife experienced this 6 he spills his coffee and chocolate milk every where in the kitchen but never wipes it I once saw the mf VACUUMS his familys kitchen bc there was a spilled rice grains Basically hes really sloppy There are more but thats the top of my head Idk what I should do Everytime i tell him whats been bothering me we always have a huge fight and it always ends with ok i promise i wont do it again but he still does and its and endless cycle I cant leave him bc I literally have no money to raise my son alone AND my mom is getting old so i have to take care of her too So til now im just tolerating everything but it drains my energy so much but at the same time i put on a happy smile on my face for my son i dont ever want my son to see depressed or angry Mind you he used to b very sweet and thoughtful at the beginning of our dating life and marriage life I thought he was the most amazing guy I know he loves me and my son but i dont think he loves me enough to

1j4o5u0,I cant forgive my friend for how she treated me,What she did hasnt had lasting financial or safety effects on me but I just feel pissed that she had the thought to treat a human like that I was meant to go to a concert with her and one of her friends Everything was fine until a few hours before when she decided to started making long messages and voice notes about how everything was just going to crazy and chaos I was informed last minute that her friend has problems being at concerts and around any people due to social anxiety I said I understood as I had suffered with it still do at times and had only really gotten over it recently And then it just gets worse and worse cant pick you up anymore my friend isnt calming down shes been freaking out about this since we bought the tickets months ago We probably wont talk to you much you might just had to stand a hit away from us You can be there just do your own thing I told her to just tell me if I cant come and she told me its probably best if I dont 11 year friendship just treated like an ant on the ground stepped in on and killed I asked her why she didnt just tell me MONTHS ago if her friend was uncomfortable with me there I could have made other plans or tried to message her friend help her know that I wont judge her and she doesnt have to interact with me if shes uncomfortable But I was left with 4 hours to get other plans Thankfully sold my ticket last minute but lost lots of money from it I got mad at her but I dont know if I feel sorry A friend of mine that knows her too but its not like wed ever all hung out or even mention eachother to eachother said maybe I should have been more considerate and just left it because her sister had passed away a few years ago and she still struggles I told her I understand that I dont expect her to not ever be affected my that again But I also told her that I wont be excusing her if she treats me badly When Ive grieved Ive never used it as an excuse to treat people badly Ive heard other stories about her not treating people the best and I feel like she now hides behind this and uses grief as her excuse I never got an actual apology just a idk what to say Im not putting this up to grief even if it was it doesnt excuse what she did She had months of time to inform me that the situation may not have been appropriate as her friend is uncomfortable around anyone new and had been anxious for months leading up to this her words I dont need the full diagnosis and pry into her friends life because Im not entitled to that But if I had just been told months before that she was feeling anxious about going to a a concert with an unfamiliar person I could have seen if the friend wanted to meet in a quiet place with the mutual friend or meet over text Or I could have made other plans Its fine now its been a little bit of time since then I dont talk to her much at all only if I have a question but I dont forgive her for the reason that she treated a human like that,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 05:15:51 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j3kz2n,It hurt and I will never forget what they did,I was about a freshman when it started I went to a school and said school was a Christian School But it really was anything but what youd expect I will never forget what happened in those 3 dreadful fucking years I stayed in that god damned school They made me distrust anyone who worked in education they made me hate anything relating to going to school In the span of 3 years of being suicidal and slicing my arms they only started to give a damn when my grades went up Freshman year ignored Sophomore year ignored Junior year Seen but only because my grades went up I admit I didnt have the best grades I didnt get medals like my classmates but thats not the point In sophomore year we had a new student First thing they did Announce that they should help the student take away all the sharp objects from her They didnt do that with me They didnt announce jack shit They let me hurt myself By the end of the year my own best friend even got help I didnt know she was struggling we were always the outcasts But then she got help The principal came in on the first week my best friend didnt come to school anymore and told everyone to make little notes that are positive addressed to each other but in reality it was really just for my best friend The principal told everyone to make friends with her so they did She was involved more but I wasnt Anytime she had announcements about me it was reprimanding the other students for speaking in our mothertongue with me and not in English because NotAWinterTale can only speak english Which is false I speak 5 total languages They never set up a guidance councilor for me Anytime I tried to look for one I got brushed off and was told to just pray to God That was the only thing they ever tell me Pray to God of course That doesnt address anything The principal talked to me told me a story about a deceased student She was physically disabled but always came to school happy She told me that she had it worse than I did and I should be happy for that The principal in the same day told me to stop crying otherwise she wouldnt talk to me anymore She also told me all the professors thought I should be in a different section The one where they put the dumber kids Which I found very insulting because they hadnt even tried to help me in any of my problems just ignored me and moved on It was painfully obvious when a professor didnt like me They never responded to me or acted with me the same way as other students But still really fucking disgusting to me How dare she compare my problems to a deceased student That was extremely disrespectful and told me all I needed to know I couldnt trust the principal at all Every fucking day for 2 years I came to school with new scars They never checked on me that responsibility for some reason befell my own few friends Other students Not the teachers The students 4 people who saw me But then the pandemic came and we were all forced to go to school online My grades went up It only got easier because I didnt feel any pressure Nor did I have to work with others who only wanted to delegate me stupid tasks or have me do nothing at all or some professor not answering my question properly but just making it more complicated it was easier because I could search up the topic at the same time and get the answers I needed But then they my grades went down again I was called in for a private meeting with the principal a professor and two guidance councilors I am not ever forgetting what they told me Is there something wrong NotAWinterTale You know that you can talk to us Your grades are going down Your grades in the first and second quarter were really good and it concerns us that it went down again If theres anything we can do to help tell us I had never felt angrier at them Two fucking years of being ignored of cutting my arms and being suicidal enough to have nearly jumped off the damn building they only started to give a fuck the year they see I fit their expectations of being smart I never forgot what happened or what they did That stuck with me for years Im still crying about this years later Because of them I feel like I dont deserve help unless my performance is above average that I meant nothing all because I struggled and couldnt do it They always made me feel ashamed that things didnt click for me Now I feel vindicated now that I know I have AuDHD and while I know it probably isnt an excuse I feel happy to know its not because I was stupid and didnt try hard enough I am told I deserve what they never gave me but sometimes those words arent enough to erase the pain that school gave me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 20:41:10 UTC,3,0,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0

1j5zzni,I want to get him out of my brain,I dont know where to begin but its been eating at me for a while and for the sake of myself I gotta get it off my chest I f19 met this guy in 2023 he randomly blocked me a little less than a year ago and we lost contact Its been 9 months and although I dont think about him anymore in the sense where Ill openly think oh I miss him out of the blue I still feel like I see him in everyone Ive moved on I dont think about him randomly hearing his name doesnt upset me anymore nothing about him hurts me anymore The problem is just that certain gestures that hed do certain things hed say every time someone does the same or does something that reminds me of him he comes to mind immediately Mostly its the way hed word stuff and for some reason whenever someone says the same thing or acts similarly its like I have to tell myself its not him Nobody had ever made me feel the way he did which I find weird cause we never dated Kinda feels like I found my soulmate but lost him if that makes sense It sucks because Im in a relationship and I love my boyfriend to bits Weve been dating for around a month now but despite that hes my favourite person Being with him and being able to know him is the highlight of my life so why does that one guy still haunt me I feel so incredibly guilty writing this because although its not something I can help I feel like shit about it I feel like the guilt is eating me alive and Id bring it up with my boyfriend but I know what hes like If I do hell start telling me to break up with him even though he could say the same exact thing to me and has actually admitted to feeling this way about someone before and Im not mad about it because I understand,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 20:47:53 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j657gu,Am I being used,Am I being used Do I 26F need a reality check Ive been friends with my friend Blake 26M for over a year now We have been pretty close since the beginning When we first met we bonded over our shared love for playing soccer together and music I would say we have many similarities We both enjoy adult animation like Studio Ghibli raves and playing board games Since we shared many similarities we kept in touch daily through text messages phone calls and FaceTime We had a mutual friend named Jennifer Jennifer and I were very close until I noticed that whenever we spent time together she spoke negatively about everyone around her As a result I gradually distanced myself from her Around the same time Jennifer and Blake started dating Although I wasnt close to Jennifer and didnt personally like her I wanted Blake to be happy Blake and I maintained a consistent relationship and communication We talked every day even during our lunch breaks via FaceTime However things took a turn when Jennifer informed Blake that I had feelings for him and wanted to pursue a romantic relationship with him That was not the case and I was even in a relationship at the time As a result Blake ended our communication to preserve his relationship with Jennifer We did not talk for eight months However in January he reached out to me He told me that Jennifer suddenly broke up with him in December Since then weve been hanging out again In February we attended a rave and ended up having sex that night A week later we confessed to each other that we had both harbored feelings for one another since weve first met At this point I informed him that I didnt want to be a rebound and he responded by stating that he wasnt ready for a relationship and wanted to focus on healing I accepted his decision We continued spending time together and continued having sex However I later told him that I no longer wanted to have sex with him because I was struggling to separate our friendship and romantic feelings Around the same time his exgirlfriend Jennifer filed a protective order against Blake Sidebar Personally I have had past experiences with abusive men which may have influenced my perspective However I must admit that I am not entirely aware of the details of Jennifer and Blakes relationship Given Jennifers personality I cant help but wonder if this situation is a attentionseeking ploy On the other hand I have only heard Blakes side of the story However I suggested that we establish boundaries We agreed to refrain from having sex and I told him I need a break from constant communication I also told him to fine another trusted friend to confide in about the Jennifer situation because I havent healed from my own trauma from the abusive I had endured Blake expressed his agreement to the physical boundaries and expressed he didnt want to lose me again and our friendship Since implementing these boundaries our relationship has undergone a significant change We dont talk that much anymore and when we do the protective order case seems to be the main topic of discussion Although last night I visited Blakes place to watch Star Wars During the movie he asked me to engage in a platonic cuddle We did and he said Thank you I inquired about the reason behind his gratitude He mentioned that my presence was naturing and made him feel less lonely Am I only in his life because he feels lonely,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:52:22 UTC,2,4,1.0,,,0,0

1j3tjoq,Found a girl ODing and saved her life Found out more about the girl and what happened to her later,This is a bit long but its also how it happened Sunday afternoon my wife daughter daughtersfriend the dog and myself went to the river to play and collect some pretty rocks since it was so nice outside We live within walking distance and on the way back we were about to leave the levee along our normally used path when both my wife and I spotted something on the levee about 50 feet away we couldnt tell what it was I asked my wife to take the dogs leash so I could go check and to please take the girl a little way further away while I go make sure its just garbage As I got closer and saw it was a person I quickly told my wife and asked her to call 911 I went over to the person and found out it was a young looking girl and she was still breathing I ran back to my wife who was on the phone with emergency services and relayed the info that it was a young female still breathing not conscious I then ran back to the girl and tried loudly talkingshouting at her to see if I could get some reaction but I was very hesitant to touch her since I could see she was actively breathing Her phone which had been in her open hand the entire time began to make ringing noises and I tried to answer it but it was some kind of Instagram thing and not an actual call I dunno I set her phone back into her hand and about 30 seconds later a police officer showed up I waved at the officer to get his attention to the exact location He quickly ran up to me and gave her a very brief checkout before administering a dose of narcan He waited a few seconds and began to shake her and shouting a bit to get her awake which resulted in a moan and partial roll from her He kept trying to get her awake for maybe another 30 seconds and the ambulance showed up they almost drove by but saw me waving at them and managed to just barely make the turn 3 EMTs hurried up to us and checked her vitals and pupils and in the next 90 seconds they had her standing and eyes open I figured the was nothing else they needed me for I thanked them and quickly got out of the way A side note Im very impressed with the reaction time of both the police and the ambulance they were both on site with within 5 minutes of my wife calling them The next day at work I mentioned this to a coworker whose father I know owns the trailer part right next to where I found the girl My coworker found out more about what happened and I hate it Apparently the girl had gotten some weed from her cousin which had been lacedcontaminated with fentanyl It also sounds like her cousin was with her and left her laying there when she collapsed Also found out she had to be administered 2 more doses of narcan while in the ambulance and that she was only 13 years old Also learned I sort of know her I actually know her parents as I worked with them both about 10 years ago I remember seeing her as a small 23 year old kid havent seen her since though so I obviously didnt recognize her Im glad it was my family who found her and she will be ok someone could have easily drug her away down into the trees and she would have never been seen or heard again Im terrified for my daughter who is about half this girls age I cant believe how close I ended up being to her family I dunno how to end this but I needed to share the story Teach your kids how to be smart and responsible you wont always be there to tell them yourself And always wash your hands after touching random objects I vigorously washed my hands when I got home since I touched her phone which could have been contaminated with fentanyl for all I knew,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 03:13:53 UTC,1519,45,0.98,,,0,0
1j86p6k,My girlfriend broke up with me because I told her that do not call me man,Hi I am 21 yo person who identities as a woman though I do not have any effort to transition Only my inner cycle knows it I generally do not hide my thoughts or behaviors Many of my close friends knew that I am a trans before I told them so I am not sure if I truly identify the situation or not but hope that you understood I was dating with a girl who seems masculine She is cishet even though I did not think so when I met with her We were doing okay Cute dates romantic bonding sexual tension Everything was fine as I wish One day she refereed me as a man which I hate to hear I thought she said it by mistaken Did not talk about it until it occurred a few times more After the third time I decided to talk with her about the pronunciations ps In my native language we do not use pronounces Though still a person can be called as a man or a woman which hurts me in this context In a proper time I told her to not call me a man or mr and she asked why I explained everything I discovered about myself She was shocked by the things I told her said that she has no idea what to do and doesnt know even what to think I said its fine you have time etc to relax her A few days passed and everything was fine as I expected I have never faced with a negative things after I told my identity crises to my friends Until 14th of Feb aka Valentines day In the morning she text me that she feels awkward due to the situation and wanted to talk to me Then she called me with a crying sound Did not say anything new though it was impossible to feel the uncomfortable feelings of her We had a planned date at night which she canceled Two days after that day we broke up Just because I am not comfortable with hehim pronounces I feel ashamed and useless I have never been ashamed this much The only thing I told her that do not use man as she describes me It led us to break up I was left alone since I said truths about myself I feel anger against her want to take a revenge Though I think that it is a reasonable to breake up with somebody due to herhim identity,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 19:11:10 UTC,0,5,0.17,,,0,0

1j706wr,I was a sexual degenerate as a child and feel deeply ashamed and uncomfortable about it,Throwaway account because I dont want anyone I know to see this This is something Ive only ever told one person and I feel deeply uncomfortable to even tell a therapist For context I have never been a victim of sexual abuse physically was raised in a super healthy home life etc Nothing traumatic has ever happened to me due to another person I personally knew When I was younger I purposely would go on a site called KidzChat I knew that predators would be on that site and would advertise myself as someone to talk to F 12 I was around the ages of 1014 doing this Older men would then message me super sexually explicit things We would sext for a while and eventually trade Skypes to talk or videochat The biggest instance that I remember was skyping an older man who wanted to show me his jumping jacks He would jump for a while and then his pants would conveniently fall off For some reason that moment is engrained in my mind I know Im a victim fully but I feel weird because I went out looking for it I guess thats the cost of unlimited Internet access Another entirely separate thing that bothers me severely is that one day aged 11 I had my family dog perform oral on me The dog didnt need any coaxing it liked the smell and went up to it I remember it feeling awful and I felt so intensely guilty afterward I never did it again but I realize that this has deeply affected me as an adult I absolutely cannot receive oral from a man because it reminds me of what I did with my family dog This fact genuinely haunts me as I know it was completely wrong and animal I dont even know how to cope with both of these facts as I was a victim and perpetrator These things still affect me in my sexual life now manifesting as intense fear and guilt to commit certain normal sexual acts with people like being eaten out sexting my boyfriend etc I know I dont have the guts to tell a therapist either,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 05:01:10 UTC,157,23,0.89,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j7v7kp,I had one of the most disturbing dreams of my life,I had a really disturbing dream last night and I feel like it carries a strong meaning It was incredibly vivid and I felt an overwhelming sense of guilt and horror throughout The dream I was sleeping in a hammock in the hall of my apartment building in my hometown when an old woman and her friends surrounded me claiming that she had left her jewelryone necklace and three ringson my hammock While I was still halfasleep I found the jewelry but she kept grabbing at me searching for it I hid the pieces because I wanted to keep them Later I ended up returning only the necklace which was worthless at the buildings front desk but I kept the rings for myself This threw me into a huge moral dilemma Then I spent what felt like an eternity waiting for my food delivery When I finally went to pick it up I found the delivery guy lying on the ground in a pool of blood his legs completely crushed Cars kept driving over him as if he wasnt even there There were two other bodies crushed beyond recognition one of them a child I was with David my childhood best friend a doctor and Sophie my best friend one year behind me in med school David went to help the injured Meanwhile Leo a former friend I used to do reckless things with appeared but he only walked beside me We greeted each other exchanged glances like we had things to catch up on but we didnt actually talk As I walked back to my apartment still holding the rings in my mouth I decided to give them to the front desk guy But when I got there the usual porter was gonethis one was heavily tattooed someone I didnt recognize Instead of taking the jewelry he encouraged me to keep the rings and spend all the money on cocaine He handed the rings back to me Then I got home and my familybut it wasnt my real family it was The Sopranoswalked in Their presence made me feel emboldened to keep the jewelry I put the rings on my fingers But then the old woman appeared again This time she confronted me directly and took the rings from me The entire dream was extremely vivid I felt a crushing sense of guilt and the violence of the crushed bodies was horrifyingI could smell the blood and flesh mixed with rain and I could hear the families crying in the distance At some pointeither in this dream or another oneI also remember seeing my father It was from a time before he was bedridden before everything went downhill He died when I was 19 after a 3 year long battle with cancer Context that might be relevant Im a last year medical student and a maybe recovering polyaddict Im like a week totally clean from everything except nicotine ketamine and weed were the last drugs I used maybe three weeks clean of a mild to moderate opiate habit Coke isnt really my thing but I had a conversation about my addiction with my roommate and cant stop reflecting about my use ever since David is my childhood best friend now a doctor Sophie is my best friend one year behind me in med school Leo was my main companion for reckless behavior including drugs For whatever reason he suddenly cut me and another friend off but recently started sending memes like nothing happened For the first time Im considering cutting him off completely Im currently watching The Sopranos This was one of the heaviest dreams Ive ever had and I cant shake the feeling that it means something important Immediately after I woke up I felt the urge to register it I was calm just felt like an uncomfortable dream but as soon as I started reading ChatGPTs output on its meaning I had a legit anxiety attack Ive had like 5 LEGIT attacks in my life and this one was textbook Hyperventilation and a physical urge to cry even though I wasnt feeling really emotional This hit me hard man It reeks of psychoanalysis so much its comical,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 10:03:57 UTC,3,0,0.72,,,0,0

1j7b4sy,I spent years in love with my grandma,Three years ago I met a girl online and we hit it off instantly We texted every single day flirted shamelessly and honestly It was one of the best connections Ive ever had We never did video calls though so neither of us knew what the other looked like Were both introverts so it never crossed our minds to FaceTime weird I know but thats introvert life for you Despite that we developed a crush on each other but we decided to remain flirty friends who sometimes roleplay sexy things because were both not relationship people and and longdistance relationships are a hard pass for us So we just kept texting and gaming together Since I didnt know how she looks like my brain started creating an idealized version of her and I imagined her like this alluring confident intense and mysterious femme fatale One day this girl disappeared without saying anything Poof gone she deactivated all her gaming socials She was always quite depressive so my mind started to jump to the worst conclusions I was very worried And I endlessly tried looking for her everywhere but I only knew her name and country so I got nowhere I eventually gave up looking for her but she always remained haunting me in the back of my mind because of the way she had disappeared and the fact that I didnt know what happened to her So I kept thinking about her throughout the 2 remaining years replaying our last conversations to look for cues and all of that led me to dead ends It was frustrating And it was like a mystery that I needed to solve Alexa play oh whooo is sheee So one day I decided that enough is enough I was going to find her and I was going to get my answers even if I have to become the FBI myself I believe in manifestation and law of attraction so I spent a whole night visualizing me finding her personal socials the socials we had each other added were not personal socials it was gaming socials so I wanted to find either her Instagram or Facebook And it worked Next day I went full FBI detective mode I said the only information I had about her was her name and country so I used those leads and somehow I managed to stumble upon her real full name I think this was the manifestation and law of attraction at play or some kind of witchcraft I dunno It turned out that the name she had given me was a fake one but thats understandable so I dont hold it against her Whatever With her real name in hand I found out where she went to school where she went to college and of course her personal socials So I opened up her Facebook and Instagram filled with anticipation because finally I would be able to put a face to the ghost whod haunted me for 2 whole years And when I laid my eyes on her there she was THE SHEER REFLECTION OF MY GRANDMA WHEN YOUNG No really Like not kind of not a little resemblance I mean copypaste CtrlC CtrlV a perfect genetic duplicate of my grandma in her youth I had spent years chasing this mystery woman only for my brain to go Wait a minute is that grandma I WAS FUCKING IN LOVE WITH MY GRANDMA FOR YEARS Years of mystery longing idealization GONE IN A SECOND My attraction to her Instantly killed Biggest turn off of my life All the sexy things she had ever told me were no longer sexy and I just couldnt picture us physically together anymore We used to roleplay fear play scenarios AND NOW THE FEAR PLAY TURNED INTO FEAR FOR A DIFFERENT REASON Like instead of Im going to hunt you down and devour you being hot now its giving Eat your vegetables sweetheart and Im just sitting there like NOOOOOO THE MAGIC IS GONE This is the kind of thing that would send Freud into overdrive Tell me how does this make you feel LIKE SCREAMING FREUD IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE SCREAMING My brain had built up this intense mysterious alluring figure and then boom grandma vibes And I ended up in some kind of weird family reunion yay This is for real one of the biggest plot twists of my life I basically turned 3 years of longing into a detective saga with a twist ending and instead of crying Im laughing about it At this point Im just happy because I can finally close this chapter but at the same time I feel shallow for losing attraction towards her immediately after seeing her Oh well not everyone can be attracted to their grandma,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 16:21:03 UTC,0,1,0.5,,,0,0

1j7l8u4,One choice can blow up your life,I 27f got engaged 6 months ago to my now ex fiancé lets call him Ross 30m However that month was hell with my grandma who I was extremely close to dying I wasnt dealing with it I was just ignoring the pain and saying I was fine Well about 3 weeks after we got engaged and my grandma dying I had drinks with a friend 27f What started off as just a drink or two quickly turned to shots and not remembering even leaving the lounge Now most of this is from what I have been told by the friend her husband and my ex fiancé Friends husband lets call him Craig had to come and pick us up and took us back to their place My fiancé had his son and we lived about a hour away from the friends and where we got drinks so he was not able to come get me The friend and I apparently crashed in their bed with Craig having to wake me up when Ross called Now this is where stories have changed At first Ross and I were told that my friend and Craig started doing stuff in the same bed I was in and I woke up and joined in Whereas recently they have started to say I started everything The only memory that I have during any of this is thinking what the fuck am I doing and I then proceeded to run out of the room According to my ex fiancé I then called him and was trying to seduce him over the phone This is when I apparently told him what happened and he said I sounded excited My next memory is being on the phone with him and him yelling at me that I had called him just to tell him I cheated on him We apparently talked a little longer and then hung up And that night is the night my life fell apart Since that night we have tried to make it work but as you can tell he is now my ex fiancé He continues to holds resentment towards me and the friends on what happened I would also like to say that they are no longer friends either after that and the friend texting me telling me that she was the martyr in my relationship Well now that everything has ended and stuff has come to light I am struggling Craig was sober through the whole night and the friend while originally saying she didnt remember anything is now saying that she remembers all of it I am the only one that doesnt remember leaving the lounge or anything at their house besides that one thought and the one line from the phone call I am feeling very used and taken advantage of because sober or even buzzed I would have never hooked up with anyone but my fiancé Together we have experimented but it was together I am so unsure of how to feel about that night Now I am not looking for advice sympathy or really anything I just thought it might help if I write this all down And maybe someone can learn from my story that just because you think you can trust people to protect you that may not be the case and one night can take the life your building away If there are questions Ill do my best to answer them in the comments Thanks for reading,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 23:47:34 UTC,4,2,0.65,,,0,0

1j73qfo,My partner is completely irresponsible with money and Im considering breaking up,I apologize in advance for any grammarspelling mistakes english is not my first language For context me 27F and my bf 25M have been in a relationship for 5 years and living together in my fathers house for 4 in my country living costs are really high so its pretty common to still stay with your parents beyond your 20s At the end of last year my bf decided he needed a new phone for posting content tiktok and reels since his current phones camera wasnt good and his career gym instructor personal trainer could use a boost from social media While I agreed that a new phone with a better camera would help and I knew that he had saved some money I asked him to wait a little longer 1 month or 2 before making any impulsive puchases since I was unemployed at the time and that money could be used for any emergencies Well he disregarded everything I said and decided to buy the phone anyway and to make a long story short it was a scam in wich he lost almost 800 To say I was disappointed is an understatement because i told him before that even though the money was his and he could use it any way he wanted the shop was really suspicious and it was better to buy from an official store if he was going to spend that much in a phone It was really frustrating but I tried to help him contact his bank to see if there was anything we could do and to my surprise they refund almost half of the money but my happiness was short lived because the very next day he fell for another scam and lost both the recovered money plus 300 250 from his account and 50 from mine I was livid at this point the car had broken down another 600 expense we had no way to pay our share of the bills plus the repair costs and he had to ask for money from his mother bless her to solve everything but we survived Well now Im employed and things were better until yesterday when he told me he was thinking again about buying the phone to wich I told him no way not right now since were not completely stable yet to spend that much money and I thought he would be at least a bit more mindful since were still paying for his poor decisions from last year and we barely have money for bills but he didnt want to listen to my reasoning kept justifying why he needed it and Im sure hell buy it even though he knows that if he does that Ill have to cover his share of house expenses and Im honestly mentally and emotionally exhausted I feel like he isnt my partner anymore just an oversized toddler and its draining me For additional context hes been betting his money on soccer games and although he wins most of them last week he almost lost all of the grocery money Our currency is not USD so those are all approximate values If you survived my ranting thank you for reading everything,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 09:04:59 UTC,10,7,0.92,,,0,0

1j7kduf,I befriended a teacher when I was 14 and almost ruined his life,Ive only told maybe 2 people for my entire life about this but its been weighing on me recently I feel like I need to just shout to the void about it I28M befriended one of my teachers when I was 14 At the time he was 35 For more background I was F at the time now FtM He was my middle school teacher and when I switched schools I added him on Facebook It wasnt until around my freshman year of high school that we really started to talk At first I basically harassed him sending him messages daily until he started to reply and it became conversational After about a year we began messaging each other daily It was never anything inappropriate we mainly talked about games music art daily life etc normal friendly type conversation We never hung out or met up or anything The only time I saw him after he was my teacher was one time at a school event I lived in an abusive home and was a very lonely kid I always figured he sensed that and that I just neededwanted someone to talk to who actually cared He became what I still consider to be my best friend at the time I eventually started to have feelings for him because of this I still remember telling him how I felt and him saying something along the lines of Im very flattered but thats not appropriate The conversation dwindled a bit after that but some time passed and we picked back up our daily conversations One morning I woke up to see my father on my computer snooping through my messages with this former teacher I freaked out and told him this We ended up exchanging numbers and started texting because of this A while went by a few months if I remember right we continued our friendship and daily conversations Something happened and my parents took my phone I cant exactly remember why they took it I went to lunch with a friend one day and when I got home both of my parents were there and I knew something was wrong they divorced and hated each other They confronted me about my teacher and Is friendship saying they knew everything My father had texted him through my phone telling him to cease contact and threatening to report him to the school board if he ever tried talking to me again I was heartbroken hearing this and knowing Id never speak to him again My parents claim he was grooming me but I never felt that way He felt more like a dad or an uncle and treated me almost as his kid Plus as mentioned before I basically harassed this man into talking to me I always got the feeling he just kind of felt bad for me especially looking back on our conversations and this situation as an adult I never spoke with him again after that It was somewhat of a traumatic experience for me but only because someone I really cared about just suddenly vanished from my life and I felt as though I had nearly ruined his life because I was a lonely kid The loss I experienced changed me as a person and the way I view all relationships I still think of him often I want to reach out and ask him how he is and tell him how sorry I am for putting him in such a bad situation Its just been so long and I dont want to dredge up the past especially when Im sure it was also traumatic for him I dont know how to move on when it ended so abruptly and so badly I have dreams of running into him on the street and getting my opportunity to tell him Im sorry and hear how he dealt with things afterward,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 23:06:16 UTC,465,64,0.91,,,0,0
1j7fdqt,My exgirlfriend gaslit me while relationship while cheating on me found out on my birthday,My m24 now exf26 girlfriend started dating in March last year I had just come out of a toxic situationship where I take part blame I was a bad communicator Im sure I still am but I gained some communication skills I really liked her found my now ex 3 weeks later I knew it would be a rebound but it helped so much Especially considering this girl had been my crush since 8 years ago when I had first started working with her We had so much fun early on trips going out eating out It started to feel less like a rebound and something of a real relationship Unfortunately it came to her moving out of her moms house She needed a place to go and me with my somewhat trust issues was scared to let her move in with her friends which were one girl and two guys She had been known to get around but I trusted her more than most people did and had hope She was very kind had many mental issues but nothing I couldnt stand I had grown up with childhood trauma and this seemed like nothing So me with my trust issues and wanting to move out of my moms house as well took her offer of renting a place together It seemed fun and I had just started a career job so it seemed like a good time Found out very quickly it would not be See my ex well call Fiona had severe insecurities and drinking issues not to mention drug addiction I had known to some extent but not to this severity The first week we moved in I wanted to have a get together party for our first place together Turns out Fiona hates having people in her space She was very quiet the whole night and near the end she stormed off to the room where Id get yelled at when I head to bed She scream at me in bed as I had work the next morning I told her sorry and wed talk about it tomorrow She got up and stormed out the room I was just happy for the quiet until I hear her screaming my name and yelling help Help I storm out seeing her wrist covered in blood with it spilling all over the floors I help her best I can she didnt hit an artery so it soon stopped but left a nasty scar After this night most nights especially when we went out I would get no rest being accused of cheating or just not giving her enough love Over the next few months one of our mutual friends decided a surprise birthday party for her I honestly wasnt thinking to hard about it I just thought maybe itd make her happy forgetting she didnt like people in her space Same thing happened She was upset the whole night stayed in the bedrooms and never came out Through out the night you could hear her screams saying get out of my house In the most embarrassing way possible Her sister was there and tried to calm her down the whole night which did not work I eventually got everyone out because the music was barely covering it up I went to bed again Same thing yelling at me She got up stormed out I was worried but thought that it was a one time thing Nope I instantly hear my name being screamed This time much worse I come out to see the cut is even deeper attempt to stop the bleeding but it just wont I call 911 while making a makeshift tourniquet to try and stop it The paramedics get her after the police which was someone I knew I told them about how she was saying before that she wanted to die I didnt think this was an attempt but a callout I took her to the hospital after the medics said she didnt need the ambulance after patching her up Stayed up all night at the hospital dropped her off at home then went to work I was miserable I couldnt stand this anymore I didnt want to break the lease but at the same time I also still cared for this girl I felt bad I needed a way out that night was my chance but you just couldnt leave her alone she cried and begged me So we continued our relationship A few months later same thing yelling at me and saying I dont give her enough affirmations and accusing me of deleting snapchats and sneaking people in when shes off at work Which led to a night that she destroyed my tv in the living room put holes in the walls and screamed at me in my face I was done I left to stay at my friends house Told her to leave wed figure out the situation after The day after she said she needed time to move and wanted to talk I went over and we talked the whole night She promised shed get therapy and help And I felt so terrible I truly loved this girl but it was such a toxic relationship I gave her one last chance We decided to stick together agreeing to talk things out more See I still have my trust issues and being accused of things makes me curious why its that in particular I memorized her password months ago but never really felt the need to look through her phone I had it just in case But I was working one night straight shift She went out with her friends Acted very strange to me and I just felt something was off I come home at 7am find her dead asleep Couldnt even wake her up to give her a kiss She had left her phone on my side of the bed I felt the urge to look through it Went through it for hours Finding hidden messages in messenger of her taking to her ex saying how she thinks about him everyday and that she needs him Other messages to her OTHER ex on Snapchat came across it by chance because it had been cleared and muted It was of last night being very flirty and him leaving hearts and her pictures with her hearting back Her saying I miss you and then a phone call about 6 minutes lasting I called this number I asked him to be straight up if shes cheating He sounded dumbfounded but said she wasnt and that they were just friends that use to date But I found pictures dating only right before we started dating that they were kissing and all over eachother I woke her up absolutely heated Ngl this was probably the angriest Ive ever been I told her what I had seen She of course denied it Eventually admitting that it was cheating but they never had sex Which I absolutely think is a lie But I said it was over and she took it so easily She nodded and called her mom got her stuff in the car then laughing about a joke she made saying shes tired of constantly moving All while I sit and wait for her to leave Also if I didnt mention this happened ALL ON MY BIRTHDAY She leaves not answering any of my questions like why how could you do this Since then Ive been sitting here she still left a few things and needs a truck to come pick them up She just texted me that shes coming today to pick them up I still feel like shit but can hold my emotions

1j4q5vg,54 and struggling,Hi I when I was 12 I was playing in an arcade on the slot machines and a guy came up to me and started feeding my machine with cash I went back every week and he paid whilst I played This happended over a period which I cannot remember and then one day he started to stroke my penis Nobody had ever touched me here before so naturally my body reacted and I got erect even though i was scared as hell I continued to go back for six months then one day he took me to a cafe on the pier and bought me dinner Burger chips etc He undid my zip on my trousers and got my cock out and jerked me off and I came my first ever ejaculation I keep blaming myself because I kept going back to get jerked off and fed My mom was single parent and dad moved away I was left alone for hours when she was working I now realise I was groomed and sexually assaulted I still have these feelings of excitement when I remember this first time which then turn immediately to disgust at myself for saying nothing and letting it continue I have had therapy when i was 16 Long story but I was addicted to the machines by now and another guy started doing the same and pay me 40 for the privilege The money just went back on the machines This second guy groomed me so much I ended up going to his flat to see his spectrum computer and he continued there which turned to blowing me and paying me 40 The last time i went he raped me I ran away after and stayed out late and the police were out looking for me I was scared to go home as much bottom was so painful The police found me hiding under the pier and took me home I told them and mum that I had realised I was late home and rather than face the music stayed out as I was scared of getting into trouble So naturally I was in a vicious circle the later it became The accepted it and nothing was said about the assault I dont remember how I dealt with the pain but my brain has blocked some stuff out FF three years and the police turned up at myself home and said I had been exposing my penis to the public I seriously honestly have no recollection of this at all They cautioned me and my mum shouted and screamed when they went asking why until I broke down after she said has someone hurt you She got the police back and I made a statement To this day Ive never been told what happened the guy Whethery they caught him or not but I never had to go to court For years I thought they filed it nfa as I was just a dirty rent boy who deserved what he got I feel let down by the police as I know now that I was a child and it was grooming secual assault and rape I am a gay man and have never been able to take it sorry for the crudeness due to the memory I know its not everything but I know Im a disappointment for not being a real gay man When I have these feelings of not being good enough for anyone or deserving of anything I struggle and want to run away As i am a let down to others for not getting over it Ive been in a relationship for 28nyesrs and my partner he knows everything but I still regularly have these days of being not enoug people pleasing and feeling like everyone would be better without me For some reason I just had my first nightmare in over 35 years and it started with the first day of being touched at 12 and ended with the rape and police I woke up to my disgust with an erection which soon went down when i was awake I feel sick and cant believer my body reacted in this way to a traumatic memory I have felt guilty all these years that the guys who assaulted me made me erect and ejaculate but the therapist said it was just a natural reaction to being touched down there And Ive accepted it wasnt my fault Until now That dream has taken me back over 40 years and to wake up erect makes me wanna kill myself What sick fuck am i Or was it my 12 year old inner person that made meerect I am due at work in a cople of hours and cant face the world I am disgusted with myself again after all the years of counselling and accepting i was a child and they were adults and as such I took no blame whatsoever But this fucking nightmare has moved the goalposts Why the fuck would I wake up sexually excited over something so traumatic The only thing I can think of is yesterday my partner and I and his sister found out their dad my dad in law has secondary cancer and metastatic cancer which is obious a traumatic Could this trigger earlier trauma But the sick feeling of waking up with an erection makes me feel so low i cant tell anyone I wont kill myself dw I am a people pleaser and would never put my friends and family through that I have cptsd as 8 years ago my best mate took his life and I found him So I could never put others through what I have So in not killing myself I am a failure to me twice As I am pleasing others instead of me I just wanna go back to the day before yesterday when I felt a normal person Instead a funked up freak of nature,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06

1j42ewg,It feels like I was SAd even though it probably wasnt sa,The whole thing happened over 10 years ago and I had actually repressed the situation pretty well until my ex messaged me again recently Now I think about it every day and have panic attacks because of it Back then we werent together yet but he knew that I was in love with him One evening we were at his best friends place and the two of them were smoking a bong They wanted me to smoke as well I asked what it was and they said weed Being stupid I took a hit but whatever it was it definitely wasnt weed At first I got extremely dizzy then I couldnt move anymore and I started panicking inside because I couldnt speak or even breathe After about 10 minutes his best friend told him to check if I was still breathing which he did When he confirmed that I was still breathing the other guy left the room to go to sleep Thats when my ex started undressing me and then had sex with me It must have lasted for several hours and towards the end I was somewhat conscious again and could have said something But I didntI just couldnt At some point he stopped and I went home I had never felt as horrible lying in my own bed as I did after that night Afterward I desperately wanted to be with himprobably because I thought it would somehow undo what had happened About a year later we actually got together But maybe Im overinterpreting the situation After all he knew I loved him so maybe he thought I wanted it too Ill probably talk to my therapist about it but Im afraid Im making it into something bigger than it actually was Besides it was my fault too I dont know I just wanted to get it off my chest,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 12:55:19 UTC,0,4,0.25,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j354wi,Is It Normal for a Mom to Act Like This Feels Like I Have a Teenager for a Parent,What do i do Sometimes i feel like my mom can just be the worst She can be so rude immature and she acts like a teenager Am i wrong for thinking this I keep switching between self pity and guilt because i just have no idea if this is normal or not because all in all she is my mom and i love her very much but sometimes when i witness some of my friends relationships with their mothers i feel tears come to my eyes literally Basically for context i graduated from high school four months ago and im only going to university next year so taking a gap year to travel and work and im leaving overseas in three months So basically my day to day just consists of learning the piano trying to find a job reading a bit organising my OE and occasionally hanging out with friends Today i was watching Tv which to be honest i rarely rarely do and out of nowhere she comes storming in with a horrible attitude and my heart just immediately starts racing because for some reason I can never fully relax around her Im just always on edge even the sound of her footsteps gives me anxiety She starts complaining and getting angry at me basically muttering this lazy bitch etc to herself because she was working and didnt have time for lunch yet while i was sitting infront ofthe TV I mean am i wrong for getting a bit uncomfortable and weirded out by that Just because I feel like she shouldnt be comparing herself to me and it just feels very immature and strange like is it entitled for me to think yes well your the adult and im not sure why your comparing yourself to your teenage daughter Like she was trying to guilt trip me Shes just always angry and taking shots at me and it feels so weird because Im the one that has to endure her tantrums and Ive learnt not to react or give her my emotions and try and just stay level Its to the point where if she does decide to be nice to me i just get sad or even angry because its like i cant even enjoy it because i know it wont last Its like she flips a switch depending on her mood It reallly feels like im on eggshells when im in the same room as her and it almost feels stuffy and hard to breathe Like i just cant enjoy myself or let my mind be at rest im always aware of where she is and what shes doing and when she leaves the room i can breathe I understand to an extent why she is so angry and frustrated with me all the time but its just upsetting because i feel like i can count on one hand the amount of times she speaks to me nicely in a week To be honest my room is a pigstye and i know it and i hate it too but im just in a bit of a rut right now and i know its bad and ive been trying to clear it step by step but its very overwhelming for me and i dont blame her for being frustrated about it But I was finally makin some progress the other day and packing my dirty clothes into one basket and organising them in the other and then i go to bed and leave it for the next day to put away I wakeup and the clothes are thrown everywhere around the room and i hear her yelling that i shouldnt be using the baskets she needs for laundry or something like that To be honest i wasnt really even suprised or angry But today i decided to sort of get back at her a bit which i know is immature but i couldnt realy control my emotions and when i get angry i dont yell back or argue i just do something small to the other person which sort of calms down my head so i squirted a bit of ketchup from my lunch onto the carpet It was really only a dollar coin size but i go back to my room and i hear her storming down the stairs and throwing open my door and starting to scream at me about it I just really am at a loss and dont know if its me or if its her,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 07:04:41 UTC,1,2,1.0,,,0,0

1j7ik5i,7layer carrot cake The shame Not death but pretty similar to a death sentence,The way life taught me about sex Not my mom or dad or a sex ed teacher But life Lets keep in mind that as humans we have an innate instinct to procreate My dad used to babysit me while my mom would go to work He would put Asian music videos on in the living room and I would sing and dance to the songs all day long I was 4 I was a sociable outspoken singing daddys girl and I loved people because they would dote on me What Im really trying to say here is at 4 I could recognize humans and human beings My dad took me over to his buddys house His buddy had two sons One was about 7 and the other son was about 4 as well While he and his buddies were hanging out downstairs the older boy 7 showed me a book his dad had of naked people in all sorts of sexual positions kind of like a Kama Sutra He proceeded to usher me into a closet and took off all my clothes My dad found me naked in the closet and helped me put all my clothes back on and we went home At around 5 years old I woke up one morning and looked around My little brother was sleeping in a separate bed in the same room as me As you know and as I have mentioned above I loved watching TV because of the music videos and because of Barney and other things I would watch on TV So this somber morning I woke up walked to my parents room and they were sleeping and I didnt want to wake them up I walked back to my room where my brother was sleeping We had a TV in our room and laying around on the floor were a VHS tapes So I picked one up and popped it in It was a porn tape I remembered the naked people from the book that one kid had showed me and this porn tape had the same people Naked and actively doing things I somehow knew it was bad So I turned down the volume and I watched the whole thing instead of taking out the VHS Lets just say curiosity killed the cat and I was the very curious kitten Then around the same year at 5 years old I was molested by my uncle He was living in the same house as us in the basement It happened to my memory one time and one time only I knew what had happened to me the moment it happened I knew something bad had happened to me and I knew what sex was but I just didnt know the exact words for what everything was That is my 7layor carrot cake story Not exactly 7 layers but it just seems that bad things of a sexual nature kept making its way into my very short life and I came out on the other side too knowing and too knowledgable way too soon Every day I wish I had had the chance to be innocent and to be trusting of others and of people I wish I had the chance to be a happygolucky kid unburdened But I was denied that I grew up with no friends at all because of the amount of guilt I felt The fact I understood sex at such a young age and being molested it was like an awkward secret I just kept inside But secrets weight on you Even if you dont think they do Its a physical manifestation and I was not the beautiful child I always wished I was I was dark and small and always was a little heavier than other girls Because of all those reasons I still have no friends I have never made a friend I still have extremely low selfesteem paired with a high body count Im just not normal It feels this way at all times I always stick to myself and I never look anyone in the eye The shame I also want to note to anybody that was raised around too many males Just dont Its not safe for any parent with a small female child to be around that many menmales all at once and even if you trust them I would say you should always have a considerable amount of doubt and remove your child from danger or harm,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 21:44:50 UTC,2,0,0.61,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j638ou,My dads in the icu my boyfriends planning a trip,This happened in mid January For context I am 32F and my boyfriend is 34m weve been together for 3 years and we live together in a house that I own Now for the story my dad has been unwell for over a month and my siblings and I mom died from cancer when I was young have been taking care of him while we waited for test results and some answers Last week his condition took a turn for the worst and he ended up being taken to the hospital by ambulance and has been in the icu for a week He was diagnosed with cancer We still dont have all the answers and I dont know what the future holds for my family On the third day that my dad was in the icu my boyfriend was at work and texted me about his plans for the following day that consisted of him meeting up with friends to plan their trip I knew they had been talking loosely talking about potentially going on a trip at the end of the month but I thought it was common sense that since my dad is in the hospital the trip would be off Well apparently not Needless to say we had an argument I told him its extremely hurtful that he would abandon me at a time like this After a lot of back and forth throughout the day he let me know the trip was cancelled nothing had been paid for or even booked yet but at this point I just feel like the damage is done Who would prioritize a boys trip when their partners only parent is extremely sick in the hospital The obvious answer is to break up but I dont know if I have it in me to go through a breakup right now Its been a few days now my dad is doing much better hes out of the icu and Ive been there everyday helping him with his recovery so he can come home Ive been off work for the past week and a half during all this and went back yesterday and have been going to the hospital between shifts My boyfriend has been moping around the house the last few days and every time I ask him whats wrong he says nothing or I dont know Im just sad I said if this is about the trip then just go He says thats not what its about I suggested he goes to talk to someone a therapist or a friend or me He declined all of this I asked what I can do to help he said nothing and Im not his therapist I said nothing and just collected my stuff and went to work I have a lot on my plate already and Im feeling angry that hes putting this on me now as well We spent the next few days avoiding eachother around the house which was making my mental health seriously depleted We finally had a conversation I told him he should go on the trip because theres no sense of him staying here if hes not even going to acknowledge me or be supportive to me and my family anyways The next day he booked his flight I tried to convince myself I was okay with it but his 5 day trip suddenly turned into 10 days and I just knew I was done We had a few conversations while he was away mostly me crying and telling him how angry I am with him He came home and I ended it as soon as he walked in the door He begged and pleaded said he never would have left if he knew I would end it because of the trip There was a lot of back and forth and I asked him if he could just leave for a few days to give me some space which he did He ended up taking me on a date for Valentines Day later that week and things seemed to be getting a little bit better We planned a night away the following week to try to connect again During our romantic night away he decided it was a good idea to invite his friend and friends girlfriend to join us for dinner the girlfriend ended up not coming so it was just me my bf and his friend and then surprisingly a bunch of his other work friends just happened to be at the same restaurant What was supposed to be a romantic evening to try to repair our relationship ended up being a table of 8 of us talking about my boyfriends job We went back to the hotel got into an argument and went to bed angry The next day we woke up and he got in the shower and left his Apple Watch on the night stand I had that gut instinct to check his messages and there it was He was been messaging with another girl the entire time my dad was in the hospital and was meeting up with her for coffee dates Which I highly doubt is all that happened So ya thats it He moved his stuff out last week and the person I thought I knew for the last almost 4 years has become the person whose hurt me more than anyone ever has in my life Im on my own again going to be 33 next month and starting from scratch I dont know what the future holds but it has to be better than this right,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:17:01 UTC,7,1,0.71,,,0,0

1j7knoh,Reconnecting with someone but Im so sensitive to their teasing comments,Not really looking for any advice on this I just need to vent as I dont feel its a big enough deal to bring it up to them grinning_face_with_sweat Ive recently been talking to someone I lost touch with ages ago We used to be extremely close and always teased each other jokingly But since reconnecting with them Ive just been feeling a lot more sensitive to their comments It feels silly as I know they dont mean anything bad by their words but I just find myself wondering if they even really like me as a person or if theyre judging me Couple of examples I have pet cats and this friend knows I love them Theyve never liked cats which is fine They sent over a funny video of a cat but that somehow devolved into them telling me how much they hate cats and talking about how they also thought cats made their owners bitches etc I just tried to brush it off and joke back defending my stance on cats a little bit This isnt the first time Ive had to hear about someones grievances with cats but its just such a conversation killer for me Like cool you hate the animals I happen to really like I am so glad you have given me this reminder lol The other thing that bothered me a bit was just a comment that made me feel like they thought I was immature I said something like Oh this slaps and they immediately said Dont say that youre 31 Its such a small thing but I guess Ive always been a bit anxious about seeming mature enough to people so it did sting a bit I imagine a lot of this is just my own anxieties getting the best of me as well as the fact that its been so long that were almost strangers in a lot of ways I guess I dont really know what they think do me anymore If you made it this far thanks for reading grinning_face_with_sweat,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 23:19:06 UTC,1,0,0.67,,,0,0

1j7m4go,He didnt stop when I was shaking,The content warning is because Im not sure if it is that but if it is I dont want to trigger anyone For context theres a guy 20m I 18f have been talking to and hooking up with for a little while now We met up Friday night and had discussed going a bit rougher and what that entailed and I was really looking forward to it He also brought some drinks for us We were drinking a bit and went for one round then drank some more I was sipping mine over the night and hadnt noticed until later but he had around three beers The second time we went he was struggling to get it up because of the alcohol and I gave him head to help He slapped my face while I was which we had talked about but I was hesitant so I wasnt expecting it I could feel it through my entire skull but didnt stop or say anything The whole time before this he was gentle when I gave him head because of my gag reflex but he started pushing it a bit not too much though and I could pull away I think he was getting frustrated that he couldnt get off at this point and flipped me onto by back I was on a bed he was standing next to He said he was going to finish on my face I didnt say anything but the idea of that is so disgusting and I was fearful I guess He would switch between jerking off and using my mouth forcefully at this point and my whole body was kind of heaving when I gagged I was shaking a bit even my jaw was trembling At one point my jaw trembled a bit more obviously and he laughed a bit I think at that I dont think he could tell that I was uncomfortable and right after this he leaned over my face to try to finish on my chest instead I was still shaking and at this point crying a bit my eyes were already a bit wet from gagging He couldnt see me crying though All I could think was that I felt horrible and I wanted to go home He eventually gave up but noticed at that point that something was up I wasnt looking at him or saying anything and he asked if he pushed too far I still wasnt saying anything and I was crying He hugged me and I cried a bit heavily but quietly not sure if he noticed He told me that if I wasnt comfortable I need to tell him to stop right away We showered after and I was still shaken We went to bed right after and the next morning we had fun like usual Hes a good guy and prioritizes me getting off and things like that I dont blame him for what happened or didnt until I asked a guy friend if he would stop if someone was shaking and he said yes like its obvious Im wondering if maybe the alcohol could have caused him to not notice or what And I understand that even if you consent but dont really want it it still feels horrible and thats why even two days after I feel sick to my stomach thinking about it I just dont know how to stop thinking about it EDIT Thank you everyone for commenting I will definitely be talking with him more indepth about boundaries safewords and physical stops too A few other things he is not my boyfriend this is a strictly fwb situation and neither of us want a relationship I dont think what happened was assault I just felt horrible during it but I understand that hes not at fault The reason I made this post was I was trying to classify what happened to try to feel better and understand it was a miscommunication for sure and I feel a LOT better about it,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 00:30:16 UTC,1,27,0.51,,,0,0

1j5qsiz,I accidentally walked into a secret Russian spy base,Back in 2019 I had an appointment at a Jewish school in Amsterdam I was told to look for a schoolbuilding with a large fence around it and camera security Once I arrived at the location I saw a building that fitted the description I couldnt find something that seemed like an entrance but I noticed a gate and door that were open because someone was talking out the trash and walked in trough there I had taken notice that inside the compound there were two luxury cars parked one with Russian licence plates and one with diplomatic plates Once inside it took me a while to find a person but after searching a bit I found a man who didnt speak dutch and was looking at me with confusion I explained I had an appointment at the school and he simply pointed out to me that the Jewish school was the building next door and directed me out of the building At the school they couldnt tell me what was in that building there was noting indicated there on google maps And for years I have wondered about what it was because it had a vibe as if I had just stumbled into a secret Russian base that I wasnt supposed to find I was reminded of this incident earlier today and finally decided to do some research into the building located at the Veluwelaan in Amsterdam And as it turns out the building was indeed closed a couple of years ago because it was a base for the Russian secret service Holy cow I literally walked into a Russian spy base 5 years ago And more importantly I got to walk out of a Russian spy base alive,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 15:24:05 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0

1j73e1b,I killed my dog and its been haunting me for a long time now,A bit of backstory I used to live in the countryside with an older relative and she had a habit of acquiring pets she was unable and unwilling to take care of eventually we ended up with four dogs two small and two large The problem is that every time we would open the front gate to take the car out the dogs would run out into the brush and potentially put themselves in danger so wed lock them in a tiny cage for a few minutes while we drove out and then come back in and let them out into the yard The two large dogs started to get too big and the relative refused to buy a new larger cage for them and told me to figure it out it was my job to lock up the dogs and this relative could basically boss me around all she wanted eventually I started putting one of the smaller dogs in an open plastic barrel while the others stayed in the cage but she learned to jump out so I would put a lid on it for more than five minutes I hate myself for it but I am an extremely almost medically forgetful person And one day I simply forgot about the dogs and went to work truly believing that I had let them out as usual I came back to find that the dog had suffocated in the covered barrel I cant explain the emotions I had in that day but that happened when I was 16 and it still makes me nauseous to think about Ive had a very hard life but for some reason I think that this day was the worst day There was a lot of screaming and crying from both the relative and I and she made me wrap the dog in an old dog food bag and carry it to the car so that I could dump it far from our property unceremoniously It still fucking haunts me Everyone tells me it was an accident but I still have nightmares about it All I can think about is how horrible it must be to be a tiny innocent thing suffocating in a plastic barrel on a hot day It eats me alive Everything makes me anxious I dont want to be responsible for something like that happening again I want to have kids one day but how can I knowing that theres a possibility that they can meet a horrible end just because my mind is in the clouds The only time I spoke of this event was the day it happened to various online friends and then I never spoke of it again since until now Im laying in bed and trying to sleep and maybe it would help if someone knew Im sorry Lila I didnt mean to,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 08:38:30 UTC,0,1,0.33,,CONTENT WARNING ANIMAL ABUSE,0,0

1j7ce4s,Grieving biking season,For the past 2 years Ive been smoking weed almost daily I recently went through a lot of changes and in that I quit smoking and started taking supervised urine tests Among other things I knew that taking these tests meant I couldnt take my drivers license for at least a few months and that was okay with me What I didnt know is that it meant I couldnt drive at all until these tests were finished which is 6 months even tho I am clean My doctor failed to tell me or I failed to remember that I cant use the license for my motorcycle that i already have I recently met a guy who made my passion for driving motorcycles light up again I was so ready to get back on the bike bring it out of the garage change out the oil and have it in pristine condition I was so excited to spent a summer on two wheels while getting my life back on track and this time with someone to share the joy with In some ways it was part of my motivation for staying clean and having it ripped away in the span of a few google searches made it that much harder I feel so angry and stupid I feel like I should have known and I feel like it was obvious Yet I thought in some magical way that I could keep my excisting licence just not take another drivers test I was so ready for the freedom of driving to work and going on road trips Or just driving to the store without relying on commute or friends or having to walk for 15 minutes I know it really isnt the end of the world but the next 5 months is gonna be that much more challenging knowing I could have been on a bike if I hadnt admitted to my doctor that I smoked weed Im gonna call the doctors office tomorrow to see if Im correct in thinking I cant drive my motorcycle but Im scared of getting my hopes up Id rather sit with knowing Ill get told I cant drive than be let down again tomorrow But on the other side of things I probably wouldnt have quit if it wasnt for having to do this at some point either way It just sucks that Ill be done with these tests in September at the very end of the season,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 17:15:58 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j3m1c0,Called out my boyfriend feel a little guilty now,So let me F19 start this off by saying my boyfriend M22 is most likely autistic and also very socially awkward He doesnt have any irl friends and pretty much only talks to me and his mum His mum is an alcoholic and a lot of the time they fight because shes drinking and he has to raise his voice and be stern to get any point across He hates that he has to and does try to talk to her normally I understand this However he does kinda do it towards me too I mentioned hes most likely autistic I am autistic so he could entirely not be I just think he is as well and this very much presents in the way he gets irritatedoverwhelmedupset when he doesnt understand something or something doesnt have a logical answer or fit the logical answer he has in his head I put up with this because I understand getting frustrated when things arent how they should be but last night I really just couldnt handle it We got into a stupid disagreement over a movie he wanted to show me because he likes the perspective its shot in He asked if I knew what he meant and I said yes I just couldnt articulate it out loud I do have a problem with that where I can know the answer to something but the more someone prods at me to say it it ends up just completely leaving my mind and it makes me feel stupid He asked if I just said that because I didnt know but didnt want to sound dumb and i explained the above point and told him I learned perspectives in drama class Now this is not the first time Ive mentioned to him that I had to learn basic cinematography in two of the 4 years I took drama in high school but he either forgot or just got too in his head where he was making me seem stupid and he kept saying things along the lines of drama is acting Cinematography is filming Theyre different I even tried to remind him multiple times about the fact I needed to know it for class but I kept getting interrupted which annoyed me since he gets so aggravated if anyone interrupts him and says interruptions only lead to arguments until he finally just pretty much said the point I had been saying and ended it with him yet again reminding me drama isnt cinematography and asking if I saw why he was getting misled I ended up saying he needed to stop calling me stupid which at first he tried to defend because hes never outright called me stupid which is true just the way he treats me occasionally makes me feel lesser and he ended up getting upset because his defence turned into him saying he didnt get why people always made him feel like an asshole when thats just how he is and I told him this might just be the way he talks but its disrespectful and thats why he feels that way I also dont really get this because he always says hes changing but nobody else is and while its true hes growing as a person losing weight got a job gaining confidence and setting goals his behaviour does need work and he cant expect everyone else including me to immediately change when he doesnt like certain things but then use the excuse of thats just how he is We ended up not talking for the rest of the night and while I do feel justified in what Ive said I do still feel guilty for making him upset I was kinda hoping he had work today so he wouldnt be in a bad mood until I say something he really likes his job and also doesnt have a specific schedule he kinda just goes as hes needed but as guilty as I feel I dont want to apologize for anything,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 21:25:52 UTC,0,2,0.4,,,0,0

1j6ysb5,FINAL UPDATE I 21F found out my husband 33M has been having an affair with my mother and I dont know where to go from here,Hey so this will be my final update on everything as I believe the situation has finally come to an end and Im in a really good place I left off where I was in a shelter and had made a lot of friends Well the girl who I was gonna move somewhere with she ended up going back to her Mom and step Dad and so I was back to being stuck on what to do That was until I got a message from my grandma that her mom my greatgrandma needs someone to care for her she said that her brother would be happy to have me stay with him as long as I care for my great grandma I decided I have nothing left to lose and decided this would be a good gig till I find out what I wanna do I arrived in Miami 3 days ago and have been enjoying it greatly so far I never really knew my dads side as he wasnt that close with his family and after he passed it was hard to keep contact My greatuncle is very nice and very accommodating and his wife is really nice they live in quite a nice part of Miami as well near the beach I havent seen my greatgrandma in over 10 years and she was so happy when she saw me She cant speak that much English as she only really speaks Spanish Im aware I said my dad was white but thats was only because I was scared of my identity being revealed and that wasnt a 100 lie My father was Cuban and was born and raised in Miami however he was most likely a descendant of Spaniards Anyways my great grandma has been teaching me Spanish and as well through the help of translating of my great uncle stories about my dad She told me that he would fall asleep on her lap at family gatherings and how he would make the whole family laugh imitating her accent It made me tear up seeing all the photos of him as a kid with his whole family She told me that when he got on drugs and ran away from home it left everyone in complete distraught She claimed my grandma would cry everyday My Mom never had a relationship with them and that was her choice they wanted to meet her actually They told me that they werent shocked what happened to me as my Dad told them later on my mom would cheat on him all the time with other men This made me furious as my mom always claimed my dad was her soulmate I have not heard anything from my mom however my cousins wedding went ahead yesterday as my aunty posted it on Facebook My mom was there and she seemed completely fine from the photos The wedding looked boring anyways my cousin is marrying his first cousin from Pakistan inlaws side and no one is smiling It made me laugh actually seeing my mom with all these people who are deeply religious and conservative Seeing my mom next to my grandma and other female relatives who wear scarfs and are deeply religious compared to my mom who sleeps with anyone that gives her an ounce of attention really cracks me up Also no word from my EXhusband however his sister sent me a text apologising on behalf of her and his parents So yeah thats the end I believe Im taking care of my greatgrandma and will work out what I wanna do in the mean time This will most likely hopefully be the final update as I believe Im in a really good place,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 03:38:28 UTC,1576,32,0.97,,,0,0
1j6gkb7,Obsessed with my best friends pornstar girlfriend,Im still trying to wrap my head around the fact that my friend from high school is dating a pornstar I mean Ive known him for years and weve been through thick and thin together But when I stumbled upon her videos my mind was blown I couldnt believe what I was seeing Shes doing some extremely hardcore stuff Im talking multiple giant cock gangbangs and her body is just wow She has a gigantic ass that seems to be the center of attention in almost every scene At first I felt a mix of emotions shock curiosity and a little bit of jealousy I wont lie Ive always thought of my friend as a bit of a shy guy so its hard to imagine him with someone whos so outgoing But as I watched more of her videos I started to feel a twinge of concern I mean this is a whole different world that Im not familiar with and I worry about my friend getting hurt or caught up in something thats not good for him But at the same time I have to admit that Im also kind of fascinated Ive never seen anything like this before and its like my eyes are glued to the screen I feel like Im getting a glimpse into a secret world that most people dont know about and its both thrilling and terrifying I dont know how to process all of this to be honest Part of me wants to talk to my friend about it to ask him if hes okay and if he knows what hes getting himself into But another part of me is afraid of judgment of being seen as a hypocrite or a voyeur I mean who am I to judge what hes doing or who hes dating All I know is that my mind is reeling and I dont know how to reconcile my feelings about this I guess all I can do is wait and see how things play out and hope that my friend knows what hes doing,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 12:54:39 UTC,0,142,0.49,,,0,0

1j777at,I feel so stupid for how bad my finances have gotten,As title says I 25m feel dumb for how bad me and my partner have handled our money Weve been living in the same place for about 3 years and we were pretty fine for the first 2 but this last year we have just made every dumb decision possible with our money and now we are majorly behind on rent for the second time and I have no idea what to do I used to work long hours with decent pay but quit for mental health When I did have money i burned through it When I started making less I didnt adjust and kept burning through it First time we were behind it was by about 3k and eventually we paid it Now were about 1500 behind and as Im working still for very little I dont really have a way to catch up quick and since its the second time our landlord whose kind of just a buddy wants us to pay by a certain date or leave fair Definitely dont have money to move definitely cant catch up just by working the way i am Deeply scared to try and go back to working long hours I have no formal training or schooling Definitely have analyzed the past few years and have realized Im mentally ill and unmedicated Its also so hard for me to get my head together because I feel like the country is going to shit and it feels so useless to try to do anything I also recently stopped talking to my parents which was a good decision but I didnt realize how much of a toll that would take on me I just feel so stupid about everything,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 13:04:29 UTC,1,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j5xemc,I tried to overdose but I failed Now Im even more lost,Last night around midnight I took a few mg of Xanax n 300 mg of hydroxyzine thinking that it would kill me in my sleep and no one would realize until I was already dead But of course with my luck Im here to tell you it didnt work Around 1 pm I woke up with nothing to show for it I made sure not to have any signs or tell anyone I was trying to die but that doesnt even matter now The worst part of this is that Im really dizzy and unbalanced when Im walking around but thats literally the only sign anything happened Im so disappointed People overdose on Xanax all the time without even trying actually trying to just get high and feel better But when I try all I get it 13 hours of uninterrupted sleep and a bit dizzy People die every day on accident without any thought or desire or knowledge but everytime I try to die it doesnt work I think its bc Im 250 lb and I needed to take more to match my weight but I literally took all of the CNS depressants I had and even then I woke up with minor symptoms This isnt fair I know so many people die from trying even less and without trying so hard I also know that some suicidal people are grateful they wake up after their attempt and maybe I wish I could be one of them but Im not Im angry and sad and confused about why I didnt die and why I have to keep living this insanely miserable life I wish I had just died last night but Im even terrible at killing myself ETA I did some research and I didnt take nearly enough of either drug,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 19:16:57 UTC,1,5,0.66,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0

1j4e234,I 30M have the biggest crush on my coworker 35F and I cant stand it,Ive worked with this woman for about 4 years Weve traveled together on business several times Ive always been a pretty shy guy but am especially cautious when socializing with women I work with I try to be myself but not act in a manner such that they could feel uncomfortable basically Im afraid of flirting because I want to be a good human being and also keep my job When Im with this woman its pretty chill We chat about our travels and places we want to go She occasionally tells me very personal things one time she randomly told me she had an IUD after we were just sitting in silence for a few seconds Anyway I think shes great Shes very smart and successful We both make 140k at basically the same job She owns her own house but Im not quite there yet Shes funny cute and very fashionable The little things like the way she paints her nails neat like a professional does them for her on the daily and wears her hair are so unique and attractive Sometimes things feel fantasy like when were traveling together We might both reach for the temperature controls in the car at the same time because the AC is too cold and touch hands We say the same things at the same time and have the same thoughts when a random event happens in front of us Sometimes she would say interesting things like if it was appropriate Id invite you to stay at my house because the office is far for me and close to her Or if I talked about moving shed get excited and joke that I could be her neighbor I always wondered if she was attracted to me but she shows mixed signals Shes a very smart woman so its possible she thinks the same way I do and doesnt want to jeopardize her career Shes had boyfriends on and off and Im not even sure what her current status is I feel like in an alternate reality we would be the perfect couple But in this reality well just be coworkers who live a couple hours apart Its frustrating Ive never been sexually active before because Im waiting for someone who electrifies me as much as she does to truly desire me and to be in the right situation for it Thats hard to find TLDR just a dumb man crushing on a coworker Update I dont think I can ask her out Messaged her at work today to ask how things have been and the conversation felt one sided I cant deal with the humiliation embarrassment and fear of her getting freaked out by me doing so,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:09:36 UTC,170,157,0.9,,,0,0
1j48nfz,My boss keeps a camera feed of me going for a week,My f29 boss m late 40s kept the camera feed of me on his computer screen at all times Obligatory throw away account cause the details in this might be easy for some of my coworkers to find this and I dont want to give up my main account Also I was posting this on am I over reacting but my update actually came as I was typing this on that sub so now Im switching it to here that everything seems to be wrapped up So I work in a mostly male dominated field in a CNC machine shop as a brake operator I am the only woman at my company that works on the shop floor About a year ago there was a fist fight between 2 other operators and there were no cameras inside to show who started the fight so both operators had to be let go To prevent this from happening again the cameras went up all over the shop Absolutely no blind spots crystal clear HD camers we know this because our boss has a TV screen above his desk now where he can watch all the cameras He can have up to 8 of the camera feeds on his screen at one time and it has the ability to cycle though all of the feeds switching feeds every few minutes The problem came about a week ago when a coworker of mine came up to me and told me there was only one feed on the screen Me at my machine I have never been written up or even talked to about problems with my work so I was very thrown off by this When I had the opportunity where I could think of a reason to go into his office to see for myself when I walked in his office sure enough I saw my empty station on the screen I pretended not to notice and just asked a question about a part I was working on that could be a reasonable question and went back to my work like nothing was wrong Over the next week or so I tried to put it out of my mind but I couldnt get past it and more coworkers approached me and said they saw me on the screen So late last week I went to HR and asked if I was in trouble for anything The HR guy looked surprised and asked me what I was referring to and I told him how closely Im being watched and it seems to be just me singled out He said he would look into it and get back to me but as far as he knew there was nothing wrong About an hour later I get called into the managers office with HR screens are back to normal showing 8 different work areas Im happy for a second until I am asked why Im spreading misinformation I ask what theyre talking about and I proceed to be gaslighted for the next 5 or so minutes about how the cameras have always been this way and Im seeking attention I say multiple coworkers have mentioned to me about seeing it and we can bring them in to ask They threaten to write me up if I keep bringing up this blatant lie and that Im slandering the manager to my fellow coworkers I contact a lawyer cause at this point Im like fuck it Im going to quit this job anyway might as well raise a little hell but then part of me decides its just not worth it and with everything Ive been through lately its just not worth it I decided to contact my ex who Ive been broken up with for a year and fill him in We were together for 5 years and hes the love of my life about a year ago he was offered his dream job across the country and asked me to go with him My mother was dying of cancer at the time and I was the only one she had left to take care of her He planned on turning down the job to stay with ne but I told him Id never forgive myself if he passed on his dream job for me About 6 months ago my mother passed and idk why I didnt contact him but it kinda felt like my whole world fell apart so I just accepted this was my life now When I told him what was going on he said why dont you come move in with me I didnt know it but he hadnt dated anyone since we broke up and neither had i because he had always planned on us reuniting after my mother passed and when she did he didnt want to rush me cause he wanted to wait until I was ready I wasnt ready at all until he asked me that question but without hesitation I said yes I put in an application that day at a CNC shop near where he lives and that was yesterday So thats where this post was going to end on am I over reacting for picking up and moving across the country And then the phone rang Apparently the place I was hiring was impressed with my years of experience and theyre a newer shop so I actually have more experience running a brake then most of their employees They offered my about a 25 raise of what Im currently making and I accepted on the spot They asked when I could start and I said next week Immediately called my boss and told him hes a fucking creep and that I quit HR has been calling me nonstop begging for me to reconsider but that ship has sailed Ex bf or possibly just bf again said hes excited for me to move in but will be setting me up in a separate bedroom at first just so we can take things slow and figure things out which I think is very smart of him and Im glad cause I think we need that time too My current landlady is an absolute sweetheart and knows how rough this year has been for me so shes letting me break my lease with no penalties and she already has someone lined up to take my apartment I asked if they wanted to buy some of my furniture since Im only taking what I can fit in my truck and they offered me a thousand buck for my living room set and all my drawers and dressers Not having to worry about all that I can fir the rest of my stuff in my truck easily and Im starting my cross country trek tonight Fuck creeps and if

1j5l06a,I pissed myself in a ride thanks to an obese couple at a park,I hate roller coasters after this horrible experience My brother 17 and I 13 were in line waiting for the Jurassic park ridecant remember where the line was long and then the person in charge started asking for 2 people and no one moved We were so tired of waiting and I told lets call him Mateo mateo to volunteer us He was reluctant cause no one had spoken up and we couldnt see the cart but I told him to please accept cause I was tired When he raised his hand I saw a lot of people turn to us with a mocking expression I started to get scared In our cart there were two morbidly obese people who shouldnt have been allowed The security lady came to secure us it was a long bar that gets pulled from up and secures all the people in the cart from the hip idk how to explain and she started pulling down the bar when she reached the gigantic stomach of the man She tried going lower but his belly wouldnt let her I was scared cause i wasnt secured at all Mind you i was a fucking lanky teenager and the ride started and i felt myself slipping down I started crying saying to mateo that i was gonna die and he realized what was happening He tried to grab me as best as he could cause he also wasnt really secured but he was way bigger than me I was crying so hard trying to hold on with all my strength it wasnt much lmao my brother trying to help me when suddenly i felt myself go up and almost over the security bar I dont know how but mateo found the strength to pull me back down and I was panicking so hard The ride ended and i couldnt calm down mateo picked me up and carried me all the way back to our parents only then did we both realize i peed myself at 13 years old It was so scared so embarrassed top 5 worse experiences of my life would not recommend Being in a park with roller coasters rn made me remember that horrible feeling Edit my bad at the title i meant peed english is not first language,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 11:03:13 UTC,0,4,0.45,,,0,0

1j4s9h6,So are you gonna be our new besties The June 27th incident at Kings Island,Hey everyone For the second consecutive year I stayed at Great Wolf Lodge from 623627 I visited the park Kings Island on 625 amp 627 In a perfect world Id love to tell you about everything I did and the people I met But unfortunately the sense of joy rejuvenation and fulfillment I get by being there was tarnished by an incident that took place at the end of the trip and at park closing on the 27th This post is as long as it is to make sure I cover all the details of what happened as specifically as I can Its now been eight months since this took place so I needed some time before I went public about this What I hope to accomplish with this is to have a better understanding of the world from a unique perspective and to use this as a learning tool to learn from someone elses misjudgements Im posting this with the complete acceptance understanding that this story may bring some type of criticism in my direction and honestly to achieve some type of closure on this particular incident With all that being said Ill begin On the night of June 27th I was in the Fast Lane Queue for Orion to get a PostFireworks Night Ride That day I was wearing a white Ross Chastain Gone Fishing Busch Light Car TShirt Wrangler Jean Shorts and AllBlack Under Armour Mens Charged Rogue 4 Running Shoes I was at the top of the steps and happened to introduce myself to two young ladies who were sitting against the fence in the station To best describe it as many of you know theres a 34 foot gap between the station and the stairs before you actually enter the station If I was to guess I originally thought these two females were in their early 20s Im 28 for context but they ask me Are you gonna be our new besties No girl has ever asked me a question like that So Im of the impression that theyre attracted to me and assumed theyre of legal age so I jokingly responded Well Im gonna be leaving tonight unless you had something else in mind And even if things worked out I wouldnt have bothered because I have a 2 Hour Drive in front of me back home to Louisville after I do this Night Ride But the girls then look at each other very awkwardly and say something along the lines of Dude WERE 16 I profusely try to apologize but they begin to overreact and make a scene in the station escalating the situation and start running down the steps of the normal queue And I apologize to the greeter and to a ride attendant because I didnt know that they were underage As Ill explain later in more detail that part of the situation like all parts of this situation couldve been resolved with an apology and life couldve went on As this was misunderstanding Some may ask why I didnt just ask how old they were Ive been raised on the idea that asking women how old they are is inappropriate So I finished my ride which while it was spectacular Im kinda nervous about what happened beforehand as I head to my locker to retrieve my belongings Mine was on the section closest to the OnRide Photo Desk and Im not able to open it probably because the park is now closed so the rental by default has expired So while Im about to get someone to help me get this locker opened two teenage boys confront me very aggressively on the situation before the ride saying something in the realm of What are you doing touching up on these little girls You should know better You wear that cross on your neck and do something like that How would god feel about that For context I regularly wear either black or silver cross necklace Ive had many people make conversation about that Im disappointed in you Youre not going anywhere until you apologize They also asked if I was at Soak City earlier which I was to check it out for the first time and look through some of the shops But they claimed I made inappropriate physical contact with someone there to Which I didnt I know that isnt exactly what these two gentlemen said but its what I remember as my anxiety ramped wondering how do I get outta this dilemma that just got handed to me on a silver platter But a couple of things I never groped these women The park has security cameras everywhere including in the coasters stations so theres proof that didnt happen and I also attempted to explain to these two gentleman that I had no clue they were 16 Again I thought they were in their early 20s college age But they werent buying it as both told me BRO YOU COULD TELL Many women look older than they actually are So you really cant sometimes But they both proceed to exercise public humiliation on me by shouting how I was Touching up on little girls to everyone who was leaving Area 72 that evening Like theyre the men from Dads Against Predators on Locals Finally security steps in to figure out what was going on and by the request of these young men One guard originally begins to interview me but then attends to the younger gentleman who initiated the confrontation so another guard interviews me and I explain everything as detailed as I can and as calm as I can l which in the moment was pretty impossible to accomplish I finally got my things outta my locker then this guard escorts me to the front of the park to see what his supervisor or coworkers had to say on the matter and they told me Youre good to go sir nothing else is gonna happen Next time when youre having small talk just be more careful So I walk the path back over to Great Wolf where my car was parked I checked out from there that morning and was granted permission to keep my car parked there But as Im then at the NorthEnd of the parking lot in the small section that walks SoutheasttoNorthwest what appears to be a Black 2014 Honda Civic pulls up and its the teenagers again The gentleman in the passenger side ask for my name number address and zipcode Which I like this whole time cooperate and disclose it And many of you may ask why would you give your information to them They arent police or security I thought that being honest and cooperative would salvage my reputation in this situation And what if they can tell that Im lying So after doing so he says to me We just got banned for a month This is my favorite place to go to Have a good night I love you Then they take off into the night To be honest I shouldve walked down Columbia Road instead of the walk path to avoid the possibility of further encounters But at that point I thought the teens left at that point Or ask security to escort me to my car if theyre allowed to do that After filling up my car at the GoCo on Kings Mills Road I began my drive home I look over to my left on Southbound I71 to look at the park one last time despite it looking so spectacular in person at night I was unable to enjoy it because of what all just happened Heres how this situation shouldve been resolved If I were the girls Id peacefully and politely inform me Sorry to tell you but were actually 16 Then Id have responded My apologies I didnt know that Ill back off I apologize Then the girls shouldve said Youre fine Its all good Then life wouldve moved on and the situation wouldve never escalated to the point it did But to begin with if the girls never asked that question none of this would have ever happened to begin with If I were either of the boys I would have started with professionally and calmly said Excuse me sir you gotta minute to talk And I wouldve said Sure No problem They couldve have offered to buy me a Dasani then said Do you know why were wanting to speak with you Okay there was an incident involving several young ladies in the station a few minutes ago would you mind sharing your side of the story And I wouldve done just that So they have both sides of the story and develop a conclusion and they finished the meeting by stating Okay we believe you did make a mistake you didnt know their age just be more careful next time Thank You for talking with us and have a good night Theres a reason for the saying Cooler heads prevail You gotta assure everyones calm in order to then get to the bottom of any situation That never happened There also has to be a presumption of innocence established in the investigation process as well Thats why in the legal system All suspects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law Which thanks to security for helping with this incident and siding with me on this On June 28th one of the male parties in the incident made a post to this group that afternoon which was a motive to making this post in response I waited til now to conduct this post so I made sure I could tell my side in the most detailed and comprehensive way possible But prior to the post either being deleted or taken down I monitored it by reading all the comments throughout the time that post remained up To start I read that I was reported to Mason Police I was waiting to see if either they would call me for an interview I never did I thought about calling them myself but when talking to someone about the matter they recommended I didnt This individual also claimed in the comments I watched him do what he did But in the post he states 2 girls came running down the stairs Which implies that he was either at the bottom of the stairs or still at groundlevel And in addition to the wall that divides the FastLane queue to the regular queue after the show building there would be no possibility for him to have seen the incident unfold So it seems very contradicting Also another user had stated the girls wouldnt of lied about something like that This where I channel my inner Alex Jones and become a tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist In retrospect hindsight is always 2020 I believe the possibility that those girls asked me that question Are you gonna be our new besties to bait me Ill even go a step further that Im of the belief that they mightve been of legal age but claimed they were 16 as a convenient excuse to cause a problem Im not saying thats the case its complete speculation In todays society select people love to cause andor escalate issues to play the victim card because it gets them attention On top of that they also delivered misinformation by stating I had groped them Like I mentioned earlier there was a 4ft gap between us that wouldve been impossible And security cameras are everywhere and if footage was pulled up it shows I never did that So they lied about that to artificially make the situation look worse to garner more attention and spark more outrage This is why you have to hear both sides to the story then develop the conclusion Not just hear one side and ride with it Again what other reason would these two girls ask me that question In the minutes hours and days following this has greatly amp negatively affected my mental health as Ive had many thoughts rush through my head I thought maybe it was best I should wait a couple years before visiting again Im worried about the people around who witnessed what happened how will they think of me Whats the ride attendants at Orion gonna think of me Whats gonna happen if these teens see me again Are they gonna forget about what happened or will they try to engage in some type of conflict How will I be able to pick myself up from this And am I sure Ill still be a positive asset to society Thankfully I didnt have to wait too long to answer that last question On July 3rd I visited Ark Encounter and it felt therapeutic to be on I71 again then be around people again While there Id happen to see a mom try taking a family photo but she wouldnt be in it so Id ask Excuse me maam if you wanna be in the shot Ill take the photo And that situation happened 4 or 5 times that day and to see the sense of joy appreciation and thankfulness expressed by these families to me reassured that I was good person and a positive asset to society Ive talked to many people about this for advice and support While at the GocoPopeyesDunkin Donuts on Kings Mills Road to fill up and I talked to the guy working there about this and mentioned it was teens just looking to cause issues When I woke up Friday afternoon I talked to my parents immediately about this if I didnt theyd notice something was bothering me I also talked to select people at Work on XBOX and to other friends of mine and everyone unanimously have said that I did nothing wrong and agreed it was a misunderstanding I wanna thank everyone who Ive reached out to for support as this has been a difficult time Im surprised everyone has sided with me on this they didnt have to but Im grateful for helping me get through this I can only imagine the stress and anxiety women especially attractive women feel in public To go to any Zoo Bar Restaurant Bowling Alley Amusement Park Movie Theater etc has to be sometimes unbearable To always be looked at or to have someone always making advances towards you has to feel vulnerable and invasive With that in consideration I do whats necessary to respect womens boundaries when out in public So to even claim that Im a Predator is absolutely inaccurate As mentioned earlier this was a misunderstanding These girls asked a question that led me to assume they were attracted to me and of age I responded based off that then they blew it out of proportion and caused a huge mess at the end of what was supposed to be another fun and memorable multiday trip up there In conclusion the last absolute last things Id want to do is make enemies inside the gates of Kings Island Not within Mason Ohio not within Warren County not within the Cincinnati TriState Area and not within the State of Ohio period And the other last thing I wanted is to be on the radar of the City of Mason Police Department I imagine a day where I can call Mason Ohio home so I want to be on good terms with everyone I encounter To the other parties involved if they read this post I hope we can mutually apologize come to a better understanding of what took place so we can be on good terms with each other achieve closure and move forward on a positive note Im gonna be visiting the park again this year so I dont want us to cross paths and have any further conflict or sense of animosity or discomfort While Im not wishing ill will on anyone these four people possibly will be faced with a situation thats a misunderstanding as well If so Id want their situation to be handled calmly and smoothened out as well and as quickly as possible so they dont face any hate or animosity from the opposing parties of whatever situation faces them And I apologize to the two young men for getting banned Yall unfortunately were denied the opportunity to see the Fourth of July Celebration fireworks display and more valuable time to ride Orion The Beast or whatever yalls favorite coaster might be While I understand they were trying to stand up for whats right it still wasnt the correct way to do so and hopefully they learn from this as well For me I just use it as a learning experience to be extra careful on who Im talking to and not make decisions off assumptions Which I apologize to the young ladies for doing so Im someone whos very respectful to peoples boundaries and wouldnt wanna make decisions about that makes someone feel uncomfortable But I do hope they apologize for asking a question that expresses attraction only to turnaround and cause a scene that couldve been resolved with a simple apology Nobody wouldve gotten banned and security wouldnt have gotten involved Im gonna be presented with 1000 different situations and scenarios and Ill be fine in 925 of them Nobody is perfect Also its been important for me to allow time to heal the wounds as the situation shrinks farther in the past I come to Kings Island for peace and serenity not drama and distress And this sadly was drama and distress Ive met many people in my now four visits to the park and had wonderful converstations and engagements with those people both fellow guests and employees Its very unfortunate this all happened and was more heartbreaking that it happened at the very end of this trip I took I refuse to allow that to be the last memory I have of the park this year Thank you to everyone who took time outta their day to read this and whether or not youre going to the park today have a great day everyone,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 10:07:37

1j3qcal,Nobody will ever love you like a mother loves their child Why is this phrase so maligned,Ive been searching on Reddit for a few minutes and everything that comes up is about raisedbynarcissists narcissism narcissism cptsd victims of abuse more and more narcissism I cant take it anymore because this is not my experience AT ALL My mom says this to me but what I hear when she says this is that this is realistically how life is going to be or is playing out for me and everyone else and this is just a factual statement OBVIOUSLY for victims of parental abuse this is patently false but Id like to see the opposite expressed somewhere so here goes my attempt My mom is a lovely person Shes always tiring herself out helping others supporting others lifting them up Im sad and she says she doesnt mind staying awake at night to talk to me Im not a nuisance to her Im cared for and loved In many ways this has put me off of romantic relationships If no one is ever going to to put it bluntly coddle me and carry me through life like my mom has what does romantic love have to offer me IF its not pure and unconditional and unstoppable what good is that kind of love I know I know what Im asking is a tall ordeal but still I just wanted to let people know that sometimes that sentence is true and other times it is abusive But I dont think it has to be one specific thing all the time Context is required in my case my mom is a genuinely wonderful person who only wants whats best for me is supportive hears me out when I have issues Even if she doesnt know how to adequately be supportive of my specific needs but thats for another rant Shes always there for her friends in practical and more emotional ways and she takes care of all of us Shes always looking out for me and my dad and her mother and people she used to work with text her constantly because she just plainly made their lives very happy She wasnt bossy or punitive at work although she praised a job well done she could see the good in every person and tried to help them in the ways she could She believes there is always a place for everyone and just because someone is doing bad at one task doesnt mean they are invaluable She understands people She cares most of all and shes genuine and so it is really weird to me to go online and only read about how abusive that sentence is because my mom is not like that so why would she say it I do have issues with taking things literally btw and suspect to be on the autism spectrum Maybe my whole family is Idk we just do things differently between me mom and my dad uuuf rant over really needed to say this,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 00:34:50 UTC,2,3,0.63,,,0,0

1j4zka7,Ive been selfprescribing my adhd with crystal meth for little over a year now and its changing my life,In my younger years Ive struggled with drugs Ive done everything you can think of but the only drug that scared me to my core was meth The first time I smoked it my brain said This is what youve been looking for your whole life so I was a functional meth addict for 3 years would go on weeklong benders every 45 months then I quit cold turkey with all substances for 5 years started getting muscular at the gym got my life stable and manageable Now I own my own landscaping company and I flip homes life is good But it was getting overwhelming The paperwork that comes with selfemployment is the bane of my existence Especially because I was diagnosed with severe ADHD as a child So about a year and a half ago I went to my doctor to get diagnosed again so I can get prescribed some kind of medication I knew I was going to need something to keep my business growing without completely crumbling it under my lack of focus I went through the long process and got denied because by divine providence I smoked weed for the first time in years about 5 days prior I was infuriated So I finally said fuck it and looked up old contacts and bought 3 grams of meth the next day I still remember holding that bag like I was Sméagol with the One Ring lol The deep whisper that calls to all addicts beckoned me to go all in to smoke that shit right up But by that point I had already realized the simple joy of living a true peaceful life and I knew I would throw it all away if I started back up again I bought a milligram scale and started off with 25 milligrams The realization of seeing what 25 milligrams of meth looked like made me understand the sheer power of amphetamines For years people were smoking grams of this shit Consuming it like candy yet all you ever need is a crystal the size of a grain of sand I put them into individual pill cases and started to take one a day If I havent taken a dose before 10am then I would skip taking it altogether Ive tried Adderall in high school from friends and I really enjoyed how it made me focus meth felt cleaner more aggressive Over time I started to remember my appointments without having to write them down My sleep schedule became predictable as I never sleep during the day anymore And my willingness to work harder is becoming effortless Sex is always amazing and I stopped drinking again because Ive become sociable without the need for alcohol The best thing that has happened is that Im more aggressive with business negotiations Im less nervous and Im not afraid to assert my dominance when I feel it is necessary Now I can never think of ever smoking this stuff again I know Im the exception and Im not telling you to use drugs Meth is powerful and will destroy your life before you realize whats going on But I just needed to tell someone Ask me anything you want Btw I still havent finished the 3 grams I first purchased a year ago Itll probably last me another year before I have to go back out on the streets for more,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 16:34:54 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j3dijb,My dad that mlested me growing up isnt my dad,Forgive my formatting Im on mobile Do not share my story anywhere TW Death Incest Pdophilia I dont honestly know where to start so I guess the beginning is where Ill go When I was very young my dad began molesting me from what I can remember I was around 3 or 4 I have three younger sisters that I grew up with and he molested them too as they got older but it was mostly me that got the brunt of it Last year my mom passed away of a stroke It was a very complicated time for me because although my abuser was arrested for what he did my mom had convinced my sisters and I to drop the charges right before she had passed away She would say awful manipulative things like You dont want your dad to die in prison do you to guilt us into dropping the charges She then proceeded to invite this man back into our lives by moving him back into the house we all shared at the time and my discomfort was ignored and brushed under the rug When my mom passed my dad went crazy and forced me out of the house My mom was a buffer between everyone and with her gone I didnt feel comfortable at the house at all and I had my boyfriend stay in my room with me because I felt safer that way Cue raging dad cussing me out for inviting another man over and threatening to call the cops and having him trespassed all crazy erratic shit I didnt understand So I moved in with my boyfriend yay All that drama didnt even end up mattering though because dad remarried and moved to a new state just 3 months after my moms passing Currently all my sisters are still living in that house together Now heres the fun part Im the eldest Growing up I was always told that my parents got married at the courthouse and had me before they officially hosted the wedding I was born in 99 and the timeline I was told was Met online in 97 Courthouse wedding in 98 I was born in 99 Wedding I was pictured in took place in 2000 I always knew I was in their wedding pictures and I never questioned what they told me they said the ceremony was delayed until my grandma could get back from doing government work overseas It all made sense to me growing up I never questioned it but it was all a lie So this weekend was a the year anniversary of my mothers death and I decided to get dinner with my sisters Were having a good time and everything but I forgot my jacket and my boyfriend stopped by the restaurant to bring it to me I get back to the table and my sisters got all quiet and said Hey weve got some news for you and its really heavy Long story short this man that Ive thought was my dad my whole life is NOT my biological father My sisters have been going through all of our moms things over the last year and kept coming across weird pictures and documents relating to me that didnt line up with what wed been told I wouldve thought they were trolling me if it werent for the fact theyd confirmed everything with my aunt my moms younger sister Who I just found out yesterday didnt know that I didnt know because my mom was not only lying to my siblings and I about it but lying to my aunt and all of our extended family too saying my siblings and I already knew Im going to visit my aunt in a couple of days to sit down and talk all of this out get the real scoop on my life because my whole worldview has been shattered On one hand Im grateful I was finally told but I turn 26 this month and thats an insane age to learn your dad isnt even your dad Not to mention what a horrible dad he was I feel this information to be both heartbreaking and freeing Im not related to this monster If I have kids I wont be passing along his DNA and thats comforting to me I dont want to make my half sisters feel bad for being related to him but I cant help feeling like this Ive always told myself I wouldnt have kids because this guy doesnt deserve his DNA being passed on and now I find out I have none of it This information was a gift to me On the other hand Im angrier at my mom than Ive ever been I mourned her death so severely I suffered because I felt so guilty that our relationship was so tumultuous in life And yet we never could have had an honest relationship because I now know she was never honest with me About almost anything I feel so much better and at peace knowing that it really and truly was my mothers fault that our relationship was so rocky How can you have an honest relationship with anyone that could lie about something so big Not to mention the fact that she was so manipulative and greedy doing everything she did just to invite this evil man back into our lives just because its what she wanted for herself to retire on his dime None of this is on me anymore and I feel so much lighter And before anyone asks yes a DNA test is in my future and Im starting therapy again soon I have no idea if my dad is even alive or still out there but Im going to find out Im not sure how to end this but let me just say this has been the craziest year of my life by far and Im glad I dont have to interact with either of my parents anymore or feel guilty about how I handled things when my mom was

away for college and we were both going out of state on opposite sides of the country I thought it would be the best thing for us but its been the opposite I really hurt her when we broke up The first few days I thought this was going to be the best thing for me and I just tried to push her out of my mind as much as I could but I just kept feeling like an asshole She loved me so much and I took it for granted She would do things for me all the time just because and never expect anything in return She would constantly put me ahead of her and also just loved me no matter what I was going through I couldnt stop thinking about her and during my first week of college I was so excited about what was going on in my life and I wanted nothing more than to just text her and let her know what was going on It bothered me that in the almost 3 months we had been broken up at that point she never once reached out to me I wanted to know how college was going for her I wanted to know how she was doing How could the girl who I once had this amazing love with not try to reach out to me once I texted her letting her know that I had been thinking about her and that I hoped she was doing well She kept things super brief and said she hoped I was doing well but I wanted to talk to her so much more so I poked about what she had been doing and in two months she had done so much and she was going to this great huge school and was doing all of this without me I know I shouldve been happy for her but it just made me sad and angry We didnt talk for a month after that until she sent me a picture of a tattoo she had gotten I was so excited that she finally reached out to me This was the first time since we had broken up that she initiated the conversation We talked for a little bit and it felt so great We fell back into conversation like back when we were dating It felt so good to talk to her again but at the same time it made me feel sick that I knew so little about what was going on in her life now and I was only hearing so little about it I sent her a text telling her how happy I was for her and how what shes doing seems like such a great experience for her and she never responded That hurt a lot I looked at her TikTok and Instagram for the first time in months and I just wanted to throw up She is living this whole life without me She looks happy and most of all beautiful Like how dare she be so beautiful and smile at people with smiles that were once mine I would go to her Spotify and I would be so paranoid that one of those playlists was dedicated to someone that wasnt me I felt so selfish and angry and mad at the world and at myself I had to push her out of my mind so I started seeing someone I wasnt even really interested in them Lookswise they were nothing compared to my exgirlfriend Their personality was so dull and boring compared to my ex and in the end I ended up just feeling like this huge dick for stringing someone along for months just to get over my exgirlfriend I went home for my Christmas break from my college and it got even worse Knowing that we were in the same town and just a drive away from each others houses made me feel insane I got so nervous that I was going to run into her any time I left the house I thought about going Christmas shopping in the mall she worked at so I could accidentally run into her and then would just get sad because I was becoming this huge creep I wanted to text her every day asking if she wanted to get coffee and I never did because nothing would hurt more than knowing she didnt want to see me I texted her Merry Christmas and she was nice about it but she didnt want to talk to me anymore after that And then I saw she went back to her college before me and it was painful seeing her with all her friends having so much fun and having so much fun without me Seeing her cozied up with a girl on her Instagram makes me feel like Im going to throw up I see them post together all the time and I just want to know if theyre dating How could she date someone so soon after 3 almost 4 years How could she be so brazen and post her and that girl getting coffee and going on dates together Does she not think Ill see it I think I would feel worse if it was a man The thought of some man looking at her the way I used to and touching her and being intimate with her makes me angry and sad and violent all at the same time I would stalk her pages all day while I was still in our hometown waiting for her to post something and getting nervous when she would How could she be having so much fun and be so happy all without me We were each others first love first kiss first everything And now I dont know if shes doing that with other people Things got a little bit better when I went back for my second semester of college but I still just cant get her out of my mind Im starting to see another girl now to try and get over my ex and shes again nothing like my exgirlfriend and I dont think there will ever be anyone like herWhen I first broke up with her I didnt think it would hurt this much I guess in the back of my mind I thought she wouldve fought for us I thought she wouldve texted me more when we were broken up I thought she and I honestly wouldve gotten back together at this point Im so insanely in love with her still and I brought this on myself but I thought I was doing whats best for the both of us I guess I didnt appreciate or realize the things that she did for me while we were together,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 13:50:08 UTC,0,16,0.41,,,0,0
1j7zsso,Feeling abandoned while visiting a friend abroad,Im currently visiting a friend abroad and have been here for the past two weeks She invited me to show me her city and during the first week we spent a lot of time together which was great However in the second week her university started and understandably she now has other priorities Shes had to cancel most of the plans we made and doesnt seem interested in making new ones though shes very apologetic about it As a result I cant help but feel a bit left behind Its a strange situation because on one hand Im a little frustrated but on the other I recognize that wanting more attention is selfish her studies are obviously more important This is the first time Ive been upset with someone for a reason that is entirely my own issue I dont want this to turn into resentment especially since she hasnt actually done anything wrong Talking to her about it also seems wrong since it feels like guilt tripping her into doing something she doesnt want doesnt has the time for Typing this out only shows me how wrong I am for being upset but I cant help it,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 14:24:15 UTC,4,1,0.71,,,0,0

1j5kpxw,I feel such deep gratitude towards someone and cant share it,When I was 17F I met someone A woman Online I never met her in real life even years later We only spoke on the phone once for an hour years later It was basically a purely texting relationship It was a blogging site one of those where you just wrote an online diary basically We hit it off as conversation partners but it wasnt more than that for around a year We didnt even talk that often but when we did it was magical She was much older than me and I knew it from the beginning She was 31 when we met It was weird for me to talk to someone older but it just worked and I didnt think about it much so I rolled with it We talked almost exclusively about a shared hobby A year later I was having a complete breakdown It was my first major mental health breakdown I think I was just lost in transitioning from school life to college life I suffered alone for a year I didnt really have a support system and after that I decided to open up about it in my online diary I didnt know what I expected if I expected anyone to care But she suddenly supported me She talked to me a lot She said she had been through the same things so she understood what I was feeling And thats how it started she explained to me A LOT about how mental health works When I was a teenager I didnt believe in mental health Till it bit me in the ass I mean I had this major breakdown and suddenly my nonexistent mental health incapacitated me I had severe fatigue panic attacks even diarrhea So the woman basically taught me some basic concepts explained some basic things to me I started to read up on therapy psychology wed discuss issues It was also magical she just got me Id never had the privilege of having anyone in my life who understood me gave me a manual to myself I internalized my familys approach of youre just a lost cause hysterical little shit and theres nothing left to do with you but ignore you when you get difficult And with her I suddenly understood that I wasnt hysterical That my feelings had a cause That I could actually fulfill my needs and there would be no breakdown So she taught me how to relate to myself in a healthier way how to be on my side always And the best part She never actually lectured me on anything never made me do anything never got mad at me for not trying anything And she was always respectful to me despite the age difference She never played the Im older and I know better card even though she was definitely older and knew better She just explained how things work for her and how she thought it worked for me too because were so similar and I could take it or leave it She just treated me the way that I understood how to treat myself Like shed do or tell me things thatd calm me down or help me get out of despair or a panic attack and I made a mental note oh thats what I need when Im having a panic attack Yes this works for me when Im overwhelmed Ok thats what Ill ask for when I need support next time I think I was going through this very major and lifechanging breakdown for about a year My health was never the same after that still isnt 13 years later but I was slowly learning to live with this new version of myself I felt more stable but I still needed a lot of support And she was there I dont think Id be alive or relatively sane right now if it wasnt for her during that first year if it wasnt for her guidance and gentleness I really had no one especially no one who understood me like she did Shes the one who made me try therapy Not by talking about it she never went to therapy herself but a couple of months after we started talking about my mental health I was reading some posts about therapy and understood that what I felt with her I could find in therapy And I got really interested in it with her I couldnt ask for more or for a more stable presence With a therapist I could get that presence for an hour a week on a regular basis Well I never found that therapist with whom I had this magic Never found anyone even remotely not hurtful actually I have a bad trauma from therapy by now tried 20 therapists The woman was really the only person in the world who got me to relax and listen to her without fighting and rejecting right away Others would just trigger me hard trigger a defensive response and then hurt me when I couldnt accept what they were saying even though I was fighting myself hard not to push them away With her it felt like she was going through the minefield of my psyche knowing exactly where to go and where not to go and how to neutralize at least some of the mines without setting an explosion off And the most awesome effect was that the neutralization usually had ripple effect shed make one small thing feel slightly better and I could feel the chain reaction of things correcting themselves months later things that were unrelated to the first conversation It went on for years I mean she wasnt my therapist but We talked about our lives hobbies mental health It was always the olderyounger dynamics but not in a bad patronizing way shed just explain things but she never pushed She never said that because Im younger I dont get to have a different opinion Never laughed at me Never tried to make me respect her She didnt need to Ive never respected anyone like this in my life She doesnt have a conventional successful life never married never moved out of her familys apartment she didnt even work most of her thirties for reasons I didnt fully understand but never pushed her to share But I respected her more than anyone who had all those She was very smart driven understood things deeply always treated people with respect everyone she had this quality of attracting people to her like she didnt wait for anyone to start talking to her like I did if she saw someone she found interesting shed just initiate And she treated vulnerability with care Doesnt matter what happened between us doesnt matter if I hurt her unintentionally Id never do anything bad to her intentionally doesnt matter what was happening she never used any one of my open wounds never chose to set any of the mines just to hurt me back And she could do it at any moment She spoke my language she knew how to put things exactly in a way that her words would have the most effect so she could destroy me She never ever even tried in all those years Not even when the relationship went sour and she was annoyed with me for years Shed snap at the small things once she started aggressively attacking me in a discussion about Harry Potter Not memy thought process Thats when I knew it wasnt just a rough patch but truly over but she never went for my traumas Not even when she didnt enjoy me anymore As I said the way she treated me had a ripple effect fixing things without her even trying Through the years the way she treated me talked to me I developed that inner compass as I call it basically this feeling that in my life Im the one who always knows best Even if I make mistakes Im still the one who knows best and Ill course correct if I make a mistake I dont mean that I feel that Im always right about everything just in my life in things that concern me It was very different from what my family told me youre incapable of anything you should listen to us you dont have a brain That inner compass made me finally start living my life Not what my family thought was best what I felt like doing And the most beautiful part of it was that these things were not what the woman wanted either They were truly mine I moved to another country something I always wanted She clearly couldnt understand my decision but that didnt matter It was mine I started speaking another language English more because thats what I always wanted and she couldnt understand it either And it didnt matter I knew what I wanted And a thousand choices like that that she watched me make and kept her mouth shut enough Because of this inner compass I feel like there will always be a part of her in me wherever I go As Ive said the relationship went sour With years I understood that this dynamics of her keeping me at arms length I never knew much about her her struggles she never let me support her doesnt work for me anymore And I wanted to actually talk on the phone actually meet her All I could get out of her was one phone call and after that she was always not in a good place for a call I finally was brave enough to admit to myself that I wanted more of her and that Im an equal in this relationship and an adult too so I have the right to pursue it and wanted to have a relationship She was vague about it And then her reaction made me not sure about it too At some point she did try to rely on me more and I didnt get it I guess and it hurt her immensely and when I understood that I hurt her it was hard to forgive myself she was someone I NEVER wanted to hurt Not for any reason And then we talked about everything the dynamics my feelings our wants and desires and just like that it was over slowly quietly not really too painfully and immensely painfully for me at the same time but I mean she didnt really hurt my feelings I was just hurting because it ended It was 7 years after we started talking But I could never forget her Id text her sometimes just to know how she is Nothing too personal just to know if she was ok Shed get annoyed at me for that I couldnt really understand why Shed say something about me trying to be a peoplepleaser and showing that I still care when I dont At some point I asked her if I should stop texting her because I clearly annoy her She said yes I tried I tried for two years And then I texted her again and said that Im not a child anymore I was 28 at the time and I dont want to live in a world where we dont talk We didnt have to be best friends but I was certain we had to talk Sometimes About anything At some point And she agreed It was weird and I was the one texting her mostly And then it fizzled out I never talked to her about it There was nothing left to talk about nothing left to say But I still think about her when something good happens in my life When something bad happens and I handle it like a capable adult without falling apart When I manage to choose myself instead of caving in Yesterday was one of those days I couldnt keep it in the last one was a year ago and she did acknowledge it even if briefly I texted Hey its one of those days when I cant help it but want to wish you the best So here I am wishing you the best Youre incredible and I feel so lucky to happen to live on this Earth when you exist She read it immediately and left me on read Im not sure why She used to tell me that she doesnt know what to say when people tell her good things and she used to do it with me too But she usually acknowledged it Now she didnt Did she think I was weird for texting it Did I make it awkward Was it too much I guess Ill never know But ChatGPT told me to try and write it in a journal so here I am on this sub trying not to bother the most magical connection of my life with my gratitude Ive been in love I have parents siblings well cousins Ive had best friends And this connection was everything in one an older sibling whos almost like a parent whos also my best friend and with whom Im absolutely in love She was my first adult love the love when you dont just fall for someone because you think theyre perfect but the love when the more you see the imperfections the more you respect and love the person You understand how difficult their life is and respect how beautifully theyre fighting and what a strong and capable person they are despite all their limitations My life and mental health are in no way perfect Ive made a lot of mistakes some of which I wont ever be able to fully correct But the peaceful moments that I have the good things the authentic parts of my life the parts where I feel like Im living my life and not someone elses I owe to her,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 10:43:48 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j4ipqp,Its a real story I have sleep paralysis and it getsnsfw,Im not sure where to post this but I really need advice thats why I made an account just fot this because Im starting to question my sanity I recently started living alone in my first apartment Im extremely careful I always lock the doors and windows at night and I dont have any pets I used to have occasional bouts of sleep paralysis during a stressful phase but they were relatively harmless dark figures just staring at me hearing weird noises etc But since Ive lived here its different Now I wake up several times a week in the middle of the night completely paralyzed I can only move my eyes hear and feel And every time I see this big dark shadowy figure in my room But it doesnt just stand in the corner It slowly comes towards me It pulls my blanket away then my pants and then it starts touching me in a way that feels far too real It starts touching me with its mouth It licks me sucks me as if it is completely obsessed with my vagina And the most disturbing thing is I feel EVERYTHING Every detail Much more intensely than any real human contact I have ever had It brings me to orgasm over and over until the sensations are so overwhelming that I pass out And when I wake up in the morning my blanket is actually at the foot of the bed or on the floor my pants exactly where it threw them For the ones who wants to imagine it the figure is black shadowy with glowing white eyes but sometimes they look red and it is very large It has a somewhat human shape but also somehow not There is a dark aura around it like black smoke The hands are very large and the fingers are extremely long The only thing I remember is that in one of my earlier sleep paralyses years ago I saw these hands or very similar looking hands trying to grab me But I was able to free myself from the paralysis in time bec my sister suddenly came in my room and turned the lights on Its mouth is not visible but when it begins with the act I can make out the outline of the mouth and it has a very long tongue You can then imagine where the tongue goes It doesnt say anything or even talk to me I know it might feel like a particularly realistic sleep paralysis but how can things be moving in my room Im scared It happens almost every night and although it doesnt hurt the thought that it might do more at some point scares me What if its not just a hallucination And before anyone asks No Im not desperate or lonely Im single right now but Im happy with it I dont miss anyone feel untouched or crave closeness Ive had relationships in the past but right now Im enjoying my own life so I understand even less why this is happening But my biggest concern is that deep down Im starting to enjoy it There are moments when I catch myself thinking Dont stop Keep going And that terrifies me even more I have a disturbing theory What if it isnt just a sleep paralysis I know its not a dream bec Im fully awake Im just unable to move or make a sound What if it is some kind of entity or demon that possessed me I know how crazy this sounds but if you were in my shoes would you really rule it out I feel like I cant talk to anyone about this Its so humiliating and the worst part is what if it keeps coming to me every night until the day I die bec I dont do anything about it Im desperate and conflicted because as terrifying as it is it also feels good And Im starting to crave it I dont think a real man could ever satisfy me again like this Ive tried to relax before sleep and I dont have any stress in life at the moment but it still visits me almost every night And like i said Im extremely embarrassed to talk to other people in real life because Ive started to enjoy it and I dont have any money for fancy therapies What if this continues for years I feel everything and when I wake up in the morning my intimate area feels a bit numb and tingly as if someone had been fiddling with it so its not fake its really happening to me I almost always pass out from all the orgasms Being satisfied so intensely every night can be dangerous right Idk Have any of you ever experienced something like this Am I just crazy or is something going on here that I cant explain,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 00:30:48 UTC,39,89,0.63,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j4t53m,Did My Partner Cheat 10 Years Ago and Forget It Wasnt Me that was with him,My partner and I were in bed watching silly videos when a clip of a comedian popped up asking people about the weirdest place theyd had sex Without thinking I laughed and said Oh for us it was definitely the beach Remember when we used to go there For context it was a very isolated beach But then he looked at me and said Nooo the weirdest place was in the bathroom at Asda I froze What I stared at him confused We never had sex in a bathroom at Asda He insisted we didback when he was living with his brother and I was staying with my aunt He even painted the scene our son was asleep so we snuck off to the bathroom Only our son wasnt even born yet I was pregnant at the time And I am absolutely sure I would remember having sex in a supermarket bathroom That kind of adrenaline rush would have stayed with me forever Yet he kept insisting it happened And thats when it hit me Did he cheat on me and forget that the person he was with wasnt even me This was 10 or 11 years ago but still I would not have forgotten this And I know this because I remember every place Ive ever had sex in public even from before I was with him So this made absolutely no sense to me So yeah there you have itthe truth off my chest Edit or update whatever you want to call it I didnt expect this post to get so much attention This is my first time posting here This is not AI or fake English is not my first language but I am somewhat fluent My grammar isnt the best so I asked AI to correct it I dont see a problem with that And seeing how some people are roasting me in the comments for being with a cheater saying my child deserves better hoping hes not a doormat like his mom and that I deserve this I can only imagine what the comments would look like if my grammar was bad As for those commenting about my child He doesnt know anything about this Hes never seen us argue all he sees is what we let him see Apart from the things I mentioned weve had a very loving relationship the cheating 5 years ago I forgave and I dont regret that we have been happy trust is still hard sometimes but at the moment in the present he has not given me reasons to think that he has cheated or though about it I understand what people are saying that he might be abusive or mentally manipulating me but I dont really see it that way maybe when we argue but I dont think he does that on purpose or maybe Im just blind Right now Im thinking this might be something hes confusing with a dream or something like some people have said Thinking back I have mentally blocked out a lot from that time I had a very stressful and traumatic pregnancy and its not something I want to get into or talk about I posted this just to get it off my chest Please dont offend me in the comments thats just mean and dont bring my son into it he has nothing to do with this,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 11:10:46 UTC,5740,275,0.95,,,0,0

1j5mosy,My mom might never be the same,Ok I know the tag is bad but let me clear stuff up right off the bat I didnt try to kill myself nobody in my family did and nobody in this story succeeds in doing so With that said its still disturbing I go to a high school that is located right next to a PreK8 school My mom works there and teaches PreK4 while my brother attends as a 7th grader Yesterday my mom and brother told me of something that happened Basically a kid in my brothers grade tried to kill himself in the bathroom using his belt part of the uniform and was at it for several minutes before a friend of the kid went looking for him To make a long story short it was a whole 2 hours afterward that the police were called and something was done about it Now this alone is devastating and disturbed my mom but what made me call my post this was this detail of the story The kid tried this around 11 am The administration was only made aware at 1 pm The kids knew this and said nothing Now you may think that its because hes a bully or disliked but he was a smart kid who played football at his school and was generally wellliked The chilling part was that most kids were just indifferent to the whole thing They felt bad but nobody was particularly emotional My brother said that everybody was silent but only a few who he knew feared death The kid who went to check on the victim got texts from the victim with suicidal thoughts and he said nothing at first And thats why I named this post what I did My mom is one of those people who believes that suicide is cowardly and that there are always options for those who feel that way but hearing how a group of kids witnessed one of their try that and then everyone not go talk to grownups was shocking for her Even worse since they have the school has not made anything public yet about this incident and probably is just going to sweep it under the rug Now I might have exaggerated the title a bit my mom is a very resilient woman But I fear that the way this story played out will affect her for a long time Also normally I would talk to friends and people in school about this but the victims older sister attends and probably doesnt want anybody to know so I ranted here,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 12:47:35 UTC,0,2,0.5,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0

1j3puzv,ChatGPT suggested I might have autism Told my friends they were surprised that I wasnt already diagnosed with autism,OK so this is kind of a clusterfuck and I need to get it all out there so here goes For the past probably over a year at this point Ive been chatting to ChatGPT every now and then at least once a week Ive been kinda treating it as like a diary that talks back I dont input too much personal info or anything like that but if Im worried or stressed about something that I dont wanna burden the people in my life with or if I have something Im thinking about and am interested to see how an AI might respond to it then Ill just open ChatGPT and vent Every now and then Ill get a Memory Updated notification where its randomly decided something Ive said is worth remembering for future conversations and over the past year this has built up a fair amount especially about likes dislikes fears and that kinda thing Its an interesting feature and it sometimes makes conversations more relevant or stops me having to go over old things and so I mostly just leave it as it is Recently I saw a trend where people were asking ChatGPT to suggest something that the user doesnt know about themselves based on everything in ChatGPTs memory about them From what Ive seen it tries to be insightful sometimes it is quite helpful other times it is kinda brutal but overall its usually pretty interesting in one way or another and so I decided to give it a try I asked it based on everything its learned about me over the course of our conversations what is something that it thinks I might not know about myself that might be beneficial for me to know As you can tell from the title of this post its response was that I should probably get tested for autism I wasnt really sure how to respond to that I dont really know what I was expecting but it was definitely a lot more targeted and specific than the posts Id seen of other people asking ChatGPT similar questions I asked it to clarify and it brought up things that it had noted about being kind of picky about what I consume stuff about regretsworries related to normal social situations fixations on random things and a few other things that it said was indicative of autism It also reminded me that it wasnt a medical professional which I thought was a very interesting thing to include after suggesting that I might have autism Anyway I kinda put it to the back of my mind and then later that evening I joined a voice chat with a few of my online friends that I play online games with and after a while I kinda brought up with them what ChatGPT had said Their initial reaction was to laugh which I thought meant that they thought what the AI had said was wrong but then they said words to the effect of With how much you talk to ChatGPT Im surprised you hadnt already told it that youre autistic I then said that I wasnt autistic by which I meant I didnt have a formal diagnosis of autism and until this point didnt really consider myself to be autistic and things got kinda awkward Anyway I just took the AQ50 and got a score of 36 which came with the message Scores in the 3350 range indicate significant Autistic traits Autism so I guess theres a fair chance that Im autistic and that somehow Im the last person to know about it I dunno how Im supposed to feel about this or what Im mean to do with this information Im a guy and in my early 30s so it feels kinda late to get a diagnosis with something like this and even if I did get a diagnosis I dont know what it would change for me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 00:12:03 UTC,0,9,0.38,,,0,0
1j4d2y1,I went to a fancy beach resturant soaking wet alone for my birthday a couple weeks ago,Yup you read the title So my birthday was a little while ago it was my 20th and honestly I was pretty damn depressed for it Didnt have a lot of friends to celebrate with and was basically alone and it feltstill feels really weird not being a kid anymore I decided to treat myself to a beach day both to go romp around and also cause I needed some driftwood for an aquarium I was setting up I have no car though so had to take the bus to get up which had a very inconvenient schedule So I got to the beach found some sticks and got so distracted that I unfortunately missed the bus pick up Now there was another bus coming in a couple hours and I could always call a ride too if needed So I decided that now that I was here for at least a couple hours I might as well do some more exploring This particular beach stretched for 3 miles north up to another beach where on the other side there was a small resturant I was pretty hungry at this point so thought itd be fun to walk up there and catch bus later that evening at that spot instead So I cruised up the beach and got some really great views of the clouds and sinking sun along the way I eventually got to the cutoff to where the other beach started however while the map only portrayed a small stream separating them by now the ride had come in and that tiny stream was basically a river After scouring the area for a bridge or easier way across I stupidly chose to wade through a shallower point which worked and I made it to the other side of the beach soggy but triumphant I had no change of clothes in my pack So after drying off a tiny bit I walked up to the resturant and when I got inside I realized this wasnt just some little beach shack it was a full on fancy ass resturant My belly was roaring though so I decided to give it a try I asked for outdoor seating for obvious reasons and was really surprised to see them setting the table with fancy cloths and a bunch of different forks and silverware and shit I ordered crabcakes and some jumbo shrimp which were the cheapest things there but combined still cost a whopping 70 They eventually bring out two tiny barely palm sized pencilthin crab patties and 5 individual finger length shrimp both elaborately decorated in the middle of these giant white plates For the cost of it all I was half convinced Id be able to keep the plates too I kept getting odd looks from the other diners who were almost all either in pairs or groups I was the only lone person there Not to mention still pretty soggy dressed like a casual vagabond and with my backpack as my only companion in the opposite chair Yeah I stuck out like a giddamned giraffe in a horse ranch Eventually I finished up and caught the bus back home where I promptly went to sleep Happy 20th birthday bud theres 70 bucks you aint getting back and an experience youll cherish for all the wrong reasons,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 20:30:14 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j7w3d0,A couple of friends wore black to my wedding,and they looked fabulous My wardrobe consists of mostly black It certainly helps my confidence helping out my figure yet I have often felt pressured to avoid the colordark tone when attending weddings as a guest I see men in black suits and black dress shirts at weddings all the time I certainly never wear a black veil and my fabulous little black cocktail dress with sequence would be completely inappropriate for a funeral so Im not sure how it can be interpreted as a code for disapproving of the marriage espeically for an evening event Some recent weddings I have been invited to have been quite expensive to even attend It is worth it for a good friend so I definitely also bring a nice gift When I am obligated to in addition buy a new dress to fit a theme as a guest and never wear it again I often just RSVP no Just wanted to get this off my chest I have heard that many think its an oldfashioned rule Unfortuantely I have had opposite results offline,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 11:06:07 UTC,6,4,0.81,,,0,0
1j6r9ab,My one attempt at healthy communication ended horribly and I feel like the worst friend ever,I was heavily bullied via social ostracism as a kid It also didnt help that I am very likely autistic and I have a very hard time picking up on unspoken social cues I also grew up in a bit of a turbulent environment where speaking my mind often ended in punishment Therefore my own communication habits are not the healthiest I tend to bottle things up for months and then crash and bedrot for days on end when it all becomes too much But I have a best friend who I finally felt comfortable attempting more immediate healthy communication with and its blown up so badly that Im almost wishing Id just kept my mouth shut instead Theyve been getting really into a TV show for about 5 months now which is great and Im truly happy for them A lot of the time theyd send me voice notes about it or wed call and theyd end up talking about it to the point of apologizing for overtaking the conversation and Id always say they had nothing to be sorry for because I love listening to my friends be happy about stuff Genuinely I do and it was literally all fine up until last week After months of searching due to unemployment I had a job interview lined up for the next day Of course I immediately texted my best friend and they congratulated me and said theyd send me messages of encouragement before the interview I thanked them and then they immediately proceeded to talk about the show again I didnt think much of it and listened as always because I enjoy it The interview day comes the next day and its HECTIC I was so busy that I was literally going from 530am to 530pm and by the time I got home I was ready to crash My interview was scheduled at 4 and theyd been texting me about the show prior to it so I figured Id get my messages soon Well long story short they never came I got home at about 530 immediately crashed and took a 2 hour nap and then woke up to chat with them only to have another conversation about the show Admittedly I didnt feel great about it but I thought it was just the lack of food and sleep talking so I brushed it off Over the next few days though I noticed that sometimes the things Id send them would just get liked and immediately moved on from in favor of talking about the show eventually I realized that this wasnt making me feel great so I decided to ask them if we could maybe tone down the conversations about this show and explain how it made me feel Sounds like a healthy way to communicate right Wrong As soon as I sent the message I realized how badly I fucked up They were rightfully upset that Id waited a week to tell them this and didnt give them the opportunity to correct themselves in the moment and for that I apologized I genuinely thought a week wasnt that much time and it wasnt something I was even mad at just mildly upset But then the whole conversation kept spiraling and I literally feel sick at the way I made them feel I thought that I was avoiding bottling it up and actually doing the right thing because I was communicating a relatively minor on my end issue early on but it turns out that by not saying anything immediately Ive basically reinforced their worst fears about themself Theyre now scared to talk too much to anyone about anything and now any mention of the show makes them feel sick They said they feel like a bad friend and part of them feels lied to because I always said it was alright how much they talked about it but it wasnt a lie It really was alright the job interview was literally the only incident that made me feel not great about it I kept apologizing because I never wanted them to feel like that around me but theyre still really hurt and now weve been taking some space from each other for about four days now I feel sick I feel like I ruined the one friendship where both of us felt safe to be ourselves Even if we manage to move on from this I know itll never be the same and its all my fault theyll never talk to me again without worrying that theyre being too much and thats the one thing I never wanted them to worry about with me because I know what its like to be too much for the people around you I wish Id kept my stupid mouth shut It was never even that big of a deal I couldve just dealt with it and bit my tongue but of course the one time I feel like communicating is the right thing it just ruins everything I hurt my best friend so bad and I didnt even mean to and now theres nothing I can say or do to fix it I thought I was finally doing things right but it all just went wrong anyway and now one of the people I care about the most is hurting because of me The guilt is eating me alive Ive been crying ever since it all went down and now I wish Id never even said anything,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 21:19:11 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j6qxcs,I cant get over my ex,I cant get over the guy I was in love with 3 god damn years ago and it makes me sick So I was never really in a relationship with this person we actually never even hang out together We met in 2022 and we had a friendship that you wish on everyone but the friendship got stronger and so did our feelings At first he started getting feelings at the time it was not appropriate because I was still in a relationship I broke things off so I could be with him but when that happened he didnt have the same feelings anymore and everything went downhill Im not gonna explain everything that happened in those 6 months but I can say that nothing went back to how it was Because I was still in love with him when he basically ghosted me at the time I never got the closure I needed I think And I begged him to let me stay in his live as friends and now that Im hearing myself I sound so stupid After everything that happened in those 6 months we kissed etc for like 2 more times and that made it even worse to get over him Like I said we stayed friends and talk like 3 times a year new years birthdays and holidays I even got a new amazing boyfriend whom Ive been together with for almost 2 years and who I really love and could see myself marrying one day But I still think about him the ex Last week he even responded on a story I posted on Snapchat and we exchanged maybe 10 sentences I wake up the next day and he deleted me from snap I would like to think his new gf made him do it because it would honestly hurt more if he did it himself So now 1 week later and everyday Im thinking about it and everything that happened almost 3 fk years ago So my question Reddit users is why cant I get over him Why cant I get over the memories that we made Why not after everything this person has put me through English is not my first language so Im sorry for my grammar Side note 15 years ago he moved to another city so I havent seen him in 1 year And I see him maybe once I year now I was supposed to see him last week but he couldnt come,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 21:03:59 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j5o8uu,I broke up with my girlfriend of almost four years and I regret it,Its almost been a year and I made a mistakeIn June I broke up with my girlfriend of almost four years because we were going away for college and we were both going out of state on opposite sides of the country I thought it would be the best thing for us but its been the opposite I really hurt her when we broke up The first few days I thought this was going to be the best thing for me and I just tried to push her out of my mind as much as I could but I just kept feeling like an asshole She loved me so much and I took it for granted She would do things for me all the time just because and never expect anything in return She would constantly put me ahead of her and also just loved me no matter what I was going through I couldnt stop thinking about her and during my first week of college I was so excited about what was going on in my life and I wanted nothing more than to just text her and let her know what was going on It bothered me that in the almost 3 months we had been broken up at that point she never once reached out to me I wanted to know how college was going for her I wanted to know how she was doing How could the girl who I once had this amazing love with not try to reach out to me once I texted her letting her know that I had been thinking about her and that I hoped she was doing well She kept things super brief and said she hoped I was doing well but I wanted to talk to her so much more so I poked about what she had been doing and in two months she had done so much and she was going to this great huge school and was doing all of this without me I know I shouldve been happy for her but it just made me sad and angry We didnt talk for a month after that until she sent me a picture of a tattoo she had gotten I was so excited that she finally reached out to me This was the first time since we had broken up that she initiated the conversation We talked for a little bit and it felt so great We fell back into conversation like back when we were dating It felt so good to talk to her again but at the same time it made me feel sick that I knew so little about what was going on in her life now and I was only hearing so little about it I sent her a text telling her how happy I was for her and how what shes doing seems like such a great experience for her and she never responded That hurt a lot I looked at her TikTok and Instagram for the first time in months and I just wanted to throw up She is living this whole life without me She looks happy and most of all beautiful Like how dare she be so beautiful and smile at people with smiles that were once mine I would go to her Spotify and I would be so paranoid that one of those playlists was dedicated to someone that wasnt me I felt so selfish and angry and mad at the world and at myself I had to push her out of my mind so I started seeing someone I wasnt even really interested in them Lookswise they were nothing compared to my exgirlfriend Their personality was so dull and boring compared to my ex and in the end I ended up just feeling like this huge dick for stringing someone along for months just to get over my exgirlfriend I went home for my Christmas break from my college and it got even worse Knowing that we were in the same town and just a drive away from each others houses made me feel insane I got so nervous that I was going to run into her any time I left the house I thought about going Christmas shopping in the mall she worked at so I could accidentally run into her and then would just get sad because I was becoming this huge creep I wanted to text her every day asking if she wanted to get coffee and I never did because nothing would hurt more than knowing she didnt want to see me I texted her Merry Christmas and she was nice about it but she didnt want to talk to me anymore after that And then I saw she went back to her college before me and it was painful seeing her with all her friends having so much fun and having so much fun without me Seeing her cozied up with a girl on her Instagram makes me feel like Im going to throw up I see them post together all the time and I just want to know if theyre dating How could she date someone so soon after 3 almost 4 years How could she be so brazen and post her and that girl getting coffee and going on dates together Does she not think Ill see it I think I would feel worse if it was a man The thought of some man looking at her the way I used to and touching her and being intimate with her makes me angry and sad and violent all at the same time I would stalk her pages all day while I was still in our hometown waiting for her to post something and getting nervous when she would How could she be having so much fun and be so happy all without me We were each others first love first kiss first everything And now I dont know if shes doing that with other people Things got a little bit better when I went back for my second semester of college but I still just cant get her out of my mind Im starting to see another girl now to try and get over my ex and shes again nothing like my exgirlfriend and I dont think there will ever be anyone like herWhen I first broke up with her I didnt think it would hurt this much I guess in the back of my mind I thought she wouldve fought for us I thought she wouldve texted me more when we were broken up I thought she and I honestly wouldve gotten back together at this point Im so insanely in love with her still and I brought this on myself but I thought I was doing whats best for the both of us I guess I didnt appreciate or realize the things that she did for me while we were together,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 13:50:08 UTC,0,16,0.41,,,0,0

1j4e57g,Hooked up with moms friend,tldr My moms friend helped me through a tough time and get into college We got really close and weve been hooking up since No one knows She worked with my mom They grew close over the years and became even closer the summer before I left for college because my parents were going through a nasty divorce She threw me a birthday party when my parents were too busy fighting in court to remember She made a big effort to be there for my mom and by proxy she was also there for me We grew close because she would bring over dinner and eat with me drive me places pick me up and bring me home and even helped me with school My mom picked up another job to help pay for the divorce lawyer so she was gone a lot She helped me prepare for my college interviews wrote me references and connected me with people she knew Most nights shed feed me dinner clean up and make sure I was home instead of out partying then lock up our house and sometimes sleep there on the couch or my moms bed until my mom got home I always was attracted to her since she was younger than my mom but still had that fit work out milf type of look I would check her out often and even use her as the focal point of my masturbation It got to the point where I snuck into her laundry basket a few times to check out her used lingerie We grew closer and talked about sex It started from her giving me advice on navigating the dating world and a girls perspective I felt comfortable with her helping me figure out these social situations since she is young and attractive I just figured she understood I complained about girls friends anxiety She was a great listener and I would love receiving comforting hugs from her I would always get aroused from talking with her about things One night when we hugged she felt my hard arousal accidentally press up against her but nothing happened My fantasy was just that a fantasy until I went to college My parents were still dragging the divorce out so she graciously helped me shop pack and even dropped me off It was only 45 mins away from home I wanted to go further away but Im just lucky to even get into college with all the stress Her texts were often and short so it wasnt unusual for us to be casual with each other One night I got really drunk and texted her pretty late thinking she wouldnt get it until later in the morning I mentioned how I thought about her during random hook ups or masturbation Well to my surprise she replied and we engaged in a little back and forth This happened a few times over the course of my first semester and I did try to push the flirting boundaries when we talked about intimate things It usually started with reminders for me to practice safe sex and then lead to talking about sex in general I could tell she was really careful about being intimate with me A few times it slipped into flirty territory There was a blizzard as everyone was leaving for winter break I could have taken the train but I texted her that I didnt have a ride home because I wanted to spend time with her It was late and the storm was pretty bad by the time she dropped me off She insisted that shed come in and make me dinner At some point a bottle of wine was consumed She mentioned that my mom was working until 10pm that night so she stayed up with me to watch a movie We ended up talking about all the things that happened that semester and I admitted to her her my lack of confidence with girls I joked that if only I could get some practice in real life instead of watching porn I could find the clit Well one thing led to another and we spent a lot of break together Since coming back to school shes been driving here and getting a hotel for us once a week Im afraid that I wont like girls my age anymore after this and that shes making it so fun and easy that Im not making an effort to meet girls my age Not really sure what to do but needed to get this off my chest Its just nice having someone to have sex with so easily instead of putting in effort to flirt play games go out drinking and risking being with a random girl,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:13:00 UTC,0,2,0.44,,,0,0

1j773xl,I wouldnt marry my husband of 17 years if given a doover,Four years ago I felt like I had achieved all goals happiness and was married to my best friend For context I 35f and my husband 38m have been married for 17 years I met him as a teenager we dated and married promptly after my 18th birthday I felt like we had really worked through a lot of issues to build a good marriage and life together I dont have a strong support system of people in my life so it was just him and me against the world Well that changed and Ive been beating myself up about it for a while and trying to navigate my feelings or just ignoring them idk I started to have feelings for a coworker I know typical He has been a friend at work and is married There has been nothing romantic between us and I dont get any indication from him that he is interested in more He has just been supportive as my coworker and a friend and that friendship doesnt extend outside of work at all I have no interest in pursuing a romantic relationship with him either I dont want to have infidelity in my marriage or try to convince someone else to be untrue And breaking marriages for another person just means a worse marriage This has really led me to contemplate my life Why when everything was feeling so right did I start catching feelings for someone else I looked back at our relationship and started seeing all the negative I questioned if I was just looking for reasons to justify how I felt I came to the realization that our dating relationship was abusive and early years of our marriage More than just bad or two stupid kids He was very controlling pushed sex on me before I was ready and even used a sexual act two different times as punishment that was painful Anytime Im alone with my thoughts I think that so much of how I am today in my relationship with him was shaped by the bad times He isnt that person any more he isnt controlling and treats me better overall But I dont have friends am scared to make him mad scared to talk about my feelings am super agreeable to avoid any conflicts He has been explosive and mean in the past when he gets angry although that hasnt been too recently Nothing ever physical I still feel like a terrible person for thinking about another guy and feel some blame for wallowing in the past I think if I would do it all over and theres no way I would stay in the relationship if given a do over If I had a daughter I would teach her how to avoid this and reach out for help I feel like my eyes have been opened to the truth of our past I tried to bring it up with him by asking what he thought about our dating relationship He said he doesnt really think about it and I said that I thought it was bad I brought up some things and he didnt want to talk about it He said he had apologized and I just hadnt forgiven him for it He got mad and I got upset and cried I remember him giving an apology several years ago we both got drunk and he said he felt bad about things and I consoled him but Im just now realizing it was abusive I wanted to get confirmation from him that he agreed it wasnt a healthy relationship just for healing But there was nothing productive about it I find myself lately being depressed and bottled up I work full time and my husband hasnt had a job for a few years now I really dont care if he works but want him to contribute to our relationship in some way Instead he spends a lot of time sitting around the house on his phone making a mess and spending excessive amounts of time on hobbies And no I dont think there is any chance he is cheating I think he is also depressed My guilt and frustration are overwhelming I love him and he loves me but Im spending too much time in my head not dealing with my feelings just hoping things find their place and go back even though I know thats not likely I know I could use counseling to work on past trauma and learn to be a better partner myself So maybe Ill finally do that,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 12:59:24 UTC,695,67,0.91,,,0,0

1j3bnhi,Realised my family dont respect me now Im heartbroken and dont know what to do,Hello Reddit long time reader but finally posting for the first time so please be kind also this is on mobile so Im sorry if my grammar and format arent very good Trigger Warning as this might be a hard read for some and contains talk of abuse My 29 life story isnt a happy one lots of loss abuse and loneliness Abit of background Im the middle of 3 kids an older sister and a younger brother were all close in age and didnt get along at all as kids but did become closer as we got older or so I thought My Dad died when I was young and this had a massive negative impact on my family but especially my mum who became a partially functional alcoholic with lots of mental health issues which she has never gone to or considered therapy for She also has dated alot of abusive and weird partners over the years so I grew up in a violent and toxic environment she has not had a successful long term relationship since my Dads death I am autistic and have afew mental health problems myself but I have been in and out of therapy for a long time and have done alot of work to try to better myself and work on my flaws I have chronic illnesses and chronic pain from degenerative issues which make day to day living hard I dont want to sound all woe is me but unfortunately this is just me being honest about whats happened and still happening to me I absolutely LOVE animals I have grown up around all sort of animalspets and honestly I love them more than people they love unconditionally and my soul pet was there throughout all Ive suffered in life always there to love and comfort me in my time of need Ive never felt more loved in my life than the love I felt from them and Ill always cherish my 10 years with them They unfortunately passed away 2 years ago and I still struggle with the loss today Ive lost a fair few animals over the years and grief is nothing new to me but its never any less painful each time I was bullied relentlessly through out my educational years and even in the workplace Im abit different and maybe a lil weird but I will never understand why Ive been bullied the way I have I always try to be kind and caring to people and will always have someones back but sadly its never reciprocated and I have faced my bullies alone All this and I still strive to be a good and kind person as for me kindness is my default and I never want to or intend to hurt anyone Thanks to all the bullying I have alot of selfesteem and self worth issues that I deal with but will always try and make others feel good about themselves Ive suffered through multiple physically and emotionally abusive relationships in my life Im not perfect but have never treated any of my partners the way I have been treated Ive been put down called names financially abused hit and raped by past partners and was sexually assaulted by a family friend Ive never received any justice for whats happened to me and sadly theyve all gotten away with it My mum has been abusive to me and my sister growing up shes the typical toxic narcissistic gaslighting and body shaming mother who hates all but one of her kids my EDs started primarily thanks to her and her fatphobia which has inflicted lasting damage on me and my siblings Shes hit me verbally abused me and been physically violent to me from ages 8 upwards she never acknowledges her actions and has literally never said sorry or apologized to me EVER Its almost like she is physically incapable of saying sorry to me specifically Shes thrown me out the house multiple times and gaslights herself into saying that I moved out which just isnt true the last straw was throwing me out with nowhere to go and I had to figure out everything on my own Ive lived independently ever since and even when Ive been homeless theres no way Id ever put myself through living with her ever again I am Queer and Trans she has not shown any respect for my identity or just me as a person Ive been out as trans for 4 years and it was pretty obvious in my teen years that I was not comfortable with my assigned birth gender Shes not homophobic but is not supportive of trans identities at all and has been very open about her lack of respect for it which has been devastating to my identity and my mental health Ive done so much to help her and financially support her over the years and thanks to therapy Ive realized how bad it is and have cut her out my life for good My sister has 2 kids I absolutely adore them and would do anything for them their dad has been in and out of their lives so I have helped alot with raising them and I love them like theyre my own I do NOT want children myself I thought I did growing up but as Ive gotten older Ive realised that I would not be a good parent and would not want to bring children into the world with a parent thats messed up no child deserves that I moved away from my home town about 4 years ago to get away from the small town racism and homophobia it was not possible for me to be who I am in that place and have been happier where I live now Unfortunately this has had a negative impact on my relationship with my siblings they make minimal to 0 effort to see me and its always me travelling to them and considering Im disabled and they arent seems abit unfair to me I am very different from them and have different beliefs than them too this has put a strain on our relationships our political beliefs are not the same and sadly theyre quite closed minded and disrespectful towards foreign womens and transqueer rights They say the apple doesnt fall far from the tree but I fell and rolled off a cliff away from them and their beliefs So now Im faced with a dilemma back away and barely or never see my sisters kids again allowing them to be raised in this environment or sit and allow my family to continue to disrespect me my identity and my beliefs Its heartbreaking cus I have just 1 friend who understands loves and respects me I have no one else and spending most of my life being and feeling alone is taking its toll I try so hard to make friends and find partners but I always end up alone Feeling alienated from my family is awful as family means so much to me but I clearly dont matter to them in the same way Sorry this was long but I just needed to scream something into the internet void about how I feel as I cant talk to my family about things as it just causes arguments Thank you for reading,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 14:12:26 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j2zd0k,I am struggling with the decision of accepting money from my dad when I plan on cutting him off again,For context I am 29 years old and I grew up in an extremely abusive household My dad nearly tried to take my life on several occasions and knew that my brother was sexually abusing me and did nothing about it My dad constantly threatened to either kill me or himself and would not let me move out or live my life even through my 20s He would pretend to be poor and ask me to help him with bills all the time but he was sitting on a half a million dollars and just didnt want to use it It got to the point that even in my early and mid twenties he tracked my location my credit card bank account etc and would abuse me choke me punch me threaten to kill me if I spent any money on anything Once I even asked to move out and he grabbed a kitchen knife and said hell either kill me or himself if I ever leave I ended up getting cancer and my dad never even helped me with any of my bills for treatment and still continued to ask ME for moneyhelp Fast forward to last year I finally ran away I changed my last name my phone number moved to a different city and took my dog and left I went one full year without contact filed restraining orders and everything My dog has been my only consistent family my entire life He has been the only support Ive ever had and is my emotional support dog He was just diagnosed with cancer and I BROKE down Out of sheer emotion I called my dad Which was the dumbest thing Ive ever done He was so elated to have me call him and back in his life that he offered to pay for my dogs surgery to help him be cancer free I let him and I was so happy to have support I NEED to cut him off again because hes already talking about wanting to leave his wife my mom and move in with me so we can leave happily ever after He makes comments like we can get a second puppy and raise him together as if we are a couple and we would live a life together My father is making me EXTREMELY SICK and I am reminded why I had to cut him off Anyway I was told my dog may need a round or two of chemotherapy Giving him chemotherapy could give him a matter of YEARS of his life back versus only months My dog is in EXCELLENT condition couldnt even tell he was sick He IS worth saving My dad is offering to pay for the chemotherapy Because he thinks he will be able to keep me in his life by doing so Am I a bad person if I accepted his financial help and then cut him off all over again right after Is that morally wrong Would I be the AH Im learning how to live life at 29 years old for the very first time and barely making it I was never taught financial literacy or how to manage my money because my dad did everything for me And didnt let me take charge of my own life I never knew how to cook or do ANYTHING They took my life away from me because they wanted me to live with them forever I need this financial help to save my very best friend but I also dont want to do something that would make me a horrible person I could TECHNICALLY afford his chemo but it would pretty much make me have 0 savings So WIBTA to take his money and then run I also considered telling him that Id only accept the money if he knew it was no strings attached and that he has to be fully aware that I am not letting him BUY a relationship with me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 01:35:42 UTC,0,1,0.5,,,0,0
1j32iaa,My dads girlfriend tried to get me to forge documents,My mom and dad have been separated since I was 13 and it was because of my dads abuse and neglect He has brain damage from a bad car accident and has poor impulse control as a result Despite this Ive tried my best to be on good terms as an adult but his psycho girlfriend is too much to deal with Her name is Cherry He started dating Cherry about 3 years ago Shes had three kids and lost them all to the system because shes too crazy to care for them bipolar and sometimes else shes estranged from all of them important notes for later she is loud rude quick to anger and prone to simple and complex delusions when something doesnt go her way Im positive the only reason my dad is still with her especially after she killed his cat supposed by accident is because she came into a lot of settlement money from hernia mesh complication Since then theyve been living it up together About a week before Christmas Cherrys oldest son got hit on a moped on the highway by a big truck He felt into a coma and is brain dead His long term girlfriend and mother of his son was given power of attorney aa per his medical wishes Now Cherry lost custody of him when he was just 9 years old and havent spoken to her in over 5 years She had never met her grandson or his girlfriend until she came to the hospital Cherry immediate assumed she was in control over his medical decisions and requested the plug be pulled and openly discussed lawsuits and burials in front of his girlfriend and son Girlfriend told her to stop and said she didnt have the right and before long Cherry is banned from seeing him and banned from the hospital as a guest forever In Cherrys mind and version of events his girlfriends grandfather forged her sons name on the medical records declaring her to make decisions on his behalf in case of coma the reasoning is her grandfather works for the county court as a traffic ticket clerk and her evidence is I know my son Shes repeatedly asked my opinion on the matter because I work in critical care nursing and Ive explained it multiple times as simply as I can but she refuses to believe that a common law partner with a child of 10 years would be granted power of attorney over an estranged parent who lost custody for mental health and sex work and drug convictions This leads me to the trap I feel in Theyve been bugging me about meeting for lunch for weeks to discuss something and every time Id ask what for they say we need to talk in person I was going to be in town that way last Saturday so I agreed and figured a free meal and theyd stop bugging me The day before my dad ask me to bring my notary stamp Im a notary good side gig and I press and they say we need you to look over some papers I get suspicious and stiff out what theyre up to I call them out of it and they insist that it isnt related to it I get there we order our food and they pull out power of attorney forms They try to say that the court told them they just had to fill these out get them notarized and Cherry would get power of attorney over her son I explained these forms required her son to sign them and says it doesnt because hes in a coma I explained this was forgery and her rebuttal was well that bitch forged her name to take my son and I had to calmly explain that even if it did happen nothing would change without a lawyer and they dont take this stuff lightly Cherry has a melt down and accuses me of plotting against her and my dad had to get her to stop because at this point she causing scene yelling slamming her hands on the table I get up and leave and my dad tried to call my four times before he got the message Today he texted me saying why couldnt you just do it if youre right they wont accept the form noways like he didnt ask me to commit a crime for his psycho girlfriend They deserve each other and feel horrible for her children ever having to deal with crazy crack head One day Ill never have to deal with her or my dad and Ill celibate with KFCs finest to commemorate the time they tried to bribe me with a 5 fill up to commit forgery to get control over a person in a coma,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 04:19:06 UTC,30,4,0.87,,,0,0

1j5ez5s,I treated my for a broken handwrist as a kid and didnt knowrealize it until i was older very long read oof,i honestly really should probably talk abt this bc it honestly was actually pretty tramuatizing enough that i feel like i may have locked away some memories of what happened bc of just how awful some of the experience was my memory is somewhat spotty bc of how scary it all was but ill try my best to explain my friend had a Halloween party at her house we decided to play something that involved running which was a rather stupid decision as everything was slippery and dark outside i was running nearon ground that was steeply raised up a bit for a buliding to be bulit flat on i slipped and fell despite the mud when i instinctively reached out to brace myself by putting my hand out towards the top of the small slope i got hurt really really badly i had never been in such pain before i dont remember how quickly it arrived exactly but it was pretty quick to show up i started crying a soon as the pain hit and the girl i had been running behind took notice and from what i can remember asked if i was ok the other girls i was playing with eventually noticed and the escorted me to the house and to my friends mother who is a vetvet tech she wrapped it in blue vet wrap in the kitchen and asked if i wanted to go to the doctor and child me refused out if fear of possibly having to get surgery and probably bc i didnt want to inconvenience anyone the vet wrap was uncomfortable and irritating but honestly the splint i got for a broken foot abt 2 years ago was worse and it was by an er doc too and while child me had to experience that awful splint the vet wrap did make my hand feel better i felt like i could pick it up and move it safely so i ended up staying inside sitting on one of their couches in the living room and resting my arm on the arm supports watching tv with my friends mom i wasnt rly interested in the show but that was the least of my worries then i think at one point she brought me food like a hotdog or smth which had ketchup bc my autistic ass wouldnt eat meat unless ot had ketchup on it the other girls went outside after everything calmed down somewhat tho my friend stayed a bit longer from what remember to make sure i was ok eventually they came back inside for an event i forget if it was planned or started bc it was dark and I was stuck inside basically it was a game where someone would get wrapped on toilet paper to become a mummy they included me in it by loosely wrapping parts of my armhand that i was willing to move and then we eventually all went home i dunno when any of this next stuff happens exactly but ill try to explain it in order i was cyberschooled then and at first i was fine until i needed to write something im right handed and my right hand was the one that was injured i remember my mom yelling at me because i refused to use my right hand and i think i asked if she could write for me she told me to use it and i remember crying and saying I cant I cant i tried to move it even slightly in order to try obeying what she said but the pain was terrible horrendous unbearable i cant think of words that can extensively describe how much pain i was in i dont quite remember it all but i think when i tried to use my left hand to write i was yelled at too and my mom minimized my pain by saying smth along the lines of it isnt that bad and i was also condescendingly asked if i wanted to go the doctor which i again refused fearing surgery and also bc having my parents yell at me made me upset all this time i remember i still had that blue vet wrap on my hand was shaking and in so much pain i forget if my mom did the usual let me feel it thing but if she did i most definitely refused and probably yanked it away based on the fact I still had that vet wrap on i think it was probably the next day i was allowed to write with my left hand but not without being scolded i remember writing down things in notebooks for fun with my left hand and i even decided that a character id made had my left hands handwriting i eventually got better writing with my left hand and honestly really had fun with it while i wrote and did things with my left hand i also did not use my right hand or bend my wrist at least i did as little as possible i kept on using the vet wrap to stablize it until it wouldnt stick no more then i found some wrap i has gotten from when i sprained my leg and so i it instead and remembered how i treated my sprained leg used that was refrence for resting my hand and also didnt move it bc it was painful i dont remember much else abt the recovery i think i stopped wrapping it and started using my right hand again as soon as the pain lessoned which probably was after like a month or two perhaps ik it takes longer for a broken bone to recover but the pain does go away pretty quickly honestly i remember my mom expecting me to recover from my sprain in about a week and was upset i still refused to use it and instead write with my left hand i did keep on writing with my left hand sometimes for awhile after that just for fun which ironically probably helped my right hand recover lol i dont quite know how long after it was but i think it was a decent chunk after but within the same year i once again slipped and fell and i forget which handi landed on but based on the pain and how caught myself the same way again i think it was my right which i once again assumed was a sprain but only a minor one so i again pulled out the wrap i had and i think for abt a day or 3 days wrapped my hand i remember not having much pain and wondering if it still needed wrapped the next day but i still ended up keeping it on i think and until i was a teen it never hit me that the pain i feltin my bones was not a normal sprain thing but probably a broken bone and it really hit me after a horse broke my foot 2 years ago that yea that probably wasnt a sprain bc like it was while less pain that pain i got from my broken foot felt literally like a lesser version of the pain i felt in my hand when i was a kid tbh im not completely sure if i did break my hand as ive never rly had it inspected for past breaks unlike my foot it doesnt rly act up when the weather changes or from overuse etc at least i think so i never rly took notice of anything like thay as a kid because i was never aware or looking for anybpain related to broken bones so im open to anyone suggesting its something else not for legitimate medical advice as well ik i shouldnt get it from here and its already healed just out of curiosity i wonder if it was like a pinched nerve maybe but it didnt feel like one at all ive unfortunately had and continue of have pinched nerves in my neck

1j2zd9q,My mom passed away and bf is becoming more abusive,Its been 6 months since my mom has passed The first month was the hardest I didnt have the energy to do much of anything And then came the nausea Turns out I got pregnant by my bf I was extremely saddened by it bc I already had one abortion when I didnt think I was ready for it years ago And I had promised myself that I wouldnt go through with that again The problem is my bf is very verbally abusive and cops have been called multiple times bc of it in the past 6 years Today he was upset that the gym was too crowded and he kept being negative over the whole thing That annoyed me and so I just said we should just go since hes killing the mood over nothing We both were free for like 4 hours so waiting just a bit wasnt going to effect much He then started driving very aggressively and that bothered me further since I am pregnant and hes supposed to be more careful on the road He kept saying things to me none of them were questions or anything I could really say anything to That made him start yelling at me and calling me an asshole for ignoring him I told him to stop calling me that and that began a screaming match I felt my baby going crazy in my womb so I told him to stop the car and I walked out a mile and a half away from home I ignored all the calls and texts while I walked I read my Bible to calm down my thoughts and the baby I also stopped to grab a green juice and a tuna wrap since I hadnt eaten anything Im torn about the whole ordeal He wont listen to me about basic respect and Im scared that the baby will have to deal with his antics as well Im not looking for advice really I just needed to vent Thanks for listening,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 01:36:04 UTC,2,3,1.0,,,0,0

1j6ysb5,FINAL UPDATE I 21F found out my husband 33M has been having an affair with my mother and I dont know where to go from here,Hey so this will be my final update on everything as I believe the situation has finally come to an end and Im in a really good place I left off where I was in a shelter and had made a lot of friends Well the girl who I was gonna move somewhere with she ended up going back to her Mom and step Dad and so I was back to being stuck on what to do That was until I got a message from my grandma that her mom my greatgrandma needs someone to care for her she said that her brother would be happy to have me stay with him as long as I care for my great grandma I decided I have nothing left to lose and decided this would be a good gig till I find out what I wanna do I arrived in Miami 3 days ago and have been enjoying it greatly so far I never really knew my dads side as he wasnt that close with his family and after he passed it was hard to keep contact My greatuncle is very nice and very accommodating and his wife is really nice they live in quite a nice part of Miami as well near the beach I havent seen my greatgrandma in over 10 years and she was so happy when she saw me She cant speak that much English as she only really speaks Spanish Im aware I said my dad was white but thats was only because I was scared of my identity being revealed and that wasnt a 100 lie My father was Cuban and was born and raised in Miami however he was most likely a descendant of Spaniards Anyways my great grandma has been teaching me Spanish and as well through the help of translating of my great uncle stories about my dad She told me that he would fall asleep on her lap at family gatherings and how he would make the whole family laugh imitating her accent It made me tear up seeing all the photos of him as a kid with his whole family She told me that when he got on drugs and ran away from home it left everyone in complete distraught She claimed my grandma would cry everyday My Mom never had a relationship with them and that was her choice they wanted to meet her actually They told me that they werent shocked what happened to me as my Dad told them later on my mom would cheat on him all the time with other men This made me furious as my mom always claimed my dad was her soulmate I have not heard anything from my mom however my cousins wedding went ahead yesterday as my aunty posted it on Facebook My mom was there and she seemed completely fine from the photos The wedding looked boring anyways my cousin is marrying his first cousin from Pakistan inlaws side and no one is smiling It made me laugh actually seeing my mom with all these people who are deeply religious and conservative Seeing my mom next to my grandma and other female relatives who wear scarfs and are deeply religious compared to my mom who sleeps with anyone that gives her an ounce of attention really cracks me up Also no word from my EXhusband however his sister sent me a text apologising on behalf of her and his parents So yeah thats the end I believe Im taking care of my greatgrandma and will work out what I wanna do in the mean time This will most likely hopefully be the final update as I believe Im in a really good place,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 03:38:28 UTC,1577,32,0.97,,,0,0

1j31tre,I love my family and I paid for their travel to Europe,I dont have any place to share this story because it may be too braggy so I hope to post this here I 33M am the eldest of my family with my 2 siblings 32F 29M and my parents almost 60 My earliest memory was of my siblings and I sleeping in a storeroom frequently visited by roaches and mice and us playing with street children Amid this our parents still found the money to install an AC in the storeroom and got us into the best primary and secondary school in our town This reflects how my parents worked hard for the family while making sure that me and my siblings are living comfortably Due to my upbringing being quite positive and never having felt impoverished I always thought of myself as normal and at times even rich It was only during the past few years of maturity that I realised that my parents truly kept the family afloat While I always wanted to give back to my family I was assumed to become the poorest among my siblings We say this in jest so it was totally fine My siblings were the businesstypes and theyve saved up enough money to be far richer than me while I am still doing my PhD hence underpaid Due to my academic degrees Ive travelled quite a lot especially within Europe travel between countries is super cheap Each country I stepped into I always hoped that I could bring my family with me I never thought that this would be a possibility because my family lives oceans away and again I am a PhD student Fast forward to last year I was scanning through LinkedIn and found an AIrelated job which completely fits my profile I have a unique set of skills from my previous MSc and my current PhD which made me uniquely fit for this job they literally should have just put my name on the job ad lol Due to being related to AI and the unique nature of my specialty the job paid extremely well Additionally it was a completely freelance and remote job I applied and got in and made my way from being a normal worker to becoming one of the heads of the team even getting facetoface with the huge AI companies yes those ones I was paid weekly and within the first week I was able to comfortably buy the latest iPhone and an ok desk setup during the second week I am quite a simple guy who really just wanted a good phone and desk so the next few weeks the money was just gathering in my account Anyway my graduation from my European MSc was coming up it got delayed and I really wanted to bring my parents With no hesitation I invited my parents to the graduation all expenses paid My mother also asked if my siblings can also tag along At this point I did not have enough money for everyone but I said they can come Somehow along the way my siblings also had all their expenses paid by me Haha I worked my ass off while my mother planned the trip We ended up with a planned trip across 6 countries in 3 weeks Honestly I did not expect it to be as intense but I still said yes My mother really wanted to visit those countries And how could I even say no if my mother keeps showing me her planned outfits beret included There isnt enough space to list down all the things we did but here are some of the heartwarming ones gtMy father was never the type to express his emotions well and whenever we used to have our local trips he was mostly unimpressed For the first time I saw him taking photos of a landmark Eiffel Tower and he was quite lovey dovey with my mother especially in Paris They were so cute gtMy siblings and I had extremely deep conversations in Amsterdam About our lives our family How proud we were of each other and also reminiscing some of our childhood memories and that and look where we are now moment We never really talked to each other in such profound ways and I am so glad we had those conversations gtOur last stop was in Amsterdam my family had to take the train to the airport while I had to take the train back to the UK In the most dramatic way we found ourselves on adjacent platforms which meant we were waiting at the same bench for our trains Im fucking crying now Their train was about to arrive on the platform so we said our goodbyes We were not the type to hug so I just awkwardly said good bye to each of them while waving my hand My mother was surprised and asked me for a hug instead imagine her saying it in a stereotypical spoiled brats voice lol We did This was the first hug we had since Ive become an adult damn the onions They went inside the train and kept looking at me I HATED seeing them on the train I did not want them to leave and return to their normal lives back home Tears starting to form on my eyes and I had to look away I know it was truly dramatic And the timing was perfect because their train ran on that instant and mine came to my platform I miss them The work was a short term one so it stopped around mid of last year but it is starting up again I barely had any savings but I have no regrets I wish I can bring them here

1j4yx7b,The cp case against my ex husband has been closed and I dont know how to feel about it,In the beginning of the year my 27f ex husband 27m came to me after not talking for a year since the divorce finalized to confess to me of having sexual fantasies about children and looking at cp while we were together I took this information to the police and have been working with an investigator since then and made a controlled call to him with the investigator where he confessed only to looking at animated cp because the real stuff is really hard to find Today I was told that they spoke with him and looked at his devices and havent found any evidence and are closing the case And its a relief that to the best of my knowledge he didnt hurt any children or consume any content that hurt actual children But I was also warming up to the idea that he would face some kind of consequences for his actions Because he also emotionally manipulated and raped me throughout our entire marriage I know that I could still try to press charges for what he did to me but I dont really have any proof except for my own words And I want to be able to just move on and enjoy my life now that Im free from him But he has a new girlfriend who is significantly younger and reminds me of me when I was young and fell for his bullshit It feels so wrong that he can just do all of this and put me through so much and have nothing happen I hope hes telling the truth about getting help and wanting to change but I also cant help but believe that every word that comes out of his mouth is a lie even when he believes its the truth But Ive done what I can it cant be my responsibility anymore,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 16:07:52 UTC,32,10,0.82,,,0,0
1j4s9h6,So are you gonna be our new besties The June 27th incident at Kings Island,Hey everyone For the second consecutive year I stayed at Great Wolf Lodge from 623627 I visited the park Kings Island on 625 amp 627 In a perfect world Id love to tell you about everything I did and the people I met But unfortunately the sense of joy rejuvenation and fulfillment I get by being there was tarnished by an incident that took place at the end of the trip and at park closing on the 27th This post is as long as it is to make sure I cover all the details of what happened as specifically as I can Its now been eight months since this took place so I needed some time before I went public about this What I hope to accomplish with this is to have a better understanding of the world from a unique perspective and to use this as a learning tool to learn from someone elses misjudgements Im posting this with the complete acceptance understanding that this story may bring some type of criticism in my direction and honestly to achieve some type of closure on this particular incident With all that being said Ill begin On the night of June 27th I was in the Fast Lane Queue for Orion to get a PostFireworks Night Ride That day I was wearing a white Ross Chastain Gone Fishing Busch Light Car TShirt Wrangler Jean Shorts and AllBlack Under Armour Mens Charged Rogue 4 Running Shoes I was at the top of the steps and happened to introduce myself to two young ladies who were sitting against the fence in the station To best describe it as many of you know theres a 34 foot gap between the station and the stairs before you actually enter the station If I was to guess I originally thought these two females were in their early 20s Im 28 for context but they ask me Are you gonna be our new besties No girl has ever asked me a question like that So Im of the impression that theyre attracted to me and assumed theyre of legal age so I jokingly responded Well Im gonna be leaving tonight unless you had something else in mind And even if things worked out I wouldnt have bothered because I have a 2 Hour Drive in front of me back home to Louisville after I do this Night Ride But the girls then look at each other very awkwardly and say something along the lines of Dude WERE 16 I profusely try to apologize but they begin to overreact and make a scene in the station escalating the situation and start running down the steps of the normal queue And I apologize to the greeter and to a ride attendant because I didnt know that they were underage As Ill explain later in more detail that part of the situation like all parts of this situation couldve been resolved with an apology and life couldve went on As this was misunderstanding Some may ask why I didnt just ask how old they were Ive been raised on the idea that asking women how old they are is inappropriate So I finished my ride which while it was spectacular Im kinda nervous about what happened beforehand as I head to my locker to retrieve my belongings Mine was on the section closest to the OnRide Photo Desk and Im not able to open it probably because the park is now closed so the rental by default has expired So while Im about to get someone to help me get this locker opened two teenage boys confront me very aggressively on the situation before the ride saying something in the realm of What are you doing touching up on these little girls You should know better You wear that cross on your neck and do something like that How would god feel about that For context I regularly wear either black or silver cross necklace Ive had many people make conversation about that Im disappointed in you Youre not going anywhere until you apologize They also asked if I was at Soak City earlier which I was to check it out for the first time and look through some of the shops But they claimed I made inappropriate physical contact with someone there to Which I didnt I know that isnt exactly what these two gentlemen said but its what I remember as my anxiety ramped wondering how do I get outta this dilemma that just got handed to me on a silver platter But a couple of things I never groped these women The park has security cameras everywhere including in the coasters stations so theres proof that didnt happen and I also attempted to explain to these two gentleman that I had no clue they were 16 Again I thought they were in their early 20s college age But they werent buying it as both told me BRO YOU COULD TELL Many women look older than they actually are So you really cant sometimes But they both proceed to exercise public humiliation on me by shouting how I was Touching up on little girls to everyone who was leaving Area 72 that evening Like theyre the men from Dads Against Predators on Locals Finally security steps in to figure out what was going on and by the request of these young men One guard originally begins to interview me but then attends to the younger gentleman who initiated the confrontation so another guard interviews me and I explain everything as detailed as I can and as calm as I can l which in the moment was pretty impossible to accomplish I finally got my things outta my locker then this guard escorts me to the front of the park to see what his supervisor or coworkers had to say on the matter and they told me Youre good to go sir nothing else is gonna happen Next time when youre having small talk just be more careful So I walk the path back over to Great Wolf where my car was parked I checked out from there that morning and was granted permission to keep my car parked there But as Im then at the NorthEnd of the parking lot in the small section that walks SoutheasttoNorthwest what appears to be a Black 2014 Honda Civic pulls up and its the teenagers again The gentleman in the passenger side ask for my name number address and zipcode Which I like this whole time cooperate and disclose it And many of you may ask why would you give your information to them They arent police or security I thought that being honest and cooperative would salvage my reputation in this situation And what if they can tell that Im lying So after doing so he says to me We just got banned for a month This is my favorite place to go to Have a good night I love you Then they take off into the night To be honest I shouldve walked down Columbia Road instead of the walk path to avoid the possibility of further encounters But at that point I thought the teens left at that point Or ask security to escort me to my car if theyre allowed to do that After filling up my car at the GoCo on Kings Mills Road I began my drive home I look over to my left on Southbound I71 to look at the park one last time despite it looking so spectacular in person at night I was unable to enjoy it because of what all just happened Heres how this situation shouldve been resolved If I were the girls Id peacefully and politely inform me Sorry to tell you but were actually 16 Then Id have responded My apologies I didnt know that Ill back off I apologize Then the girls shouldve said Youre fine Its all good Then life wouldve moved on and the situation wouldve never escalated to the point it did But to begin with if the girls never asked that question none of this would have ever happened to begin with If I were either of the boys I would have started with professionally and calmly said Excuse me sir you gotta minute to talk And I wouldve said Sure No problem They couldve have offered to buy me a Dasani then said Do you know why were wanting to speak with you Okay there was an incident involving several young ladies in the station a few minutes ago would you mind sharing your side of the story And I wouldve done just that So they have both sides of the story and develop a conclusion and they finished the meeting by stating Okay we believe you did make a mistake you didnt know their age just be more careful next time Thank You for talking with us and have a good night Theres a reason for the saying Cooler heads prevail You gotta assure everyones calm in order to then get to the bottom of any situation That never happened There also has to be a presumption of innocence established in the investigation process as well Thats why in the legal system All suspects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law Which thanks to security for helping with this incident and siding with me on this On June 28th one of the male parties in the incident made a post to this group that afternoon which was a motive to making this post in response I waited til now to conduct this post so I made sure I could tell my side in the most detailed and comprehensive way possible But prior to the post either being deleted or taken down I monitored it by reading all the comments throughout the time that post remained up To start I read that I was reported to Mason Police I was waiting to see if either they would call me for an interview I never did I thought about calling them myself but when talking to someone about the matter they recommended I didnt This individual also claimed in the comments I watched him do what he did But in the post he states 2 girls came running down the stairs Which implies that he was either at the bottom of the stairs or still at groundlevel And in addition to the wall that divides the FastLane queue to the regular queue after the show building there would be no possibility for him to have seen the incident unfold So it seems very contradicting Also another user had stated the girls wouldnt of lied about something like that This where I channel my inner Alex Jones and become a tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist In retrospect hindsight is always 2020 I believe the possibility that those girls asked me that question Are you gonna be our new besties to bait me Ill even go a step further that Im of the belief that they mightve been of legal age but claimed they were 16 as a convenient excuse to cause a problem Im not saying thats the case its complete speculation In todays society select people love to cause andor escalate issues to play the victim card because it gets them attention On top of that they also delivered misinformation by stating I had groped them Like I mentioned earlier there was a 4ft gap between us that wouldve been impossible And security cameras are everywhere and if footage was pulled up it shows I never did that So they lied about that to artificially make the situation look worse to garner more attention and spark more outrage This is why you have to hear both sides to the story then develop the conclusion Not just hear one side and ride with it Again what other reason would these two girls ask me that question In the minutes hours and days following this has greatly amp negatively affected my mental health as Ive had many thoughts rush through my head I thought maybe it was best I should wait a couple years before visiting again Im worried about the people around who witnessed what happened how will they think of me Whats the ride attendants at Orion gonna think of me Whats gonna happen if these teens see me again Are they gonna forget about what happened or will they try to engage in some type of conflict How will I be able to pick myself up from this And am I sure Ill still be a positive asset to society Thankfully I didnt have to wait too long to answer that last question On July 3rd I visited Ark Encounter and it felt therapeutic to be on I71 again then be around people again While there Id happen to see a mom try taking a family photo but she wouldnt be in it so Id ask Excuse me maam if you wanna be in the shot Ill take the photo And that situation happened 4 or 5 times that day and to see the sense of joy appreciation and thankfulness expressed by these families to me reassured that I was good person and a positive asset to society Ive talked to many people about this for advice and support While at the GocoPopeyesDunkin Donuts on Kings Mills Road to fill up and I talked to the guy working there about this and mentioned it was teens just looking to cause issues When I woke up Friday afternoon I talked to my parents immediately about this if I didnt theyd notice something was bothering me I also talked to select people at Work on XBOX and to other friends of mine and everyone unanimously have said that I did nothing wrong and agreed it was a misunderstanding I wanna thank everyone who Ive reached out to for support as this has been a difficult time Im surprised everyone has sided with me on this they didnt have to but Im grateful for helping me get through this I can only imagine the stress and anxiety women especially attractive women feel in public To go to any Zoo Bar Restaurant Bowling Alley Amusement Park Movie Theater etc has to be sometimes unbearable To always be looked at or to have someone always making advances towards you has to feel vulnerable and invasive With that in consideration I do whats necessary to respect womens boundaries when out in public So to even claim that Im a Predator is absolutely inaccurate As mentioned earlier this was a misunderstanding These girls asked a question that led me to assume they were attracted to me and of age I responded based off that then they blew it out of proportion and caused a huge mess at the end of what was supposed to be another fun and memorable multiday trip up there In conclusion the last absolute last things Id want to do is make enemies inside the gates of Kings Island Not within Mason Ohio not within Warren County not within the Cincinnati TriState Area and not within the State of Ohio period And the other last thing I wanted is to be on the radar of the City of Mason Police Department I imagine a day where I can call Mason Ohio home so I want to be on good terms with everyone I encounter To the other parties involved if they read this post I hope we can mutually apologize come to a better understanding of what took place so we can be on good terms with each other achieve closure and move forward on a positive note Im gonna be visiting the park again this year so I dont want us to cross paths and have any further conflict or sense of animosity or discomfort While Im not wishing ill will on anyone these four people possibly will be faced with a situation thats a misunderstanding as well If so Id want their situation to be handled calmly and smoothened out as well and as quickly as possible so they dont face any hate or animosity from the opposing parties of whatever situation faces them And I apologize to the two young men for getting banned Yall unfortunately were denied the opportunity to see the Fourth of July Celebration fireworks display and more valuable time to ride Orion The Beast or whatever yalls favorite coaster might be While I understand they were trying to stand up for whats right it still wasnt the correct way to do so and hopefully they learn from this as well For me I just use it as a learning experience to be extra careful on who Im talking to and not make decisions off assumptions Which I apologize to the young ladies for doing so Im someone whos very respectful to peoples boundaries and wouldnt wanna make decisions about that makes someone feel uncomfortable But I do hope they apologize for asking a question that expresses attraction only to turnaround and cause a scene that couldve been resolved with a simple apology Nobody wouldve gotten banned and security wouldnt have gotten involved Im gonna be presented with 1000 different situations and scenarios and Ill be fine in 925 of them Nobody is perfect Also its been important for me to allow time to heal the wounds as the situation shrinks farther in the past I come to Kings Island for peace and serenity not drama and distress And this sadly was drama and distress Ive met many people in my now four visits to the park and had wonderful converstations and engagements with those people both fellow guests and employees Its very unfortunate this all happened and was more heartbreaking that it happened at the very end of this trip I took I refuse to allow that to be the last memory I have of the park this year Thank you to everyone who took time outta their day to read this and whether or not youre going to the park today have a great day everyone,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 10:07:37

1j5fth6,I hate my parents for not letting me have surgery for pectus carinatum,First of all I want to apologize for my poor English since Im doing this through a translator Im a 19yearold guy who has had pectus carinatum his whole life It has brought me a lot of teasing and stares and even though I have the mildest case I have a small bananashaped protrusion on my sternum Ive wanted surgery since I was 14 As a first option they wanted me to wear a compression brace for a year which is complete nonsense I knew it wouldnt fix what I have and even the doctor said so I fought for years to get surgery until one day they took me to the subcapital to see a doctor The doctor told me it was a very mild case and that the surgery was very simple they would cut two cartilages push the sternum inward and that was it This happened in June 2024 I was very excited about the idea of having a normal chest My experience with this condition has been horrible and has caused me a lot of insecurity Every time I wear a tshirt the lump is noticeable making me look much fatter than I actually am Ive been training for five years and its horrible to see how I cant make progress in my chest because this damn protrusion sticks outits all Ive seen in the mirror for five years Going back to what I was saying my parents postponed the surgery until 2025 I got angry with them and gave them an ultimatum Either I get the surgery or I leave the house I want to clarify that this was the only thing I was asking for the only thing I wanted Im the youngest child and I have a 29yearold sister who is studying her second degree because she realized that the first one wouldnt get her a job My father has always helped her with her apartment and university expenses Ive always known she was the favorite and I wasnt asking for muchjust this surgery Today we went to see a doctor in our city and instead of agreeing with the previous doctor he said they would have to break my abdomen cut all the cartilage and insert a prosthesis I suspect this was all planned because my father is a doctor and I have a feeling he talked to this doctor to make me change my mind or to have an excuse to say no I walked home because I was so angry at them Ive been fighting for this surgery for about five years and they found the perfect excuse to deny it Tonight at dinner I ate in my room Im so tired of themthey are the most vile cruel and arbitrary people I know I hate them for making me go through my entire adolescence and now my adulthood with this lump in my chest just because they dont want me to have surgery They have no idea how much Ive suffered or how much I wish with all my heart to die I wish I could just wake up one day and no longer exist in this horrible world I hate the parents I got and I hate my sister for being the favorite If I could Id take a gun and blow my brains out so I wouldnt have to endure this anymorebut I will make them pay As soon as I get a job Ill leave this place and never speak to them again When theyre old Ill put them in a nursing homeand Im being generous I should let them rot in their own filth Ill update if theres any news,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 05:01:13 UTC,25,1,0.87,,,0,0

1j3ahkl,Being a teacher makes me hate everything,Im a teacherlibrarian at an elementary school in my tenth year and it has become increasingly apparent that this is not the job for me Despite not wanting to be another statistic in the world of education I need to get out before I completely lose it Reading and libraries used to be my life I would spend countless hours reading books and browsing through the stacks in libraries Whenever I traveled my first stop was always the library Growing up no one ever doubted that Id become a librarian Life took some twists and turns along the way but I finally finally made it back to the libraries I love Now I fucking HATE IT Along with anything else that used to give me joy in life I used to love to go hiking shopping working out just be out and about for no reason at all but now all I do is crawl into bed and sleep until the next morning And calling it sleep is very generous Running on about four hours of sleep has become standard and dont think that the lack of sleep contributing to my overall feelings about life has gone over my head Problem is that nightmares about going back to work wake me up and fretting over the students for several hours after makes sleep a luxury for me Im sick of spending the majority of my day managing behaviors Im sick of trying to find engaging lessons for the students to absolutely not be able to handle it Im sick of the constant NOISE the SCREAMING and the VIOLENCE Why is violence the first thing these kids turn to Im sick of these kids leaving the library and the books in pieces acting as though they havent had me since kindergarten and know how the library is supposed to be kept Im sick of the students acting like its their first goddamn day on Earth Im sick of hearing the phrase Im sorry and just watching them do it again five minutes later I told one girl that her apology had less meaning than a pigs fart and I dont even feel bad saying that Im sick of their entitlement and how they think they deserve to take every piece of me without giving a modicum of respect in return Im sick of getting excited and emotional over a book I bought the students thinking that theyll like it just for them to roll their eyes Its like these kids have only two settings mean little bastards or asleep I used to be a creative I used to spend my free time drawing painting knitting and writing Boy how I loved to write I looked at some old Google docs of my stories and I miss that girl the one who could spin worlds out of nothing and create endearing and courageous characters But that girl is dead I couldnt write even if you pointed a gun to my head These goddamn energy sucking vampires disguised as children left me bereft of any emotion willpower or desire to do anything I cant even distract myself in the company of other people The single life has plagued me for over two years and I want to get into dating but Im such a miserable person that I dont think its fair to subject someone to the unpleasant experience of being in my presence I barely want to be in my own company The only other people I occasionally hang out with are other teachers so our primary form of entertainment is drinking and trauma dumping I dont even like reading anymore Reading For a librarian I pick up a book and it reminds me of school a straight up hell and thats enough to turn me off The thought of having to do this for another twenty years drives me to despair Can you believe I used to win teaching awards I used to be a good teacher I dont know where I went wrong Like the only thing that is keeping me here is my dog and shes 13 years old But with a lot of spunk Once shes gone I wont know what to do with myself So like I dont know what my aim is with this The jobs here are pay a fucking joke and I already feel like a failure enough that losing my house will definitely send me over the edge So here I am day after day spending the better part of my life with people I hate,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 13:14:19 UTC,16,16,0.91,,,0,0

the ends of the earth for them once he had to deliver something car oil at 6AM for his sister n her husband 6AM Mf usually wakes up at 2pm ffs 4 he has this obsession w fixing up old cars he would spend loads of money on it and w literally his blood sweat tears and his time Yo i dont mind mf got a hobby i got a hobby too thats great for him but wht abt when i need to shower Do i have to go outside to ask you to watch over our son again with your ugly smug face again to sum up he has 2 obsession league of legends and his car None of which you can bother him at all My hobby is just gym

1j7547j,I feel like Im stuck in a relationship and dont know what to do,I 25F have been in a longdistance relationship with this guy 23M for the past 15 years He was really sweet and caring in the beginning and I talked to him for a considerable amount of time before starting a relationship with him Its just that I think his behavior has changed compared to how it was during the talking stage and the first few months of the relationship He says hes a faultfinder and that its just a part of his personality In the beginning he only used to praise my appearance but over time he started commenting on my facial features nose forehead etc and many other things Ive had a bad case of acne throughout my adolescence due to sensitive skin and genetic factors so it couldnt be cured completely While I dont have cystic acne all over my face anymore I still occasionally get breakouts The skin on my body also gets inflamed easily after waxing Earlier he never said anything about itin fact he used to love and support me despite all of this But eventually he started telling me to use certain products to improve my skin Ive told him multiple times that this isnt how things work since Ive undergone treatment for most of my life but he gets irritated and says I dont even want to try and that I lose hope too easily Similarly he made comments on my facial features and said I need to get plastic surgery When I got upset he claimed it was just a joke I have a very chirpy bubbly personality and get excited easily We recently went to a concert and everything was fine until we were walking back As we were side by side with his arm around my neck we reached a narrow space where only one of us could pass at a time I was focused on our conversation so I stood there for a second or two before moving He got annoyed removed his arm grabbed me from behind and pushed me through the space After that he started scolding me for being too dumb to stand there and not move immediately which I dont think is even a reason to fight For the next hour he kept verbally abusing me asking if I was really dumb or just pretending to be around him He even mocked my excitable personality saying I get too excited to see him and then start acting dumb He also said I dont deserve anything he does for me including the concert which was my birthday present from him He kept going on and on while we walked back for an entire hour My head hung low and I was holding back tears the entire time When I had to catch the train to return home he held my backpack tightly from behind and forced me to jump onto the moving train even though I was scared and there was a huge risk involved in doing something like this I mean anything could have gone wrong We had gotten late and almost missed it Just two weeks ago he faked breaking up with me to teach me a lesson because he thought that was the only way I would understand He said he had fought with me multiple times over a single issue and since I didnt seem to get it he had to do this At first I thought he was just angry and didnt take it seriously But the next day he texted me dryly and told me it was final I was heartbroken and broke down in tears desperately trying to reach out to him That afternoon I videocalled him while crying hysterically begging him to come back He laughed in my face and told me not to cry that everything would be fine in two to three months and that I should just leave him He was completely unemotional and unnecessarily cold Each word hit me hard and I kept wondering where all his love had gone He knows Ive had traumatic experiences in my past relationships yet he took advantage of my biggest emotional vulnerability He knows I get anxious overthink everything and become inconsolable Despite that he played on my emotions The very next day he went on a fiveday trip with his friends which they had been planning since the previous week He barely responded to my texts or calls while I was a crying mess unable to eat sleep or work properly When he came back I decided to talk to him one last time because I was so hurt that I had finally made up my mind to end things But when I called him he acted as if nothing had happened I lashed out and told him everything he had done wrong and how I felt all those days After listening he finally realized how horribly he had treated me and admitted that he thought we would reconcile He had only pretended to break up with me so I would realize my mistake It was never real He thought wed just talk and sort it out I wasnt in the right headspace but I still gave him another chance There are other things that bother me and Ive told him a million times to work on them I always get excited for the weekends because were busy all week and I look forward to spending time together I usually plan for us to watch a movie and he always promises to be there at a certain time But then he keeps postponing because his roommates drag him along saying he cant stop them He keeps pushing it forward until its too late and I end up waiting At the end of the night I just say I understand and go to sleep He apologizes promises it wont happen again and then does it again the next weekend After the breakup drama we discussed this and he promised to change But that very day he did it again And then again this weekend He has also told me multiple times that if I dont start making good money and move in with him soon he might get attracted to someone else and leave me He constantly tries to make me jealous by talking about other girls even saying he doesnt want to waste the best years of his life in a longdistance relationship and wants to hook up with other girls Later he claims hes just joking and doing it to motivate me to work harder earn well and move in with him On the other hand Ive never belittled him or made negative comments about his appearance or insecurities He has acne scars and body dysmorphia but Ive always loved him as he is making sure he feels comfortable in his own skin I tell him hes the most perfect guy for me and that he doesnt need to change anything to feel good or deserving But he constantly criticizes me mocks me when I express my struggles and calls me weak whenever I try to talk about things that hurt me He says he doesnt like weak people who crib all the time which makes me feel like I cant even discuss my problems with him If I do he gets annoyed fights with me and tells me Im playing the victim instead of being strong Honestly Im just really confused I love him and dont want to leave but I dont know if hes good for me PS The mistake he wanted me to realize was that he thinks I need to develop new skills to switch to a better job My current job is hectic and lowpaying but I have to work hard throughout the week With my parents declining health I cant study every weekend Sometimes I slack off because Im overwhelmed and need to cool off He tells me I need to hurry up and when I explain my situation he fights with me mocks me and says Ill never earn well or do anything in life because Im not trying hard enough Edit Additionally he has told me multiple times that other peoples opinions of him matter a lot He wants to be likable to everyone He said he used to get a lot of attention before developing acne but things changed after that which is why he constantly seeks validation from others He gets upset when girls in general dont give him attention Whenever I ask why he seeks attention from other girls when Ive always appreciated and motivated him he simply says its because Im his girlfriend so my words dont count He also gets noticeably excited and happy whenever he finds out that a girl is interested in him as it satisfies his need for validation Ive always brushed it off but idk if its a concern or not,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 10:46:43 UTC,1,3,1.0,,,0,0

1j6rl5a,I dont know what to do And I need advice,I 27 father of three lives alone with my three children Thanksgiving month of last year the mother and I got into a heated argument which led to a back and forth physically the most I did was push her to get some space to walk away because I truly dont believe in hitting women unless its life or death Before that even happened two days prior to this she was already putting her hands on me which led to a big bruise on my back And a long scar going from my neck down to my back Once I pushed her away from me she instantly called the cops and said I was the one being belligerent and she wanted me removed from the house The police arrive and she Yes she showed them the camera footage of what had been going on and ofc she was deemed the main aggressor and was taken to jail Once she got out apparently she has a court order to stay off of the property and to have no contact with me Her name is still on the lease so she helps out by paying her half of the rent and once a week will ask if the kids need anything she has a friend that reaches out for her She currently has no where to live but she stays with a friend and still has her job as a nurse and is in school during the day She gave me the option of getting a hotel room to get the kids because its going on four months since she has seen or talked to any of them I thought the hotel option was a good idea and I even offered to pay for half the expenses But it never happens because she either to busy with school and work I would like too take her to court so she can at least help me by getting them and keeping them for a week I have managed to do what I can with childcare and anything else the kids need so I can work my self and I have managed to do this alone What do I need to do to get her to court so we can have our time with the kids individually I understand she is in a situation but I shouldnt have to suffer because of it I hope this doesnt sound bitter on my end but we are not together anymore so she is going to have to start riding her storms out alone now Im not complaining about taking care of my kids because I love them dearly and I dont find anything manly about complaining about something you helped bring into this world but I need a break some times and Im only asking for a week,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 21:34:05 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0
1j4q5vg,54 and struggling,Hi I when I was 12 I was playing in an arcade on the slot machines and a guy came up to me and started feeding my machine with cash I went back every week and he paid whilst I played This happended over a period which I cannot remember and then one day he started to stroke my penis Nobody had ever touched me here before so naturally my body reacted and I got erect even though i was scared as hell I continued to go back for six months then one day he took me to a cafe on the pier and bought me dinner Burger chips etc He undid my zip on my trousers and got my cock out and jerked me off and I came my first ever ejaculation I keep blaming myself because I kept going back to get jerked off and fed My mom was single parent and dad moved away I was left alone for hours when she was working I now realise I was groomed and sexually assaulted I still have these feelings of excitement when I remember this first time which then turn immediately to disgust at myself for saying nothing and letting it continue I have had therapy when i was 16 Long story but I was addicted to the machines by now and another guy started doing the same and pay me 40 for the privilege The money just went back on the machines This second guy groomed me so much I ended up going to his flat to see his spectrum computer and he continued there which turned to blowing me and paying me 40 The last time i went he raped me I ran away after and stayed out late and the police were out looking for me I was scared to go home as much bottom was so painful The police found me hiding under the pier and took me home I told them and mum that I had realised I was late home and rather than face the music stayed out as I was scared of getting into trouble So naturally I was in a vicious circle the later it became The accepted it and nothing was said about the assault I dont remember how I dealt with the pain but my brain has blocked some stuff out FF three years and the police turned up at myself home and said I had been exposing my penis to the public I seriously honestly have no recollection of this at all They cautioned me and my mum shouted and screamed when they went asking why until I broke down after she said has someone hurt you She got the police back and I made a statement To this day Ive never been told what happened the guy Whethery they caught him or not but I never had to go to court For years I thought they filed it nfa as I was just a dirty rent boy who deserved what he got I feel let down by the police as I know now that I was a child and it was grooming secual assault and rape I am a gay man and have never been able to take it sorry for the crudeness due to the memory I know its not everything but I know Im a disappointment for not being a real gay man When I have these feelings of not being good enough for anyone or deserving of anything I struggle and want to run away As i am a let down to others for not getting over it Ive been in a relationship for 28nyesrs and my partner he knows everything but I still regularly have these days of being not enoug people pleasing and feeling like everyone would be better without me For some reason I just had my first nightmare in over 35 years and it started with the first day of being touched at 12 and ended with the rape and police I woke up to my disgust with an erection which soon went down when i was awake I feel sick and cant believer my body reacted in this way to a traumatic memory I have felt guilty all these years that the guys who assaulted me made me erect and ejaculate but the therapist said it was just a natural reaction to being touched down there And Ive accepted it wasnt my fault Until now That dream has taken me back over 40 years and to wake up erect makes me wanna kill myself What sick fuck am i Or was it my 12 year old inner person that made meerect I am due at work in a cople of hours and cant face the world I am disgusted with myself again after all the years of counselling and accepting i was a child and they were adults and as such I took no blame whatsoever But this fucking nightmare has moved the goalposts Why the fuck would I wake up sexually excited over something so traumatic The only thing I can think of is yesterday my partner and I and his sister found out their dad my dad in law has secondary cancer and metastatic cancer which is obious a traumatic Could this trigger earlier trauma But the sick feeling of waking up with an erection makes me feel so low i cant tell anyone I wont kill myself dw I am a people pleaser and would never put my friends and family through that I have cptsd as 8 years ago my best mate took his life and I found him So I could never put others through what I have So in not killing myself I am a failure to me twice As I am pleasing others instead of me I just wanna go back to the day before yesterday when I felt a normal person Instead a funked up freak of nature,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06

1j6pyo0,I witnessed domestic violence and didnt do anything about it,I was walking home from school this was the 90s so we were all just walking around freely for miles and passed by the same neighborhoods I always passed There was this one small house on the left side of the road and coming up on it I could hear splitting noises like someone was being hit but I think I couldnt believe it until I actually got close enough There was this guy 20s maybe both of them standing over his wife or girlfriend on the front lawn she was lying down on her side and had her arm stretched out Then as I walked by slowly unable to stop for some reason he started beating and slapping her and grabbing her by the hair and yanking her towards the house He also kicked her multiple times I think he might have called her Alicia But the eerie thing was that she was surprisingly quiet about it not like crazy screaming but just like please stop You would think shed be screaming and crying out for help or something I remember that I was just walking in horror the guy didnt seem to notice me or if he did he didnt care I couldnt stop and I couldnt stop looking at them I think I was trying to figure out what street I was on but I had never thought to memorize the alley way streets so I didnt know The whole scene moved in slow motion but I still remember the entire beating the sounds the sounds of grass scraping the shape of his hands Just broad daylight at 3pm on a weekday front lawn no one else on the street but them and me springtime I ran home in tears and told my mom who just told me not to get involved When I tried to tell her that I think he was going to kill her she asked me what street and address this happened because if we report it Ill have to know all these things I had no idea so again she told me to mind my own business I was 10 or so when this happened and Im in my 30s now I still have the exact same fantasy memory of having gone back in time and instead of walking away and running away from the scene I get in between them and save her somehow If not save but at least make such a fuss that someone calls the cops Its always the same thing that I dont care if I get hurt in the process I would have done the brave thing Instead of what I actually did just run away in literal horror I feel so haunted by this scene I dont think Ill ever forget it for the rest of my life honestly,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 20:19:25 UTC,9,10,0.85,,CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCEDEATH,0,0
1j7cxzj,I was dumped yesterday but I had been thinking about the breakup for a year it hurts so much,I 25F was in a relationship 25M for almost 2 years It started off very very well very dreamy and romantic where I told my friends that I had found the guy I had been looking for all this while etc etc 2 months after our first date i lost my job and i realised how emotionally unavailable he was because all he cared about was his job and his work stress he didnt know how to empathise with me or support me or help me out for context the city we live and work in is his hometown but i thought probably my expectations are a bit much because we are so early in the relationship But i have known since aug 2023 that this isnt right for me I am going to bulletise the problems spending time despite living in the same city he only saw me once a week frisat which i initially found weird but adjusted around it However because he is an insane workaholic we didnt do anything special just stayed in There were no date nights When we went out on date nights i planned all of them i initiated them and i convinced him I wanted to spend more time with him see him more but that he told was not possible because it messes with his routines A lot of his habits and ideas of how we should be were straight up selfish inconsiderate and disreputable tbh A twisted definition of ambition different definitions of meaning of life He has a well paying reputable steady job but he wants to start his own thing so that he is doing something meaningful in life What that means for us is insane working hours no downtime no quality time no matter how much i tried to adjust When breaking up he said the kind of relationship i want works for people who have job stability and dont want to do much outside of that and i disagree so much All i wanted was someone to spend my weekends with have that quality time Isnt that the bare minimum Also if he cant do this how will he ever be in a relationship For me i am super ambitious and have built a career in a foreign country from the ground up but for me ambition means being good at job and liking it enough to login every morning to do a good job Meaning of life doesnt come from the job as i work for the paycheck but meaning comes from travel experiences relationships and friendships His routine he was obsessed with his routines Wake up at 6 sleep at 10 gym at 7am work 89 kinda guy Which is ok routines are good but what that meant was he only saw me fridays and called me daily 93010 he didnt call me initially at all and we foughjt a lot to get here Anything outside of that was not possible This didnt emotionally sit right with me because i couldnt trust depend rely on him In fact when we were breaking up he told me he calculated the amount of time he spends with me or talking to me and thats about 12hweek which is not possible for him right now What this translated in my head was i am not worth the 12hweek his spending habits he lives at home with his parents earns a LOT more than me and saves and invests all that he earns to an obsessive degree He has enough to retire rn and i respect that But what that meant for us was he was extremely stingy and calculative We split stuff but he just wasnt happy spending on date nights dinners gifts Heck he even calculated the transport cost from his home to mine He even liked to lecture me about how i should spend money when i already live below my means because i have a loan He also said that he is saving enough for the both of us but that never gave me confidence because i saw that as an attack on my independence i cant live on the money he has earned or saved because it is not mine he will always reinforce that and i will have a lesser of a say in how we spend that money He definitely wanted a prenup if we were to marry which i dont mind but his general attitude towards money and being too calculative wasnt reassuring Basically these were longstanding problems which i identified very early on in the relationship and communicated why i find them problematic However after each time i communicated he gave me something new to cling my hope on to and i hoped things would get better because i genuinely wanted this to work They never got better we kept on arguing until yesterday when he asked the question and i agreed i felt a bit blindsided tbh because he never told me he is thinking about it too I guess there are 2 lessons for me 1 To be in a relationship and live in the present and not with the persons potential and what it could be 2 To not be so obsessed with the idea of relationships and building a life and the feeling of home with someone that i keep putting up with shit Having said all of this the feeling of loss is immense and i still miss him and have been bawling my eyes out when it was me who had been considering breaking up for the past year and i know in my heart he is not the one for me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 17:40:16 UTC,2,0,0.76,,,0,0

1j5wepk,Out of nowhere I met this really gorgeous girl and now Im over here secondguessing everythinglike am I even doing this right,Hey everyone to whoevers reading this story Id love to hear your thoughts on it I guess I should start with a little backstory Around early autumn last year I was walking through one of the neighborhoods in my city It was my last day at work and after finishing up I decided to take a stroll grab something to eat and soak in the last warm sunny days I found a nearby bench sat down popped in my earphones and just listened to music as I made my way to a café At some point I noticed a girl who looked really upset I hesitated for a moment but then decided to go up to her and see if she was okay Turns out shed had a really rough day We ended up walking together exchanging contacts and chatting later on when we had time Our first few meetups were easygoing and fun We talked got to know each other and with every meeting we started growing closer After about a month I started visiting her place after the gym to unwind a little And then at some point things between us started feeling like more than just friendship There was this warmth this physical closeness that Id been missing even though I had plenty of friends I was single at the time Shes absolutely gorgeouslike the kind of girl who turns heads wherever she goes Shes tall about 185 cm has an amazing figure a beautiful face and these deep brown eyes that just pull you in Shes got a great body though thats far from the only thing I like about her Shes also a few years older than me Then about three weeks later after lots of time spent together and some really great conversations I went over to her place again this time bringing flowers to surprise her I rang the doorbell and when she opened the door my jaw literally dropped There she was standing in front of me in red silk shorts and a top looking absolutely breathtaking I just stood there speechless until she pulled me inside wrapped her arms around me and kissed me We headed to the kitchen where she was cooking some meat for dinnersomething she knew I liked even though Id never actually told her That moment just hit differently It was like she knew me better than I knew myself That was when I realizedthis girl had completely stolen my heart Later she even got me a pair of shorts and an Tshirt so Ive have something to wear around her place I changed sat down with her on the couch and we put on some YouTube Before long we were cuddling and yeahthat was when we kissed The whole evening was just perfect And now every day I catch myself wondering am I doing the right thing Because I honestly love spending time with this girl I could really use your advice,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 18:42:58 UTC,4,4,0.83,,,0,0

1j3pwgn,my friend left me and i dont know what to do with myself anymore,my friend left me and i dont want to be here without him i would normally never turn to reddit for help but im here right now i female have been struggling so much lately i large factor of struggling is about this one guy i bet you hear that so much but this is the only time in my life that ive ever ran into a problem like this i guess i can full on lore drop here i met this guy that ill call steve in early 2023 ever since i met him i had this deep connection with him i have serious feelings for him and ive never crushed on somebody before it took me up until october 2024 to tell him about how i actually feel i visited him at his college right before i told him its the main reason why i told him in the first place when i told him he never really told me about why he didnt like me back steve has always been a very private person but i assumed this would be different after i opened up to him i was struggling so badly i eventually told him that i needed to stop talking to him when i told him that which was in november of 2024 he finally told me that he was gay i really dont know why he was keeping that bit of information from me for so long he had talked to me about liking girls before so i just assumed that he couldve been bi because he did kind of give off gay vibes me not talking to him only lasted like a week and a half because i took a gummy and texted him i tried to tell him that i needed to stop again but he just kept on texting me and i felt bad for just not answering him this man has been the light of my life for such a long time it feels texting him was one of my favorite aspects of the day and it was what got me through dark times because it felt like he was there for me fast forward a few weeks he tells me about this guy that he was talking to he told me that he had been talking to this guy for 3 months and that this was the first time he has ever really liked someone back he randomly texted steve saying that he only had platonic feelings for steve and steve got so upset he sent me a voice message of him almost on the verge of tears i told him that i shouldnt be talking to him about this but i did anyways because i loved him i tried my best to help him through the situation i shared what i did when he told me that he didnt like me back and i told him that i would be there for him day and night which he never ever took advantage of even though he said that this was one of the darkest times of his life all was good until last month steve was starting to act really weird towards me he said that hes sorry if he has been weird he was never answering me despite texting me 247 days prior so i confronted him about it he told me that he went on a date with another guy i ended up leaving him on read and he said I was going to send a text to you in the morning but honestly it just feels more right to do one now Im sorry I was slightly inebriated in my last response and thats not fair for you I do just want to let you know I am doing well enough mentally right now Like am I the best lve ever been no but Im definitely very much in a manageable position right now I know whatever I say or do wont stop your anxiety but I want to ensure you that if there was something going on I would let you know You are a very close friend of mine and you are definitely someone I come to when things are not right The reason I initially said I was just busy yesterday and not what I was actually doing was because I didnt want to make you uncomfortable for anything like that But it is for the best for me to be honest with that kind of stuff and lll make sure to keep you in the loop As for the insert boy name here stuff I dont really want to concern you with a lot of it because it honestly does depict me at my worst sometimes I try to handle most of that without mentioning anything because its usually easier and I dont like getting people involved that shouldnt have to be I hope this kinda helps digest a little bit i still left him on delivered because i just couldnt handle the pain he has put me through i texted him almost a week later stating that i am in so much pain and i cant take it anymore every single time that i try to make it clear that im deeply struggling he never seems to care although hes said that he cares for me deeply just last week i had this very depressive episode and he asked me how things were going and i said not well i genuinely think i am the most depressed ive ever been right now i am at my lowest point i can barely eat sleep or focus im just empty i cant even get up and be productive i dont even feel like im living im just existing you wouldve thought that i wouldve been so happy and excited on saturday but i didnt even care about being at insert my favorite place here im starting to lose interest in everything and after i said that he didnt answer as a follow up message i said im taking this radio silence as a strong sign and i dont want to hear some excuse like sorry i forgot to respond or i couldve sworn i responded originally i had a way bitchier intro to this message but thats not me all the times you said that you cared about me i knew they were all lies i knew i shouldve listened to my gut the entire time i really really really wish i wouldnt have responded to that one message in february of 2023 i feel like all of our friendship has been is me constantly doing shit to be such an amazing friend for you but you NEVER returned the favor and im sick and tired of it i made you all those bracelets i made that painting for you i always checked up on you i sent you a heartfelt message on your birthday but did you ever do anything like that for me sorry for doing so much for people and expecting something small back every single one of my friendships ends like this all youve ever done is just constantly lie to me and i bet you think that i just havent noticed cooking dinner till 11pm going home because you have a headache immediately passing out when you go to bed ill try my best to respond to you any of these sound familiar im so tired of how horrible of a person youve been towards me i try my absolute hardest for you ive gotten out of bed eaten kept my grades up tried to take care of myself picked myself up off the ground and smiled just for you maybe im just too generous loyal compassionate empathetic and sympathetic as a person i genuinely dont know why you still talk to me or why i still talk to you ive given our friendship so many second chances but this is my breaking point im so fucking sick and tired of everything i really hope that when i do end up taking my own life that not a single tear falls from either one of your eyes i always wanted to tell you that id make the sky so pretty and orange for you but i dont want to do that anymore notice how i didnt even mention my feelings for him in that message once now that we arent talking i dont know what to do with myself anymore ive grown so attached to this man and i dont know what to do without him he has been my rock ever since we met he was all i had and now i have absolutely nobody ive been lonely my entire life and i would say that it got worse when i started having feelings for him but now that hes gone my loneliness is ten times worse i am seconds away from writing my notes and saying goodbye i am so picky with who i want to be with if they arent aligning with what i want to do in my future i wont be happy with them long term i dont date just for fun i date to marry the reason i grew so attached to steve was because he aligned with my future im so alone and empty with him gone and i feel like it would be a better place if i said my goodbyes i dont want the space if thats what hes giving me i unfollowed him on everything but i havent blocked him i just dont want to keep going if it means that im not friends with him

1j6pk4i,I recently found out my abusive brother might have a baby,My F20 oldest brother OB M31 is an abusive misogynist He genuinely thinks that women his girlfriend his wife his mom doesnt matter should be beaten andor be physically intimidated when he has any even the smallest disagreement He was kicked out of the military for beating his wife he somehow got honorable discharge from what my mom says My mom also has video evidence on OB practically dragging his girlfriends down the stairs in front of her children my brother only went after single moms With that said lets get into the main reason Im scared for this child I recently found out my OB is a child predator and that the reason OB was kicked out at 14 almost 15 wasnt because of no reason It was because my mom walked in on us with our pants down in my closet when I was 4 3 years later OB got my name tattooed on his arm I dont really remember it that well because I had pushed the memory deep down in the back of my mind because I thought it was my fault I remember thinking all I have to do is push it all the way back behind the wall into my subconscious because I heard thats how others got rid of the bad feelings or bad memories I think its because I heard that there was 2 sides of the brain I remember thinking Why didnt I just say no It wasnt until years later OB had moved back into our house when I noticed weird things OB would do like how I mentioned he only goes after single moms or moms who recently left an abusive relationship only for them to leave OB because I never wanted my children to be put back into that situation luckily the Girlfriend he practically dragged down the stairs has a new boyfriend who said Ill make sure he doesnt goes anywhere near my family again I would notice things like how OB treated me like OB would his girlfriends or how OB would stare at my chest or at me in a weird way like a dog would a squirrel or almost like how they describe jaws eyes but I thought I was just being crazy Then OB offered my underaged friend alcohol if she got into his car and went on a drive with OB to nowhere is particular After a couple of years OB was kicked out again for trying to beat my dad for telling OB to stop yelling at my mom about how OB crashed his car while drunk and the entire time the way OB was talking to her it sounded like he was trying to blame her or the mechanic who fixed his car my mom said the next day OB went back to the mechanic and yelled at him then OB got upset that the best mechanic who worked there wouldnt fix his car and told him to go somewhere else And then as soon as she raised her voice above him to get him to stop screaming and yelling he immediately started the crocodile tears The story OB told us was actually ridiculous OB apparently hit a boulder in the middle of the road and swerved off the road into a ditch My parents visited the crash site of where the supposed boulder was and all they found were swerve marks to a ditch As for the road it looked completely fine for a road that had a boulder land on it a couple hour prior we live in a part of America where the roads dont get that much maintenance and when we do its noticeable and definitely lasts longer than a day After a little while the whole p diddy thing came out and something about it made me snap and I kept thinking about predators and how they are disgusting creatures At the time I had recently bought some shrooms bars from a local store The more I thought of the p diddy situation the more the memories of my own molestation started coming back I started getting angry a lot and eventually I told my mom She said that when she found us she didnt think anything had happened yet and that OB was just about to do something I asked her why she didnt call the police because OB would have still attempted to molested a 4 year old child She said it was because of my dads crazy exwife Sometimes I wish I could go back in time and stop it I was littarly just playing with my toys before OB came home from school and immediately ran to me like I was present under a christmas tree I still remember the conversation we had OB he said something along the lines of we should take off our pants or something about a game I wasnt really paying attention when he initially walked in because I was focused on my toys Me But why OB Because I want to show you something Me starts to take off pants OB If you kiss mine Ill kiss yours Me senses something is off and starting to get scared but why I dont want to OB its not scary see does what you think he said he would I genuinely feel sick thinking about it Then I geuss he heard my mom or he had locked the door OB You need to get your pants on shes not supposed to see us Then my mom walked in and stopped when she ws my still trying to button and zip up my pants Mom what whatthe Fuck then she started yelling at OB WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU DOING TO HER then she grabbed him and pulled him out of the room I dont really remember much after that but I do remember the couple of times I would think about it and get a disgusting feeling or like shame before I had successfully pushed it down Now I dont know what to do its not exactly like I can go to the police and get justice when it was a long time ago and there is no actual proof the court would listen to My family has cut him off though which is good because I was scared of what OB would do if OB moved in with my nana and papa theyre 80 and my aunts have mobility problems the only person who would be able to defend them is my uncle who isnt exactly the athletic type and is much older than OB Edit I fixed the spelling and grammar mistakes,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 20:00:55 UTC,6,2,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0
1j87aar,I wish my brother could see his girlfriend isnt the best,At first I thought his girlfriend was really cool and stuff but then the more I got to know her the more I had this gut feeling that she wasnt a good persongood fit for my brother and its making me not like her She has a lot of other guy friends which I dont think is a bad thing cause I too have guy fiends and i love them as friends obviously but the way she acts with a couple of them makes me just go oh For example One time she had to whisper something to one of her guy friends and instead of being a normal person while whispering she had to lay her head on his shoulder and whisper which is just ew Then shes still good friends with a guy she had been extremely close to dating and they both really really liked each other but never started dating She even asked my brother if this guy could go to prom with her which my brother quickly shut down And then finally she keeps making me switch seats with this one guy whos our friend because in her words She never gets to see him but when I suggest things like facetiming him texting him more calling him more she always goes but i see you alllll the time unlike him which is such a weird excuse i feel like She sleeps over with my brother a lot but the only time i really see her is when i go into my brothers part of the house She also doesnt really interact me once I switch seats with the guy which really makes me upset because Im still her friend I just feel like shes not that good of a person and my brother needs to see the way she acts with these guys and how he should probably start setting some boundaries,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 19:36:18 UTC,0,1,0.5,,,0,0

1j3puzv,ChatGPT suggested I might have autism Told my friends they were surprised that I wasnt already diagnosed with autism,OK so this is kind of a clusterfuck and I need to get it all out there so here goes For the past probably over a year at this point Ive been chatting to ChatGPT every now and then at least once a week Ive been kinda treating it as like a diary that talks back I dont input too much personal info or anything like that but if Im worried or stressed about something that I dont wanna burden the people in my life with or if I have something Im thinking about and am interested to see how an AI might respond to it then Ill just open ChatGPT and vent Every now and then Ill get a Memory Updated notification where its randomly decided something Ive said is worth remembering for future conversations and over the past year this has built up a fair amount especially about likes dislikes fears and that kinda thing Its an interesting feature and it sometimes makes conversations more relevant or stops me having to go over old things and so I mostly just leave it as it is Recently I saw a trend where people were asking ChatGPT to suggest something that the user doesnt know about themselves based on everything in ChatGPTs memory about them From what Ive seen it tries to be insightful sometimes it is quite helpful other times it is kinda brutal but overall its usually pretty interesting in one way or another and so I decided to give it a try I asked it based on everything its learned about me over the course of our conversations what is something that it thinks I might not know about myself that might be beneficial for me to know As you can tell from the title of this post its response was that I should probably get tested for autism I wasnt really sure how to respond to that I dont really know what I was expecting but it was definitely a lot more targeted and specific than the posts Id seen of other people asking ChatGPT similar questions I asked it to clarify and it brought up things that it had noted about being kind of picky about what I consume stuff about regretsworries related to normal social situations fixations on random things and a few other things that it said was indicative of autism It also reminded me that it wasnt a medical professional which I thought was a very interesting thing to include after suggesting that I might have autism Anyway I kinda put it to the back of my mind and then later that evening I joined a voice chat with a few of my online friends that I play online games with and after a while I kinda brought up with them what ChatGPT had said Their initial reaction was to laugh which I thought meant that they thought what the AI had said was wrong but then they said words to the effect of With how much you talk to ChatGPT Im surprised you hadnt already told it that youre autistic I then said that I wasnt autistic by which I meant I didnt have a formal diagnosis of autism and until this point didnt really consider myself to be autistic and things got kinda awkward Anyway I just took the AQ50 and got a score of 36 which came with the message Scores in the 3350 range indicate significant Autistic traits Autism so I guess theres a fair chance that Im autistic and that somehow Im the last person to know about it I dunno how Im supposed to feel about this or what Im mean to do with this information Im a guy and in my early 30s so it feels kinda late to get a diagnosis with something like this and even if I did get a diagnosis I dont know what it would change for me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 00:12:03 UTC,0,9,0.4,,,0,0

1j4d2y1,I went to a fancy beach resturant soaking wet alone for my birthday a couple weeks ago,Yup you read the title So my birthday was a little while ago it was my 20th and honestly I was pretty damn depressed for it Didnt have a lot of friends to celebrate with and was basically alone and it feltstill feels really weird not being a kid anymore I decided to treat myself to a beach day both to go romp around and also cause I needed some driftwood for an aquarium I was setting up I have no car though so had to take the bus to get up which had a very inconvenient schedule So I got to the beach found some sticks and got so distracted that I unfortunately missed the bus pick up Now there was another bus coming in a couple hours and I could always call a ride too if needed So I decided that now that I was here for at least a couple hours I might as well do some more exploring This particular beach stretched for 3 miles north up to another beach where on the other side there was a small resturant I was pretty hungry at this point so thought itd be fun to walk up there and catch bus later that evening at that spot instead So I cruised up the beach and got some really great views of the clouds and sinking sun along the way I eventually got to the cutoff to where the other beach started however while the map only portrayed a small stream separating them by now the ride had come in and that tiny stream was basically a river After scouring the area for a bridge or easier way across I stupidly chose to wade through a shallower point which worked and I made it to the other side of the beach soggy but triumphant I had no change of clothes in my pack So after drying off a tiny bit I walked up to the resturant and when I got inside I realized this wasnt just some little beach shack it was a full on fancy ass resturant My belly was roaring though so I decided to give it a try I asked for outdoor seating for obvious reasons and was really surprised to see them setting the table with fancy cloths and a bunch of different forks and silverware and shit I ordered crabcakes and some jumbo shrimp which were the cheapest things there but combined still cost a whopping 70 They eventually bring out two tiny barely palm sized pencilthin crab patties and 5 individual finger length shrimp both elaborately decorated in the middle of these giant white plates For the cost of it all I was half convinced Id be able to keep the plates too I kept getting odd looks from the other diners who were almost all either in pairs or groups I was the only lone person there Not to mention still pretty soggy dressed like a casual vagabond and with my backpack as my only companion in the opposite chair Yeah I stuck out like a giddamned giraffe in a horse ranch Eventually I finished up and caught the bus back home where I promptly went to sleep Happy 20th birthday bud theres 70 bucks you aint getting back and an experience youll cherish for all the wrong reasons,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 20:30:14 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j6wish,Im done holding on to the scraps of relationship my father and I have left,Very long and emotional story short or as short as I can get it gt013 I grew up a daddys girl I love my father with my whole heart and cherish his presence I am inherently anxious and suffer from undiagnosed AUDHD anxiety disorder and depression but it doesnt affect me as much because my family is loving and kind gt gt13 My mother and I caught my father cheating on her He told us he stopped and that he was sorry gt gt1315 I didnt talk to my father directly as I felt betrayed and hurt This was made worse when my mother kept trying to stand up for him I later learnt she was trying to stop the mistress from contacting my father so that she and him could work on their relationship gt14 My mother is diagnosed with cancer but they cant tell what kind or how far along it is My father grows even more distant from us and the arguments increase gt1516 My mother is hospitalized and my father starts talking to this woman on his phone I start to feel more anxious My mother advocates for my father but it just makes me more mad and hurt They argue more now and I find myself becoming emotionally distant from my father gtLate 16 My mother dies and I shut down as well as shut myself off from my family friends and peers I am angry at my father as he does not seem as affected and was also the cause of my mothers stress before she died My older brother tries to soothe me and we traumabond My father tries to relate to me as his mother died a few months before mine but he doesnt understand that it isnt the same gtMy father dates moves in and then marries a woman I have never met in less than 8 months His friends my trusted adults all support him as well as his family and peers I am hurt but I pass it off as him just grieving differently I was sure it was a phase and that they would break updivorce soon enough I later find out its the same woman he cheated on my mother with lied to us about and then continued to talk to while my mother was battling cancer I confront him about this and he says that he thought I knew who she was despite us never being formally introduced to her To this day I know next to nothing about her Only her first name where her mother lives and the name of one of her children gtFathers wife is emotionally and verbally abusive towards me and my brother but I being the younger and more emotional one take it harder gtShe tells me that Im killing my father by arguing with him and that he will end up dead just like my mother I yell back at her to defend my father as I take it very seriously when someone wishes death upon another even indirectly but my father takes her side and berates me for defending him gtHe does a myriad of other things threatening to sell off my cats locking them outside and causing one to die from the cold as punishment for me not agreeing with him as well as pretending not to hear when his wife flat out threatens to kill me He was right next to her when she said it mind you gtUnder the advice of my older cousin from my moms side I report the wife to the CPS but he denies hearing her threaten me to the social workers which makes me look like an emotional teenage girl We get placed into family therapy but the therapist is borderline sexist and just wants us to be a family unit regardless of the womans blatant disregard for my safety gtI ask my father why hes choosing his wifes needs over the safety of his biological children whom he claims to adore and he simply says that the Bible says wife before children Id argue that doesnt apply to wife that you cheated on your childrens mother with and who threatens you children but okay dad gtI sleep with a knife under my pillow just in case she tries to harm me My anxiety and depression levels are through the roof gt17 19 I cant remember much from these years but it mostly involves me trying to bond with my father as hes the last living parent I have I go through 3 relationships and have no one to talk to or seek comfort from when it goes downhill My father thinks were getting better because of him and not because of the gigantic effort and emotional stuffingdown Im doing as even being near his wife makes me anxious to the point of insomnia As angry as I was before I still love my father and want him in my life I tell him that he can pick any other wife just not her and I would be genuinely happy with that He doesnt care and only treats me well when shes not there away on vacation or at her mothers house When she is around though he is more distant and visibly more tense gt20 My father announced that he wants to split our house physically half of it is to go to me and my brother as it was built when my mother was alive and she paid for and designed it I tell him that I dont want him to do it as it will just drive us further apart but his reasoning revolves around his wife and her comfort My brother and I have long assumed that his wife is just with him to benefit from his money she doesnt treat him nicely but he doesnt seem to notice I know its childish and naïve but I didnt want him to distance himself from me even though he has hurt me so much for so long I still cry Ive actually just stopped crying as Im typing this whenever I think about how far weve already drifted apart Our relationship went from one of trust smiles secret fastfood lunch breaks and long hugs to me not even being able to tell him about the girl that broke my heart and how I would love to have one genuine dadhug from him so that he can tell me its alright I would love to have him at my wedding one day but I dont know if that will ever happen I dont want to grow up not in a world where he dies alone and regretful but it seems that thats the only way for me to not end up living my entire life clinging to his leg begging him to look back and maybe love me the way he used to So Im done Im done wanting his love and Im done waiting on him to realise he was wrong and that I still needed him Im going to be something and Im going to love someone and let them love me in return I deserve better TLDR My father has hurt me with his actions and his words for too long Im going to learn how to live without him no matter how much it will hurt to let him go,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 01:33:45 UTC,35,5,0.95,,CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCEDEATH,0,0
1j5l09y,15 Years in CanadaNow Im Jobless Broke amp Out of Options,After spending 15 years building a life here I never imagined I would end up with nothing forced to start over from zero again I have updated this post to clarify a few things based on feedback I take full responsibility for my situation I made many mistakes along the way whether it was not staying on top of deadlines assuming I had more time than I did or not making the best choices I have struggled with severe ADHD my entire life and since I choose to manage it without medication I often leave things until the last minute That habit has hurt me in more ways than I can count and this situation is no exception At the same time the immigration system has changed significantly over the years making it much harder for someone in my position to qualify In the end it was a mix of bad timing personal missteps and an immigration system that has only grown tougher for people like me I moved to Canada as an international student a little over 15 years ago I started from nothing learning English from scratch completing my academic English education and then going to university and college I worked multiple jobs as a developer while paying my taxes and contributing to the country I wanted to call home Despite all that I lost everything when my work permit expired a few months ago I did not qualify for enough points under the everchanging immigration system so as soon as my permit expired my job was gone Because my work permit expired I was not eligible for unemployment benefits had no options just the expectation to pack up and leave like I never existed The worst part is that this is not just about money or survival I genuinely loved my job I had amazing coworkers a great team and what I believed to be the perfect job in the perfect country I was lucky enough to have made meaningful contributions and had so much more to offer as a 32yearold with a bright future ahead of me That is why I have so many regrets about how things turned out and I know they will stay with me for a lifetime I would give anything to go back and keep doing what I love But because I wanted to do things the right way legally and honorably there just do not seem to be any options left Losing my job did not just mean losing income It meant losing my ability to stay afloat in the country I call home Even when I had a good income I was living paycheck to paycheck covering expenses for two people A large portion of my money went toward taxes rent and paying off debts that piled up after I lost my previous job during the pandemic Now with no work permit not even underthetable cash jobs would be enough to cover my expenses and those would not be legal for me anyway Over the years Canadas immigration system has become increasingly strict The requirements kept changing the point thresholds kept rising and options like employerspecific work permits which could have been a lifeline for people like me were removed in Ontario By the time I finally became eligible or was just about to things had already shifted again I know people who moved to other provinces because obtaining permanent residency was easier there but even that became riskier when some pathways suddenly disappeared Going back to Turkey is not just about starting over It is a nightmare waiting to happen My brother and I are both considered army escapees which means we would be forced into mandatory military service soon after arriving The Turkish army is notorious for its brutal conditions As ethical vegans and atheists we would be in an impossible position The army does not accommodate veganism and being openly atheist is frowned upon both socially and institutionally I know our time there would be unbearable in every way The system does not account for people like me those who have given everything to this country only to be left with no way to stay Is this how the system treats people who dedicate their youth education and labor to this country I do not want to sound ungrateful I have always loved this country and I still do I love its people and I consider Toronto my real home Leaving would feel like losing a part of myself forever But after all these years not having a viable pathway to stay just does not feel fair to me After more than two days without sleep with stress piling up and rent due while I have no income my mind is all over the place while writing this I also recorded myself talking about all of this for about half an hour right before writing this crying the whole time It felt like therapy in a way just letting it all out Now writing this feels like another form of that release I do not know what comes next but I needed to get this off my chest If nothing else I hope sharing my story highlights how the system fails people who follow all the rules and still end up with nothing I truly hope it will somehow help future people like me Thank you for reading I truly appreciate anyone

1j7fdqt,My exgirlfriend gaslit me while relationship while cheating on me found out on my birthday,My m24 now exf26 girlfriend started dating in March last year I had just come out of a toxic situationship where I take part blame I was a bad communicator Im sure I still am but I gained some communication skills I really liked her found my now ex 3 weeks later I knew it would be a rebound but it helped so much Especially considering this girl had been my crush since 8 years ago when I had first started working with her We had so much fun early on trips going out eating out It started to feel less like a rebound and something of a real relationship Unfortunately it came to her moving out of her moms house She needed a place to go and me with my somewhat trust issues was scared to let her move in with her friends which were one girl and two guys She had been known to get around but I trusted her more than most people did and had hope She was very kind had many mental issues but nothing I couldnt stand I had grown up with childhood trauma and this seemed like nothing So me with my trust issues and wanting to move out of my moms house as well took her offer of renting a place together It seemed fun and I had just started a career job so it seemed like a good time Found out very quickly it would not be See my ex well call Fiona had severe insecurities and drinking issues not to mention drug addiction I had known to some extent but not to this severity The first week we moved in I wanted to have a get together party for our first place together Turns out Fiona hates having people in her space She was very quiet the whole night and near the end she stormed off to the room where Id get yelled at when I head to bed She scream at me in bed as I had work the next morning I told her sorry and wed talk about it tomorrow She got up and stormed out the room I was just happy for the quiet until I hear her screaming my name and yelling help Help I storm out seeing her wrist covered in blood with it spilling all over the floors I help her best I can she didnt hit an artery so it soon stopped but left a nasty scar After this night most nights especially when we went out I would get no rest being accused of cheating or just not giving her enough love Over the next few months one of our mutual friends decided a surprise birthday party for her I honestly wasnt thinking to hard about it I just thought maybe itd make her happy forgetting she didnt like people in her space Same thing happened She was upset the whole night stayed in the bedrooms and never came out Through out the night you could hear her screams saying get out of my house In the most embarrassing way possible Her sister was there and tried to calm her down the whole night which did not work I eventually got everyone out because the music was barely covering it up I went to bed again Same thing yelling at me She got up stormed out I was worried but thought that it was a one time thing Nope I instantly hear my name being screamed This time much worse I come out to see the cut is even deeper attempt to stop the bleeding but it just wont I call 911 while making a makeshift tourniquet to try and stop it The paramedics get her after the police which was someone I knew I told them about how she was saying before that she wanted to die I didnt think this was an attempt but a callout I took her to the hospital after the medics said she didnt need the ambulance after patching her up Stayed up all night at the hospital dropped her off at home then went to work I was miserable I couldnt stand this anymore I didnt want to break the lease but at the same time I also still cared for this girl I felt bad I needed a way out that night was my chance but you just couldnt leave her alone she cried and begged me So we continued our relationship A few months later same thing yelling at me and saying I dont give her enough affirmations and accusing me of deleting snapchats and sneaking people in when shes off at work Which led to a night that she destroyed my tv in the living room put holes in the walls and screamed at me in my face I was done I left to stay at my friends house Told her to leave wed figure out the situation after The day after she said she needed time to move and wanted to talk I went over and we talked the whole night She promised shed get therapy and help And I felt so terrible I truly loved this girl but it was such a toxic relationship I gave her one last chance We decided to stick together agreeing to talk things out more See I still have my trust issues and being accused of things makes me curious why its that in particular I memorized her password months ago but never really felt the need to look through her phone I had it just in case But I was working one night straight shift She went out with her friends Acted very strange to me and I just felt something was off I come home at 7am find her dead asleep Couldnt even wake her up to give her a kiss She had left her phone on my side of the bed I felt the urge to look through it Went through it for hours Finding hidden messages in messenger of her taking to her ex saying how she thinks about him everyday and that she needs him Other messages to her OTHER ex on Snapchat came across it by chance because it had been cleared and muted It was of last night being very flirty and him leaving hearts and her pictures with her hearting back Her saying I miss you and then a phone call about 6 minutes lasting I called this number I asked him to be straight up if shes cheating He sounded dumbfounded but said she wasnt and that they were just friends that use to date But I found pictures dating only right before we started dating that they were kissing and all over eachother I woke her up absolutely heated Ngl this was probably the angriest Ive ever been I told her what I had seen She of course denied it Eventually admitting that it was cheating but they never had sex Which I absolutely think is a lie But I said it was over and she took it so easily She nodded and called her mom got her stuff in the car then laughing about a joke she made saying shes tired of constantly moving All while I sit and wait for her to leave Also if I didnt mention this happened ALL ON MY BIRTHDAY She leaves not answering any of my questions like why how could you do this Since then Ive been sitting here she still left a few things and needs a truck to come pick them up She just texted me that shes coming today to pick them up I still feel like shit but can hold my emotions

1j3f9ue,Coparent cant decide when he feels like parenting until the last minute,My coparent receives a two week work schedule every other Friday Weve been broken up for over a year and he is still unable to tell me his pickup schedule more than a few hours or a day in advance Ive asked multiple times if we can make a schedule but he always has a lame excuse I usually ask sometime between Sunday and Tuesday he rarely offers to tell me without being prompted Ive retained a lawyer to work out an agreement but in the meantime this is very annoying and negatively impacts my ability to workplan ahead Today Tuesday I asked for his schedule and he responded the usual which is meaningless as it changes Ive asked 3 separate ways today I am always polite and solution oriented when communicating I offered that we could use the schedule on the coparenting app to make things easier Hes read my messages and not responded Ive always let him have whatever days he wants and Ive only once asked to switch pickup days Our child loves him and I want to support their relationship so Im very lenient I dont want to harass him with multiple messages but I really need advice on how to get this information out of him I am so frustrated Every week he takes days to decide when he wants to parent and I want him to have access to our child so I stall my own plans to support his,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 16:50:29 UTC,3,7,0.81,,,0,0
1j577p6,I waited for more than 20 years for this result and I am not happy,English is not my first language Format from mobile All my life I felt like I was weird I felt like I forgot things that I couldnt empathize with people my imagination was strong when I was a child and thats why I felt like no one could understand me Im currently 30 and after so much time I received the test that finally removed my doubts about what condition I had I would believe that I had some kind of autism because of my behavior but what I discovered left me devastated and I dont feel like I can talk to my family about it I have mild cognitive impairment and although there are guarantees that I can continue with my life the truth is that with the pace of life I lead it feels very difficult I dont have the family support that I would like and at this moment if I tell them my condition they will use it to criticize me instead of supporting me I feel like a failure for not being able to do what others could what I expected was some guidance and now the only thing I hope is that I dont develop Alzheimers or Dementia and lose the memories or what I once was I simply feel that I lost something and although for many it is insignificant for me it was One of the hardest news I have ever received in my life,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 21:52:31 UTC,3,0,0.81,,,0,0
1j7qybi,My husband cheated on me and I decided to stay But now I just want another man to notice me,I understand I am a bad person I know that I am no better than my husband but I just cannot handle the lack of validation and love anymore I 23F got married last summer to my husband 25M who proposed to me after two years together A month later I found out hed been sexting girls on an anonymous website He had a whole separate email set up for these accounts he had There were hundreds of messages He cried claimed it was an addiction he was struggling with since he was young I was devastated I had never felt so much pain before in my life I still have flashbacks to that day dryheaving and sobbing after finding out the love of my life was off fantasizing about fucking moms and older women while avoiding having sex with me I always considered him the exception to men a devoted man who could never hurt me He swore hed never hurt me He knew I had family trauma related to cheating my dad cheated on my mom my entire upbringing and yet he still made that decision I made the decision to stay I think because of shame I really did think there was something wrong with me to have caused him to turn his back on me But also we come from a very religious very cultural community It isnt easy being divorced But I havent been the same since Its been almost eight months and although Ive gotten good at masking it I have not moved from that pit that Ive dug myself into I go to work as usual I hang out with my friends do what needs to be done My husband has to leave for work for months at a time so hes currently gone That leaves me a lot of time to sulk around in my thoughts Hes really trying to be a better person I just never really know what hes up to So I feel emotionally detached in a way I would have never imagined possible with him What kills me most is that Ive started developing a weird desire to be acknowledged Not by my husband by other men I want somebody to look at me see beauty and intellect like he used to when we first met I want someone to fall in love with me all over again And God I just crave a relationship where I dont even have to think about cheating I know a lot of people will tell me my marriage is doomed and that Im a shit person too And I know that may all be true but this is my reality currently I havent been able to speak to anyone about this ever and so Im here to vent I am trying to start therapy again something my husband is against mind you But I am doing it behind his back because I deem it necessary but that process is taking a while EDIT Those of you who keep messaging me with the intent of starting an affair or taking advantage of my vulnerability please think before you shoot me a message Women are allowed to talk about a situation like this and not still somehow be reduced to a form of sexual gratification I am not using this post to beg for attention I am simply getting it off of my chest looking for advice perhaps Its 2025 understand that there is nuance,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 04:50:28 UTC,114,42,0.87,,,0,0
1j4cyxv,A guy I knew died thinking his wife was faithful to him,I knew this girl in high school lets call her Hailey and she got engagedmarried very early One of my best friends well call her Samantha is very close with her Samantha told me once years ago that Hailey had cheated on him once before maybe more I was really shocked my gut instinct was to tell him but I didnt know him well and he seemed kind of mean Samantha told me not to say anything because she was using it as ammunition in case Hailey ever wanted to tell one of her big secrets great friendship right Anyway I listened to Samantha and never said anything despite feeling some guilt She assured me that hes probably cheated on her as well I didnt think much of it for a while Recently he died of an overdose The guilt of not telling him weighed on me pretty heavy after I found out I keep telling myself that he probably wouldve ended up overdosing anyway but I dont feel like it was fair to him that he spent his short life with someone who was unfaithful Regardless theres nothing I can do about it now except hope hes in a better place,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 20:25:49 UTC,199,38,0.87,,CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCEDEATH,0,0
1j3d6a0,The first time I ever hugged my dad was to stop his suicide attempt,This happened just a few months ago but everyone around me hasnt mentioned it since the night it happened My dad was neglected physically and from what Ive gathered in conversations sexually abused as a child His mother started him on hard drugs before the age of 10 By age 14 he was dealing to her He hasnt had anything close to an easy life But he wanted nothing more than to turn his life around when he had me He and my mom had me at 18 and 19 and were married about 4 months after my birth As far back as I can remember their marriage always had issues It wasnt easy for my mom being married to an addict He stayed clean for the majority of my childhood but I know he had relapses along the way Despite the issues my parents have built a good life for me and my siblings Moneys tight sometimes but we never are in need of anything My dad is clean and works a good paying job my mom works at the elementary school in our small town But the last two years Ive seen a huge change in how my dad was acting He was irritable constantly arguing with my mom and threatening divorce This all came to a breaking point one night when my parents both considerably drunk were having some meaningless argument fueled by alcohol and resentment In the middle of the argument my dad just got up and left the house I watched him walk into the garage shutting to door behind himself I figured he was just taking some time to cool off so I didnt think much of it About 20 minutes later my mom came to me crying telling me to go check in on him I now know that he had been mentioning taking his life to her in private I went and opened the garage door and found my dad crying at a table with a ladder and rope in the middle of the garage I didnt even look at him I was staring at the ladder I didnt know what to say His first response to me walking in was being angry with me He told me if I thought that he was going to kill himself that way I was wrong He said he had much better methods of doing so I didnt leave and I didnt respond I sat down on the other side of the garage and we sat in silence Eventually he began crying profusely and telling me he didnt know how to deal with himself anymore and I started crying too He told me I didnt have to worry about him put the ladder and rope away and told me to go back in the house But it still didnt feel right to me Before I went inside I walked over to him without saying a word and hugged him We stayed that way for a few minutes both crying When we stepped back he grabbed a pistol from his waistband and handed it to me I took it inside without a word and made sure it was put back into the safe with the ammo separate We never mentioned this night again and its been eating me alive from the inside out,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 15:22:38 UTC,0,2,0.5,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0
1j5fd9g,From now on I am no longer into girls as a girl I am going back to Christ and I strive to be homophobic to myself,From now on I will force myself to think of lesbian stuff as disgusting I will no longer engage with any of that sinning behaviour and I will find my way back to Christ I will remind myself that it is gross it is sinful and it is dirty This behaviour is mutantlike and abnormal As of now I still feel no attraction for men but I will get there through Christ for heterosexuality is natural and normal I was lucky to be born Catholic I was lucky to have been taught what sins are from early on to avoid the consequences that include eternal suffering This is nothing but another trial This is the only way to be accepted by Christ and my family I will choose to keep the peace in my family I beg for forgiveness from the lord for I have strayed I was wrong for being tempted by the devil Although I will not harm anyone else gay is gross,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 04:34:14 UTC,0,21,0.23,,,0,0
