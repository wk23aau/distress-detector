1j61gx2,i need advice,to start off im 27f with a 22m boyfriend. weve been together for almost 3 years and we met due to working together. i still cringe at our 5 year age gap. i have a friend that is 30f and i dont know if i am a complete ahole for wanting to cut ties with her or maybe i already accidentally did. the last time i saw her i ended up staying for a weekend which was fun at first and we tried to drink but we both fell asleep too fast which her boyfriend got mad about. i did not like this boyfriend 36m due to him constantly sleeping with his ex and being so obvious about it but shed be in this denial or whatever and cry to me constantly about it. he was also somewhat a neglectful parent to his daughter from what my friend would tell me. so anyways the next day came and i agreed to stay an extra day to watch her two daughters and figured id be getting paid because we discussed it prior. well i didnt and during this i ended up getting bed bug bites on my neck hands and ankle area. pretty much where my skin was exposed. since leaving there i still feel like i have bugs on my skin and im honestly afraid to ever go back. i dont know why i pick and choose when to be confrontational because i just let left and didnt say anything. i dont know whether to say anything at all. weve talked about bedbugs before and shes said shes gotten rid of them so i dont know what to say. fast forward a few days and she tells me her and her boyfriend 36m broke up and shes back together with an ex 32m. this ex 32m was sleeping with a 17 year old girl and my friend 30f let both of them move into her home with her two children before they both just dipped and apparently had left the place trashed and thats when the bedbugs originally came about around this time too. oh and that man32m knew her children for a few months and was having them call him daddy. i felt so uncomfortable witnessing all of this and then seeing what she allows herself and her children to be put through willingly. for months i was telling her xyz was not right and shed be defending herself and him 36m until they broke up. at that point is when she is like oh i could never be with someone who does xyz and completely shitting on this man talking about everything she defended and excused when she put up with it for months and would have continued to put up with it if he 36m didnt have his baby momma over again to stay the night after she had been begging him to stop for months doing that for months. so im just over it? im like why are you actively choosing to put yourself through these things? i dont like to sugar coat things because why the hell should i act like neglecting a child is okay just to be a girls girl? their relationship wasnt abusive or anything like that a lot of accusations of cheating coming from both amp issues starting a few days after they began dating which is never a good sign but neither were afraid of each other it wasnt like that and she will put up with almost anything to keep a guy around and thats my issue. i used to think she was a good mom but i dont think shes that great anymore. i used to praise her when she would say she wouldnt let strangers around her kids and doesnt let anyone else watch her kids until i realized shes letting men she just met meet her kids inside her home and be around them unsupervised. i used to think she was a good mom until i realized she raises her daughters through sugar and electronics and doesnt really watch even though around her children. all of these realizations have come to me now after she broke up with her long term boyfriend of 2 years34m and have gone through 45 relationships in a year and i dont think shes the person i thought she was and i feel awful but i dont want to be around someone like that. so she has her new boyfriend ex boyfriend 32m currently living with her again and i sent her a message a couple days ago saying i think that hes a pedophile and i dont want to be around him to which shes never responded but has sent other things. i know that once her and her current boyfriend 32m break up or start having issues she will be wanting my pity party but i cant do it anymore. i feel like i have no empathy for her anymore. if we had more to talk about than her and her relationships i feel like it wouldnt be such an issue but she has no subsidence to her at all if it is not about a man. any advice on what you would do in my situation? its not my life so i dont know why im so bothered.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 21:57:32 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j674ys,the past few weeks have shown me that life will continue without me.,specifically that my animals will be ok. one dog will go to my parents. one will go to my friends who are obsessed with her breed and if they find her another home awesome. my bird will either go to the local zoo or the house down the street. my cat can literally go anywhere. i am not needed. i promised my therapist i would reach out if i was planning anything. i lied. the gun in the house is gone but i still have the ability to purchase one amy day id like. work doesnt need me. we all know we are expendable at our jobs but its been hard for me to accept. but theres no other way to reconcile the fact that ive been at my job longer than two employees who have become managers and yet im nothing. im useless. im dispensable. im nothing. im about done.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 02:32:47 UTC,0,1,0.5,,,0,0
1j66syz,honestly this is how i am learning to cope with being singlelonely for a long time,i hate to say that i am that guy who has been single for a really long time despite my best efforts but i am. i 27m havent even been lucky enough to go on a date in like 5 or 6 years but i have not given up hope even though things do look a bit bleak for me at the moment. i am a really busy graduate student i try to fit in workouts and other activities too but it is pretty hard. i do not have a lot of extra energy left to put in substantial effort to find the right person for me on most weeks. so the thing i kinda wanted to get off my chest is i have been working on conceptswriting for a fantasy novel for a while when i get some time alone. with my life being romantically unfulfilled i have fit in a relationship between two characters the mc and another to fulfill all the things that i have dreamed about. it was not really part of my original ideas for the story but it kinda just happened. its pretty much all wholesome relationship stuff that i have never really got to have the hand holding the closeness sharing feelings tender moments having each others back etc. as lame as it sounds it has been decently fulfilling for me. there are still days that i really could use a hug even from a friend but there is something about getting all the stuff i have always wanted on paper that has been pretty nice and comforting. even though adding this stuff in has been satisfying for me i am a little afraid it makes the writing worse lol and when its all finished it makes me that much more afraid to show it to anyone. some of my friends know i have been working on this but have no idea theres romance involved in it. i just really wanted to get off my chest i have been vicariously living out my romantic dreams through my fictional characters because i do not really have a better outlet. i think its been a healthy way to express what i am missing out on?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 02:14:59 UTC,3,0,0.81,,,0,0

1j66ms7,my friend has a new boyfriend and i hate it,i know it probably sounds like im in love with this friend but im not. im married and happy. but this boyfriend is an ex friend and ex boyfriend of mine and i was really close to them. they were my first friend in my new highschool where i didnt know anyone. one day a couple years ago they texted me saying all this mean stuff and telling me that we werent friends anymore. they also didnt tell me what i did. it hurt so bad for years and im just now getting over it and i was doing good until i saw my friend posting about their new boyfriend and seeing my exs face just hit me. even after we had broken up we were great friends and hung out almost every day until that text. a really big part of me wants to stop being friends with the current friend or at least keep my distance until i feel like im ready. i dont know what im going to do. honestly i might just block them after sending an explanation. im a bad person after all so they probably shouldnt be friends with me. someone please help,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 02:05:57 UTC,0,2,0.33,,,0,0
1j65zll,update i 23m still love my ex 24f and i dont know if she feels the same,so we made the plans and i asked if it was a date or not to my surprise she said it was which is just awesome to me. we met on the train heading to the neatest city to us i had zero idea where i was being taken but it was a small caf√© not too far from a park and museum. we sat in there for around an hour before walking around the park and just talking the weather did start to turn a little dreary so we went to the museum and listened to an organ for a bit before just walking around to see what had changed since wed last been there they removed all the old armourswords and replaced them with old chairs? towards the end we walked back through the city and got on the train. i got off two stops later than i should have just so i could walk her to her car and then we headed our separate ways. all in it was a pretty fun day and were thinking of going out for dinner next time.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 01:32:06 UTC,5,3,0.78,,,0,0
1j65j6m,my family hate that i go to bed earlier than them and i hate that they expect me to not do it,i wake up 430am on weekdays to go to work so i have dinner at 7 go to bed at 8 so i can decompress and relax to then sleep at 93010. my family has been having dinner at 830 for about a month now because one of my sisters gets off work at 8 and theyve been expecting me to wait for them but if i do so i would be going to bed at 9930 giving me little to no time to decompress and relax to finally sleep at a decent hour. pretty much 23 days they ask me if i want take out for dinner and everytime i say no because i cant wait for them because it gets late pretty quickly and everytime they get annoyed at my answer. today a spin off of a show that we watch all together premiere and now my mom is complaining we wont get to watch it because i dont wanna eat dinner with them anymore. is it so hard to empathize a little and understand i have to wake up very early to go to work? like why are they like this?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 01:08:41 UTC,254,42,0.97,,,0,0
1j65iqy,i got terminated from my volunteer position with no explanation,so i 18f just finished volunteering for the day at my workplace animal sanctuary yesterday when i got a message from my boss to see he sent me a termination letter nothing in the message either just the letter itself and they have ignored me since. also sorry this is a long one i just have a lot of things in my head i need to sort out. so a bit of backstory since i was around 14 ive been dealing with the struggles of depression anxiety and adhd and ended up leaving school in yr10 because of it. took a while to figure out but i ended up going to tafe to complete my cert ii and iii to become a qualified zookeeper as ive always loved animals and cant see myself doing anything else. because of tafe i had to start volunteering to complete the practical component of my course and ended finding this amazing sanctuary to work at. so i ended up starting there in early february 2024 and fell in love with the place and the people. i was originally going once a week but started going twice a week in around november bc i loved it so much and wanted to be there more. they always told me they loved how i would be there consistently every week and i would pride myself on it as it was a big commitment for me as i lived an hour away. the environment there was great honestly i couldnt have asked for it to be any better. the owners always quite involved and prided themselves on this and wanted us to feel more like family rather than a workplace. because of this i became quite close with the people who were on my days and considered them my second family. the owners also lived on site and their kids were always around because of this i became quite close with them as well even buying them small presents for their birthdays and helping them with their homework. i suppose im telling you this so you understand how close i was with them their family and the other volunteers so you can understand how hurt i am by the way theyve handled this situation. even on my bad days they were half the reason id get up in the morning even when i didnt want to drive or talk to people id still show up bc i didnt want to let them down as again i seen them as my second family and greatly valued their opinion. so fast forward back to yesterday it was completely normal. nothing out of the ordinary we were still talking like normal doing all our tasks as normal having lunch together like normal i even got a last minute tour and stayed back to finish it up which brought in a fair bit of money for them. also just a note its a nonprofit all the money from tours goes right back into the sanctuary to care for the animals food and water vet bills etc. so just my little routine afterwards i stop on the way home to go to the bathroom get food etc. so i was checking my phone like normal and seen he sent me an attachment funny thing is i thought he was sending me a dumb reel or something. boy did i have a rude awakening when i read termination letter. so naturally i read through it and start crying because again that day was normal there was not even a hint that something like this was coming. luckily i had one of my friends with me so i didnt do something dumb like driving with so many tears in my eyes i could barely see and probably getting into an accident. in the letter he basically highlighted the fact that he wants to maintain a positive workplace and while he values my input he needs to put the sanctuary first blah blah blah the typical things in a letter that would put the blame on me so he doesnt seem like the bad guy. so one important thing to mention they say this to everyone but from the start they said that theyre the kind of workplace to make sure everyones included and dont like people to form cliques. however i became really close to two people in particular specifically because theyre great friends and have done so much for me. now while i was really close with these two i feel we included everyone when we could. especially since some days at the sanctuary wed be so busy wed barely see each other that day. so wed always go out for lunch however wed always ask everyone if they wanted anything and never ate out always came back to be a part of the whole team. wed all have a break at the same time. now obviously being friends wed hang out after work but again wed ask some people if theyd wanna come if we werent going too far away. and we would call and stuff but i feel its normal for friends to do that. so one thing i could see where they wouldnt have been to happy with this is that we were doing an animal course about 5 hours away. you have to finish the online part first before you go do the practical bit. so one of my friends told the boss that we were going to be doing it he already done it prior and was just driving us and unlike the last time it was done they didnt put it on the group chat or anything for people to say theyre interested. i think they assumed wed tell people that we were doing it and ask if theyd want to come. mind you this was about a month in advance so plenty of time for people to do the online section. i will say this course ends up being quite expensive so some people werent able to do it due to financial reasons anyway. anyways long story short one other person from the sanctuary ended up doing the course btw the course only has 4 spots for the prac part. we had a great time and included him in nearly everything we did he traveled separately to us so was only left out of stuff we did on the way. we even had a game night and everything and really the only people who were left out were the people who couldnt come but wanted to which i dont blame them for. i can only assume that this is the reason they fired us my friend that drove was quitting next week was going to be his last however they messaged him yesterday basically telling him to not come back and my other friend also got a letter similar to mine. again i was completely blindsided by this as yesterday and even the last few weeks were completely normal. no they didnt even try to chat with us saying something like hey this is what we can see is happening and we dont like it can you just try to include the other people more. something like that and i wouldnt have been as devastated. the only other thing it might be is that i would make some pretty crude jokes although i wasnt the only one that would say them and me and my boss would say them to each other and everything were aussie btw its part of our culture i suppose if we dont know you or dont like you well be quite civilpolite to you but if we do like you then youll probably cop it. although i dont think this was the problem bc again it wasnt just me making these jokes. i guess what hurts the most is that i really respected my boss and viewed both of them quite highly. like theyre great people at least i use to think so theyre great parents really community oriented and from what ive heard quite highly regarded in our field. so basically for him to not even have the decency to even send me a message along with the letter it is what hurt the most. so naturally i sent them both a message asking them to give me a call bc for my own peace of mind i really need an explanation. both of them i assume accidentally opened the message and i can see they read it however they both ignored it. so i sent them an email this morning however still waiting on a reply. ive never been through a breakup but i imagine itd be like this except instead of breaking up with one person ive just lost my second family. with no warning no explanation. anyways thanks for listening to me ramble sorry it was so long im just kind of at a loss for now. hopefully ill stop crying and get out of bed soon. thank youse heart_hands tldr i was volunteering at an animal sanctuary when i got a termination letter from my boss with no warning no explanation. i feel like ive lost my second family.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 01:08:02 UTC,3,4,0.72,,,0,0

1j657gu,am i being used?,am i being used? do i 26f need a reality check? ive been friends with my friend blake 26m for over a year now. we have been pretty close since the beginning. when we first met we bonded over our shared love for playing soccer together and music. i would say we have many similarities. we both enjoy adult animation like studio ghibli raves and playing board games. since we shared many similarities we kept in touch daily through text messages phone calls and facetime. we had a mutual friend named jennifer. jennifer and i were very close until i noticed that whenever we spent time together she spoke negatively about everyone around her. as a result i gradually distanced myself from her. around the same time jennifer and blake started dating. although i wasnt close to jennifer and didnt personally like her i wanted blake to be happy. blake and i maintained a consistent relationship and communication. we talked every day even during our lunch breaks via facetime. however things took a turn when jennifer informed blake that i had feelings for him and wanted to pursue a romantic relationship with him. that was not the case and i was even in a relationship at the time. as a result blake ended our communication to preserve his relationship with jennifer. we did not talk for eight months. however in january he reached out to me. he told me that jennifer suddenly broke up with him in december. since then weve been hanging out again. in february we attended a rave and ended up having sex that night. a week later we confessed to each other that we had both harbored feelings for one another since weve first met. at this point i informed him that i didnt want to be a rebound and he responded by stating that he wasnt ready for a relationship and wanted to focus on healing. i accepted his decision. we continued spending time together and continued having sex. however i later told him that i no longer wanted to have sex with him because i was struggling to separate our friendship and romantic feelings. around the same time his exgirlfriend jennifer filed a protective order against blake. sidebar personally i have had past experiences with abusive men which may have influenced my perspective. however i must admit that i am not entirely aware of the details of jennifer and blakes relationship. given jennifers personality i cant help but wonder if this situation is a attentionseeking ploy. on the other hand i have only heard blakes side of the story. however i suggested that we establish boundaries. we agreed to refrain from having sex and i told him i need a break from constant communication. i also told him to fine another trusted friend to confide in about the jennifer situation because i havent healed from my own trauma from the abusive i had endured. blake expressed his agreement to the physical boundaries and expressed he didnt want to lose me again and our friendship. since implementing these boundaries our relationship has undergone a significant change. we dont talk that much anymore and when we do the protective order case seems to be the main topic of discussion. although last night i visited blakes place to watch star wars. during the movie he asked me to engage in a platonic cuddle. we did and he said thank you. i inquired about the reason behind his gratitude. he mentioned that my presence was naturing and made him feel less lonely. am i only in his life because he feels lonely?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:52:22 UTC,2,4,1.0,,,0,0
1j652ed,my husband had a thing for a dog and now im rethinking him as a person,three weeks ago me 28f and my husband 29m went out to a bar. when we got there we happened to run into a middle school friend of his. we got to talking and his friend was sharing stories about when they were in middle school together. like the time his friend walked into the wrong restroom by mistake and was made fun or for a year and when my husband got hard asking out a girl after a few more embarrassing and funny stories his friend who well call jeff says hey remember that dog. i think you can see where this is going. my husband started breaking down laughing and i was totally confused. so i asked what dog jeff explained in sixth grade wasiswhatever the terminology is a zoophilia he was sexually interested in a dog named champion he didnt do anything but got a boner after he was playing with this dog. he and his friend shocked about it for a while but he kept taking pictures of this dog. it started to move from joking territory to creepy. three months later he attempted to kidnap the dog. thankfully jeffs father the owner of the dog caught him. is it weird that im reconsidering my marriage even though this hasnt been a problem in decades. my whole view of my husband has changed so am i over reacting to my husbands middle school issues?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:45:17 UTC,2638,425,0.95,,,0,0
1j64ucy,the animation industry is making me think dark thoughts.,hello. im posting this on here because anywhere else i could be found out. im a recent graduate who studied animation. i want to be a character animator working with studios or even just contract freelance work. but nobody is hiring juniors or graduates. i aced my grades. ive been given compliments on my reel. i have connections. i did some experience only to be ghosted. linkedin and indeed are only posting senior lead or principal positions even if its a mid position they wont hear back from you. even when i reached out to people they said they liked my work but werent hiring. in 202324 i reached out to over 115 places. from 2023 to now i have a spreadsheet and im on application 724. axis studios shut down technicolor and its subsidiaries shut down so now theres an even bigger pool. i feel hopeless. i feel empty. people telling me that ai will take over me too theres nothing anymore. all ive ever seen myself as is an animator and if i cant be that i dont see myself doing anything else and i cant fathom doing anything else that its making me think horrible things. that if i cant get a job or if im stuck and the industry fails and i have to switch ill be at square one and i just cant. what can i do. im so scared and hopeless.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:34:13 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0
1j64p36,i think about the one that got away even though we were never together.,due to trauma i have an extreme flight feeling so that even though things are going good with my current partner i keep thinking about just packing my things and leaving. i keep thinking about a fwb i was with prior that if we had tried a relationship probably we probably wouldve been great together. i love my current partner and dont want to actually leave him and i cant say anything to either of them because i wont let my trauma response ruin a relationship and friendship. i am working on it with my therapist. i know that if i do pack up and leave and have something with the friend that the same feeling will happen with him because i need to work through the trauma rather than giving into it. i dont really have any friends i can talk to about it because none of them will understand.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:27:03 UTC,3,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j64g7u,coming to terms with the thought that my sister is not a good person after all,it has been almost 15 years since its slowly started to dawn on me that my sister never really loved me she just thought i was so much lamer than her that she didnt see me as a competiton. for the context she is 10 years older than me and for as long as i can remember i loved her more than anyone alive. i loved her more than our parents brothers friends etc. she was my absolute role model and everything she did was perfect. it is fucked up to compare kids ever but when parents and relatives are comparing two people who are so different and not even in the same age group that is especially fucked up. she was always labeled the beautiful one me as the smart one. she was the caring child i was the mean one. her life was hard mine was easy. everything that was happening to her was always celebrated if it was good or we were all devastated together with her if it was bad and it was never her fault when it was bad. everything i ever did was considered as luck or as normal if it was good and my fault if it was bad. she loved me back and always worked on building my self confidence but never to the extent of me succeeding in being better than her in any way. this was particularly obvious in her relationship with our parents where she told me multiple times that our father wanted mom to have the abortion when she was pregnant with me. any sign of me not liking that thought was being met with the comment along the lines of me being too sensitive or oh come on he loves you now. i reacted explosivelly about that only once when i told her openely to go fuck herself with those fucked up pieces of info which of course ended with her being in tears appologizing and making me promise that i will never remind her about that event. she made it about her and her feelings and i was told by the involved parties that i shouldnt have been so hard on her. these were occasional outbursts when i would always make a conclusion that i over reacted and i would end up crying begging her to forgive me and promising never to do it again. bear in mind we are talking about my teenage yeara here not adult me. ff to my 20s while she had one relationship with her then longtime bf who became almost like a family member i mostly fucked around and either didnt really meet reciprocated feelings in guys or i didnt even want anything serious. she eventually broke up with him it was a family tragedy ofc like anything bad that happens to her and she somehow put us both together to we are never getting married file. i mean she never said it but it was obvious that she is not supportive of my potential relationships. i kind of knew it but i became sure about it when i started to date my now husband when i was 25 and as i became more selfassured because i felt loved she started to become more and more openely toxic and she was doing it often. she would use every opportunity to let me know she thinks he is lazy and irresponsible while i didnt think any of that. she started to hate my hobbies style habits which didnt change much i just wasnt as miserable as before and she was suuuuper pissed when she broke with her second bf and i got engaged. she called me and raged about how it is inconsiderate that everyone is saying congrats on social media while they are aware of her recent break up. i felt bad because during the last year of her relationship she lost one pregnancy but i still didnt think that i should hid posts my boyfriend put on social media when he proposed. after that it all went downhill. she was good to me either when something super good would happen to her or when something really bad would happen to me. she hated my wedding day and pregnancy but she was full of understanding when i had ppd. she did nothing to help but she was good to me then. as soon as i got better she was hating me again. in the meantime all good that was going on in her life was still celebrated and all bad was mourned while my life was kind of unimportant to our mutual loved ones mostly. i started to fight back but i was rarely talking shit about her to our family while she wasnt really private about her opinion on me. every time when she would show her good side again i would come back to life because i would regain the hope that the most loved person from my childhood is still there. recently i lost all hope that i will ever want her back in my life. our father died and in his final months while i was crying my guts out and doing everything to help him as we all did she told me that i was selfish as always and not showing any empathy towards him. that was the straw that broke the camels back for me and i screamed at her and told her to get the fuck away from me forever. we did communicate after that because there were many things that had to be done with our dad and i was there for her to be her shoulder to cry on when she needed me but it was just because i felt i had to for the rest of our family. as our dad passed my feelings of disgust came back and i am back to feeling hurt by our last fight. she mentioned it briefly and said that it was just a dumb fight as she always does after moments like that but to me it wasnt. to me now none of the fights we had were dumb and they were all about one thing her wanting me to be the obedient loser sister that she had when i was from 0 to 20ish and her from 10 to 30ish. i cant stand the thought of her hanging out with my kid anymore. my kid loves her and i was so happy when my sister and i patched our fight from a few years ago and she had good relationship with her niece but honestly i have two fears 1. she would fuck her up the way she fucked me up 2. she would be telling my kid mean things to show me as a bad person for whatever reason. one thing i found out later after my ppd was gone is that she was planning to take the kid away from me because it seems like i am not fit to do it but she never considered talking to my husband about it. like he didnt have ppd he was fine why didnt she talk to him? why was she planning to adopt the kid who was not out for adoption? anyway... i am done with her but i think i will need a lot of time to process this. maybe therapy would be beneficial.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:14:59 UTC,7,0,0.83,,,0,0
1j64e6n,i hate living with my parents so much,i moved back home recently after graduating from college and living with my parents again has made me cry more than i did during my four years at college. i found out today that my mom opened an enveloped addressed to me and read mail intended for me that included a lot of personal information. she left the letter in her room for at least three days without even telling me i had any mail and only mentioned it today. shes also been using the personal info in that letter to make fun of me. yeah im lucky to have parents that will welcome me home and that feed me. theyre not bad parents. but living with them genuinely makes me want to die.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:12:09 UTC,1,4,1.0,,,0,0
1j64ccx,close friend passed today at 28,you know how we always talk about how great someone is once theyve passed? this friend was truly one of the best people ive ever known hands down. i truly honest to god do not have a single negative thing to say about him. weve been friends for 20 years. we grew up together. he was the most himself person with a huge heart. he followed his passions in a way i rarely see taught children who adored him and was just such a damn good friend and person. during the last conversation i had with him over christmas he told me he was the happiest hed ever been. doing what he loves every day. pursuing his passions. i was so so happy for him. that day he also met the man im going to marry for the first time and told me how much he liked him. its hard to imagine he wont be at my wedding now. i know theres no rhyme or reason to death and i wont waste my time on arguing with it but man if anyone deserved a long happy life it was him. i feel extremely sad and just needed to get it off my chest.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:09:37 UTC,13,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j648yo,who am i?,can someone explain my situation? i dont know who i am. am i from this country? i dont feel like i belong. i dont feel like a woman or a man. sometimes i feel like a child sometimes a man sometimes a teenage girl sometimes a mother sometimes a woman. i dont know but i feel frighteningly different from my family and the traditions of my country. even the religion of my countryim not fully convinced by it. am i religious or not? why do i always drift off and listen to songs in different languages but never in my native tongue? why do i always feel like im living in a parallel world? why dont i feel like i belong to this earth? why am i always alone and why do i love escaping reality? as i write this i remember my childhood. at first i pity that little girl but in the end i dont want to sympathize with this womannot because im not proud of myself but because why am i not brave enough to discover who i am? why do i feel like my personality isnt real? is it because of my environment society or because i dont belong to this country and this religion? who am i?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:04:59 UTC,0,0,0.33,,,0,0
1j63zlg,too rich to qualify for assistance. too poor to pay the medical debt i need assistance for.,sometimes i wish i could literally die in an accident so that the calls from collections and bills piling up on my mailbox stopped. sure i make 80k but it means jack shit when i live in a somewhat expensive city and a huge chunk of my income goes towards these bills. recently i started to have health problems which are making me attend therapies to manage said problems twice a week. im spending an average of 600700 a month. i ended up in the emergency department last month too which means i have to pay 4000 to them. everywhere i go for assistance turns me away because i dont make less than 60k yet these braindead morons working there dont understand the concept of my income going towards these bills leaving me with less money to even feed myself. im down to 1 meal a day and honestly i can manage it because i have an eating disorder but i just feel bad for others that genuinely cant do it.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:52:38 UTC,3,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j63j0w,update my gf beat the shit out of someone who broke into her house,i dont know if anyone remembers me but a while ago my girlfriend and i had a home invasion incident that culminated in her beating the shit out of the intruder. im tired of saying my gf so im going to call her diana. turns out the guy was a drug addict from the next town over. he was in his 60s and he had an extensive history in jail and mental hospitals. unfortunately about two months after my post he passed away. we didnt know anything about why until we got a chance to talk to his sister who insisted she didnt blame diana and that the doctors even said that he probably didnt have much longer anyway. diana was visibly distressed during this conversation so im not sure whether or not the sister just said that to comfort her after that diana went on a trip to a national park during a week she knew i couldnt take off and forgot her meds. she has seizures that look like mild psychosismagical thinking and ended up refusing to come home at the end of the trip. she kept saying that she felt like she couldnt leave the woods because she was certain there was something she needed to learn there that she hadnt yet and when i asked her how long that might take she said some people take a lifetime. i asked if she was breaking up with me and she said something about feeling like she was too attached to me her house her pets etc and that she needed to meditate on that for a while. i ended up going to her temple to see if anyone was willing to give me some perspective on the situation since she was seeing things through a buddhist lens. it was the right choice. a monk actually drove the six hours out to her with me to talk to her in person since she wasnt picking up calls. i am so so unbelievably grateful for that monk because diana started taking her meds again and came home soon after. ive never been religious but i started to read the pali canon afterwards and that shit slaps. diana was already volunteering her time at the temple so now we both go together when we can. all things considered since then things are back to normal and going well. were both children of divorce so even before all this we were doing prophylactic couples counseling every few months and for a while after we were going once a week. diana has started seeing a therapist on her own as well which i am so proud of her for since shes always hated the idea of individual therapy. we also stepped up our home security game. diana already had plenty of cameras but now we have doorwindow alarms and motion sensors. i also convinced diana to get another dog so now we have a 75lb puppy i know a lot of people were rooting for us to get married but thats not going to happen. legal marriage isnt something that interests us and it never has. but we did buy each other rings and its been a great comfort to have something physical to remind me of her on my person all the time. were also considering having a small commitment ceremony next fall lt3 thanks again for all the feedback on my previous post. i got a lot of great advice and some good criticism. i showed it to diana and she got a kick out of the comments and we had a little mutual cry over how kind a lot of you guys were. i asked her if she was okay with me posting this update and she clucked at me and told me to do whatever i want online as long as im being nice and anonymous lol. so hope this qualifies!,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:30:31 UTC,2523,62,0.97,,,0,0
1j63eh6,i feel stuck in this life of disappointment,damn i will definitely be embarassed about this in the future but anyways ive always been a sensitive person i always cared about others and made sure to make them feel good and happy. my middle school years werent the best i had to move out of my old house and i completely changed life by moving to a town 50 minutes far from my previous residence. you can imagine that i an introverted and nerdy kid wasnt able to make many friends and so i got lonely. in fact i was known as the lonely kid no one ever wanted to talk to me and sometimes even made fun of me i discovered some years later that everyone talked behind my back during those years and that was the reason no one even wanted to approach me. and so i spent three years of my life by myself i spent my days alone definitely years that i wouldnt want to live again. once middle school ended i was full of hope that same summer i made some friends and had a lot of fun with them and so i was positive about starting high school. and so once my first year of school started i tried to me more extroverted and social the outcome was awkard im not good at being extroverted. even tho i tried the outcome wasnt positive. this time no one talked behind my back but i had trouble making friends and so i became the lonely kid once again. i was depressed spent my days listening to music and sleeping all day just to escape that feeling of void that was suffocating swallowing me whole. i was ready to end it all but i wasnt brave enough to even try so i kept living my life and eventually things got better. i made new friends i became more social and felt truly happy after years of suffering. i am happy about how i lived the rest of my teenage years but that feeling never got away. i am now left with an overthinking mindset idk if i can call it like that which leads me to anxiety about all the friendships that i currently live i cant be calm because i sometimes think that everyone will sooner or later go against me and make me live the hell i went through one more time. i cant trust anyone and this thing is making me mad because come on why am i so defensive? why cant i just live my life like the others and not worry about this? i dont truly know why i wrote this probably to feel better or to relate to someone here who perhaps lived my same experience. anyways i feel costantly feel this overwhelming sense of entrapment in my own life i feel like my past will always follow me no matter what i do. no matter how many new people i will meet i will always have this anxiety that they will disappoint me and life is so hard this way. i dont even know if someone will read this i will probably only get some upvotes and my post will be forgotten in this sub,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:24:33 UTC,2,1,0.63,,,0,0

1j638ou,my dads in the icu my boyfriends planning a trip,this happened in mid january. for context i am 32f and my boyfriend is 34m weve been together for 3 years and we live together in a house that i own. now for the story my dad has been unwell for over a month and my siblings and i mom died from cancer when i was young have been taking care of him while we waited for test results and some answers. last week his condition took a turn for the worst and he ended up being taken to the hospital by ambulance and has been in the icu for a week. he was diagnosed with cancer. we still dont have all the answers and i dont know what the future holds for my family. on the third day that my dad was in the icu my boyfriend was at work and texted me about his plans for the following day that consisted of him meeting up with friends to plan their trip. i knew they had been talking loosely talking about potentially going on a trip at the end of the month but i thought it was common sense that since my dad is in the hospital the trip would be off. well apparently not. needless to say we had an argument. i told him its extremely hurtful that he would abandon me at a time like this. after a lot of back and forth throughout the day he let me know the trip was cancelled nothing had been paid for or even booked yet but at this point i just feel like the damage is done. who would prioritize a boys trip when their partners only parent is extremely sick in the hospital. the obvious answer is to break up but i dont know if i have it in me to go through a breakup right now. its been a few days now my dad is doing much better hes out of the icu and ive been there everyday helping him with his recovery so he can come home. ive been off work for the past week and a half during all this and went back yesterday and have been going to the hospital between shifts. my boyfriend has been moping around the house the last few days and every time i ask him whats wrong he says nothing or i dont know im just sad. i said if this is about the trip then just go. he says thats not what its about. i suggested he goes to talk to someone a therapist or a friend.. or me. he declined all of this. i asked what i can do to help he said nothing and im not his therapist i said nothing and just collected my stuff and went to work. i have a lot on my plate already and im feeling angry that hes putting this on me now as well. we spent the next few days avoiding eachother around the house which was making my mental health seriously depleted. we finally had a conversation i told him he should go on the trip because theres no sense of him staying here if hes not even going to acknowledge me or be supportive to me and my family anyways. the next day he booked his flight. i tried to convince myself i was okay with it but his 5 day trip suddenly turned into 10 days and i just knew i was done. we had a few conversations while he was away mostly me crying and telling him how angry i am with him. he came home and i ended it as soon as he walked in the door. he begged and pleaded said he never would have left if he knew i would end it because of the trip. there was a lot of back and forth and i asked him if he could just leave for a few days to give me some space which he did. he ended up taking me on a date for valentines day later that week and things seemed to be getting a little bit better. we planned a night away the following week to try to connect again. during our romantic night away he decided it was a good idea to invite his friend and friends girlfriend to join us for dinner the girlfriend ended up not coming so it was just me my bf and his friend .. and then surprisingly a bunch of his other work friends just happened to be at the same restaurant. what was supposed to be a romantic evening to try to repair our relationship ended up being a table of 8 of us talking about my boyfriends job. we went back to the hotel got into an argument and went to bed angry. the next day we woke up and he got in the shower and left his apple watch on the night stand. i had that gut instinct to check his messages and there it was. he was been messaging with another girl the entire time my dad was in the hospital and was meeting up with her for coffee dates . which i highly doubt is all that happened. so ya thats it. he moved his stuff out last week and the person i thought i knew for the last almost 4 years has become the person whose hurt me more than anyone ever has in my life. im on my own again going to be 33 next month and starting from scratch. i dont know what the future holds but it has to be better than this right?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:17:01 UTC,7,1,0.71,,,0,0
1j62wut,nex fianc√© ruined my life blamed me for it and then admitted he was never capable of it,just saw a post about their narc maybe being dl and im realizing mine definitely was and after everything he did and blaming me for it he said thats why he did it and couldnt have let us every happen or get married bc of his hidden desires. exact quote at the bottom in the beginning he said he had a deep fetish he said it was humiliation at first. then the real truth was later revealed to me. and then it wasnt until after the break up he said there was sissy and cross dressing and that he might be gay. which is so bizarre bc one he only ever told me about the real kink way later and never told me the full details of it and he loves women sexually and is very sexual and addicted to porn. but he was interested in trans women and anal sex i guess. its wild bc he always said he could never be in a relationship with a man bc he needed a woman who was submissive and he had control over basically. he wanted a woman in her feminine energy but wasnt safe enough to let me stay there. after our break up also he went on a power kick after i was trying to say goodbye like i guess trying to regain power and he was being agressive and telling me to submit and basically confirm that he was right and i was wrong and legit got hard from it. the next day i said i will only submit to a man who protects and takes care of me and does not abuse me and he said he would still abuse me and i should stop whinning about it. there were times he wanted to have sex with me while watching porn and wouldnt show what the porn was or giving him bjs and hjs while he watched porn. ive posted my story lots but have left out this major detail bc it felt wrong to discuss but for reference we got engaged i uprooted my life to go move in with him in another state. 6 days after the proposal and me thousands of dollars deep into the move he called it off unprovoked bc by this time i had been perfect according to his unreasonable standards but he still blamed me. this is all after months of emotional and verbal abuse. i lost my home a job a baby mental health love my best friend my safety the realization is he legit told me he loved his fetish and addictions more than me. and he also said after he broke off our engagement and putting me through absolute hell and destroying my life and financially abusing me and me loosing my home to go move with him after our engagement after blaming me for the reason why he did it and a couple weeks after i came back to my state and was recovering from the move. he said so we get married have kids and i say by the way i love wearing diapers. dressing as a girl and letting dudes or someone fuck my ass? i wasnt gonna let that happen and that he wasnt sure if he was bi or gay. i couldnt tell if he was saying all of that as a ploy to make it easier to be friends with him bc he was actively saying he wanted me in his life and he said would it be easier if i were gay and then told me all those things. idk if it was more manipulation or if its true. i know his kink is a major thing and it wasnt something i was into and he wants to be with someone romantically who isnt into in but still have sexual encounters with people who are into his kink. i can never tell when he was being honest or just saying something to get a certain reaction out of me. there were several times hed say im going to go fuck this girl tonight bc you stress me out and then id find out he was home along and not with her. his mom would tell me or he later would tell me he never did. there were plenty of cases like this too. he would just say things to make me believe it. so i couldnt tell if he was saying he might be gay for that instance too. idk. in no way am i being insensitive to sexuality or kinks. i was very supportive to him through it all but this is just making me realize he was never going to follow through and legit used me. he basically admitted to putting me through hell abusing me very thoroughly blaming it allllll on me and my character flaws made me lose my home to move states with him tell me entire family we got engaged lose my job and spend thousands on moving lose a child all to cancel our engagement and move during a mania spike he had and blames it on me all while he was literally never going to be capable of following through. there were so many signs too im realizing now that ive missed. he used to straight up tell me that he was mirroring me and i thought that was weird bc women typically mirror the man. he used to also say hed just find someone to marry him out of convenience bc he wasnt capable of love. he was always so selfish in every aspect of our lives. he always made it known to everyone and called me his wife and loved the image that it gave him but treated me like dirt. this man was straight up telling me he was a narcissist and i missed the signs in a haze. he emotionally verbally mentally and financially abused me for literally nothing. bc i was kind and sweet and supportive and empathetic and showed him love he couldnt even fathom. he literally watched me as i bent over backwards for him and took care of him and lost the stability in my life to create one with him while he was just belittling me and destroying my worth and esteem. he needed control over me bc he lacked it in his own life and addictions and self. and was never going to marry me or create the life together we planned bc his demons and desires would have never allowed it even when i was accommodating and understanding. but the blame is all on me for loving him and having needs. theres so many factors to this and so many versions of him its hard to wrap my head around it all,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:01:38 UTC,5,5,0.73,,,0,0

1j629ya,i am having problems with my relationship and i feel trapped,i dont know where to start with it all. this is going to be long and if any of you get to the end i appreciate you taking the time to read my story. i would say that this feels like a common place story that happens to a lot of people in different ways. i just need to get my story told. almost feels like i am just asking for pity maybe i am and that is an issue with myself because seeking pity is not good for ones mental health but what ive been holding in also isnt good for my mental health. ill start the story at 4 years ago when my relationship started. it started 7 years ago. i start there. i was a lonely type of fella and i did not have much relationship experience from my time growing up and being in high school total of 2 relationships before this current one i find myself in one 8 months with it ending with me getting cheated on and the other 1.5 years with me proposing and then getting cheated on. both inperson and then transitioning to longdistance youd think id learned my lesson the first time. anyways i go about a year of being single and searching for love as all young people do and nothing worked for me dating apps social events or just finding people in places that youd want to be able to share interest with. until one day i posted a nice thirst trap online to get the selfseeking validation that i felt i needed at the time and someone slid into my dms someone that i had known from hs but never truly talked to. i began talking with this person and then we grew closer every day despite being long distance with a 3hour time difference. we facetimed each other every once in a while and then twice a week and then every day. the problem at the time in that relationship was two things i was not emotionally intelligent and i had a group of guy friends that were semitoxic. my significant other was not fond of my friends as they wanted to go out and party all the time which i didnt mind doing but it wasnt my cup of tea. so i spent more time talking with her and then one day i tried to introduce her to my group of friends on facetime and she talked to everyone a little bit and just found them all disgusting and asked to talk to me again. she said something along the lines of wow cant believe you did that and hung up on me. now for me i was confused because my buddies did the same thing with their signifcant others and no one was upset and it was nice getting to know the person they loved back homefor a little context me and my so had not met up yet we were still having facetime and what not. it was also a surprise for her because when she called i was hanging out with my buddies and one of them picked up. so after she hung up i called her back in private and i asked her what was wrong and she told me that she felt disrespected by what happened and that was our first big fight with each other and it ended with me texting her updates of when and where i am so she knows if she can call with me. i agreed with it all not thinking that it was a big deal. we continued the relationship with one another with basically a gradual turn of all my free time being spent with her. i neglected friends and became somewhat isolated from my world. as an inexperienced youngling i didnt see that issue. i kept the good friends and started distancing myself from my friends wed hang out with but it started to be less and less as the month went by. i would say that we are about 8 months into this relationship with each other when we first decided to meet up with each other and have about a week together. now before we met with each other she alluded that there were things that she wasnt going to give me or ask of me unless we were dating because i hadnt asked her to be my girlfriend and i dont know why but that enticed me to figure out what she was alluding to and that brought me to the point of when meeting up with her i asked her to be my gf and she said yes but i was so nervous asking her it felt like she was a bit hesistant on that matter when replying yes. that happened the first day and then we started dating with our first week in a relationship of hanging out with each other. i stayed at her place the whole week and we did various things and hung out with each other. it felt like things went well for the week that we spent together it felt like we connected and everyone had a good time before we had to say goodbye and continue our longdistance relationship. after i got back to my home things started to change with our relationship she wanted more from me in ways of being more emotionally aware of my day and tell her my feelings and how things made me feel and as the emotinally unintellegnet person i was it was hard for me to change that in my everyday life i was just going with the flow of life and never realy discussed my emotions with others becasue it never really came up in conversation. we argued about how i was still just discussing my day with her and not sharing my emotions with her so i worked on it and slowly got better with being in touch with my emotions yet i feel like it was never really enough for the relationship. as the months went by she continuously felt like i wasnt telling her enough about my life and felt left out the more i told her about my day so i committed to telling her everything that happened in my day as she was doing to me. now my struggle was that there was a lot that happened in my day so i would sometimes do it when it happened in my day. still i would eventually tell her about it when we called each other every day. still she would then get upset that she missed out on knowing when it happened and what i felt in that period. once again being the emotionally unavailable guy i was i tried my best to do what i could to satisfy that need for her. at this point youre probably wondering why we just didnt break up. i have no clue its probably just me being weakwilled. at this point i spent just about every waking moment texting and talking to this girl and we got into arguments just about every single day either about me missing information i was telling her or me not being emotional. being young i thought this was healthy because the arguments led to deeper conversations with each other and figuring out what made us who we are. i would say about 4 or 5 months after our initial meetup i had pretty much completely distanced myself from my friedns with rarely ever hanging out with them but maybe once in a blue moon but it made it harder in my relationship to hangout with them becausea of her wanting to know everything and me jsut wanting to spend time with friedns so there was communication delay from waht was happening in the conversation and what i was doing vs what was acutally happening in my life. this all led to arguments down the line and then our next meet up this time i was meeting her parents and she was coming to me. i set things up so that i could stay with her and got a friend that i was closer with that she seemed to like because he was married and approved more of our relationship. we spent the time together for about 2 weeks this time one week just me and her at my place and then a week with her parents. it seemed like another good meet up with both of enjoying ourselves but a little bit of tension between us from the arguments and the fact i was moving from a 3 hour time difference to a 13 hour time difference which we both imagined would put more of a strain on our relationship her parents liked me on a side note. we parted ways and i began my new path in life with her being in college and me being abroad for work. we had both been right tensions did increase with each other as i was abroad it became even hadrder for me to comunicate with her with everything that was going on in my day to day life as it was for the most part always unpredictable and hard to keep up with myself and she would sleep half way through my day as the time differnece so if she didnt wake up to a butt load of text about my day she felt upset and always had this feeling of misisng out on my life so i continued to distance myself from others and not participating in group events and when i did i tried to keep to myself to minimize the updating i had to do. at this point she just felt like i didnt love her because i wasnt involving her in my life the same way she was involving me in her life. she told me everything about her day so this wasnt a double standard and she was also busy but i would say that i was definitely busier than she was. i continued to apoligize about the communication issues with keeping in mind i still was telling her about everything that happened in my day whenever we talked on the phone especially all the things i forgot to tell her and she felt that i conviently kept forgetting to tell her about the interations that i had with females throughout my day beacuse as you can imagine she was jealous that other females got to interact with me throught out the day more and she didnt. i was better about telling her about female interaction through my day but i still missed a few here and there. sometimes i got rides from females and shed get upset that i didnt tell them when it happened. she always felt she never got the full story the first time and she had to ask multiple questions to get the whole story and that was tiring for her and it got to the point where i thought i was doing a good job but was not and i just gave up on updating her one day because life just got overwhelmed and i couldnt handle life and my relationship at the same time and she ended it after that day. i was devastated as we had been going through this struggle for almost 3 years and it just felt like it was all for nothing. we met a third time before breaking up and were going to meet up a 4th before covid19 occurred and travel bans happened which didnt improve our relationship. we broke up i got friends and started to move on with my life slowly finding myself and what makes me happy. for about a year i was single. i decided to move back to the same timezone as her and go to the college that she went to. not expecting her to be in the area not ever really knowing why i did it either. i wanted to complete college not being in a relationship but that was not what occured. as you can expect we ran into each other again and started dating because she felt like i was a changed man and was able to prioritize things in my life a little better. i can say that i did grow in the time after we broke up and explored my inner workings a little more. the thing is she thought i started dating her again because she was a different person but she hasnt really changed all that much still wanting the same things and i was more able to provide those things she wanted and it felt like things were going in the right direction. we moved in with each other and where dating for a year until she said that she wanted more and didnt feel we were growing and she said it was because i had not asked her to be my gf so about 3 months of me trying to find the right time to ask and it not working out we get into an argument about it and i asak her and she says no ask another time. so i dont plan for it and just start asking her once a week until she just says yes about 2 months later while we are living and sleeping in the same bed with each other. anyway things started getting a little tenser between us. i dont have many friends as i learned not to make friends in this relationship and i dont talk to my old friends much because it just causes conflict and id rather avoid than lie. we continued dating and for about 2 years we lived in the same place. we have had our ups and downs through the two years. i changed my job twice and have a female supervisor as you know she is upset about that but she ignores it better. she says she just at this point in the relationship buries her emotions and hides her concerns because she doesnt want conflict in the relationship and she only ever feels that she has problems with what is going on in the relationship. we still argue a lot and have those arguments turn into deep conversations and i become more and more emotionally drained as these arguments happen and i can barely keep up with my studies work and relationship yet i push on. we are starting to get to the real point of this story and why i am just done is that we were initially very active sexually in the beginning of our relationship like once a week and then it moved to once a month which you know i didnt think to much of it because i figure sex drive just went down as the relationship got more secured but we just moved to a new place and signed a 15 month lease that niether of us can afford to break and i tried to be sexual with her this morning and she told me that it felt nice but shed been thinking of her ex when weve been doing stuff and that its kinda always been that way becasue she used to be very sexually active with her ex but he was fine with not having sex and she puts herself in his position and wouldnt want that pushed uponed her and makes her feel sad and turns her off from anything that we are doing and i tried to help her get to the root of it this morning before leaving to work and i just felt that i disrepected myself by doing that and not being more upset about her thinking of her ex and it just hurts because it means just about everytime we do sexual stuff its about how she feels about her ex and makes sense why she has to sometime watch things when i go down on her. honestly i know that this is a super toxic relationship but i love her so much and have tried so hard in this relationship with the time and effort i put in everyday it just sucks all of it tldr gf thinks of ex during intimate time after 7 years of relationship and gets turned off just about every time because she pushed herself on her ex and her ex didnt care about having sex and she didnt like the idea of being in his position. so it has tanked our relationship and everything feels distant and we moved to new place with 15 month lease no one can afford to break. i feel stuck,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 22:32:58 UTC,2,1,0.75,,,0,0
1j626pw,my chronic illness has taken my will to live,i 22 f have had a chronic condition for more than 10 years now. the thing is its something i havent seen mentioned before or other people experiencing it. i feel so alone and ive seriously considered an escape route in the sense that i genuinely do not have a will to live. i have a chronic sore throat and its ruining my life. i cannot drink or eat anything cold without getting ill after. absolutely anything. i cannot just eat ice cream and enjoy cold drinks. i always have a lump in my throat no matter what i do. after i eatdrink something cold or when im sick this lump gets thicker and inflammation follows. but the worst of all is second hand ciggarette smoke and other dense smokes. just feeling it makes this lump get thicker and i start coughing. i cannot walk normally on the street and always have to avoid smokers that are everywhere. i cannot go out to bars hang with people my age because theyre all smoking. i am the insane one. the doctors do not care since there is no concerning inflammation and ive been told to just deal with the smoke and avoid it as if thats possible. i live in eastern europe ive also had my tonsils removed because the inflammation affected my bones and heart but even after that theres been no improvement. the thing thats causing it is a bacteria called staphylococcus aureus and this chronic state most likely developed when i failed to do a treatment properly. ive been desperate to find an explanation for my pain on my own and was able to find just one scientific paper studying the sensitivity of this bacteria to second hand ciggarette smoke. i wish i could live somewhere isolated without pollution from smoke but its not likely since im just an average woman. no skills to survive on my own nor the resilience for that. i am so tired. i do not see a future for myself. ive never had a relationship due to some other reasons in the past and i dont see myself having one because of this. also sorry if this isnt the appropriate sub for this. i mostly posted this as a cry for help and maybe to attempt at finding people who relate. ill remove my post if needed. thanks for reading.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 22:28:51 UTC,5,1,0.67,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0
1j623o7,i just broke up with my partner because they didnt even realise theyd cheated on me,life is feeling real batshit today. came across my partners alt account on social media. open to public viewing. they described it as an orgasm journal where they seemed to be exploring self pleasure. cool love that. very datadriven. cut to a post about collective episode with another online user. they had been exploring what sounds to be a lot like mutual masturbation where youre turned on by the idea of someone watching viewing things through a datadriven lens in the name of research. naturally i lost my shit and messaged them. we called and i told them all of the assumptions id made. they didnt say i was wrong just said its research. i feel like im getting pulled into insanity and delusion here. it feels like kink gone wrong. what do you mean its research?? research is ethical? having sexual conversations around topics that arouse you with another person for the purpose of sexual pleasure sounds like infidelity to me? i cant believe i had to tell this person who most of the time has their head on square amp thinks intelligently and rationally that this constitutes as cheating. its not research or data what are you talking about!! theyve just posted after our break up yes im going to stop looking but its been 12 hours please let me wallow that theyre open not poly. fast fucking turnaround when we were in a monogamous relationship literally 8 hours ago. we were in a long term relationship and i cannot for the life of me process that this is the way it ends. can someone please tell me im not going insane? edit just to clarify weve had in depth conversations around our expectations of a monogamous relationship. i didnt specifically set a boundary of i am not comfortable with mutual masturbation online in the name of research because.. thats very specific and not at all a normal conversation to have lol. but i did explain what would be uncomfortable or dealbreaking for me and i would fully put the onus on them to have needed to clarify in this situation instead of going in blind because i think its very clearly something i would take issue with based on every other conversation weve had on the subject.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 22:25:00 UTC,2955,110,0.97,,,0,0
1j61ohl,my sisters life is ruined ig?,tw drug abuse so i dont know how to start. my sister hashad a longterm relationship and i even considered him my brother because he was like that with me. they even have a child together. it all started last year when my bil asked my father for 400 but not to tell my sister and he would pay it back as soon as he got paid. to this day he never payed back and he lost my fathers respect because of this. we suspected that he may be doing drugs but we kinda hoped he wouldnt do something like this because he loves his child to the moon. there were few incidents where he acted off we never interpreted much into this and just hoped everything would be okay. he works in a field where the future is the secured and a few weeks back he told us that he and his other colleagues were laid off but they would all receive loan payments till the contract ends. idk it came with a surprise and i had a thought that maybe he was the only person that got laid off. i asked my bf about it because his father works in the same company but in a different department. he said he didnt know anything about this. well wednesday was the incident that ruined my sisters life. we dont know what happened exactly but my sister has ended the relationship for good and threw him out because she found drugs. she told our mom that he had a history with drugs a long time ago but he swore it would never happen again. since yesterday he is supposedly in rehab. i dont how to talk to my sister about this and i dont know what to think myself. he was like a brother and i always defended him to everyone. i am scared what will happen in the future i mean what if he collapses again? right now my sister is a single mom who works full time with only a half day daycare. i dont know whether my bil was under influence when he was watching my nibling. there were times where he was alone with my nibling for two weeks. was he driving under influence? and was my nibling with him? for how long was the abuse? will my sister recover from all this? was he thinking about what his abuse will do to my sister and nibling? was he even thinking? there is only so much hurt that a person can endure and my sister had enough in her life. my mind all over the place and i have so much questions i would like to ask but i know that i cant get an answer. i would like to tell my bil how disappointed i am but i know that this would not help his rehab. my mind is all over the place and my heart is hurting and i cant talk to anyone expect my mother but she feels the same way expect that her heart hurts more because this is her daughter. i dont know what to do right now. i dont know what to think. i dont know what to feel. i dont know how to help my sister. i had to get this off my chest thanks for reading,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 22:06:17 UTC,2,0,0.75,,,0,0
1j61hol,i stopped focusing on myself because of my husbands actions,me and my husband have been married for 3 years and we had a rough start to marriage we were both very toxic to each other and ended up putting hands on each other but over time we go the help we needed and we are trying to rebuild but its been difficult very difficult. he was a virgin when i met him and he was my second partner ive been with. lately ive been feeling very lonely and discouraged from trying to be sexy around him before we got married and were dating he was very horny all the time and wanted it almost 3 or 4 times a day but now im lucky to even get with him once every week or 2 weeks and ive noticed that its always me initiating it also he doesnt really touch me he straight just only goes to fumble my boobs and nipples then goes down on me then we only do missionary and doggy thats it and it takes about 30 min. once i didnt initiate at all and wanted to see how far he will go to not having sex it was a month and thats because i couldnt handle it anymore. recently ive been trying to talk to him about it but he says that he wants to build up emotionally because of our past and doesnt want to focus on the sexual stuff which i feel is important too. ive bought lingerie to maybe inspire him but all he does is say i look beautiful and thats it he doesnt go feral he doesnt dirty talk he doesnt admire me he doesnt role play he doesnt grab my ass nothing we dont even make out. im starting to feel more like a roommate i stopped putting in the effort of being a woman i stopped shaving i stopped plucking my eyebrows i stopped waxing or trimming i shower only once a week because i thinks whats the point? and yes ive brought this up to him multiple times and he says i still look beautiful and thats he still loves me. i just dont feel wanted or desired i dont know how else to explain it to him. ive said to get home and throw me on the bed and fuck the shit out of me but he says that no because he comes tired from work and dirty which i dont give a fuck ive told him to look for more positions to try but he always says well you research and ill do it. which i dont want i want it to come out of him to want me to desire me. ive put lingerie on and once i really out did myself i got my hair done and shaved trimmed everything but then he said that he doesnt get turned on by lingerie but he also doesnt know what turns him on. also one time we were getting into it and he pointed out i missed a spot when i shaved down there which made me feel really embarrassed and we ended up not doing it. i dont know what else to do really ive brought this up to him a hundred times but he never gets the point and leaves it to me. what do i do? i feel so frustrated with the situation,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 21:58:26 UTC,3,6,1.0,,,0,0
1j61gr1,broke up with partner but the real reason is his penis didnt satisfy me.,we were in an open relationship and i have several other regular sex partners of 10 years and five years. i also have hookups with others. there were some differences that caused me to end the relationship. however i am a size queen and know i need it packed to feel fuflilled. needless to say it afected my satisfaction a lot! im really sad that i settled for someone who didnt satisfy me. i tried to approach sex life as something for us to build on. as this was a newer relationship. but i never craved him when we were apart and i would not miss him physically. this signaled an end to me! i guess size really does matter and i just needed to find out.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 21:57:20 UTC,0,7,0.25,,,0,0
1j61gar,is there a right way to tell my christian brother about my sexuality?,hi this is my first time writing here so i hope it makes sense. i am a 21 year old female living in a generational christian family. being told your entire that married and have kids is something i have to do and that if i dont now i will someday. so when i found at the age of 14 that i am asexual and just a couple years after bisexual. i kinda felt relived but also terrified. i have only told my cousin and she was very accepting of me and we tell each our problems all the time. i have been debating on telling my brother about my sexuality for a couple years. just the two of us are going on trip this can either going to ruin our whole trip or strengthen our bond. the biggest problem is that i am worried he will think i am too young to talk about these topics and hell say i can change either when i am older or when i find the right person. all that to say that i love my brother but knowing his biblical stance on sexuality has made this very difficult for me to say anything. anyways thanks for reading my rambling i havent 100 decided to tell my brother but i hope to soon.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 21:56:46 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j61dns,my mother is most likely the cause of my uncles suicide.,today i learned that my mother was most likely the catalyst for my uncles suicide and im devastated. wednesday night she kicked me out of her car and left me on the side of the road because we were arguing and she was caught in one of her many liesgaslights. i spoke to my grandma today about it and she came clean about the reason behind my uncles suicide. i never met my uncle he committed suicide at a young age while being held in jail. the note mentioned specifically because he felt like a failure he was deep into alcoholism at the time. my grandma sat me down and told me the events that led up to his death. mom and my uncle were both extremely drunk with mom driving and my uncle being the passenger. they got into a nasty fight and mom kicked him to the side of a highway and told him to walk home. so he did. he mistook another house as his own and woke up to the police ripping him off the couch. he was arrested for breaking and entering and disorderly intoxication. he was sent to sit in jail for 60 days. he committed suicide on the 2nd day. if mom didnt leave him on the side of the road he would most likely still be here. theres a part of me thats extremely vindictive of her for doing so but another part that knows that she didnt intend for it to end that way. it pisses me off that im so understanding about it and it devastates me.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 21:53:32 UTC,150,11,0.92,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0
1j61aoy,im turning 18 today and i cant even afford a cake.,today is my 18th birthday a milestone thats supposed to feel like the gateway to adulthood independence and new beginnings. but instead of feeling celebrated i feel overlooked. instead of joy theres this heavy weight in my chest pressing down on me making it hard to swallow the disappointment. for almost two months now my father hasnt been able to work due to a jobrelated injury. money is tight so tight that even something as simple as a cake a small token of acknowledgment is out of reach. i understand. i really do. i know its not their fault and i know they love me but that doesnt make it hurt any less. birthdays are supposed to be special a day when you feel seen. but mine never really have been. ive had birthdays forgotten birthdays i had to share like they werent fully mine birthdays that felt more like an afterthought than a celebration. and now here i am reaching a turning point in my life and it feels like just another ordinary day except worse because deep down i wanted it to be different. what makes it harder is the facade i feel forced to maintain. everyone around me assumes im fine that im well off that things in my life are smooth. my friends ask me what my plans are and i dont even know how to answer. do i pretend i have something lined up? do i admit the truth? how do you explain to people that your birthday this huge symbolic moment feels hollow because even the simplest things are out of reach? i keep telling myself to be grateful to focus on what i do have but id be lying if i said i wasnt struggling. its not about material things its about feeling valued feeling like this day matters feeling like i matter. and right now i just feel invisible. i know life isnt about birthdays that one day in the grand scheme of things shouldnt define anything. but when you spend every other day just pushing through birthdays are supposed to be different. theyre supposed to be a pause a moment where you feel like the world sees you. but today i feel like im standing in the middle of a crowded room screaming for someone to notice me and no one even looks up.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 21:49:53 UTC,11,13,0.92,,,0,0

1j5zzni,i want to get him out of my brain,i dont know where to begin but its been eating at me for a while and for the sake of myself i gotta get it off my chest. i f19 met this guy in 2023 he randomly blocked me a little less than a year ago and we lost contact. its been 9 months and although i dont think about him anymore in the sense where ill openly think oh i miss him out of the blue i still feel like i see him in everyone. ive moved on i dont think about him randomly hearing his name doesnt upset me anymore nothing about him hurts me anymore. the problem is just that certain gestures that hed do certain things hed say every time someone does the same or does something that reminds me of him he comes to mind immediately. mostly its the way hed word stuff and for some reason whenever someone says the same thing or acts similarly its like i have to tell myself its not him. nobody had ever made me feel the way he did which i find weird cause we never dated. kinda feels like i found my soulmate but lost him if that makes sense. it sucks because im in a relationship and i love my boyfriend to bits. weve been dating for around a month now but despite that hes my favourite person. being with him and being able to know him is the highlight of my life so why does that one guy still haunt me? i feel so incredibly guilty writing this because although its not something i can help i feel like shit about it. i feel like the guilt is eating me alive and id bring it up with my boyfriend but i know what hes like. if i do hell start telling me to break up with him even though he could say the same exact thing to me and has actually admitted to feeling this way about someone before and im not mad about it because i understand.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 20:47:53 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j5xpao,the weight of my own mistakes,there was once a boy who believed in lovenot the fairytale kind but the kind that made the world feel right. and for a while he had it. a girl who stood by him who saw the best in him even when he didnt see it himself. she loved him with a kind of loyalty that was rare a love that never wavered even when he gave her reasons to walk away. but love isnt just about feelings its about choices. and one day fear made him choose wrong. he let gonot because he didnt love her but because he was afraid. afraid of not being enough. afraid that one day she would leave and it would hurt too much. so instead of holding on he let himself drift away. he convinced himself that if he stopped putting in effort if he stopped making her a priority then maybe just maybe it wouldnt hurt when it finally ended. but she never left. she stayed. she still believed in them even when he had already started moving away. and then he made a mistake he could never take backhe gave his heart to someone else before he had truly let her go. at first he thought he could move on. but something inside him shifted. after some time in his new relationship he finally understood his mistakes. he realized how deeply he had hurt the one person who had truly loved him. but he never knew how to make it right. how do you fix something after breaking it beyond repair? how do you face the person you betrayed knowing no apology will ever be enough? he wanted to go back to do something anythingbut the guilt held him back. and so he stayed. not because he had moved on but because he was afraidafraid that if he left his new relationship to make things right he would once again be the villain in his own story. the guilt consumed him so instead of looking back he convinced himself that staying was the only way forward. and in his guilt he changed. determined not to make the same mistakes he became kinder. he tried to treat the new girl right giving her the love and care he had once failed to give. but kindness when given to the wrong person is easily taken for granted. and she did exactly that. she manipulated him gaslighted him twisted his guilt into a weapon against him. she made him believe he was always wrong always at fault. every time he questioned her actions she turned it around making him doubt his own reality. whenever he felt she was wrong she made herself the victim and made him feel like he was the one to blame. slowly he lost himself. the person he once wasthe person who understood things clearlybegan to fade. and as you already know he never spoke up. regret became his shadow. guilt his reflection. he had apologized to the one he had hurt over and over again but some wounds dont heal with words. he had hurt someone beyond repair and now he was paying the pricenot just through his own pain but through the way he was now being treated. he wanted to move forward to leave it all behind but no matter what he did the past followed. every quiet moment became a reminder of what he had lost. every time he tried to love again he feared he would be taken for granted just as he had once done to her. maybe this was karma. maybe this was what he deserved. or maybe just maybe he still had a choice. as he stood at the edge of everything he had been and everything he could become he realized something he had no idea what came next. would he ever forgive himself? would he ever find peace? or would he always be haunted by what he had done? he didnt know. but for the first time in a long time he was ready to find out.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 19:27:03 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j5xemc,i tried to overdose but i failed. now im even more lost.,last night around midnight i took a few mg of xanax n 300 mg of hydroxyzine thinking that it would kill me in my sleep and no one would realize until i was already dead. but of course with my luck im here to tell you it didnt work. around 1 pm i woke up with nothing to show for it. i made sure not to have any signs or tell anyone i was trying to die but that doesnt even matter now. the worst part of this is that im really dizzy and unbalanced when im walking around but thats literally the only sign anything happened. im so disappointed. people overdose on xanax all the time without even trying actually trying to just get high and feel better. but when i try all i get it 13 hours of uninterrupted sleep and a bit dizzy. people die every day on accident without any thought or desire or knowledge but everytime i try to die it doesnt work. i think its bc im 250 lb and i needed to take more to match my weight but i literally took all of the cns depressants i had and even then i woke up with minor symptoms. this isnt fair. i know so many people die from trying even less and without trying so hard. i also know that some suicidal people are grateful they wake up after their attempt and maybe i wish i could be one of them but im not. im angry and sad and confused about why i didnt die and why i have to keep living this insanely miserable life. i wish i had just died last night but im even terrible at killing myself. eta i did some research and i didnt take nearly enough of either drug.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 19:16:57 UTC,1,5,0.66,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0

1j5wpag,i told my friend that she needs to stop victimizing herself and i dont really feel that bad about it.,keeping events and names vague on purpose. i have a very close friend a who i love very dearly but shes been in bind after bind. her family had disowned her and she has been in like 5 horrible relationships in the past two years and both the places she has worked at in the past two years have gone out of business. none of this stuff is her fault but i think it puts her in a shitty place where she feels justified in her own mind to just not hang out with friends or justified to be rude to friends in a way. i love hanging out with a and i love just sitting around and chatting and watching tv with her while i do art and such like that but i also love getting out of the house on occasion if im invited. for example as roommate b invited bs gf me a and another friend out to go get food. we got all ready and then a was like i actually dont have alot of money so im gonna sit this one out. and we were all super sad and then we all look in our wallets and agree we could chip in a few bucks each to cover as meal because shes been in hard times so much and we go tell her and shes like no... i dont want to... so we go out to eat without her and have a great time and come back and even bring her food back from the restaurant and shes all angry and depressed and sad she didnt get to go. two weeks ago b took a bus to stay in her gfs dorm for a few days and when she came back i picked her up from the bus stop we got some fast food even got some for a and then came back home and me and b were talking and being silly when a goes i hate hearing you talk and have fun like that when you got to go do something fun while i had to work for all those days with no break. and then a goes back to her room. i went to class and didnt hear anything for a few days but i know that a and b argued. then some friends from me and as highschool that we still regularly talk to texted me and said theyre gonna do something fun over this coming weekend and i was like hell yeah i love hanging out with my friends and they told me to ask a if she wants to join in and i call up a and ask her and she goes idk... i dont have my work schedule yet... and i said ok could u text ur boss and ask for the day off? we really all want to hang out with you! and she says ill see. weekends coming around and i just texted a to ask if shes gonna hang out with us and she goes no i have work i say oh im sad you couldnt get work off and she goes oh i didnt really try... they highschool friends didnt directly ask me so i figured i wasnt invited. like girl.... i literally asked you because they wanted you there? and i showed her the texts from our friends asking if a is coming because theyre so excited to see her both friends live a ways away so we dont see each other often and one of the friends hasnt seen a for about 4 years due to moving states and then coming back. and we were all excited and waiting for her to join us. but i go ok... i wish u could have joined us maybe we can pick u up after u finish working and hang out? and she just goes no i think your all going to have fun without me and i kinda was a bit pissed w her so i said she should have take the day off when i asked a while ago and shes just like oh. i could have. but i didnt. ??? girl? this is around when i told her she needs to stop victimizing herself. i hung out with her roommate later that day and we discussed how shes kinda been and b said she would talk to a about how she needs to stop isolating herself. i also ended up inviting b to hang out with us over the weekend instead as the highschool friends have all met b in passing and like hanging out with her. ik this is gonna piss off a a bit but like a could have also hung out with us.... and then a is gonna be mad and not want to hear about what weve all done for a while. im just so tired of her self deprecating behavior where she always has to be the victim who just cant hang out or cant do anything fun and all that bull. tldr exactly what the title says. i told my friend that she needs to stop victimizing herself and i dont really feel that bad about it. thats the end.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 18:53:01 UTC,2,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j5wepk,out of nowhere i met this really gorgeous girl and now im over here secondguessing everythinglike am i even doing this right?,hey everyone to whoevers reading this story. id love to hear your thoughts on it. i guess i should start with a little backstory. around early autumn last year i was walking through one of the neighborhoods in my city. it was my last day at work and after finishing up i decided to take a stroll grab something to eat and soak in the last warm sunny days. i found a nearby bench sat down popped in my earphones and just listened to music as i made my way to a caf√©. at some point i noticed a girl who looked really upset. i hesitated for a moment but then decided to go up to her and see if she was okay. turns out shed had a really rough day. we ended up walking together exchanging contacts and chatting later on when we had time. our first few meetups were easygoing and fun. we talked got to know each other and with every meeting we started growing closer. after about a month i started visiting her place after the gym to unwind a little. and then at some point things between us started feeling like more than just friendship. there was this warmth this physical closeness that id been missing even though i had plenty of friends i was single at the time. shes absolutely gorgeouslike the kind of girl who turns heads wherever she goes. shes tall about 185 cm has an amazing figure a beautiful face and these deep brown eyes that just pull you in. shes got a great body though thats far from the only thing i like about her. shes also a few years older than me. then about three weeks later after lots of time spent together and some really great conversations i went over to her place again this time bringing flowers to surprise her. i rang the doorbell and when she opened the door my jaw literally dropped. there she was standing in front of me in red silk shorts and a top looking absolutely breathtaking. i just stood there speechless until she pulled me inside wrapped her arms around me and kissed me. we headed to the kitchen where she was cooking some meat for dinnersomething she knew i liked even though id never actually told her. that moment just hit differently. it was like she knew me better than i knew myself. that was when i realizedthis girl had completely stolen my heart. later she even got me a pair of shorts and an tshirt so ive have something to wear around her place. i changed sat down with her on the couch and we put on some youtube. before long we were cuddling and yeahthat was when we kissed. the whole evening was just perfect. and now every day i catch myself wondering am i doing the right thing? because i honestly love spending time with this girl. i could really use your advice.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 18:42:58 UTC,3,4,0.8,,,0,0

1j5vn09,i was regularly abused and my son knew about it,i was a mess following my mothers death. it messed with my sleep and i was on sleeping pills. my husband used to work in shifts. our son 16 at the time lived with us. he was a very normal kid. we never even treated him any wrong. few months ago i stopped taking the pills. my husband was on night shift and sons friend was staying over. i woke up in the middle of the night to his friend with his hands on me. i was scared and screamed. i asked him what he was doing and he couldnt answer. i was expecting my son to come in after i screamed but he didnt. i went into the living room and called. he came out pretending he didnt hear me or knew what was happening. i just knew he was lying and he eventually confessed that he knew and that his friend pressured him. i was getting raped for almost a year and he said nothing. i didnt tell my husband because i dont know how he will react. i just told him never to contact my son again and threw him out. i havent directly talked to my son since. i dont know if i ever will.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 18:13:37 UTC,115,47,0.86,,content warning sexual assault,0,0
1j5v8s2,my grandfather passed away and all i feel is guilt,my father was abusive towards me with my earliest memory being him breaking my arm. it all went to court after he tried to strangle me to death when i was 8 yers old. i cut his whole side of the family off and my decision was consolidated when they sided with him and when i was 9 years old despite making it clear i didnt want to see them my grandmother ran up to me and refused to get go of me while my grandfather watched. i felt betrayed by both my grandparents and had not spoken to either of them since. im 17 currently. december i found out my grandfather had terminal stomach cancer and i sat there wondering if i should make contact before it was too late. he had not done anything to me but he was complicit. i carried on as normal until last night i sat there deciding that i was going to write to him after school. the news came in at 11am he had died. months of back and forth on whether or not to do it and he died. theres no chance of rekindling because hes not here anymore. all i can do is sit here and wonder what life would have been like if i didnt make the decision i did 9 years ago and i feel that will haunt me forever. i feel like such a shitty person.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 17:58:36 UTC,4,3,0.84,,content warning violencedeath,0,0

1j5ucsq,i think i am in love with my friend and it is ruining my life,me 26f and my friend 25m met during university but we didnt talk much back then. he had his own friend group and i had mine. it wasnt until a few years after graduating when we ended up working together that we became inseparable because our cubicles are right next to each other. i have pretty bad abandonment issues but i also get attached to people way too easily a deadly combination i know. so when we started hanging out more i didnt think much of how close we were. i was just happy to have such a good friend. i didnt realize i had feelings for him until my birthday. he was running late to my party and i caught myself looking at the door constantly waiting for him to show up. i felt this ridiculous relief when he finally arrived. at the time i had just gotten out of a really toxic situationship so i dismissed my feelings. i told myself i was just trying to replace what i had with the other guy. then a few months later he told me he was interviewing for a job on the other side of the world. i had a fullon breakdown. that was the moment i realized how deep my feelings for him actually were. i cant even tell you how many nights i cried over the idea of him leaving. in the end he got the job but still chose to stay. some part of me thinks maybe he likes me back. hes told me before that he thinks im pretty he cooks for me listens to me vent spends whole weekends with me and just shows up in a way that no one else has. sometimes he makes comments that imply he does want something with me but then he also says he wouldnt date someone outside of his culture we are from two very different countries. so i dont know if hes sending mixed signals on purpose or if im just reading too much into things. to make things worse he recently started messaging back and forth with a friend of his from high school and it seems pretty flirty he seems excited. its killing me. i dont know what to do or how to deal with it. i want to cry every single day. he is going back home for vacation soon and im terrified that hell come back and tell me he has a girlfriend. i know now that a relationship isnt possible and i dont want to lose him as a friend. but i dont know how to deal with these feelings.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 17:28:03 UTC,2,5,0.67,,,0,0
1j5u6ov,why i dont support or celebrate specific group celebration holidays? menwomenmotherfatherprideblack historyetc,i want to start by saying that this is a personal opinion and i understand and also support personal opposing views on this topic regarding individuals who believe the days to be an exemplification of feelings rather than the notes listed below. in the past few weeks ive been hounded on a lot about not celebrating valentines day mothers day or international womens day by people other than the ones id celebrate them for. ranging from people telling me im an awful human being for not appreciating my mom or women in generaldespite this being wholly inaccurate to people threatening to assault me because i didnt do something special for my mom on mothers day. i wanted to hear from random strangers online if my reasoning is sound and makes sense as toward why i dont celebrate them specifically as when i explain it in person people seem to get quite upset with me regardless. i would like to note that around the holiday not on the holiday itself all the time just around that time period i still put more effort and care into the relevant individuals but i just dont like to celebrate the days themselves for the reasons listed below. my reluctance to celebrate holidays like fathers day mothers day international womens or mens day and others that specifically celebrate a group of individuals stems from a few key personal beliefs and feelings. 1. forced social expectations i often feel that these holidays create an obligation rather than a genuine expression of appreciation. society dictates that on this specific day i must express gratitude or admiration even if i already do so in my own way throughout the year. it feels performativelike im expected to participate just because its a designated date rather than acting on my feelings when they naturally arise. 2. commercialization over meaning these holidays have been heavily commercialized turning what should be a meaningful moment into an opportunity for businesses to sell cards flowers gifts and expensive dinners. it feels less about genuine appreciation and more about fulfilling a marketingdriven expectation. i dont like the idea of my relationships being tied to consumerism where love and respect are measured by the money or effort spent on a particular day. 3. personal connection to the honored group sometimes i dont have a personal connection that makes celebrating these holidays meaningful. for instance if someone has a complicated relationship with their parents or lacks a strong figure that fits into the holidays framework these days can feel alienating rather than celebratory. its a reminder of what someone might not have rather than an opportunity to appreciate what i do. 4. selective recognition feels arbitrary why do we elevate specific groups on designated days while overlooking the everyday contributions of others? it feels arbitrarywhy celebrate fathers on one day and mothers on another when both play roles throughout the year? why single out women for one day rather than advocating for equal treatment and appreciation daily? it seems more symbolic than substantive and i prefer actions that carry meaning every day rather than confining appreciation to a calendar date. 5. pressure to conform theres an implicit pressure to participate in these celebrations whether its through social media posts attending gatherings or giving gifts. if i choose not to theres often an assumption that i dont care or that im being inconsiderate. but in reality i simply prefer to show my appreciation in my own way at my own time without feeling compelled by external expectations. 6. not everyone experiences these days positively for many people these holidays can be painful rather than joyous. someone who has lost a parent might struggle on mothers or fathers day. someone who has faced discrimination or hardship might not feel comfortable with the broad generalizations made on international womens day mothers day fathers day or international mens day. these celebrations assume a universal experience that doesnt exist and id rather avoid engaging in something that might inadvertently bring discomfort to others. 7. personal values and approach ultimately i value sincerity over tradition. if i appreciate someone i want to show it naturally in a way that feels right to me not because a calendar tells me to. i dont need a designated day to tell my parents i appreciate them nor do i need a specific date to recognize the struggles and achievements of any group. id rather express my respect gratitude and admiration in everyday moments through my actions and words rather than as part of a structured societal ritual. for these reasons i tend to avoid participating in these kinds of holidays. its not out of defiance or lack of appreciation but rather a personal preference for authenticity over obligation.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 17:22:18 UTC,0,3,0.36,,,0,0
1j5u6k8,im in over my head. how do i stay positive?,my 52m fatherinlaw 85 moved in with us from another state due to his declining health. there was no way he could live by himself any longer. hes a solid guy...sharpminded wellread but lately he just sits naps and stares into the void for hours. i work from home and watching him decline watching him die...has started to weigh on me in ways i didnt expect. he says that if he stops eating he wont last as long and things like that. hes on all kinds of meds for cancer to depression of knowing hes dying. in the past two months ive had to give him more showers than i can count after accidents. ive hosed down clothes scrubbed poop from the shower and still not used to the loud burps the constant farting the mad dashes to the bathroom while using a walker hearing his despair as we walk listening to him crumble in humility. i havent said a word to anyone about it because the first thing i feel isnt frustration...its sadness. he had prostate cancer and its spread to his bones. the doctors havent given us much insight into whats next but every day i can see him slipping. my heart is breaking in all kinds of ways. my bride works crazy hours and makes about twice what i make. she feels awful that this is upon me and we even tried bringing in a nurse for a day but after they left he begged me not to have them come back. he likes it here just the two of us most of the time during the day. he moves between the window with a bird feeder his recliner and his books. when my teenage boys are home they watch history documentaries together and for a little while. and we do small things on the weekends. i dont say anything to my wifeshes losing her dad. i wont let her see me struggle. i wont let him see it either. ill be here 100 without a single complaint. but the truth is i can feel it getting to me and my kids can too. how do i stay positive? how do i keep from drowning in this? i knew this would be hard but i didnt realize just how much. im in over my head and that itself makes me feel selfish. ugh!,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 17:22:11 UTC,8,9,0.91,,,0,0

1j5tjlt,my boyfriend is watching his ex and has the urge to jerk off,for some context my boyfriend 23m and i 24f have been in a relationship. he was after me for 1 year dated for 1 year broke up and have been dating for 6 months now. i have an autoimmune disease that is mostly affected by my mental health and can create severe illnesses and damages to my body. since ive been dating him ive been noticing my health getting worse and worse. to add more to the story i found out he was attracted to his workcolleague and made some sort of move check my other post to figure out some more about this if interested but it will add more to the story and will help you gain a better understanding. plus my boyfriend since the start of our relationship has told me how hes a man who doesnt watch corn and has been flexing it to his guy friends and all. so my boyfriend has been recently saying nonstop how hes open for me to check his phone he has actually said it so much it was beginning to be suspicious. i had been noticing him becoming more irritated with me by the second without me doing nothing and i asked him. i told him that i knew there was something he was hiding that was making him so anxious with me all the time thats when i began suspecting and he denied all of my comments saying it was because hes been so busy with work. after some days he started saying it again telling me that i could check his phone whenever i didnt trust him. he was always used to me saying no since i was keen on not doing so since i felt like doing that. there must be a lack of trust in a relationship and thats how they fall apart. so he didnt expect me to say yes this time. i did due to all my suspicions at the moment. he watched me and didnt dare say a word. i gave him some time to be honest with me before looking through his phone and he reassured me there was nothing. i went to his recently watched in tiktok and i found gems there. he watched these typical girls with boobs bigger than their heads move their butts and boobs sensually. then there were many replays of this girl we both knew he talked to before ever getting with me. he didnt say anything and denied ever doing anything with her videos only getting hard and then looking for other stuff to jerk off which i think is a complete lie but still. not only did he break promises by telling and promising me that he didnt watch corn or other girls but also lied to me about it until i figured it out. he was never honest and i believe that he still is hiding things from me just because i didnt figure them out yet. it was already bad that he did this but worse when it was his ex situationship. i need some help and opinions to clear my mind i dont know if im crazy or being rational. i would appreciate other peoples experiences dealing with wrong people and then finding a good person for you. i need to believe that this is not the love i deserve and that theres many guys out there that wont do this to me.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 17:00:28 UTC,0,31,0.25,,,0,0

1j5saoz,my girlfriend said shed cheat on me and now i feel worthless,imtf 19 and my girlfriendf19 have been together for about 4 months now. i know it isnt a lot of time but i really felt something for her. she was the only person with who i could share my deepest secrets without judgement. she knew me i didnt have to wear a mask around her and that made me comfortable. we lived 8 hours away from each other. we met every month or even more frequently. i helped her with her struggles at the beginning. she was freshly after a breakup with a guy she lived with she was extremely emotional since they guy seemed not to have cared for her. he promised to visit her but didnt and only like 2 months after their breakup he started relentlessly calling her. nudging her to go to therapy etc. he even joined her friend groups discord server and that made her so emotional she quit the internet for a week and only talked to me through phone. i helped her through this period i was always calling her and wanted to spend every minute of my time with her. first off it was good. we talked we played games we watched movies. she had her weird habits but i got used to them. eventually we started arguing a lot. i mean i really did all i could for her. she was my priority all of the time. i called off parties to want to spend time with her. i went on a 10 hour train ride just to see her and comfort her in a place she didnt really have a lot to do. but the thing is she never really cared for me the way i did for her. i reserved time for us during new years eve just so i could see her and she had a mood swing or something and called it off since she thought i was getting attached to quickly. we were to meet about 2 weeks ago but she called it off too since our conversations wasnt good. i am not going to lie it was not a pleasant conversation but a honest one nothing to get offended by. just us talking about us in a slightly sadder tone. i get really emotional and jealous like she was talking to her friend that he has to watch something and that shes willing to watch the entirety of it with him. i just thought well why doesnt she want to watch things with me? why does she want to visit him not me? i was her girlfried at the end of the day and that guy called everything she recommended crappy. its like i gave her all this attention and she didnt even care enough to visit me. this morning she wrote me an ominious message would you still want to be around me if i had kissed someone else in the past month i replied that if she would give someone a kiss on a cheek or something which is kind of normal in my part of the world id be okay with it but if it was romantic something that could be classified as cheating i would leave. she then said that it is going to happen and that she would have done it a long time ago if it hadnt been for that that she doesnt go out much and is pretty asocial. i mean that kind of broke me. i never had any meaningful relationship i was always hiding a part of myself and when a person that accepted me came along they stab me in the back in such a heinous manner. i already got cheated on once. i know how it ends there is no redemption no coming back to what once was. i really loved her gave her everything i could but that still wasnt enough.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 16:17:15 UTC,1,7,0.56,,,0,0

1j5rl29,i feel like my boyfriends sex doll,my boyfriends of a year is only my 3rd sexual partner. when we met he told me he hated getting oral but loved giving it. when we first started having sex it was really good. i was worried he told me he was a porn addict previously but the sex was very focused on my pleasure and i was pleased. i did try to give him oral but he would stop it after a couple of minutes and move on to me. during those attempts i could tell what he didnt like and did so i stopped doing the things he didnt enjoy when i would go down. about a month into sex he one day pulled my hair and started face fucking me. after he asked me if i liked having him control me when down there or if i preferred being in control. i told him i was really uncomfortable being held down there and i was really uncomfortable being face fucked. he claimed he liked me being in control. last 2 months or so sex has completely shifted. he hasnt gone down on me. i feel like a rag doll he uses. he grabs my legs and moves me where he wants me and grabs my head and pushes me into giving him oral often while holding me down there. then last weekend happened. i said i wanted to try anal but have been scared. we tried it once before but it hurt and i cried out and he stopped. it wasnt off the table to try again. he woke me in the middle of the night while i was asleep on my side by entering me from behind on his side too. it felt good and he and i have an agreement to wake up sex when we spend the night together even middle of the night. a few minutes in he pulls out and aims at my ass. he pushed in a little i cried out and pulled away no lube used and he has a big dick. he put his hand over my mouth and grabbed my waist and pulled me hard back onto his cock. i started crying from the pain but he just held me there while he finished with his hand on my mouth. when he was done i told him it hurt and all he said was i never said no and rolled over and went to sleep. then he woke me up again a few hours later and repeated the whole thing so i was super sore and have been since. i love him but i dont love feeling like his sex toy. edit im sitting here crying. i felt used but never really thought about the fact i was violated. i grew up in an abusive household and sometimes boundaries and normal things dont feel normal and abuse and bad things do. ive been really emotionally numb to this all and i guess i needed a wake up call to see this isnt okay behavior.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 15:52:12 UTC,6402,948,0.94,,content warning sexual assault,0,0

1j5qsiz,i accidentally walked into a secret russian spy base,back in 2019 i had an appointment at a jewish school in amsterdam. i was told to look for a schoolbuilding with a large fence around it and camera security. once i arrived at the location i saw a building that fitted the description. i couldnt find something that seemed like an entrance but i noticed a gate and door that were open because someone was talking out the trash and walked in trough there. i had taken notice that inside the compound there were two luxury cars parked one with russian licence plates and one with diplomatic plates. once inside it took me a while to find a person but after searching a bit i found a man who didnt speak dutch and was looking at me with confusion. i explained i had an appointment at the school and he simply pointed out to me that the jewish school was the building next door and directed me out of the building. at the school they couldnt tell me what was in that building there was noting indicated there on google maps. and for years i have wondered about what it was because it had a vibe as if i had just stumbled into a secret russian base that i wasnt supposed to find. i was reminded of this incident earlier today and finally decided to do some research into the building located at the veluwelaan in amsterdam. and as it turns out the building was indeed closed a couple of years ago because it was a base for the russian secret service... holy cow i literally walked into a russian spy base 5 years ago. and more importantly i got to walk out of a russian spy base alive!,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 15:24:05 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0
1j5q831,parents called me a communist for wanting more hours on my job,i 17m am a filipino and have been living in canada for about 6 months now. just last month did i finally land a job at the deli in a supermarket after months of seemingly endless jobhunting. however my manager at the deli is... lets just say a not very nice person. shes very condescending and pretty much just has something against the students that work in the deli me included. her very obvious and not well hidden hatred towards the students finally came to a full fruition when she scheduled all the students for the rest of the month just less than 10 hour shifts a week. in fact one of us was even getting just 4 hours in a week. its not like we were being greedy or anything. all of us need the money. one of us needs it to buy insurance for his new car and another one of us needs it to buy a new car. i need it to pay the internet bills in my house help my parents with their payments and maybe soon buy a pc for myself. when i saw my schedule for the rest of the month as expected i was pissed. i mean seriously? we havent really been slacking off either all of us even do our jobs arguably well. when we went to ask our manager about it she was supposed to still be at work another one of the employees at the deli said she already took off. of course we are planning to ask her about the schedules tomorrow. but when i told my parents about it they were not happy. they thought i was asking for too much. of course i was once again pissed. for someone who works as a student and earning minimum wage helping his own parents pay their bills i think i should atleast have some right to extend my hours no? but no of course not. when i told them it should be my right to ask my manager for those few extra hours they then went to comparing me to protesters. no joke heres how the conversation went dad what if the next time i start seeing you on the streets holding a placard? what if you end up like those pink protesters back home? referring to what happened back in the philippine presidential elections me i dont think it will go that far. besides even if it does i think protesting about our hours should also be a part of our rights no? mom what are you thinking? the way youre thinking now youre gonna end up a member of the npa! a philippine communist terrorist organization now this made me even more pissed. but to my parents credit they did try to diffuse the situation. how did they do that? why by insulting the way i do my chores at home of course. they said i needed to prove myself at home first. do the chores well first. like huh? i already do my jobs to the best of my ability as far as i know i dont really know what else i need to prove at home. i mean i guess fair enough??? i suppose theres still a few things to work on i guess?? just so yall know i did consider telling them that my manager was a notsonice person. but considering they already called me a communist for wanting more hours i dont even wanna know what they would wanna call me if i complained about my manager. just do your job and bow down to your bosses thats their motto after all. not even joking. honestly my brainrotted side thinks this is pretty funny but it kinda made me feel bad at the time. my parents would literally rather compare their own child to a bunch of terrorists rather than siding with them! amazing! tldr manager is an asshole gave me bad hours and when i told my parents i was gonna ask for more hours they compared me to communist terrorists,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 15:03:46 UTC,19,10,0.96,,,0,0
1j5q2fl,wife and i got kicked out of a therapy session,things have been rough at home. im 30m wife is 27f. fighting virtually every day. i take my lumps for escalating in certain situations but i feel its primarily my wife that breaks the peace and gets upset and acts over the top angry. then im angry at her for how she acted in her anger then shes angry at me for being upset by it all. its a vicious cycle. anyways her dad offered to pay for us to go to therapy. therapist was a 70 year old guy thats been doing it for 50 years. seems very wise. is all about accountability. doesnt want to hear what the other person did to you he only wants to know how you contributed to the situation. my wife has missed the last two sessions. which hurt me alot as things have been so bad ive been desperately wanting the help to break the cycle. the first time she was angry and didnt want to come. the second time she said she forgot the appointment. i vented out alot of our problems when i was alone this last session and was grilled for my part of it. i talked about things ive done shes done and things that are affecting the children. he said we will plan to get her side of things when we come back together. we both showed up yesterday and he wanted her side of the issues i talked about. every time she went to talk about something she prefaced it by saying i only did this because he did this first etc... even an issue i had with how mean she was to our daughter recently. our daughter is 6. but the story still started out with well she yelled at my sister so i did this. he became irritated and impatient with her. told her that he wouldnt keep trying to beat the issues out of her and that she needs to stop blaming other people and just admit to what she did. she stammered and couldnt talk without trying to shift some guilt first. it went back and forth between them for a minute with me sitting silently to the side. she couldnt get any kind of admission out without having someone else to blame first. eventually she started reading out some horrible texts she had sent me out loud on her phone. it was painful to hear her read it off so robotically but to me it seemed like a step in the right direction because the things she said were awful and she was technically admitting to it by reading it out loud. she got towards the end but threw in one more then he did this so i did this. he said both of you need to get out. this sessions is over. as soon as she finished reading. we both left silently. as i went to leave the building i had the urge to go back. i knocked on his door and asked for a few more seconds of his time which he obliged. i asked why he ended it at that point because in my mind she seemed to be cooperating. he said that its a combination of things. firstly her not showing up to appointments. he helps us outside of his normal office hours as a favor to her dad who he knows from a rehab program. her not showing up is disrespectful at best. secondly it was the combination of the horrible things she said via text the robotic way she read them and her inability to take accountability. i said i understood and thanked him for his time. i dont know where to go from here. things have been so awful. shes been fighting with me and other people nonstop over the smallest things. after that appointment she has flipped a switch thats been engaged for weeks now and is acting as sweet as possible. i feel like its a love bombing facade. i dont know what advice im really looking for. im just sad and afraid i know what i have to do. anyone have any advice towards something like this?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 14:58:31 UTC,1474,169,0.98,,,0,0

1j5ox11,boyfriend wants to get married and im indifferent towards it,back story im f28 and my m30 wants to be married. we were on and off from the years i was 1920 and when i turned 21 we got together offically and i was convinced by him and his mom to move in since i was living alone and my parents are retired in a different country. from the years 1922 he was just not nice very rude and he would always choose his friends over me and his friends were always females. in the early stages his friends or family will tell him to leave me and he would do it and then be adamant on staying friends when i would say no. he also kept crying to me about his ex and how much she hurt him and he hid the fact he would talk to her mom like once a week. when i found out he stood his ground and said no to cutting her off. he only agreed to cut her off because i was pregnant with his child. when i turned 23 during covid we fell pregnant although i took plan b i didnt realize i was ovulating so it didnt work. we kept our son but he was just so rude during my pregnancy he took it upon himself to be there for a female friend all because she was dating a guy and needed help and instead of her going to her female friends my bf was always available. he went as far as to stay out all night and get drunk with her and their other friends and the guy she was dating when i didnt want him to and when he returned home he cursed me and his mother out because i held him back in life. i also had told him for years how important marriage was to me and he was just so whatever about it. i told him while i was pregnant just ask with a ring pop since we didnt have too much money and i wanted to be married before having a kid and he came home a few days later and as i was lying on the couch he threw the ring pop and said you going to say yes right i said no because he made it seem like a chore or obligation rather than him wanting to. he also spend all my pregnancy mad at me because i didnt want to name our son after him. when ive told him since i was 19 and even before when we were sort of friends at 16 that i do not want to name my son after their father name. fast forward our son is born and he is currently 4 and throughout these 4 years he keeps wanting to be married and i told him unless he has a career were he can care of the home expenses what is the point. since our son been born ive made almost all the money paid our rent our bills hes has jobs here and there. he just made one year at his current job and he does pay his part but even before our son and now im also paying like 6070 and he pays the rest and theirs been times ive paid 100. i told him if he becomes a police officer id feel okay and comfortable marrying him since its a good paying job and he can support us and he wants to and hes doing it for him and for us to be married. but i also feel so indifferent like i dont see the excitement in calling him my husband since we skipped over the step. sometimes i feel like its my fault and i should of ignored that he threw a ring pop at me and other times i feel like if i would of accepted it i would be open to constant disrespect from him in the future. him as a father super good and kind he takes our son to school and picks him up he lets me sleep in and sleep whenever. he tries to pay for dates when we are out our son and him have a strong bond. he gets me flowers offers to cook even it it doesnt taste the greatest. overall him as a dad and a partner is nice i do feel spoiled. but because i cant let go of how he treated me im always going to have this fever hes going to revert back.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 14:15:54 UTC,3,9,1.0,,,0,0
1j5owrb,i cant stand people coming over to my place but i dont mind visiting them at theirs,title. im extremely introverted and my social battery runs out very quickly but that being said im definitely not antisocial. i have three close friends that i love dearly and i dont usually struggle with making new connections. however i always make up excuses to not let people come over especially when its a one on one hangout because i feel like at some point im just too tired to hang out in contrary to them and i just have to wait for them to decide to leave. it makes me feel horrible to essentially kick my friends out so i dont do it but after a couple hours im pretty much done socialising and switch to survival mode. when its me who comes over to other people i can just leave at any given moment when i feel uncomfortable. does anyone else struggle with this? i just treasure the tiny piece of space that i have too much to let people into it even if theyre my friends but never allowing people to come over probably makes me seem like a weirdo. if i were to tell my friends why i always insist on visiting them instead of vice versa theyd probably get offended that i get tired of their company at all.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 14:15:36 UTC,7,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j5oph1,i f24 thought this word was degrading but why did it turn me on?,ive been dating this guy for the last four months and he is genuinely one of the kindest most wholesome people ive ever met. if wholesome was a person it would be him. hes loved and respected at his job and church and i admire him so much. last night though something happened that i cant stop thinking about and i just need to get this off my chest. we were intimate and he was a little rougher than usual not in a bad way at all. it was different but i liked it. then completely out of the blue he leaned in and whispered in my ear calling me his little slword. i was so caught off guard. ive never been called that word before in my life and i always assumed id be offended or upset if i ever was. but instead i liked it. a lot. so much so that i instantly came. and now im just sitting here confused about why that word something that should have made me uncomfortable had the complete opposite effect. it felt wrong but at the same time it felt good and i dont know what to make of it. i guess i just needed to put this into words and get it off my chest its just unlike me to like such a word like that.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 14:07:47 UTC,450,106,0.87,,,0,0
1j5on2i,i dont know if ill make it past april,i dont know why im posting this. maybe i just want someone to know. maybe i want to feel like my existence mattered to someone even if just for a moment. even if by strangers. ive had a specific date in april marked as my death day. ive tried to get help. i reached out for therapy at multiple locations. ive contacted help lines and end up feeling like a waste of space on the line. i contacted a couple more places and even i told them they were my last chance. but every single place has waiting lists. no matter how much i say i dont have time to wait they just tell me to hold on. i dont think i can. im drowning and i cant breathe. this feels like it. i dont know if i actually want to be saved or if i just want people to understand that i fought. that i tried. that i didnt just give up for no reason. i feel invisible. even when im here i dont feel here. its like im just moving through the motions waiting for the date to come. my whole conscious life has been abuse. i cant get everything out of my head. im an adult now i have to move on but i cant. im stuck and i cant get help. real help! the last therapist i had was in my late teens and she said one day i would just go and kill myself. i wish i could tell her how right she is! i tried to prove her wrong and failed! i dont know what i want from this post. maybe just to feel like someone sees me before i disappear. maybe to feel like i wasnt completely alone in this. april is coming so fast and i tried but i cant anymore.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 14:05:12 UTC,2,5,0.63,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0
1j5o8uu,i broke up with my girlfriend of almost four years and i regret it,its almost been a year and i made a mistake.in june i broke up with my girlfriend of almost four years because we were going away for college and we were both going out of state on opposite sides of the country. i thought it would be the best thing for us but its been the opposite. i really hurt her when we broke up. the first few days i thought this was going to be the best thing for me and i just tried to push her out of my mind as much as i could but i just kept feeling like an asshole. she loved me so much and i took it for granted. she would do things for me all the time just because and never expect anything in return. she would constantly put me ahead of her and also just loved me no matter what i was going through. i couldnt stop thinking about her and during my first week of college i was so excited about what was going on in my life and i wanted nothing more than to just text her and let her know what was going on. it bothered me that in the almost 3 months we had been broken up at that point she never once reached out to me. i wanted to know how college was going for her i wanted to know how she was doing. how could the girl who i once had this amazing love with not try to reach out to me once? i texted her letting her know that i had been thinking about her and that i hoped she was doing well. she kept things super brief and said she hoped i was doing well but i wanted to talk to her so much more so i poked about what she had been doing and in two months she had done so much and she was going to this great huge school and was doing all of this without me. i know i shouldve been happy for her but it just made me sad and angry. we didnt talk for a month after that until she sent me a picture of a tattoo she had gotten. i was so excited that she finally reached out to me. this was the first time since we had broken up that she initiated the conversation. we talked for a little bit and it felt so great. we fell back into conversation like back when we were dating. it felt so good to talk to her again but at the same time it made me feel sick that i knew so little about what was going on in her life now and i was only hearing so little about it. i sent her a text telling her how happy i was for her and how what shes doing seems like such a great experience for her and she never responded. that hurt a lot. i looked at her tiktok and instagram for the first time in months and i just wanted to throw up. she is living this whole life without me. she looks happy and most of all beautiful. like how dare she be so beautiful and smile at people with smiles that were once mine? i would go to her spotify and i would be so paranoid that one of those playlists was dedicated to someone that wasnt me. i felt so selfish and angry and mad at the world and at myself. i had to push her out of my mind so i started seeing someone. i wasnt even really interested in them. lookswise they were nothing compared to my exgirlfriend. their personality was so dull and boring compared to my ex and in the end i ended up just feeling like this huge dick for stringing someone along for months just to get over my exgirlfriend. i went home for my christmas break from my college and it got even worse. knowing that we were in the same town and just a drive away from each others houses made me feel insane. i got so nervous that i was going to run into her any time i left the house. i thought about going christmas shopping in the mall she worked at so i could accidentally run into her and then would just get sad because i was becoming this huge creep. i wanted to text her every day asking if she wanted to get coffee and i never did because nothing would hurt more than knowing she didnt want to see me. i texted her merry christmas and she was nice about it but she didnt want to talk to me anymore after that. and then i saw she went back to her college before me and it was painful seeing her with all her friends having so much fun and having so much fun without me. seeing her cozied up with a girl on her instagram makes me feel like im going to throw up. i see them post together all the time and i just want to know if theyre dating. how could she date someone so soon after 3 almost 4 years? how could she be so brazen and post her and that girl getting coffee and going on dates together? does she not think ill see it? i think i would feel worse if it was a man. the thought of some man looking at her the way i used to and touching her and being intimate with her makes me angry and sad and violent all at the same time. i would stalk her pages all day while i was still in our hometown waiting for her to post something and getting nervous when she would. how could she be having so much fun and be so happy all without me? we were each others first love first kiss first everything. and now i dont know if shes doing that with other people. things got a little bit better when i went back for my second semester of college but i still just cant get her out of my mind. im starting to see another girl now to try and get over my ex and shes again nothing like my exgirlfriend and i dont think there will ever be anyone like her.when i first broke up with her i didnt think it would hurt this much. i guess in the back of my mind i thought she wouldve fought for us. i thought she wouldve texted me more when we were broken up i thought she and i honestly wouldve gotten back together at this point. im so insanely in love with her still and i brought this on myself but i thought i was doing whats best for the both of us. i guess i didnt appreciate or realize the things that she did for me while we were together.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 13:50:08 UTC,0,16,0.41,,,0,0
1j5o5qn,is it ok to be confused and overwhelmed when figuring out what you want?,a year ago i was stressed and scared that being a software engineer would ruin my plans to try and be creative.. i was dead set on it but i watched the creative industry crumble and i see how corporatized it really is.. it makes sense why people go indie. so i shifted focus because of the news and im just questioning what i want to do and how. now i just dont care or stress about being creative.. i dont mind doing it on my downtime even if i suck at it. ever since i traveled across the country i feel myself wanting to find a new place to live.. a place that vibes with me especially outside the us. but ill likely need to advance my education become a genius to be considered a hire for an overseas business. im just not fit with my associates degree. so i feel stuck. i may bite the bullet and get a software engineering degree but only so i can live somewhere cool and feel at home.. edit i moved from one interest to another and im feeling overwhelmed because of the news and i just want to find whats right for me but it will take a lot of work.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 13:46:44 UTC,5,2,1.0,,,0,0

1j5mwpv,potentially ableist rant about asd and neurodivergence,im frustrated with how asd dominates the majority of neurodivergent discourse. i get it. i really do. asd is very misunderstood and it very often coexists with other nd types. buuuuuut it feels like everyone only talks about or thinks about asd. heck even terminology seems asd specific. sometimes i just want to find something about adhd and i get told its an asd symptom that can be present in others. erm no. its an adhd struggle too based on self reports from those with a diagnosis. why are most nd struggles seen through the lens of asd so much? im struggling to verbalise my thoughts and im hoping someone gets what im saying. we need space for just adhd just dyslexia just ocd. comorbidities are comorbidities. not the core of disorders. im sick of being told that something i deal with is actually an autism thing and i just happen to experience that just by chance. no. im not autistic. my struggles are not autistic traits. they are adhd traits. wed know that if we stopped calling every trait in an nd person an autistic trait. im sick of my symptoms being seen as an afterthought a fringe case of asd symptoms. acknowledge my disorder for what it is. im tired of being an oh by the way addition haphazardly tacked onto an asd discussion. yes it is ok to acknowledge that some things are asd specific that i happen to do by chance. no not every nd trait is autism specific. my sensory issues are not asd traits they are adhd traits. stop telling me its okay to acknowledge that some things are asd traits that others experience. what are you implying? and im definitely not arguing everyone is a little asd. thats stupid and if you manage to get that out of my rant i cant help you. im saying validate my struggles as they are. not because they overlap with asd. whats funny is my friend who says this doesnt pick up on the fact that it hurts me when they say these things.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 12:55:47 UTC,1,5,1.0,,,0,0
1j5cw2b,i think my dad is a pedophile.,some things that has caused me to think this. he used to touch my butt when i was younger and my upper thighs. when i told him to stop all he did was laugh at me and tell me i was sensitive. a couple weeks ago he touched one of my friends feet. my friend about 5 of us were sitting on top of a table during a competition. thats when my dad came over and touched one of my friends feet. my friend didnt really seem to notice he doesnt know my dad very well but since he used to touch my butt i got a little freaked out. this next thing might just be a weird thing but i found a letter in my dads car. it was written by a young girl and she described her family. my dad teaches high school so why would he have a random letter from a young girl? when i asked him about it he got really madnervous and looked in the trash for it. im not completely sure honestly if he is a pedophile. but every time im around him i get this awful feeling.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 02:19:50 UTC,1,0,1.0,,content warning sexual assault,0,0

1j5dg6w,my friend is suicidal and i think im starting to hate them because of it.,sorry about the calous title i need to get the worst out of me. my friend is a wonderful person. hes so funny and kind and smart. his laugh could light up a room with minimal effort. that is when hes not in a depressive episode. he grew up in an extremely abusive home and has since been diagnosed with eating disorders anxiety and severe depression and bpd. ive been friends with him around 2 years ago and holy fish paste has it been a ride. i dont even know how we got to this point in the friendship but he just vents to me. no warning no nothing. ill ask him where he is after ditching classes for weeks on end and hell go oh im at home___ im kind of losing it right now. im smashing my head on the wall. or something like that and it makes my stomach turn. because i know hes gonna tell me some gut wrenching reason as to why hes not there and its like. so draining. he has so many problems that could be simply fixed by putting in effort and making active choices to better his situation but he refuses to. i twll him he needs to move in with family that offered to house him? he stalls until the offer is no longer available. i tell him his teachers arent praying on his downfall that hes just a serial truant? he continues skipping class and lets his grade slip. i tell him his equally mentally ill boyfriend is making his mental worse with endless lies and manipulation? hell skip classes and then post with his boyfriend later on. its just like. im so tired of being scared to check his messages because im gonna have to talk him off of the ledge for the third time this week. im scared to answer unknown numbers because he has me down as his emergency contact if he ever gets put in the ward again. im scared to talk to him about the things he does that genuinely pisses me off because i think hell kill himself. im so scared that hes just consistently on the verge of ending it all that i never go against him. even on the little things because if he ends it and that note comes out noting things i did wrong i wont be able to live with myself. so i dont do anything. i just let him vent despite it making me feel so hopeless. i let him do shit that pisses me off because im scared. im a huge fucking pussy and a horrible friend and my worst fear is that hell do it anyway and ill have to apologize to everyone he loved because i didnt do enough. and before you try to tell me to tell him to get help he already has a therapist and is medicated so theres not much else i can do except be there even if i dont want to even if i dont want to babysit him and then shit my pants when he takes too long to respond to a text.. and i never ever vent to him about anything because im scared ill be the straw to break the camels back. i dont really need any help because i wouldnt kms but jesus christ i feel crazy and dirty and so evil. i shouldnt hate him for things he cant control but a part of methat grows every time he impromptu texts me asking if i hate him beleives that hes in full control hes just comfortable being where he is. sorry for the run on sentences and bad grammar and general doodoowater backgrounds and explanations im just typing my thoughts at this point i dont know.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 02:49:07 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j5mosy,my mom might never be the same,ok i know the tag is bad but let me clear stuff up right off the bat. i didnt try to kill myself nobody in my family did and nobody in this story succeeds in doing so. with that said its still disturbing. i go to a high school that is located right next to a prek8 school. my mom works there and teaches prek4 while my brother attends as a 7th grader. yesterday my mom and brother told me of something that happened. basically a kid in my brothers grade tried to kill himself in the bathroom using his belt part of the uniform and was at it for several minutes before a friend of the kid went looking for him. to make a long story short it was a whole 2 hours afterward that the police were called and something was done about it. now this alone is devastating and disturbed my mom but what made me call my post this was this detail of the story. the kid tried this around 11 am. the administration was only made aware at 1 pm. the kids knew this and said nothing. now you may think that its because hes a bully or disliked but he was a smart kid who played football at his school and was generally wellliked. the chilling part was that most kids were just indifferent to the whole thing. they felt bad but nobody was particularly emotional. my brother said that everybody was silent but only a few who he knew feared death. the kid who went to check on the victim got texts from the victim with suicidal thoughts and he said nothing at first. and thats why i named this post what i did. my mom is one of those people who believes that suicide is cowardly and that there are always options for those who feel that way but hearing how a group of kids witnessed one of their try that and then everyone not go talk to grownups was shocking for her. even worse since they have the school has not made anything public yet about this incident and probably is just going to sweep it under the rug. now i might have exaggerated the title a bit my mom is a very resilient woman. but i fear that the way this story played out will affect her for a long time. also normally i would talk to friends and people in school about this but the victims older sister attends and probably doesnt want anybody to know so i ranted here.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 12:47:35 UTC,0,2,0.5,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0

1j5l5t1,my mom hates me,sorry for the bad writing i attempted to post it in an german subreddit first but they ave a limit of 3k letters max and also dont allow blocktext wich is what this would have turned into if i tried to stay within said margin plus deleting a paragraph so i had to use google translate! sorry! i 25f always have disputes with my 59f mother. whenever i dont do something the same as she wants she gets pretty acidic and even if i do it the same way as she wants she somehow always has something to complain about. example of today because of the beautiful weather i should hang my duvet out of my window but the problem is that the winter garden roof is right in front of my window and i cant hang it out because it is a more or less flat level. so i decided to hang the blanket over the edge of the winter garden roof mind you at one point that was quite clean in my opinion at least and if i had hung the blanket directly out of the window she would have been dirty or even dirty anyway. i also had planned and also discussed with my mother that i would wash the blanket this weekend anyway. nevertheless she then sniffed me about half an hour later and she also found it very shit that i sucked at the same time as i was sucking. we have a solar system that produces a very nice amount of electricity in very sunny weather and i thought that it would already be finished with sucking because i hadnt heard her vacuum cleaner anymore and then started sucking my room. however she still has a problem with it because she apparently continued to suck again after a moment which i couldnt hear because of my loud sucker and also ran the washing machine which i didnt know anything about because i couldnt see or hear her from my room on the first floor and that i was not explicitly told that it would be hired in addition she also complained because i took a break when sucking i have a cold and dont have enough endurance to create everything at once my room consists of two adjacent rooms of which i usually only do one because i am more in this but this time i wanted to do both and only took a break in between after i had explained mama that she told me that i always had an excuse. i then started crying no idea why sometimes happens during such confrontations and mama asked in a rather aggressive tone why i would cry now even though there is no reason for it and that we would only have a reasonable discussion. incidentally the howling is nothing that i have an influence i dont because it is to cry afterwards or something i have zero control about whether or when this happens in the surplus she also titled such moments as psycho shit and attempted manipulation. not today but in other similar situation incidentally she mostly teemers my attempts to explain and or counter arguments or ignores them entirely. i often have the feeling of being shouted at in these moments even though she only talks to me very quietly her words i dont even want to do something in the household anymore because it is almost always wrong or not right. and almost every interaction with her consists that she tells me something what to do or indicate that something is wrongdirty or somehow not correct. that would be okay but everything is just too much i dont want to come down to her or talk to her. when i come home and your car is not there im already relieved. is probably not your fault im probably just over sensitive or overreact or something. also i havent stopped crying the whole time while writingtranslating this and my mom came in and asked me in a really passive aggressive tone what was up and why i am still crying. i told her to leave and she left. idk what to do.. i feel like she truly hates me and idk why she does all of this like that. maybe it makes her happy? when asked she always says that she doesnt but idk if i can believe that,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 11:14:08 UTC,1,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j5l4s1,just had to block my fake coworker with no explanation and i feel good about it.,i 19f work with this girl genly 25f. at work she plays the sweet quiet girl and everyone thinks shes so nice and understanding. but behind the scenes? shes a twofaced gossip who talks shit about everyone including the people she claims to be close to. at first we were pretty close but the more i got to know her the more i noticed how fake she was. shed backstab people she said she liked and i realized she was probably doing the same to me. so i decided i was done. no warning no explanation i just blocked her on everything and moved on. the second she found out she ran to facebook and posted some weird fakeintellectual quote about people being obsessed with psychology and personality traits my coworker told me clearly trying to make it seem like shes above the drama. she even told people i blocked her which is just petty. like just admit youre mad and move on. before all this genly used to be super close with another coworker joanna 24f. i asked joanna about something that made her realized that genly was saying behind her back and that opened joannas eyes. their friendship ended after that. so now genly has no one left except two other coworkers maribeth 22f and kenneth 20m who are just as fake as she is. the crazy thing? the day after i blocked her maribeth and kenneth almost got attacked by a dog on their way to work. i passed the same dog later and it didnt even look at me. then genly didnt show up to work that day claiming she had a stomach ache. the timing is insane like the moment i cut her off her whole vibe got thrown off. i know some people are saying i shouldve talked to her before blocking her but i honestly dont owe her an explanation. she was fake i removed her from my space and thats it. im done with her.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 11:12:13 UTC,27,3,0.78,,,0,0
1j5l1e7,sister in law keeps taking my stuff,just couple months ago i23f and my husband 24m decided to move in with my husbands family till were able to afford to buy a house. its just his parents his sister and her son. recently his sister 19f has been using my clothes and shoes without asking. if i leave it in the living room or anywhere else thats not our room shell use it. i left my jacket and a bunch of clutter from the car in the garage cause we were cleaning the cars out and i kept putting off when id put everything away. next thing i know my jacket is upstairs and its clear she wore it cause it reeked of her perfume and her bag was on top of it whatever not a big deal i take it to our room. but this continues to happen with a bunch of other shirts jackets whatever. next instance she broke her one pair of sandals and started using mines which i honestly didnt mind cause i have at least 5 pairs and it was peak summer time. next thing you know i dont see my one pair i usually wear and i just start wearing a different one eventually i find it in mil car with the strap broken. my mil doesnt wear my stuff and his sister uses her car constantly. clearly sil broke it and never mentioned it to me but okay cool whatever. then another pair go missing okay cool she probably got hungry or something idk but whatever i can get new ones so i let it slide. its now colder out now so i go out and buy some ugg tasman slippers and she starts wearing that. this is where i start to get a little annoyed cause id get dressed according to what shoes im gonna wear and when wed head out to the garage my shoes arent there and shes gone. okay moving on. my husband bought me a pair of pandas that i rarely wear i wore it out one time and switched to sandals so i kept the shoes in the garage next thing i know theyre upstairs and sil had just came from somewhere. okay now im definitely annoyed cause literally sandals are fine but sharing shoes is gross. and that brings us to today. ive been looking everywhere for my black leather ankle boots i last wore on christmas and havent seen since. for some reason i decide to stalk her facebook and i see a picture that she posted from 2 months ago from a trip she took to vegas and i could see the top of her shoes and it literally looks like my boots. same dent same scratch. she doesnt own any shoes like that either. im not confrontational so i ask my husband to ask her if she has my boots and she says she doesnt know and that she doesnt wear boots. so now i look like the crazy person and my husband thinks maybe i misplaced it. its literally no where else in the house or the car. hes been aware of her taking my stuff and never says anything to her and the one time i ask him to ask her he gives in and sides with her like she hasnt been taking my stuff for months now. this seems so stupid and petty to get mad over cause shes younger than me but literally just ask. shes the youngest and grew up with all brothers so i understand the entitlement but i grew up with all sisters and its not hard to just ask.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 11:05:37 UTC,6,8,0.88,,,0,0
1j5l09y,15 years in canadanow im jobless broke amp out of options,after spending 15 years building a life here i never imagined i would end up with nothing forced to start over from zero again. i have updated this post to clarify a few things based on feedback. i take full responsibility for my situation. i made many mistakes along the way whether it was not staying on top of deadlines assuming i had more time than i did or not making the best choices. i have struggled with severe adhd my entire life and since i choose to manage it without medication i often leave things until the last minute. that habit has hurt me in more ways than i can count and this situation is no exception. at the same time the immigration system has changed significantly over the years making it much harder for someone in my position to qualify. in the end it was a mix of bad timing personal missteps and an immigration system that has only grown tougher for people like me. i moved to canada as an international student a little over 15 years ago. i started from nothing learning english from scratch completing my academic english education and then going to university and college. i worked multiple jobs as a developer while paying my taxes and contributing to the country i wanted to call home. despite all that i lost everything when my work permit expired a few months ago. i did not qualify for enough points under the everchanging immigration system so as soon as my permit expired my job was gone. because my work permit expired i was not eligible for unemployment benefits had no options just the expectation to pack up and leave like i never existed. the worst part is that this is not just about money or survival. i genuinely loved my job. i had amazing coworkers a great team and what i believed to be the perfect job in the perfect country. i was lucky enough to have made meaningful contributions and had so much more to offer as a 32yearold with a bright future ahead of me. that is why i have so many regrets about how things turned out and i know they will stay with me for a lifetime. i would give anything to go back and keep doing what i love. but because i wanted to do things the right way legally and honorably there just do not seem to be any options left. losing my job did not just mean losing income. it meant losing my ability to stay afloat in the country i call home. even when i had a good income i was living paycheck to paycheck covering expenses for two people. a large portion of my money went toward taxes rent and paying off debts that piled up after i lost my previous job during the pandemic. now with no work permit not even underthetable cash jobs would be enough to cover my expenses and those would not be legal for me anyway. over the years canadas immigration system has become increasingly strict. the requirements kept changing the point thresholds kept rising and options like employerspecific work permits which could have been a lifeline for people like me were removed in ontario. by the time i finally became eligible or was just about to things had already shifted again. i know people who moved to other provinces because obtaining permanent residency was easier there but even that became riskier when some pathways suddenly disappeared. going back to turkey is not just about starting over. it is a nightmare waiting to happen. my brother and i are both considered army escapees which means we would be forced into mandatory military service soon after arriving. the turkish army is notorious for its brutal conditions. as ethical vegans and atheists we would be in an impossible position. the army does not accommodate veganism and being openly atheist is frowned upon both socially and institutionally. i know our time there would be unbearable in every way. the system does not account for people like me those who have given everything to this country only to be left with no way to stay. is this how the system treats people who dedicate their youth education and labor to this country? i do not want to sound ungrateful. i have always loved this country and i still do. i love its people and i consider toronto my real home. leaving would feel like losing a part of myself forever. but after all these years not having a viable pathway to stay just does not feel fair to me. after more than two days without sleep with stress piling up and rent due while i have no income my mind is all over the place while writing this. i also recorded myself talking about all of this for about half an hour right before writing this crying the whole time. it felt like therapy in a way just letting it all out. now writing this feels like another form of that release. i do not know what comes next but i needed to get this off my chest. if nothing else i hope sharing my story highlights how the system fails people who follow all the rules and still end up with nothing. i truly hope it will somehow help future people like me. thank you for reading. i truly appreciate anyone who takes the time to respond with feedback suggestions or criticism.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 11:03:23 UTC,6,50,0.53,,,0,0
1j5l06a,i pissed myself in a ride thanks to an obese couple at a park,i hate roller coasters after this horrible experience. my brother 17 and i 13 were in line waiting for the jurassic park ridecant remember where the line was long and then the person in charge started asking for 2 people and no one moved. we were so tired of waiting and i told lets call him mateo mateo to volunteer us. he was reluctant cause no one had spoken up and we couldnt see the cart but i told him to please accept cause i was tired. when he raised his hand i saw a lot of people turn to us with a mocking expression i started to get scared. in our cart there were two morbidly obese people who shouldnt have been allowed. the security lady came to secure us it was a long bar that gets pulled from up and secures all the people in the cart from the hip idk how to explain and she started pulling down the bar when she reached the gigantic stomach of the man. she tried going lower but his belly wouldnt let her. i was scared cause i wasnt secured at all. mind you i was a fucking lanky teenager and the ride started and i felt myself slipping down. i started crying saying to mateo that i was gonna die and he realized what was happening. he tried to grab me as best as he could cause he also wasnt really secured but he was way bigger than me. i was crying so hard trying to hold on with all my strength it wasnt much lmao my brother trying to help me when suddenly i felt myself go up and almost over the security bar. i dont know how but mateo found the strength to pull me back down and i was panicking so hard. the ride ended and i couldnt calm down mateo picked me up and carried me all the way back to our parents only then did we both realize i peed myself at 13 years old. it was so scared so embarrassed top 5 worse experiences of my life would not recommend. being in a park with roller coasters rn made me remember that horrible feeling. edit my bad at the title i meant peed english is not first language,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 11:03:13 UTC,0,4,0.45,,,0,0
1j5kuga,feeling of solitude,hi everyone does anyone resonate or seems familiar to this? its and italian text so sorry in advance una quercia centenaria che persiste passivamente al tempo sostenuta dal gentil suolo che laccoglie offre sempre il suo supporto ad un uomo mediocre che sempre ha cercato la pace allinterno di una vita in cui √® facile entrare e pressoch√© impossibile uscire cullato dal gentil dire delle moire senza mostrare obiezione. la quercia offre segretamente conforto ai suoi numerosi coinquilini che la abitano ed ignora coloro che le crescono affianco e che cercano di non interferire con la sua quiete. le radici che prima estraevano solo preoccupazioni dai propri simili ora ricavano solo nettare puro e paradisiaco ricco dei pi√π naturali ed immediati piaceri la pace del canto degli uccelli la tranquillit√† di un bosco che come unica imposizione segue le stagioni con le bellezze che ognuna di essa gli porta il rintocco lontano di una campana di qualche paese vicino. le preoccupazioni inutili lasciano spazio solo a presa di coscienza ed accettazione. guardare al bosco e avere nostalgia di paesaggi passati che solo la quercia ha avuto capacit√† di comprendere. voltare le spalle alla citt√† che invece di nutrirsi di ricordi campagnoli e pensieri ciclici senza neccessit√† di crearne frettolosamente di nuovi si alimenta con la scomodit√† ed il rumore del futuro obbligo non naturale non favorendo una vita vissuta unicamente sul filare dei pensieri e levoluzione dellumore. vivere senza unobbiettivo od un peso sulle spalle vivere essendo nessuno vivere solo di artifici umani e fenomeni naturali solo la salute conta nullaltro tutto ci√≤ di cui ho sempre vissuto e tutto ci√≤ che ho conosciuto natura relax ricordi solitudine ed isolamento. cos√¨ come fa la stessa quercia che ho sempre ammirato vivr√≤ questa vita spoglia e silenziosa senza pi√π incappare in tumulti di pianto ed ansia paralizzante accettando il vento che tra gli spazzi vuoti ed isolati soffia e che ricorda allanimo la dimenticata arte dellaccettare ci√≤ che razionalmente odiamo ma che inconsciamente amiamo la pigrizia. lesistenza terrena √® di per s√© mortale quindi perch√® rincorrere la fatica e lansia quando si pu√≤ semplicemente accettare linerzia?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 10:52:34 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
