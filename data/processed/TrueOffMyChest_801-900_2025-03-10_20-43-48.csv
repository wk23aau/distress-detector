1j3x4w1,My abusive mother tried to raise baby birds it did not go well,Edit i forgot the obligatory Click meniton I 16M have a mother who loves birds especially cockateils she has three in total until about 2 months ago two of them ended up getting a little too close and WHAM babies Now my mother is overall not very good at parenting she messed up me and my sister pretty bad But when it comes to her pets she at least acts like she loves them Now when these babies hatched two survived and they were looking really nice and healthy that was until a couple weeks ago my mother was starting to get annoyed at their constant screaming you know as babies do and decided that they were eating enough seed it wouldnt matter if they were seperated or not from their parents they were still being fed by their mother and father occasionally throughout the day so cue her forcibly taking them cramming them into a small cage and not letting them see their parents anymore so they wouldnt scream again i was going to say something but due to being too scared to say anything if anyone disagrees with her on something big she gets explosive i kept my mouth shut i mainly helped her with them when we had to hand feed them when they were infants so i wasnt as worried as checking on them as i should have been becuase i thought she could handle it aparently i was wrong she cant and her decision to seperate them ended up being fatal for the youngest in heindsight i think he was stressed from being seperated from his mom so suddenly and so he stopped eating according to my mom he haddent really been eating too much over the past two weeks or so ie since she seperated them i could be wrong though i have some experience with birds and i at least do my reserch the youngest couldnt stand up just trying to walk resulted in him just stumbling and falling over i asked my mom why dont we take them to an avian vet to see if something was wrong and her words were i dont want to deal with some sick bird its too stressful if they die they die and plus the vet bill will probably be 200 dollars and i dont want to spend that much so cue me flabbergasted i try and hand feed the bird at least a little bit and it works hes eating some and putting him on his mothers cage floor and hes slowly eating some seeds im estatic and i think oh ill check up on him in an hour cue me falling asleep for a few hours instead and i wake up to check on him and hes already passed away i tell her and what does she say oh well ill bury him tomorrow put him in a plastic bag until then not really relevent she buried all our previous pets in plastic ziplock bags and such so thats going to be a nice supprise for the next owner i recommended that she stop doing that but she still does anyway i cant belive im related to her how can one person be so heartless she loves all her pets until they get sick then theyre just another burden to her talk about unconditinal and worst thing is i bet she wont even listen and pretend like it died from some illness again it could have been something else but im pretty confident she killed it tldr my mom shouldnt have birds and especially never should have tried to hatch and raise baby cockateils if she really gets annoyed that easily birds will be noisey i know from experience,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 06:45:29 UTC,3,0,0.81,,,0,0

1j3sl04,Thought I had i could win back my happiness but now I have such a gut wrenching wave of loneliness and shame,Since I was grade 3 there was almost been problems all my life Since growing up in a shitty environment I used to pray to get out of my living situation I had crazy family members causing scenes where the police would be called for noise complaints and question if i was getting abused From beg bugs to cockroaches filling the microwave I was so tired of it but knew I just had to thug it out Since gr38 teachers would have to question if everything was ok and i truly wondered if they were ever gonna call cps but i always hid it Then high school came around and had upgraded to a better living situation yet i felt so lonely I wasnt living with my parents and sometimes I just wanted their company despite the ruckus environment they have always caused However although i had a better living situation that was only thing that kept me happy and somewhat ok with my circumstances But high school ended and that was one of the darkest and traumatic moments of my life happened I realize I had large sums of money stolen from family members as well a spiral of physical trauma from that year From then I knew I had to add meaning to my life so I started working community based jobs and eventually researched getting into health care specifically med school ik a common dream many teens have in education but rarely achieve However I believed i could do it Now enrolled in post secondary i had big goals and was so fixated on getting one thing the typical rags to riches shitty environment to respectable status However one club i went to fucked me up story is in my profile Although it may seem like an overreaction and a story nothing to worry about it really fucked with my mental I overthink so much and made me feel like garbage worthless and scum Now after all these years I decided to call my mental health services at the uni i am enrolled in since I literally had a panic attack before class and started throwing up in the washroom Tomorrow is my first appointment and idk if this is gonna help my mental Idk if i ever had clinical depression plus i never went to see a psychiatrist to diagnose me I am writing all of this because i truly dont where to go online to vent I feel like a failure and wondered if i am ever gonna achieve the american dream or be stuck at the bottom of the totem pole I am trying my best to seem like a good human being but everything going really affects my perception of myself I hope I can show my parents I am worth something,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 02:24:42 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j3s1d5,My boyfriends mom is jealous of me,My boyfriends mom is jealous of me Hi everyone Ive been a long time listener to this podcast and a situation arose that I need advise on Im sorry in advance for any confusion or is my writing is horrible this just happened and Im not on reddit often I 19f and my boyfriend 19m started dating at the end of January this year Everything has been perfect up until now We met each others families were loved by both sides and everything has truly been amazing For some context I am at a community college studying to be a speech therapist while my boyfriend is studying biomechanics and another community college He was attending a four year but chose to come back home because it wasnt for him I am also very religious Christian and my boyfriend and I go to church together Recently his mom hasnt been the biggest fan of me There was one time where we closed the door in his room because I wanted to sleep and we wanted privacy I cant sleep unless its a dark room plus I was exhausted from working early mornings I totally understand if this is against his moms rules and from this point on weve kept the door open because his parents werent comfterble with it closed Since then shits hit the fan My boyfriend and both his parents sat down last night to have a talk They said that they disapprove of me because people who go to community college are lazy and turn out to be nobodies Im a fake Christian and it seems as though my boyfriend has gone downhill They also think in his moms words that he settled Keep in mind theyve known me for such a long time a month Its not like I dont spend time with his parents either We have dinners where Ill bring homemade sourdough bread or flowers as a thank you We talk for hours on end whenever I am over there His mom is a stay at home mom with two boys in total and since my boyfriend is the baby of the family I think she feels like shes being left behind I feel bad having her feel that way but I feel like the longer they push him to essentially break up with me the more they are going to end up pushing him away Another thing I forgot to mention my boyfriend and I have not done anything sexually other than kiss His mom claimed that my boyfriends and my relationship is lustful not love when in reality she hasnt even seen anything about our relationship other than when were at their house Even when I am over there my boyfriend at the most puts his arm on my leg or around my shoulders She is a Christian as well she went to a university that is a private Christian school and was raised to be religious Not saying that my path is more perfect but for more context she doesnt have a bible and she doesnt go to church I thought if anything someone who is religious would understand that in the Bible it says no one can judge because no one is perfect only Jesus can judge because he is and he made us I bought my boyfriend a Bible for Valentines Day she she thought it was super weird Im not telling him read ten pages every night or anything he can do whatever he wants with it read it or not I know this was super long and I feel like Im forgetting stuff but this is basically the gist of it How can I convince his parents that Im not someone that they think I am I was thinking about just having a sit down with my parents first with my boyfriend so they could also give advice but my boyfriend is 100 on my side of everything and sees right through his parents bs I wanted to later on sit down with my boyfriend and just his mom but I feel like its going to take some time Any thoughts and advice is more than welcome here Thank you,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 01:57:36 UTC,9,4,0.85,,,0,0

1j3qh3b,I Am Watching My Best Friends Fiancé Ruin His Life Day by Day,Long time lurker first time poster I have reached a boiling point where I cannot keep this within anymore My wife and I have been watching my best friends life crumbles in front of us due to his fiancé and her manipulations For the remaining of my story I will refer to my best friend as T and his fiancé as Z T and Z met on Tinder during late 2021 and T introduced Z to me and our friend group in early 2022 Ever since I met Z my wife and I had identifed so many red flags about her Here is a summary of what I can recall 1 Z has a habit of trauma dumping her past to everyone she met Even during casual conversations when people asked about her life before meeting T she would reveal about her previous engagement where her exfiancé would beat her in front of her mom just all kinds of sob stories her suicide attempts and generally just all sorts of stories that Z loves telling people that she just met making every conversation with Z extremely uncomfortable for everyone 2 Over the course of their relationship Z had convinced T to cut off his friendships with all of his childhood friends who all warned T about Zs questionable character I remember that the day T told his childhood friend group that he no longer wishes to speak to them that whole group messaged me on Facebook warning me to watch out for Z and that she is bad news even though they have never met me my guess is that T talked about me with them given that T and I are really good friends who went through a lot in life together This is the beginning of Zs gradual removal of Ts friends and her plan to isolate him from his support system What I also noticed is that Z is unable to make and keep any new friends any new friend group that met Z through T eventually got so repulsed by her that they distanced themselves from T and Z 3 Z casually bragged to me and my wife that she read all of Ts personal messages on Facebook and texts to his friends even the things he said before they met My wife and I kept telling Z to be more respectful of personal boundaries especially when it comes to the past but Z did not care and kept reading Ts personal messages to friends and family til this day 4 T and Z bought a house together in 2023 and the moment they signed it off Z quit her job claiming mistreatment even though she always bragged that the job allowed her to nap in her own office anytime she wanted and everyone treated her like family there 5 Now that T and Z are a singleincome household with T working his ass off to cover their mortgage and living expenses Z always asked for T to take her to lavish restaurants frequent trips to Disney parks even having him take her to a week in Disneyworld in Florida after she left her job Every weekend she would have him take her to LA for a different expensive restaurant so that she could take pics and flex for her IG stories 6 Z got a diagnosis for Bipolar 1 sometime in 2024 Ever since she frequently asked T to leave his work early to come home because of her not feeling well for whatever reasons Note that because of this T eventually got flagged for declining performance at his work but despite knowing this Z still had T leave work early often for her 7 It is interesting to note that despite always claiming of not feeling well almost every day during the times that I would come over at Ts place to hang out I observed that Z was frequently able to drive herself late at night to play video games at her brothers house which is a half hour drive away and come home late just fine What pissed me off the most was that during my wedding which was the only time in life that I asked to spend a lot of time with T Z asked T to leave my wedding early because you guessed it she wasnt feeling well To make matters worse Z wore a white dress to my wedding and my wife and I got asked many questions from our friends about that but we just shook it off because we were speechless about that as well 8 While she was unemployed Z decided to go to college for an accounting degree even though she has no goals of working anywhere after She always openly bragged about how she had T doing her college homework and coursework for her because she has difficulty learning since English is not her first language 9 T eventually got fired from his job for his declining performance My wife and I was able to meet up at Ts house to provide T some guidance and support to look for a new job During that time Z told us that she already asked T for a boob job she claimed that she feels insecure in college for being flat chested and she also wants T to pay for a few other cosmetic procedures well knowing that T doesnt have a source of income anymore T and Z will get married at some point in 2026 and I feel like theres nothing I can do about it My wife and I know it to our core that Z is a terrible human being but T keeps giving her excuses and falling for her trauma dumping When my own family briefly talked with T and Z at my wedding they have also all noted that Z came off very disingenuous and manipulative Since my wife and I spent the most time with T and Z our friend group for the most part doesnt know as much about Z as we know I feel like I am watching Ts life crumbles in real time as Z keeps draining his life away for her own use I honestly wish I put in more effort in talking T out of dating Z when they first met I never expected T to end up with someone that feels no remorse ruining his life like this Guess since I cant talk to anyone else IRL about this aside from my wife I am better off letting this out on Reddit,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 00:41:23 UTC,2,6,1.0,,,0,0
1j3qcal,Nobody will ever love you like a mother loves their child Why is this phrase so maligned,Ive been searching on Reddit for a few minutes and everything that comes up is about raisedbynarcissists narcissism narcissism cptsd victims of abuse more and more narcissism I cant take it anymore because this is not my experience AT ALL My mom says this to me but what I hear when she says this is that this is realistically how life is going to be or is playing out for me and everyone else and this is just a factual statement OBVIOUSLY for victims of parental abuse this is patently false but Id like to see the opposite expressed somewhere so here goes my attempt My mom is a lovely person Shes always tiring herself out helping others supporting others lifting them up Im sad and she says she doesnt mind staying awake at night to talk to me Im not a nuisance to her Im cared for and loved In many ways this has put me off of romantic relationships If no one is ever going to to put it bluntly coddle me and carry me through life like my mom has what does romantic love have to offer me IF its not pure and unconditional and unstoppable what good is that kind of love I know I know what Im asking is a tall ordeal but still I just wanted to let people know that sometimes that sentence is true and other times it is abusive But I dont think it has to be one specific thing all the time Context is required in my case my mom is a genuinely wonderful person who only wants whats best for me is supportive hears me out when I have issues Even if she doesnt know how to adequately be supportive of my specific needs but thats for another rant Shes always there for her friends in practical and more emotional ways and she takes care of all of us Shes always looking out for me and my dad and her mother and people she used to work with text her constantly because she just plainly made their lives very happy She wasnt bossy or punitive at work although she praised a job well done she could see the good in every person and tried to help them in the ways she could She believes there is always a place for everyone and just because someone is doing bad at one task doesnt mean they are invaluable She understands people She cares most of all and shes genuine and so it is really weird to me to go online and only read about how abusive that sentence is because my mom is not like that so why would she say it I do have issues with taking things literally btw and suspect to be on the autism spectrum Maybe my whole family is Idk we just do things differently between me mom and my dad uuuf rant over really needed to say this,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 00:34:50 UTC,4,3,0.75,,,0,0

1j3pz7p,My best friend of 15 years nuked our friendship when she met her current husband,So this story is a little bit friendship drama and a little bit bridezilla drama but I have been reading reddit stories for a long time and wanted to get my own off my chest Sorry this is so long Some background first my best friend of 15 years and I both female in our 30s met in college when we were randomly assigned to the same freshman dorm and we had been inseparable ever since Im talking this women was my person we did so much together were there for each others huge milestones and had kept our friendship going strong for so long even after I moved out of the state several years ago I always felt like our friendship was really balanced in that nobody was carrying more or less effort of the friendship than the other I even helped her both plan over several months and execute her escape from her abusive exhusband and was one of only a couple of people entrusted with this knowledge prior to her physically leaving We were TIGHT My husband and I eloped in our state last summer which we had been planning for 17 months prior to the event Due to events with my family we decided to elope with literally only ourselves and our photographer no family or friends to avoid drama I had a bachelorette party with my friends a month prior to the wedding so they could still be involved About 4 months prior to the wedding my friend reached out to me and asked if she could come to the elopement In her words it makes me really sad to think of you getting ready for your wedding on your own My nowhusband is a very shy man but had gotten to know her really well over the years and is now friendsvery comfortable with her and was very on board with her joining us Other than ourselves she would literally be the only other person attending To me this was a really extraordinary display of friendship as she would need to fly to come and it would cost her money which didnt bother her and I was so appreciative Well about 2 weeks after she offered to join us and we accepted she started dating a new guy that she was really into After her horrible experience with her first husband they are now divorced I was so excited for her that she met somebody as amazing as she was Well this is when the drama started At first she just asked if her new boyfriend could come up to the wedding with her they had only been dating 2 weeks at this point My husband and I talked about it and he was super uncomfortable with having a stranger join in I got back to my friend about it and said no its nothing to do with him we just dont want a stranger at our wedding last minute We had plans to do girl stuff like get our nails done the day before the wedding which would leave my husband to entertain a stranger She came back with well he doesnt have to join in anything we do as a group which felt really icky as were people who wouldnt want somebody else to feel excluded the first time they fly up to meet us especially when theyre the partner of my best friend Its not that we didnt ever want to meet the guy just not last minute for our wedding Her response Well you cant tell people they cant fly to your state which is technically true but just felt like an excuse for crossing a clearly stated boundary Either way this started the only fight we had ever had in 15 years of friendship She felt like I just wanted her to be alone in my state weird because before she met the guy she was fine with that and that I was being unreasonable She made plans and bought plane tickets for both of them despite me communicating mine and my husbands feelings about the whole thing several times During this time she and her new boyfriend got engaged after less than 4 weeks of dating I maintained my stance that we were not comfortable with having him come up to meet us at this time She revealed that her and her now fiance had made plans to elope 4 days after us in a different state and were now going to fly there directly after our wedding was over She wanted our nail appointment and stuff we were doing in the days leading up to the wedding to now be joint celebrations for their upcoming wedding too Mind you she did NOT consult me on how my husband or I felt about this prior to making her own plans and was very upset that I didnt react the way she expected me to Instead of being excited like she expected about being able to do stuff for both our weddings at the same time I was just shocked and frankly very upset that she was hijacking our wedding now If she had discussed this with me before just deciding I think I would have reacted a little differently but it just felt so disrespectful to make plans that affected my husband and I without involving us I wrote her a long text to her explaining how disrespectful this felt and asked her why she seemed willing to nuke our friendship of 15 years over a man who was nobody to anybody 6 weeks ago At this point there had been many many conversations about her not listening about having her man come up with her and now about how weird it was that they were now getting married so close to our own wedding My husband even asked at this point if we could move the wedding date or location to avoid the drama because he was so stressed out This was his wedding too so that broke my heart I ended up telling her not to come at all and told her she was no longer welcome We didnt end up speaking much for 2 months and she cancelled on my bachelorette party 4 days before it was supposed to happen I never received an apology or acknowledgement of her behavior for any of it My other absolutely incredible human of a best friend from elementary school ended up coming up for our wedding instead when she saw how stressed and upset I was about the whole situation I am eternally grateful for her Fast forward about 3 months our wedding and honeymoon are over My friend the one who did indeed get married 4 days after us reached out asking if I wanted to be the maid of honor in their wedding coming up in about a year You see their parents are not well physically and were unable to attend the elopement so they are throwing a second bigger wedding for their family in their home state I asked explicitly if she was sure she wanted me to be MOH after everything that happened earlier that year she said yes she was sure I accepted despite some reservations because I wanted her to have an amazing wedding and very much valued our friendship While MOH she kept expressing how overwhelmed she felt with everything so I tried really hard to take things off her plate I researched all the photographers in the area and made a spreadsheet with their pricing contact info availability etc I also did something similar with the area hotels within her price range Were taking many many hours of research but I was happy to help out During this time I also coordinated with the other bridesmaids to order snacks vegan I might add for her wedding dress shopping experience which I attended remotely directly after working a 12 hour night shift I also had already planned and booked her bachelorette party Everything seemed to be going smoothly she seemed happy and had never indicated otherwise Then came the we need to talk text It was a normal Wednesday we had just had a bridesmaid meeting over Teams 2 days before and everything seemed fine When we got on the phone she informed me that she no longer wanted me to be the MOH To say I was blindsided was an understatement She told me one of the other bridesmaids had agreed to take up the title I was obviously hurt but she is the bride so I just said ok if thats what you really want She then said but you can still come to the wedding if you want I froze and then asked so what youre really saying is that Im no longer in the bridal party she never explicitly stated that just that somebody else was going to be MOH and her response was only correct She didnt even have the balls to tell me that I was booted from the bridal party entirely I had to ask outright From MOH to guest in one fell swoop Her reasons you ask I have felt out of sync with you for a while now You were making me feel pressured to do things for the wedding before I was ready to do so I asked her why she never ever said anything to me if the way I was helping wasnt what she wanted or needed she just stated I didnt think it would help I then asked her why she didnt just demote me to regular bridesmaid if she didnt like the way I was doing things Ive done both MOH and bridesmaid before and know how to do both In my experience as a regular bridesmaid I wouldnt be in charge of planning anything anymore unless the new MOH or bride asked me explicitly Her answer was again I didnt think it would help This was the last straw After everything that had happened with her over the last year I was done I wasnt going to continue setting myself up to be hurt by her anymore and it was clear she didnt care about my opinions thoughts or feelings I told her not to contact me ever again and blocked her on everything after that call Needless to say I am not going to her wedding None of my other friends seemed that surprised by any of the events above so maybe she was acting like this before and I just couldnt see Side note Remember how her first wedding was 4 days after our wedding Well her other wedding is going to be 3 days after my birthday Even my husband who is antidrama asked me if I thought this was intentional haha Side note 2 Im friends with one of the other bridesmaids independently of her wedding and apparently my friend had been telling everybody else that the only reason we had a fight around my wedding was because I didnt like that she was also getting married so close to our date Which shows she neither heard nor understood anything that I said to her regarding that situation I truly hope that its just a coincidence that she met her now husband and then started acting like a terrible person Thank you everybody for reading it feels good to get this off my chest,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 00:17:32 UTC,196,32,0.95,,,0,0
1j3pwgn,my friend left me and i dont know what to do with myself anymore,my friend left me and i dont want to be here without him i would normally never turn to reddit for help but im here right now i female have been struggling so much lately i large factor of struggling is about this one guy i bet you hear that so much but this is the only time in my life that ive ever ran into a problem like this i guess i can full on lore drop here i met this guy that ill call steve in early 2023 ever since i met him i had this deep connection with him i have serious feelings for him and ive never crushed on somebody before it took me up until october 2024 to tell him about how i actually feel i visited him at his college right before i told him its the main reason why i told him in the first place when i told him he never really told me about why he didnt like me back steve has always been a very private person but i assumed this would be different after i opened up to him i was struggling so badly i eventually told him that i needed to stop talking to him when i told him that which was in november of 2024 he finally told me that he was gay i really dont know why he was keeping that bit of information from me for so long he had talked to me about liking girls before so i just assumed that he couldve been bi because he did kind of give off gay vibes me not talking to him only lasted like a week and a half because i took a gummy and texted him i tried to tell him that i needed to stop again but he just kept on texting me and i felt bad for just not answering him this man has been the light of my life for such a long time it feels texting him was one of my favorite aspects of the day and it was what got me through dark times because it felt like he was there for me fast forward a few weeks he tells me about this guy that he was talking to he told me that he had been talking to this guy for 3 months and that this was the first time he has ever really liked someone back he randomly texted steve saying that he only had platonic feelings for steve and steve got so upset he sent me a voice message of him almost on the verge of tears i told him that i shouldnt be talking to him about this but i did anyways because i loved him i tried my best to help him through the situation i shared what i did when he told me that he didnt like me back and i told him that i would be there for him day and night which he never ever took advantage of even though he said that this was one of the darkest times of his life all was good until last month steve was starting to act really weird towards me he said that hes sorry if he has been weird he was never answering me despite texting me 247 days prior so i confronted him about it he told me that he went on a date with another guy i ended up leaving him on read and he said I was going to send a text to you in the morning but honestly it just feels more right to do one now Im sorry I was slightly inebriated in my last response and thats not fair for you I do just want to let you know I am doing well enough mentally right now Like am I the best lve ever been no but Im definitely very much in a manageable position right now I know whatever I say or do wont stop your anxiety but I want to ensure you that if there was something going on I would let you know You are a very close friend of mine and you are definitely someone I come to when things are not right The reason I initially said I was just busy yesterday and not what I was actually doing was because I didnt want to make you uncomfortable for anything like that But it is for the best for me to be honest with that kind of stuff and lll make sure to keep you in the loop As for the insert boy name here stuff I dont really want to concern you with a lot of it because it honestly does depict me at my worst sometimes I try to handle most of that without mentioning anything because its usually easier and I dont like getting people involved that shouldnt have to be I hope this kinda helps digest a little bit i still left him on delivered because i just couldnt handle the pain he has put me through i texted him almost a week later stating that i am in so much pain and i cant take it anymore every single time that i try to make it clear that im deeply struggling he never seems to care although hes said that he cares for me deeply just last week i had this very depressive episode and he asked me how things were going and i said not well i genuinely think i am the most depressed ive ever been right now i am at my lowest point i can barely eat sleep or focus im just empty i cant even get up and be productive i dont even feel like im living im just existing you wouldve thought that i wouldve been so happy and excited on saturday but i didnt even care about being at insert my favorite place here im starting to lose interest in everything and after i said that he didnt answer as a follow up message i said im taking this radio silence as a strong sign and i dont want to hear some excuse like sorry i forgot to respond or i couldve sworn i responded originally i had a way bitchier intro to this message but thats not me all the times you said that you cared about me i knew they were all lies i knew i shouldve listened to my gut the entire time i really really really wish i wouldnt have responded to that one message in february of 2023 i feel like all of our friendship has been is me constantly doing shit to be such an amazing friend for you but you NEVER returned the favor and im sick and tired of it i made you all those bracelets i made that painting for you i always checked up on you i sent you a heartfelt message on your birthday but did you ever do anything like that for me sorry for doing so much for people and expecting something small back every single one of my friendships ends like this all youve ever done is just constantly lie to me and i bet you think that i just havent noticed cooking dinner till 11pm going home because you have a headache immediately passing out when you go to bed ill try my best to respond to you any of these sound familiar im so tired of how horrible of a person youve been towards me i try my absolute hardest for you ive gotten out of bed eaten kept my grades up tried to take care of myself picked myself up off the ground and smiled just for you maybe im just too generous loyal compassionate empathetic and sympathetic as a person i genuinely dont know why you still talk to me or why i still talk to you ive given our friendship so many second chances but this is my breaking point im so fucking sick and tired of everything i really hope that when i do end up taking my own life that not a single tear falls from either one of your eyes i always wanted to tell you that id make the sky so pretty and orange for you but i dont want to do that anymore notice how i didnt even mention my feelings for him in that message once now that we arent talking i dont know what to do with myself anymore ive grown so attached to this man and i dont know what to do without him he has been my rock ever since we met he was all i had and now i have absolutely nobody ive been lonely my entire life and i would say that it got worse when i started having feelings for him but now that hes gone my loneliness is ten times worse i am seconds away from writing my notes and saying goodbye i am so picky with who i want to be with if they arent aligning with what i want to do in my future i wont be happy with them long term i dont date just for fun i date to marry the reason i grew so attached to steve was because he aligned with my future im so alone and empty with him gone and i feel like it would be a better place if i said my goodbyes i dont want the space if thats what hes giving me i unfollowed him on everything but i havent blocked him i just dont want to keep going if it means that im not friends with him

1j3puzv,ChatGPT suggested I might have autism Told my friends they were surprised that I wasnt already diagnosed with autism,OK so this is kind of a clusterfuck and I need to get it all out there so here goes For the past probably over a year at this point Ive been chatting to ChatGPT every now and then at least once a week Ive been kinda treating it as like a diary that talks back I dont input too much personal info or anything like that but if Im worried or stressed about something that I dont wanna burden the people in my life with or if I have something Im thinking about and am interested to see how an AI might respond to it then Ill just open ChatGPT and vent Every now and then Ill get a Memory Updated notification where its randomly decided something Ive said is worth remembering for future conversations and over the past year this has built up a fair amount especially about likes dislikes fears and that kinda thing Its an interesting feature and it sometimes makes conversations more relevant or stops me having to go over old things and so I mostly just leave it as it is Recently I saw a trend where people were asking ChatGPT to suggest something that the user doesnt know about themselves based on everything in ChatGPTs memory about them From what Ive seen it tries to be insightful sometimes it is quite helpful other times it is kinda brutal but overall its usually pretty interesting in one way or another and so I decided to give it a try I asked it based on everything its learned about me over the course of our conversations what is something that it thinks I might not know about myself that might be beneficial for me to know As you can tell from the title of this post its response was that I should probably get tested for autism I wasnt really sure how to respond to that I dont really know what I was expecting but it was definitely a lot more targeted and specific than the posts Id seen of other people asking ChatGPT similar questions I asked it to clarify and it brought up things that it had noted about being kind of picky about what I consume stuff about regretsworries related to normal social situations fixations on random things and a few other things that it said was indicative of autism It also reminded me that it wasnt a medical professional which I thought was a very interesting thing to include after suggesting that I might have autism Anyway I kinda put it to the back of my mind and then later that evening I joined a voice chat with a few of my online friends that I play online games with and after a while I kinda brought up with them what ChatGPT had said Their initial reaction was to laugh which I thought meant that they thought what the AI had said was wrong but then they said words to the effect of With how much you talk to ChatGPT Im surprised you hadnt already told it that youre autistic I then said that I wasnt autistic by which I meant I didnt have a formal diagnosis of autism and until this point didnt really consider myself to be autistic and things got kinda awkward Anyway I just took the AQ50 and got a score of 36 which came with the message Scores in the 3350 range indicate significant Autistic traits Autism so I guess theres a fair chance that Im autistic and that somehow Im the last person to know about it I dunno how Im supposed to feel about this or what Im mean to do with this information Im a guy and in my early 30s so it feels kinda late to get a diagnosis with something like this and even if I did get a diagnosis I dont know what it would change for me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 00:12:03 UTC,0,9,0.43,,,0,0

1j3pkvs,My mind keeps me stuck in life and I hate it,This is a throwaway Im a recluse with lack of social skills and courage to just put myself out there I get really anxious of the bad things that could possibly happen and that happens in mundane situations too the worst part is that most often Ill worry so much about a thing then it just ends up being nothing and I realize the worry was for nothing My relationship with my parents isnt great either I am 21 and still living with them but I dont talk to them very much most things I keep to myself then I spend most of my time on my computer wanting to create things such as YouTube videos art music coding and I do all these things to some extent but really I just spend most of my time on YouTube or wasting time in general so really I would like to spend more of my time going outside simply walking somewhere would be good enough for me but I always find ways to convince myself not to or just forget its an option at all Now thing is Id at least tell my parents about the things I make but even that I started to keep to myself because I find myself getting really self aware about every single aspect of what I make this mostly goes for YouTube videos it feels almost too personal to share with them so the few times I showed them my videos I just got extremely self aware of every video idea and everything I wrote for the script I kind of just remained paralyzed and stopped making any videos then went to upload on a different channel they dont know of I also know this girl I met on discord 5 years ago and I would like to meet her and be together with her and I let her know this almost from the very beginning but Ive made a mistake by making empty promises and saying we would meet very soon well that soon just kept getting delayed until now and shes getting tired of waiting and I feel really bad too she really wants us to meet and I do too she lives in an abusive household that I want to get her out of but I cant seem to start taking the steps Im afraid of telling about her to my parents because they might judge me but realistically theyd be alright with it its just my stupid mind making all sorts of excuses I dont know what to do even now I have a job my dad gave to me but if it wasnt for him I wouldve still been unemployed I never had a job besides for this one Idk where Im going with this post just wanted to vent a bunch of things I guess how could I move forward Edit For some clarification my parents are not abusive at all theyre actually very good parents and yet for some reason I grew so distant towards them,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 23:59:14 UTC,2,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j3ozsn,A Former Homophobes Guide to Pride,Below is an excerpt of my story about my coming out process and how I was baptized to save myself from my sins of homophobia A link to the full story can be found here A Former Homophobes Guide to Pride Yes the title is clickbait but it will be worth the read and maybe you even get a few laughs from it Once upon a time I was homophobic At a young age I knew that my brothers homosexual tendencies a euphemism that might be more familiar to some than others was going to be problematic given my familys and my own worldview My worldview believed that A he could change because homosexuality is a choice B if he acted upon his sexuality it was a sin love the sinner hate the sin This worldview allowed our family to isolate ourselves from the truth about the core nature of at least 10 of the population including one of our own flesh and blood One day we were hanging out at a reggaethemed party with a buffet of cannabis infused edibles and libations He hadnt had much exposure to cannabis so as I watched him eat about three brownies and a glass of THC lemonade I grew a tad concerned I failed to stop him from eating that third sorcerous pastry and the situation soon turned to the classic I dont feel anything these edibles aint shit then holy shit what have I done Having been there before myself more times than one should after such an uncomfortable lesson I grabbed the reigns and became his spiritual guide or trip advisor I took him on a walk away from the crowds and instructed him to look at the stars He would bounce between they look like LiteBrites remember LiteBrites Brian I loooooooved LiteBrites then to what if we only die because we accept that we die oh my god we are all going to die Whenever we got to the latter half of these dopamineinfused thought obsessions I would coach him to focus on different topics like back to the LiteBrites or the beautiful design of a parasol and why arent parasols popular anymore he loved umbrellas as a kid Eventually and what probably felt to him like an eternity we got to the point where we could coherently talk about deeper subjects such as our upbringing We talked about when we first started jerking off how we would hide our porn downloads from Kazaa how one time I was looking for my downloads and I stumbled upon a very different type of porn than mine In a single night we tackled topics that are typically done over years of bonding moments between brothers who share the same sexual orientation We were both blown away that we had never talked about this stuff we had so much in common but with a slightly different hue to our stories of puberty That night will go down as one of the greatest moments of bonding and connection Ive ever experienced Ill cherish it for the rest of my life One day while visiting my brother he asked me if I wanted to go to Gay Bro Dinner Party I asked him what Gay Bro Dinner Party was and he simply laughed and said I cant believe Im taking you to this Well Gay Bro Dinner Party is a dinner party with Gay Bro friends much like a BBQ or dinner with Straight Bro friends The conversations that go on at both of these dude parties are exactly what you would expect but more talk about cocks balls and asses actually thats not true the frequency of these topics at Straight Bro Dinner party is equal to that at Gay Bro Dinner Partybut the context is slightly differentkind ofagain we are all just a little bit gay deep down inside When I arrived at the party his friends immediately said you brought a straight person to Gay Bro Dinner Party What were you thinking In hindsight I think it was their way of warning me that they werent going to tonedown the banter and the thematic schema that goes on at Gay Bro Dinner Party would remain the same They were going to thoroughly enjoy watching me crawl in my skin In fact in my first effort of small talk I asked the bros how they all knew my brother and they responded in brofashion at a gang bang I gave a nervous laugh doing mental gymnastics to figure out if this was a joke I decided to just roll with it and pray they werent testing how committed I was to being openminded And with that icebreaker I signaled to them with my nervous laughter not knowing whether this was a true story or a joke that I was one of the cool straight guys they could trust Looking back Im pretty sure they were joking I think I mean thats something I would say to someone clearly on a journey to rectify their former antediluvian worldview But I digress For the full story you can visit this link,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 23:32:21 UTC,1,5,0.67,,,0,0

1j3o0z9,Selfhelp culture is built on guilt not actual happiness,Hello reddit here is something that grinds my gears Why do so many selfhelp gurus push the idea that every fun thing in life is an addiction that needs to be cut out Stop playing video games theyll make you addicted Stop drinking itll ruin your life Stop doing this stop doing that And then as if thats not enough they push this pseudostoic mindset of just focus on yourself and become the best version of yourself whatever that even means It all feels incredibly narrowminded and honestly kind of boring These people act like the only thing that matters is selfimprovement and constant progress But what if I dont want that What if I just want to be me What if I just want to relax and enjoy life Life is already hard enough as it is and it feels like these gurus prey on peoples insecuritiesespecially those who are strugglingand make them believe that the things they love are actually holding them back Theres this obsession with selfimprovement that often feels less about genuine growth and more about selling an idealized almost robotic version of existence Its weird because its marketed as freedombecome the best version of yourselfbut it actually sounds more like a prison of constant selfdiscipline Like whats the point if you cant just exist without feeling guilty for not grinding 247 Take guys like Andrew Huberman for example Sure he knows his neuroscience but does he really have life all figured out Because the way they present themselves youd think they had unlocked some secret formula to existence But to me it just seems sad Humans are so obsessed with being ultraefficient that they forget we only have a short time on this planet And after that A whole lot of nothing So why not enjoy the things that make life meaningful instead of obsessing over sacrificing everything in the name of selfdiscipline I get that addiction is real and obviously some habits can be destructive But whats the point of living if you cant just enjoy things sometimes Why does everything have to be about optimizing every aspect of yourself I think its okay to make sacrifices when they actually make sense but its also okay to say Screw it I just want to enjoy myself I dont knowthis mindset just annoys me Anyone else feel the same way,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 22:49:32 UTC,6,3,0.88,,,0,0

1j3n9k4,I feel guilty for getting a DampD session cancelled,Throwaway cuz I dont really use Reddit but Ive been feeling particularly guilty about this and wanted to get it out there A bit of context this winter has been rather challenging to say the least I have struggled with mental health issues related to major life changes as well as complications in relationships and friendships All this to say Ive been having a rough time but Ive been trying to manage and for the most part have been getting better albeit there are still some harder times With that established back to the main story I am in a DampD group of eight people all in our early twenties Scheduling as Im sure many of you can imagine can be a bit difficult This past weekend we managed to find a time that worked for enough people so that someone in the group could run a oneshot He has put a good amount of time into preparing for it and seemed very excited We had chosen Sunday as the day to get together That Saturday I had planned to travel out of town for a day trip to visit family While I was there I started to struggle quite a bit Like I said it happens sometimes where certain days are harder than others and Saturday it hit hard I felt as though all my motivation to do anything had disappeared and I just wanted to crawl into bed and sob for a while I obviously couldnt do that on the spot and forced myself to power through trying to have as good of a time as I can with my family Here is where I did something I feel immensely guilty for I decided to message in the DampD groups discord saying that something came up and I wouldnt be able to make the session Really I knew I just wanted to take the day to myself as I knew with the way I was feeling I most likely would not be engaged or having fun during the session and flat out just didnt want to be there while feeling like that Shortly thereafter the person running the session decided to cancel moving it to this next weekend Some of those in the group responded to my cancellation message with little angry emojis I also was contacted by the partner of the person who was running the session They asked what happened and mentioned the prospective DM was upset that I had cancelled I said my family decided to extend the daytrip throughout the whole weekend and I couldnt get away This was a lie of course but I felt like I would seem weak if I had said yeah Im just feeling too depressed to play DampD this weekend and I thought a more concrete excuse would be more easily accepted Since then I have felt very guilty for this I understand why people would be disappointed they have every right to be and I really did not mean to hurt or upset anyone I just know I would have had an unpleasant time during the session and really did not want to be there feeling how I was I know this isnt exactly the most exciting story but I just felt like I needed to get it off my chest its been eating at me so hopefully saying this out loud so to speak will help me feel a bit better,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 22:16:58 UTC,4,3,1.0,,,0,0

1j3m1c0,Called out my boyfriend feel a little guilty now,So let me F19 start this off by saying my boyfriend M22 is most likely autistic and also very socially awkward He doesnt have any irl friends and pretty much only talks to me and his mum His mum is an alcoholic and a lot of the time they fight because shes drinking and he has to raise his voice and be stern to get any point across He hates that he has to and does try to talk to her normally I understand this However he does kinda do it towards me too I mentioned hes most likely autistic I am autistic so he could entirely not be I just think he is as well and this very much presents in the way he gets irritatedoverwhelmedupset when he doesnt understand something or something doesnt have a logical answer or fit the logical answer he has in his head I put up with this because I understand getting frustrated when things arent how they should be but last night I really just couldnt handle it We got into a stupid disagreement over a movie he wanted to show me because he likes the perspective its shot in He asked if I knew what he meant and I said yes I just couldnt articulate it out loud I do have a problem with that where I can know the answer to something but the more someone prods at me to say it it ends up just completely leaving my mind and it makes me feel stupid He asked if I just said that because I didnt know but didnt want to sound dumb and i explained the above point and told him I learned perspectives in drama class Now this is not the first time Ive mentioned to him that I had to learn basic cinematography in two of the 4 years I took drama in high school but he either forgot or just got too in his head where he was making me seem stupid and he kept saying things along the lines of drama is acting Cinematography is filming Theyre different I even tried to remind him multiple times about the fact I needed to know it for class but I kept getting interrupted which annoyed me since he gets so aggravated if anyone interrupts him and says interruptions only lead to arguments until he finally just pretty much said the point I had been saying and ended it with him yet again reminding me drama isnt cinematography and asking if I saw why he was getting misled I ended up saying he needed to stop calling me stupid which at first he tried to defend because hes never outright called me stupid which is true just the way he treats me occasionally makes me feel lesser and he ended up getting upset because his defence turned into him saying he didnt get why people always made him feel like an asshole when thats just how he is and I told him this might just be the way he talks but its disrespectful and thats why he feels that way I also dont really get this because he always says hes changing but nobody else is and while its true hes growing as a person losing weight got a job gaining confidence and setting goals his behaviour does need work and he cant expect everyone else including me to immediately change when he doesnt like certain things but then use the excuse of thats just how he is We ended up not talking for the rest of the night and while I do feel justified in what Ive said I do still feel guilty for making him upset I was kinda hoping he had work today so he wouldnt be in a bad mood until I say something he really likes his job and also doesnt have a specific schedule he kinda just goes as hes needed but as guilty as I feel I dont want to apologize for anything,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 21:25:52 UTC,0,2,0.4,,,0,0

1j3l2lo,I went on web cam sites and I still wonder if I did something wrong,Sorry for the vague language but I had to comply with the rules I have also posted this in a other subreddit I started going on webcam site similar to Omegle to help with my social anxiety and practice interacting with people I hoped this would help me become more comfortable in social situations Over time I began to encounter people who were engaging in intimate or suggestive content This caught me off guard and I wasnt sure how to react I became curious about the behavior and started interacting with others who seemed to be open to these types of discussions One day I was matched with a person who mentioned that they were looking for an intimate conversation I felt curious Later I was matched with someone who was revealing more of their body on camera I asked Is this real and she replied Yes this is real I asked Can you show me more She said No what the heck Im not going to do that and skipped Soon after I discovered an adult website with private oneonone chats and began talking to women with intimate intent I started asking them to reveal more and some did without hesitation Afterward I went and did the deed to the imagination of what I saw Shortly after I suddenly worried What if they were underage I got extremely concerned and wanted to find them again but I had no way of doing so I initially thought that if people were engaging in these kinds of interactions they must be adults I investigated the website and found out that they verify users ages with ID I returned to the platform and began asking women how old they were They all told me they were over 18 I reported the site to local authorities expressing concerns about potential illegal activity although I didnt have solid proof The authorities investigated the site and found no evidence of any wrongdoing Interpol did an investigation on the site and found no evidence of wrongdoing either The anxiety grew worse and I seriously considered reporting myself to the police in hopes that they could investigate and determine whether I had interacted with anyone underage I also began questioning whether I had at any point unknowingly gotten exposed to minors in that way I began taking SSRIs and anti anxiety meds to manage my anxiety and started therapy When I felt better I returned to the site the one that is similar to Omegle again to engage with people Shorty after I was again matched with people who were wanting to have suggestive conversation and revealing more of their body both men and women I initially skipped but got curious and felt excited againI promised myself that I would never ask anyone to do anything and if I had any suspicion that someone might be lying about their age I would immediately skip them Eventually I was matched with someone whose video was black but they seemed to be suggesting that kind of behavior with emojis I asked them how old they were and they responded 15 I immediately skipped I got matched with someone after She had her torso visible and then she lifted her shirt exposing part of her body I asked How old are you but she skipped me immediately I was left feeling distressed I was using the site without clear age verification hoping to meet people who were showing intimate content while also being aware of the risk that there could be someone underage experimenting The next day I reached out to a sex counselor and confided in her about my concerns I started crying on the phone realizing that I had crossed personal boundaries in my behavior just because I was curious Despite this I still find myself wondering whether any of the women I interacted with on the webcam site were underage My anxiety continues to distort my memory and I wonder What if they were 17 Or 16 Or even younger Sometimes these thoughts become overwhelming and I question whether I might have missed signs that would have indicated their true age Someone might say You would have noticed if they were much younger but what if I didnt I think what is the hardest is while struggling with this I dont know how to reach out for help Dont get me wrong I brought this upon myself How would others react to this,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 20:45:28 UTC,1,1,0.99,,,0,0

1j3k2r8,My fathers image,When I was little I had a very grand image of my father shaped by my family since he was rarely home They often told me about his good looks intelligence and how much everyone admired him Much of what they said was truehe was handsome excelled in his studies and graduated from university with top marks But I never really interacted with him directly Growing up I always felt I couldnt match his intelligence or other qualities Even as an adult after a lot of studying and mental development I felt I wasnt close to his level Recently I started talking to him more to try and build some connection now that Im older Im a programmer and wanted to discuss a complex new app Im working on I hoped he would listen and offer some advice The app is detailed and sophisticated but since hes a mechanical engineer unfamiliar with the latest technologies I focused on explaining the user experience to show him what the app would do However during our talks I realized there was a significant gap between us in reasoning logical thinking and the speed of processing information which may be due to his age I dont know Surprisingly instead of feeling proud of my advancement I felt sad I wanted to share this because its a new and unfamiliar emotion for me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 20:03:56 UTC,1,0,0.67,,,0,0
1j3jx39,Let my girlfriends cat out because it didnt like me and now I feel guilty about it,Posting on a throwaway for very obvious reasons The cat is fine I do see it roaming around from time to time Ive been dating my girlfriend for roughly 4 years We dont live together but we are looking for places However I was so apprehensive because I hated her cat and her cat hated me Im not much of a cat person and I understand my energy was probably off putting to the cat But Ive always tolerated it the best I could despite its dislike of me She went on a week long work trip 2 months ago and asked me to just stop by and feed her cat as well as check on her apartment to make sure all is well Sure whatever I agreed Her cat got nasty with me day one and I ignored it Second day same thing By the third day I couldnt take it and I just couldnt imagine living with this stupid cat So I grabbed it and let it outside through the window She lives on the first story so the cat was fine I placed it on the ground and let it leave Im not a total monster The next day I went to the shelter when they had an open appointment and looked for a cat that looked identical to her cat She had a generic black cat so it wasnt hard I brought it to her apartment and left it at that She came back and everything had seemed fine Shes only noted that the cat was skittish at first but we both just chalked it up to it being the first time she was away from home for so long I dont necessarily feel guilty because she seems happy but I do feel slightly guilt over my actions I needed to tell someone even if its the online void just to get it off of my shoulders,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 19:57:47 UTC,0,27,0.06,,,0,0
1j3jv17,I am in group chats and I think high school me would be proud,Back when I was in highschool I was a bit of an outcast I wasnt bullied not to my face at least was okayish socially kinda liked Always sort of something I had friends sure but I was never the number one choice Group projects I had to ask for partners no one ever asked me Same went for field trip sleeping arrangements and anything that had to be in pairs or above If we were a five people group and the project was for four Id be the one left out almost every time It would have been one thing if I was a lousy student but I had great grades so I know it wasnt about that I was also always the one to create all the group chats and always learned that there was one without me as well And sure people can do whatever they want but it still hurts when you find that out Some of these people are ones I kept in touch until today I am 24 now but again never the first choice And it might feel or seem small but I was never the one people set next to I didnt smell bad I asked about it wasnt an annoyance just another part of never being first Now dont get me wrong They were amazing friends that point aside Always there for me when I needed supported me when I came out and through a couple of years that were practically hell for my mental health defended me when I didnt know I needed defense They still support me to this day too Its safe to say I literally wouldnt have been here today without them Then college happened I started this year and the social aspect was my major fear Will I even have friends Or is it really something so awful about me that makes people feel less for me every time But college couldnt have been more different I found people that actually like me When we have classes together they search for me When I miss a day I get a text asking where I was because I never skip classes And even if they were a group before I joined they added me to their group chat without making a big deal out of it They didnt open a new group they just added me to their usual one We plan our schedules together so we share most classes we make plans I dont have to start chats I guess I am being chosen for the first time and not being left behind Its a point when I am positive that even if I dont have many classes with any of them in the future we will still keep in touch and stay friends There isnt much to this post aside from happy at where I came to but I felt like I had to get it out and tell someone,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 19:55:21 UTC,10,0,0.87,,Positive,0,0

show that no matter how hard your life is there is always a way I had reasons to give up but I chose not to I hope this story can help other people who is going through hardships I Had NothingSo I Built My Own Future There was a time in my life when I had no financial security no degree no legal certainty and no real future I had no backup plan no connections to rely on and no one to help me figure things out I had to navigate everything on my own making difficult choices to survive Early Life amp Family Background My biological father left when I was two years old to become a monk He was completely absent from my life never attempting to reconnect My mother overwhelmed with life was also absent for long periods When she became pregnant with my stepbrother she left for Malaysia and was gone for nearly a year During that time my grandmother took care of me and my elder brother She was everything you could hope for in a grandmotherkind nurturing and always present Then one day my mother returned and took us to Malaysia without telling anyone My brother and I didnt understand what was happening we simply followed instructions Like anyone leaving home we missed Brunei but we had no say in the matter Life with My Stepfather At around seven years old my stepfather entered my life I was excitedI had always wanted a father He owned a business selling screen protectors and phone covers and as it grew our financial situation improved But despite his success he was abusive Mistakes were not tolerated He beat us for small things like forgetting to turn off a light No matter how well we behaved we were constantly reminded that we were not his real children As his business boomed he became more absent but his abuse never stopped When his business thrived we moved to Johor Bahru and for the first time we lived comfortably But the abuse continued At 14 we moved to Kuala Lumpur I had no idea that my life was about to take a drastic turn Australia amp The First Collapse At 16 I was sent to Australia to continue my studies I enrolled in Year 12 at Taylors College Diploma of Business at Deakin University Bachelors Degree in Psychology Applied Science In early 2013 my stepfather suddenly announced that we had to return to Malaysia His business had gone bankrupt I didnt want to leave but I had no choice Returning to Brunei amp Struggling for Direction Back in Brunei I took a job as a marketing executive at a magazine company It was straightforward work but I realized that Bruneis work culture and lifestyle werent for me At first Brunei made sense because I didnt have the right documents to stay in Malaysia But after working there I knew Malaysia was where I wanted to be So I left Returning to Malaysia amp Facing Reality I was jobless for six months before landing a job as a Private Investigator During this time my stepfather did not support us financially He claimed to be paying our rent but we later found out he wasnt One day our landlord told us the rent hadnt been paid for months If we didnt leave immediately he would call the police That night we quietly packed our essentials and left We were shocked terrified but also relieved to get away from the lie we had been living Later I found out my stepfather had another family His former business partner secretly told my mother that he had two daughters in their early twentiesmeaning he had been maintaining a second family for over 20 years without telling us Survival Mode Private Investigator amp Visa Struggles I found my PI job through a newspaper ad It was advertised as a Market Researcher position but when I went for the interview I realized it was for a Private Investigator The work involved tracking down counterfeit products and investigating individuals I struggled at first but got better over time Still the job was stressful and I knew it wasnt my future On top of that I had major visa issues I was forced to travel in and out of Malaysia every two months to renew my stay Eventually immigration warned me that I would be blacklisted if I kept doing this Desperate I turned to an unconventional way to secure my visa But it backfired The person handling my passport ran away with it for years I was trapped in Malaysia with no legal identity I was terrified I wanted to report it but I feared I would be deported I had to stay quiet and find another way The Turning Point Finding My Strength in Teaching My wife now saw what I was going through She offered to marry me so I could get a spousal visa When she said that I broke down in tears I had been fighting for so long and finally I had a way forward I knew I couldnt continue the PI job so I looked for something more meaningful I found a job as a special needs educator and quickly realized I was good at it I understood behavioral strategies like the ABC Chart and could see real progress in my students I also took a side job at a tuition centre teaching English I worked from 8 AM to 9 PM every day It was exhausting but I kept pushing forward Soon parents started coming to me directly Word spread and I had so many clients that I had to hire another teacher to help me Building My Own Centre amp Surviving COVID19 I always wanted to run my own business When the tuition centre owner tried to take control of my earnings I knew it was time to leave I gathered my savings and opened my own special needs centre It was terrifying but I knew I had to do it Then COVID19 hit I lost over half my clients overnight I had to choose check_mark Let the business fail or check_mark Adapt and push through I transitioned to online teaching and borrowed money to keep my employees paid I sacrificed my own salary to keep the centre alive It was the hardest time of my life but I refused to give up Moral of the story Do not give up despite all the adversities If you hit rock bottom and felt aimless Always remember to do with what you can and progress forward,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 17:25:28

1j3e9n1,My Mom cant hold a job and Im not willing to finance her lifestyle,So I realize I sound like an asshole I grew up in pretty bad poverty My mom had a really hard time holding a job and when she was able to had a spending problem As a result Ive been working full time since I was 15 I worked multiple jobs at a time to get around labor laws so that I could make and save money By the time I graduated high school I had enough money to buy a car in cash and pay for a majority of my college expenses cash flowed first 3 years with absolutely no help I continued to work through college and eventually ended up in a high paying job From the age of 17 to now Ive worked around 5060 hours a week in addition to going to school I had no free time I missed out on a majority of being young I never got to go to parties I hardly ever hung out with friends which caused me to lose a majority of them and I was always exhausted while I should have been young and lively Regardless I went through the grind and came out on top I now dont typically have to worry about money Im in a relationship with a fantastic man that I plan to marry and start a family with Everything seems to have worked out My mom has always had a very hard time working She has problems with all of her co workers everywhere she goes amp she seems to struggle with taking direction As a result she tends to leave jobs quickly usually without another job offer She decided when I was around 19 to stop working to care for my elderly grandmother While I understood this decision there were still times she could have held a parttime job at least and chose not to My grandmother was in an adult daycare program for about 2030 hours a week which could have been spent working Instead my mom chose to go out and spend what little money she had gotten from various loans and wherever else she was getting money from She also complained constantly about having to take care of my grandmother My grandmother passed away a year ago and my mom was left with no choice but to go back to work and again the cycle starts over Everyday I hear constant complaining about how much she hates her job and everyone she works with She makes very little effort to find other work and writes off entire industries for silly reasons I wont work in food service because I wont wear a hair net I wont work in retail because I dont have any experience Etc She is also not saving any money not towards retirement not towards an emergency reserve nothing She claims she doesnt have any money left after bills to save but she frivolously spends Every space in the house is occupied with something She purchased a freezer full of steaks that have been sitting uncooked for months She pays someone to wash her hair every few days because she doesnt feel like doing it herself She has so many things she doesnt need and every time I visit her there is more yet bills are being paid in increments because she cant afford to pay the full bill I even cover some expenses by putting her on my plans and yet she still cannot manage very basic expenses Meanwhile I work I live very well below my means and my partner and I save a lot of money both for retirement and for our future together I know my mother is planning on being able to live off of me and I wont allow it I dont know what she is going to do and I know it sounds cold of me but I worked too hard to hand over everything to someone who has never tried to better themselves or their life Im done Edit just because Im frustrated I came to visit her today and discovered receipts for various retailers for the past couple of weeks strewn about totaling over 700 She just complained to me about not being able to pay property taxes to stay in her home Its just so bad and I needed to vent more I apologize,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 16:09:29 UTC,171,60,0.97,,,0,0
1j3dijb,My dad that mlested me growing up isnt my dad,Forgive my formatting Im on mobile Do not share my story anywhere TW Death Incest Pdophilia I dont honestly know where to start so I guess the beginning is where Ill go When I was very young my dad began molesting me from what I can remember I was around 3 or 4 I have three younger sisters that I grew up with and he molested them too as they got older but it was mostly me that got the brunt of it Last year my mom passed away of a stroke It was a very complicated time for me because although my abuser was arrested for what he did my mom had convinced my sisters and I to drop the charges right before she had passed away She would say awful manipulative things like You dont want your dad to die in prison do you to guilt us into dropping the charges She then proceeded to invite this man back into our lives by moving him back into the house we all shared at the time and my discomfort was ignored and brushed under the rug When my mom passed my dad went crazy and forced me out of the house My mom was a buffer between everyone and with her gone I didnt feel comfortable at the house at all and I had my boyfriend stay in my room with me because I felt safer that way Cue raging dad cussing me out for inviting another man over and threatening to call the cops and having him trespassed all crazy erratic shit I didnt understand So I moved in with my boyfriend yay All that drama didnt even end up mattering though because dad remarried and moved to a new state just 3 months after my moms passing Currently all my sisters are still living in that house together Now heres the fun part Im the eldest Growing up I was always told that my parents got married at the courthouse and had me before they officially hosted the wedding I was born in 99 and the timeline I was told was Met online in 97 Courthouse wedding in 98 I was born in 99 Wedding I was pictured in took place in 2000 I always knew I was in their wedding pictures and I never questioned what they told me they said the ceremony was delayed until my grandma could get back from doing government work overseas It all made sense to me growing up I never questioned it but it was all a lie So this weekend was a the year anniversary of my mothers death and I decided to get dinner with my sisters Were having a good time and everything but I forgot my jacket and my boyfriend stopped by the restaurant to bring it to me I get back to the table and my sisters got all quiet and said Hey weve got some news for you and its really heavy Long story short this man that Ive thought was my dad my whole life is NOT my biological father My sisters have been going through all of our moms things over the last year and kept coming across weird pictures and documents relating to me that didnt line up with what wed been told I wouldve thought they were trolling me if it werent for the fact theyd confirmed everything with my aunt my moms younger sister Who I just found out yesterday didnt know that I didnt know because my mom was not only lying to my siblings and I about it but lying to my aunt and all of our extended family too saying my siblings and I already knew Im going to visit my aunt in a couple of days to sit down and talk all of this out get the real scoop on my life because my whole worldview has been shattered On one hand Im grateful I was finally told but I turn 26 this month and thats an insane age to learn your dad isnt even your dad Not to mention what a horrible dad he was I feel this information to be both heartbreaking and freeing Im not related to this monster If I have kids I wont be passing along his DNA and thats comforting to me I dont want to make my half sisters feel bad for being related to him but I cant help feeling like this Ive always told myself I wouldnt have kids because this guy doesnt deserve his DNA being passed on and now I find out I have none of it This information was a gift to me On the other hand Im angrier at my mom than Ive ever been I mourned her death so severely I suffered because I felt so guilty that our relationship was so tumultuous in life And yet we never could have had an honest relationship because I now know she was never honest with me About almost anything I feel so much better and at peace knowing that it really and truly was my mothers fault that our relationship was so rocky How can you have an honest relationship with anyone that could lie about something so big Not to mention the fact that she was so manipulative and greedy doing everything she did just to invite this evil man back into our lives just because its what she wanted for herself to retire on his dime None of this is on me anymore and I feel so much lighter And before anyone asks yes a DNA test is in my future and Im starting therapy again soon I have no idea if my dad is even alive or still out there but Im going to find out Im not sure how to end this but let me just say this has been the craziest year of my life by far and Im glad I dont have to interact with either of my parents anymore or feel guilty about how I handled things when my mom was
