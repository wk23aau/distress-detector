1j5owrb,i cant stand people coming over to my place but i dont mind visiting them at theirs,title im extremely introverted and my social battery runs out very quickly but that being said im definitely not antisocial i have three close friends that i love dearly and i dont usually struggle with making new connections however i always make up excuses to not let people come over especially when its a one on one hangout because i feel like at some point im just too tired to hang out in contrary to them and i just have to wait for them to decide to leave it makes me feel horrible to essentially kick my friends out so i dont do it but after a couple hours im pretty much done socialising and switch to survival mode when its me who comes over to other people i can just leave at any given moment when i feel uncomfortable does anyone else struggle with this i just treasure the tiny piece of space that i have too much to let people into it even if theyre my friends but never allowing people to come over probably makes me seem like a weirdo if i were to tell my friends why i always insist on visiting them instead of vice versa theyd probably get offended that i get tired of their company at all,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 14:15:36 UTC,6,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j7ce4s,Grieving biking season,For the past 2 years Ive been smoking weed almost daily I recently went through a lot of changes and in that I quit smoking and started taking supervised urine tests Among other things I knew that taking these tests meant I couldnt take my drivers license for at least a few months and that was okay with me What I didnt know is that it meant I couldnt drive at all until these tests were finished which is 6 months even tho I am clean My doctor failed to tell me or I failed to remember that I cant use the license for my motorcycle that i already have I recently met a guy who made my passion for driving motorcycles light up again I was so ready to get back on the bike bring it out of the garage change out the oil and have it in pristine condition I was so excited to spent a summer on two wheels while getting my life back on track and this time with someone to share the joy with In some ways it was part of my motivation for staying clean and having it ripped away in the span of a few google searches made it that much harder I feel so angry and stupid I feel like I should have known and I feel like it was obvious Yet I thought in some magical way that I could keep my excisting licence just not take another drivers test I was so ready for the freedom of driving to work and going on road trips Or just driving to the store without relying on commute or friends or having to walk for 15 minutes I know it really isnt the end of the world but the next 5 months is gonna be that much more challenging knowing I could have been on a bike if I hadnt admitted to my doctor that I smoked weed Im gonna call the doctors office tomorrow to see if Im correct in thinking I cant drive my motorcycle but Im scared of getting my hopes up Id rather sit with knowing Ill get told I cant drive than be let down again tomorrow But on the other side of things I probably wouldnt have quit if it wasnt for having to do this at some point either way It just sucks that Ill be done with these tests in September at the very end of the season,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 17:15:58 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j3tlhm,We Need Modesty Back,We Need Modesty Back I feel like in a situation where a man gropes a woman in a bikini theyre both at fault She knows shes practically half naked which is perverted and she attracts perverted behavior from another perverted person So the man acting on temptation is wrong the woman provoking the temptation is wrong and the mentality that I can walk around in anything I want because I just want to be sexy is wrong because it all comes from immodesty and its not accidental its intentional You know sexy means sexual Its meant to provoke sexual feelings So thats lust You cant dress yourself in lust and expect not to attract it and then push all the blame on the predator when you made yourself the bait Dont get me wrong both people are responsible for their own foolish decisions but I believe more modesty will reduce any forms of sexual misconduct Sidenote I want to be clear that in no way am I justifying or excusing the actions of predators or those who commit sexual assault They are fully responsible for their sin and the harm they cause This post is not about blaming victims but rather about acknowledging the responsibility we all have in our own actions including how we dress and how that can affect others The Bible calls us to be mindful of how our choices can impact the people around us both in terms of their temptation and their spiritual growth This is about promoting accountability and mutual respect not shifting blame,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 03:16:23 UTC,0,10,0.37,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j7gwdo,My ex friend is getting married and I cannot stop feeling sad because of my own delusion,IF28 and my former friend G F30 meet during our first term in university we both came from the same area and went to the same school at one point We clicked and became really good friends from there I was an insecure 19 year old at that time and she was outgoing and active in our version of sorority I was invited to outings that I actually enjoyed and began to build up some confidence We both had our share of mental problems understood each other but after taking diffrent courses we stopped meeting as regularly but she always said that I was one of her closest friends In 2020 I became sick Really heavy burnout Crohn dieses and bulimia that made me unable to stay in town I moved back home and slowly began to rebuild my life and health Now in 2025 I am still sick but way better and have control of my mental problems During the last five years I wrote to G every time I went to the university city asking to meet up and if I could I set the dates of my travel after her schedule to make sure we could meetits a 5h drive Every time she said she would love to and if she was available we booked a date and time But almost always something happened or she double booked that she remembered 1 day to 1h before During these five years we have meet up twice and I have probably asked her around 10 times since I usually go twice a year She never wrote to me when she visited her parents or asked me when I was going down next time which I realise now was a clear sign that I ignored I once wrote and asked her if she didnt want to meet up it was okey and I would understand time changes people and friendship does not always last She denied it and said she very much wanted to meet up and I accepted the answer Telling me how horrible of a friend she is and how sorry she is Two years ago I had a major breakdown when G cancelled on me again I had been so excited and when she cancelled I was heartbroken Walking is my coping strategy especially with heavy emotions even after 10km I did not stop crying I was living with another friend for that weekend and I fully broke down in the end and told her everything They had never suspected anything cause I always spoke so well off her She apparently told my other friends who all are mad on my behalf G sent me a snap in May 2024 with the caption In exactly one year we are getting married with a picture on her fiancé I congratulated her but I had no idea about their engagement before that I decided to one last try and asked her of a time during the summer we could meet up with my vacation weeks in mind She responded and we decided a week were she was free for details to be determined later As it approached I wrote 1 week before and told her the days no response When I finally was at the hotell I wrote again and told her how long I was there and times when I was booked My friends were a bit angry at me for trying again but I said that this will be the last time One day after I came home from the trip she responded with how sorry she was for not answering I had enough and told her how I felt through the years I was nice and civile even said I should have brought it up earlier and not just unload it all now even asked my friends to read before sending G answered and told me she understood why I felt like that I ended it with that if she wanted to meet she would have to text or call me now cause I was tired of this being so one sided Guess what not heard from her since Now I see pictures from the wedding preparations like the baccalaureate and dress fitting and I feel so sad Probably I had a delusion hope deep inside that I would get an invite and that she would text me This quenching the last hope of ever being friends again and telling me how little I meant and what friends mattered to her My friends supports my feelings even my boyfriend but I just feel like I never meant anything If they are real friends they will make time for you I know but in my head I go through all those memories and just wonder if I could have done anything different Been a better friend written more called or if I just was the burden I always was scared of being also wishing I not been so delusional and naive Sorry for the long postred_heart,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 20:31:38 UTC,3,3,0.64,,,0,0

1j6lzc5,I think adults unaccompanied by children that judge at Disney are ridiculous,I have two toddlers We live in Florida so we take them Disney Initially we wanted to wait until they were old enough but it became hard to find places to go on vacation or long weekends that had facilities for children Today we were at one on the parks and at a slower ride intended for all ages toddler friendly when our youngest threw a tantrum 15M It was close 30 minutes until nap time and hes been teething We decided to come celebrate my eldests birthday 3M and especially since the recent passing of my father left him very sad and aggressive toward others at daycare he cried seeing photos of my dad and asking where he was We apologized to the two women next to us as my youngest threw things on the ground near them They started off saying that its OK Then they proceeded to let us know that they never came to the parks before a certain age and that my kids would be better just by the pool or something Keep in mind we are in the Disney Junior area And that drowning is a common cause of death in young children and I know at least three families that have experienced that loss I tried to keep it nice and then I finally said you know they usually do well with travel theyre just tired today And said goodbye Was biting my tongue the whole time and wanted to remind them that this is a ride meant for younger children and not adults in their 20s60s the two women were mother and daughter I never understand the idea children must be seen and not heard At a childrens ride in a theme park that is centered and based on childrens cartoons and film I dont care if adults show to the parks but its insane that adults want to also keep children acting like children from childrens spaces,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 17:21:54 UTC,0,17,0.41,,,0,0

1j5zag2,My life has been turned upside down and its not worth enough for anyone to help,I was in a car accident in November of last year Or rather a car accident happened to me I was on the interstate when I suddenly saw a set of headlights facing the median They were in a Tbone position with the truck to my right Before I could react both vehicles slammed into me totalling my car Thankfully or so i thought I wasnt injured I got photos names insurance information license plates everything I could think of I was told by two of the adjusters involved that I pretty much did their job for them After 4 months of being pulled around being told that I was not liable by all parties involved that the claim was going to arbitration then in subrogation and finally being told that my insurance didnt cover damage to my own car I am so frustrated and exhausted I have a parttime job an hour away that I havent been able to go to for the past 3 months My husband has his own business that uses the only other car we have I was told by so many people that I just needed to wait for liability to be settled and Id get payment for my car But today I was told that I am fully shit out of luck that because insurance hasnt paid anything for repairs or a rental or anything that theres no point in paying for my car I understand its because I had basic liability but I cant afford another car right now Ive been trying to find a lawyer to help but Ive been told by literally everyone that it just isnt worth it to pursue That the lawyers fees would be more than Id get in a settlement Ive tried legal aid the local law school referral after referral and as soon as I mention I wasnt injured its over Im at such a loss I dont know if it would be worth it to try and represent myself or just leave it alone but even the few thousands of dollars I could get for the value of my car would make things so much easier Im so frustrated that something so detrimental to my daytoday is just not worth it for absolutely everyone That I can lose my only asset be told Ive done everything right and still be on the losing side because I wasnt injured,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 20:23:11 UTC,1,7,1.0,,,0,0

1j7bpwd,My 20f dad 54m refuses to pay for my sister 18f tuition because he has no money,So when we were in highschool my dad made us quit any extracurricular activities to make extra money and help pay bills and save for our college and just put into saving for us Thats what he told us But He would take whatever we made and only give us 20 of spending money every pay period We gave him thousands that went towards the bills and college funds and even built a house back in our home country for when our parents retire To add to that we have gotten many scholarships so the majority of our schools were paid for My sister in question lost her job and has been having a hard time finding another one My dad used her funds to pay for the first half of her tuition but refused to pay for the second half The cost is 4k He said he has no money but yet he JUST bought a new BMW worth 25 to 30k Keep in mind we have 3 EXTRA CARS that need about 500 worth if fixing for him to drive just fine When my mom was trying to talk to him about helping pay for my sisters college tuition he told her to ask us the siblings to help Since I have money saved I was able to help pay for her tuition but before I did I wanted to confirm with him first that he couldnt pay for it He said he wouldnt answer that question and brushed me away When I tried to get more from him he started yelling at me calling me disrespectful This is an ongoing thing with him Whenever we try to talk back he calls us disrespectful When he is with his friends he brags about how smart educated and respectful his children are but then in private he belittles us sends money to strangers and constantly puts others first before his own family I guess we are all sick of it and I want to write this out because I dont know if somebody can see his side of things and tell me what I am missing here Yes we can move out but the economy is so bad and he knows that so whenever he gets mad he tells us that we can just leave knowing that we cant support ourselves He gets about 1500 extra in rent from us every month from 3 of us but not from 2 of us cause my sister lost her job and my other sister just started her college as well shes 17f She worked very hard and brought about 60k of yearly tuition down to 7k with scholarships and is staying in the dorms My dad has now refused to pay that even though my sister has worked throughout highschool to make that money When we argue about money he stirs the conversation away from the main point and starts going on longggg rants about this certain bill and that certain bill and whenever we cut him off so he can get to the point he calls us disrespectful and tells us to get out of his room We know he purposely does this so he can get out of a conversation And even when he says he never has the money he is constantly sending money to random people and we feel like he is flexing it I remember I had to stay at school while my classmates got to go on a fieldtrip cause he didnt want to oay the 5 fee And then he bought a 20 hat for a funeral he went ONCE He likes to be constantly looked at and its so embarrassing when we have to go out And my mom is constantly arguing with him on our behalf Its tiring and I feel for my mom who has to deal with his tantrums most of the time,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 16:46:45 UTC,2,2,0.76,,,0,0

1j54s03,My best friend tried to off herself yesterday night and I still havent cried,Basically the title heres some context I F19 and my best friend DF19 have been close friends since elementary school The summer before COVID me and my parents moved to South Florida for the start of high school and still we talked everyday We would talk on Facetime for hours fall asleep on the phone play multiplayer games and watch movies through shared play together We got through college app season together first jobs and she was the first person I came out to Ive never had a sibling but Ill always call her my sister Even though weve practically been 1000 miles apart for almost 6 years shes always my 1 call I tell her I love her everytime we hang up D is in college in New Jersey for nursing and just recently started sessions with a psychiatrist She is actively on medication for depression and sleep Shes always been a very introverted person but recently she has been telling me that shes been going to different club meetups and parties I was excited for her because this was a chance for her to make some friends and get out more We downloaded Life360 together and I told her to keep her phone charged text me when she got back and have fun Im not dumb I know kids are drinking alcohol and smoking at college events Personally Ive made a life choice to stay away from that crap but I dont hold judgment to my friends and others partaking However D has skipped the little white claws and high noons and started drinking straight vodka and tequila whenever she goes out At first when she told me I just assumed she was taking a little shot here and there and calling it a day However some of her friends who know me and our relationship have let me know via Insta that shes drinking to the point of blacking out and keeps multiple bottles of alcohol in her dorm room Ive called D and told her that shes turning into an alcoholic that she should stop going out as much and that drinking leads to more destructive behaviors She brushed me off and called me judgemental and stuck up Shes even blown off our gaming nights to go smoke with her friends Last night she texted and told me she had to call me about something serious She told me that she was drinking alone last night to the point of wanting to kill herself Her roommates had found her called the police and she was brought to a psych ward She told me that the police and her dad found out about the alcohol and that she ended up coming out to her dad unintentionally Shes also been lying to her psychiatrist and has been skipping her meds She said shes been admitted and was calling to let me know so I wouldnt worry I just told her that I love her like always and that Im glad shes still here But after getting off that phone call all I could think was I fucking told you so I told you the dangers of drinking and you ignored me Ill I feel is anger I feel angry that she would think that way about herself and want to leave me and her parents and her little sister Im angry at her on campus friends who observed this behavior and didnt stop it They let her get this bad and I wasnt there to help her It kills me that Im halfway across the country and cant afford to see her and make sure shes okay And most of all Im upset that if she ended up killing herself I wouldnt be able to do anything about it Im just her former middle school friend on FaceTime a million miles away I havent cried or felt sad and Im not sure if this is normal,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 20:10:06 UTC,1,1,0.67,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0

1j4wh50,Got committed to an insane asylum,Throwaway account Sorry if the story is too long because the details are a bit fresh I have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for a couple of years I am finishing up university but since I major in Humanities my career prospects seem bleak Also I had problems with with uni so I had to repeat a few semesters Both of these things are a source of my anxiety and depression I have friends and family members but not a significant other or a person with whom I can talk about my problems For the past several months I have been looking for a job without too much success At the same time I was trying to find help for my depression insecurities and suicidal thoughts Since Im broke and cannot afford a therapist I found an organization that offers free counseling After filling out their application they told me I should go to the hospital because they are not qualified to handle patients experiencing suicidal thoughts I had my reservations about doing that since public healthcare especially regarding mental health albeit free is pretty bad in my country Fast forward one month I managed to get two job offers one in a translation company which is a 9 to 5 and an evening teaching job I was pretty excited about the success in getting not one but two job offers so I decided to take it easy and not exaust myself with work I thought that the best course of action for me was to start doing both jobs until I figured out which one I liked more so I could focus on that job or even quit the other one Monday was my first day on the translation job In short it went pretty horribly The translation job turned out to be a regular office job where I had to scan documents and edit Word files and it did not involve any sort of translation or useful skill that could help me further my career Bear in mind I have had several translation jobs and I am not a complete beginner After coming back home I just started crying and felt desperate because that unpleasant experience on my first day on the job brought up all my repressed emotions to the surface uncertainty about my career loneliness and the fact that all people my age have accomplished something in their lives except me Therefore I gathered my courage and took a taxi to the hospital hoping to find a therapist with whom I can talk about my problems I went to the ER and talked to the nurse working at the reception who was very compassionate and patient Then she led me to talk to a psychiatrist who after listening to my woes politely informed me that I would be transferred to a psychiatric hospital or a mental asylum if you like since the hospital is full and they cant take me He also told me that I should not try and leave the hospital otherwise they would be required by law to call the police since I said that I sufferred from suicidal thoughts Then I waited for two hours until the ambulance arrived and an ambulance crew member escorted me to the car holding me by my arm so that I would not try to escape completely ignoring the fact that I came looking for help and did not try to hurt myself Fast forward to the insane asylum I was interviewd by a middleaged psychiatrist who gave an impression as if he wanted to be literally anywhere else but in that room talking to me After the interview he told me that I would have to be committed either involumtarily which would last for 48 hours or voluntarily in which case I would have to talk to a different doctor and stay in the insane asylum until she decided what is to be done with me I tried patiently explaining to the psychiatrist that I only wanted to find help for my anxiety and suicidal thoughts and that I did not want to be committed to this institution Moreover I stressed that my emotional issues are connected to my career and that I had to go to work on the following day I tried reasoning that missing the second day of my job and possibly losing both of the job offers is hardly productive for my mental health He shrugged it off saying that it wasnt the end of the world The nurses then marched me off to the psych ward gave me different clothes and showed me to my room The room had three beds and the furthermost one from the door had a heavilysedated patient whose arms and legs were tied to the bed The nurse in all seriousness even asked me if I would prefer to sleep next to the sedated patient or I would choose the first bed The lights went out and I took the sleeping pills that the nurse offered and slept peacefully until at least my roommate woke from his sedativeinduced stupor and started cursing swearing and yelling at the top of his lungs demanding to be released from the restraints Two days have passed since then I have not showered brushed my teeth or shaved since I wasnt prepared to be committed to an insane asylum and had not prepared any of my things when I initially went to the hospital to get help A lot of thoughts have gone through my mind in the past few days so I hoped that writing it all down and sharing with strangers would help me make some sense of it TLDR Tried to ask for help and find a therapist Got committed to an insane asylum instead,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 14:19:35 UTC,1,2,0.67,,,0,0

1j6bfcq,Why I dont post pictures to social media and avoid socializing with others Because of the fear theyll get my age wrong and trigger my OCD and Body Dysmorphia,I am a 26 year old guy born in 1998 Im going to sound crazy in this whole rant When I was 18 in 20162017 I became curious how others were perceiving me I thought I looked young and still had the teenage look As someone born in 1998 it wasnt my turn to be 20 yet I was still a teenager Growing up people born in the early 90s and mid 90s seemed to look more mature than me and I thought it was obvious that I was younger I began posting pictures of myself to Yahoo Answers and Facebook guess my age challenges and asked people to guess Every picture I posted there was at least one person or a few people who guessed correctly that I was 18 That gave me validation Yet I also heard 23 24 25 etc and that felt super weird at the time I felt weirded out and uncomfortable because I just didnt understand howwhy I was being perceived as much older if there were people who were guessing my age correctly I remember feeling upset even if I heard 20 I suffer from OCD too and numbers are very triggering for me They were adding on years to my life and that just made me feel very restless and I felt absolutely disgusted I was like Omg im still a teenager and Im being seen as oldDo I have an abnormal appearance whats wrong with my development But at the same time there were many people online who guessed correctly that I was 18 I remember one picture someone told me I looked like a teen and that she thought I was 1415 but another person thought I was 23 Another picture 4 people thought I was 1519 yet another person thought I was 24 One picture someone guessed correctly I was 18 but another person said early 20s unless you have brilliant skincare regime I also uploaded a picture of myself with glasses once and someone thought I was 17 or 18 yet another person said 2025 I was like 25 And that haunted me for several years I constantly kept having intrusive thoughts about these extreme perceptions and suffered so much I even had to see a doctor and psychiatrist and took medication to try and stop the intrusive thoughts I made a vow in September 2017 to stop posting In real life many people thought I was a teen in school and asked me what grade I was in but at the same time some people thought I was past university age and doing my masters It just felt super weird This kept happening to me throughout university People asking me what grade I was in being shocked that I was university and a few people who thought I was past university age I will never forget September 2019 A guy born in 1992 told me that I looked younger than 21 to him and still looked like a teen but the day after that a lady thought that I was older than my then 29 year old sister 1990 and kept saying she looked really young like 22ish and I wasnt even 22 then like wtf As mentioned earlier I suffer from OCD and constantly had intrusive thoughts that I was filthy and disgusting because years were being added onto my life and I wondered what I was going to look like when I was actually 2325 These numbers were disgusting in my mind I also developed Body Dysmorphia and hated my appearance I didnt mind being perceived as young but wondered what was it about my face that made me look old to others How could I look young and old at the same time Then when I was actually 2324 2 people asked me what grade I was in and a few days before I turned 25 in 2023 someone asked me if my school was closed for summer break But then in January 2024 someone asked me if I was 25 and I was like omg have i looked 25 for the past decade Am I living in some sort of time warp Now Im 26 and many people ask me if Im a student of a postsecondary institute uber drivers restaurantcafe owners people helping me in stores etc Thats a common perception many people have of me But I have a sneaking suspicion that history is going to repeat itself in a new context and that a new trend will form that Ive got to be 30 or 30 when Im technically not even in my late 20s yet This is why I dont post pictures online and avoid socializing with people Because Im afraid history is going to repeat itself again and that Ill suffer again Id much rather be alone than be around people who have the potential to make me uncomfortable in my own skin I wasnt uncomfortable withy appearance until I became aware that some people have extreme perceptions of me I also get really angry like why are most people so stupid and unable to read my face Sometimes I just wish I could stay locked up in a tower like Rapunzel away from the whole world so that no one can ever see my face again Im also pretending to be Evil Queen now as a coping mechanism Someone obsessed with her appearance constantly needing validation and being vindictive towards those who challenge her identity,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 06:49:26 UTC,1,9,0.57,,,0,0

1j5mosy,My mom might never be the same,Ok I know the tag is bad but let me clear stuff up right off the bat I didnt try to kill myself nobody in my family did and nobody in this story succeeds in doing so With that said its still disturbing I go to a high school that is located right next to a PreK8 school My mom works there and teaches PreK4 while my brother attends as a 7th grader Yesterday my mom and brother told me of something that happened Basically a kid in my brothers grade tried to kill himself in the bathroom using his belt part of the uniform and was at it for several minutes before a friend of the kid went looking for him To make a long story short it was a whole 2 hours afterward that the police were called and something was done about it Now this alone is devastating and disturbed my mom but what made me call my post this was this detail of the story The kid tried this around 11 am The administration was only made aware at 1 pm The kids knew this and said nothing Now you may think that its because hes a bully or disliked but he was a smart kid who played football at his school and was generally wellliked The chilling part was that most kids were just indifferent to the whole thing They felt bad but nobody was particularly emotional My brother said that everybody was silent but only a few who he knew feared death The kid who went to check on the victim got texts from the victim with suicidal thoughts and he said nothing at first And thats why I named this post what I did My mom is one of those people who believes that suicide is cowardly and that there are always options for those who feel that way but hearing how a group of kids witnessed one of their try that and then everyone not go talk to grownups was shocking for her Even worse since they have the school has not made anything public yet about this incident and probably is just going to sweep it under the rug Now I might have exaggerated the title a bit my mom is a very resilient woman But I fear that the way this story played out will affect her for a long time Also normally I would talk to friends and people in school about this but the victims older sister attends and probably doesnt want anybody to know so I ranted here,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 12:47:35 UTC,0,2,0.5,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0

1j7uunf,UPDATE My 21F boss 50M is in love with me and idk what to do,This is an update to a post I made back in October its the only other post on this account if you want to read that first I just wanted to thank everyone who responded and helped me realize it wasnt my fault All the kind words have been incredibly helpful Its been 5 months so buckle up because theres a lot to say this isnt exactly the update Im sure most of you hoped to get Its definitely not the one I thought Id get I havent received justice I probably never will In my last post I mentioned how I wasnt sure how my employers would react if I were to tell them I was assaulted Since then unfortunately another employee I work for was harassed and after months the harasser was fired Now I know theyd take it seriously but the difference is that I dont have proof I did kinda end up telling G He had asked me to work with Z and at first I agreed but after almost having a panic attack just thinking about being near him I finally got the courage to say that I didnt want to work with Z I didnt go into detail but G changed my schedule so that I wouldnt have to A couple of days after everything I was on instagram and clicked on one of those suggested accounts based on your contacts and stuff It was his poetry account and he had just posted a poem where he wrote all about me rejecting him and how people should feel bad that I didnt reciprocate his feelings but he conveniently left out the part where he assaulted me He committed a crime and then went and wrote poetry about it and posted it for people to read which is crazy I find this funny now but at the time it wasnt lol Some of my memory from that day has come back but its still mostly blocked out Its hard knowing that I might not ever know exactly what happened Even if Im not sure I want to I used up like all of my sick days after we came back for the spring semester because the thought of going back to work with that man made me physically sick Thankfully I mainly have only seen him in passing while Im working This is my last year working as a teacher I want to make it clear that Im not quitting because of him Ive been involved with this program for over a decade as both a student and an instructor and I feel like its time to close this chapter of my life I fully believe I would have come to this conclusion even if nothing had happened Im young and still trying to figure out what I want to do in life I want to take the opportunity to try out other passions of mine Im currently in the process of opening a theatre company with some friends and hope to have our first production in the fall This has been a dream of mine for years and I never thought Id actually get to do it Honestly for a moment I considered stepping away from theatre in all together It felt like he had tainted the thing I loved most Theatre was my first love and he ruined it He took the place where my happiest memories happened and made them bitter In the 5 months its been since everything happened Ive realized thats bullshit I have spent over a decade building a legacy in that department Ive broken and set records Ive advocated and I led recruiting I worked to prove to my community that the program and its students were more than just some underfunded extracurricular w kids who wanted an easy class I helped prove that they were talented and mattered The last thing I want is for my kids to think that theres one less person who cares about them because I left quietly or that their passions arent something worth pursuing because I gave up on mine He took a lot from me that day but Im not going to let him have this The 10 year old that dreamed of doing what Im doing now deserves better than that The girl that was trapped in that room when it happened deserves better than that I deserve better than that Ive hit the anger stage Im normally a very empathetic person and try to justify every bad thing a person does to me not great ik but w him I just get so angry when I see him and for once I cant think of a single reason why I shouldnt be Of course its all justified by the fact that hes starting to lash out in his own way A couple of days ago I was at a competition with my kids and I had my sister come up to me panicking because while I was helping unload equipment from our trailer he was talking to the contest manager to get my name removed from the program which meant I couldnt help them We were down 4 crew members and needed all the help we could get G had to get after him because wtf What was the point of that Later while I was helping them assemble their set they have to set up in lt7 minutes or get disqualified he pulls me aside and tells me just so you know we can be disqualified and not allowed to compete anymore if you touch anything else Dont forget youre just our assistant In a condescending voice This upset me because Ive been taking part in this competition for half of my life I know the rules I even studied the damn rulebook when I first got hired I told him actually if you look at the program for tomorrow Im listed as a director and directors are permitted to assist their students with the assembly of the set as long as students put up 70 of it Which is 100 true He didnt like my answer so I had to drag G away from where he was helping and have him say the same thing I did He was just wasting our time Its like he wanted the kids to get disqualified I explained that he was listed as just an assistant so I needed him to let me do my job because he didnt even have anything to do with our production other than suddenly showing up the day of contest to yell at the kids and stress them out he yelled at them for not moving fast enough when unloading the set even though we had arrived early to make sure we could take our time Like I said everything he does pisses me off for good reason I was definitely rude and me pulling rank is annoying but he could at least speak to me like Im adult deserving of respect rather than treating me like a child who has no idea what theyre doing I dont understand why he wants to punish me and my kids because he doesnt know how to respect boundaries and not cheat on his wife I from an area where its very conservative amp religious so It feels like the odds of someone believing me are low but I did tell my sister I knew if anyone was going to understand me it was her I was there for her when she was assaulted and its felt like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders having her by my side Im hoping to start therapy soon and begin working on how to cope with whats happened I dont know whats in store for me in terms of trying to heal and what Im going to do once I finally quit but Im sure its going to be really

1j6pyo0,I witnessed domestic violence and didnt do anything about it,I was walking home from school this was the 90s so we were all just walking around freely for miles and passed by the same neighborhoods I always passed There was this one small house on the left side of the road and coming up on it I could hear splitting noises like someone was being hit but I think I couldnt believe it until I actually got close enough There was this guy 20s maybe both of them standing over his wife or girlfriend on the front lawn she was lying down on her side and had her arm stretched out Then as I walked by slowly unable to stop for some reason he started beating and slapping her and grabbing her by the hair and yanking her towards the house He also kicked her multiple times I think he might have called her Alicia But the eerie thing was that she was surprisingly quiet about it not like crazy screaming but just like please stop You would think shed be screaming and crying out for help or something I remember that I was just walking in horror the guy didnt seem to notice me or if he did he didnt care I couldnt stop and I couldnt stop looking at them I think I was trying to figure out what street I was on but I had never thought to memorize the alley way streets so I didnt know The whole scene moved in slow motion but I still remember the entire beating the sounds the sounds of grass scraping the shape of his hands Just broad daylight at 3pm on a weekday front lawn no one else on the street but them and me springtime I ran home in tears and told my mom who just told me not to get involved When I tried to tell her that I think he was going to kill her she asked me what street and address this happened because if we report it Ill have to know all these things I had no idea so again she told me to mind my own business I was 10 or so when this happened and Im in my 30s now I still have the exact same fantasy memory of having gone back in time and instead of walking away and running away from the scene I get in between them and save her somehow If not save but at least make such a fuss that someone calls the cops Its always the same thing that I dont care if I get hurt in the process I would have done the brave thing Instead of what I actually did just run away in literal horror I feel so haunted by this scene I dont think Ill ever forget it for the rest of my life honestly,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 20:19:25 UTC,10,10,0.92,,CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCEDEATH,0,0

1j79hp6,I cant really take it anymore,Sorry for the long ass post I would have made it longer but wanted to spare you the novel Im honestly just really lost and struggling so much right now Im 25 and suffer from a long list of mental and physical disabilities Im not really able to work right now due to my disabilities but am in the middle of a long process of trying to get on disability payments I still live at home with my mum and brother dad is deceased and I just found out last week my mum has stage 4 bone cancer My partner of 3 years doesnt live with me but is soon having to move out of his family home so has been putting pressure on me to move out with him as weve been together for a significant amount of time and we should be moving onto the next stage of our relationship Ive tried to explain that its difficult for me to move out as I dont have a job and the income I do get from the government isnt going to be enough to pay for rent let alone my food medications my dogs food and be expected to save for my doctor and specialist appointments but also to save to eventually buy a house like how he wants us to be able to do before turning 30 He just keeps telling me to apply for work and I only have experience in retail but due to one of my medical conditions I cant even stand for more than 5 hours on a good day without being in debilitating pain where I literally struggle to walk I have no experience in being a receptionist and no matter how many jobs I apply for no luck He wants me to move out as well as Im being treated as a stay at home mother looking after my mum and brother this is well before the cancer diagnosis I dont think as well that its sitting in for him that I very badly need and rely on being on my mums health insurance considering Im chronically ill and it can turn at anytime for me and sadly Im having a different surgery at least once a year sometimes twice a year so idk how Id be expected to afford that if I wasnt living at home with no job He refuses to live with my family until we can save enough to buy a house because he hates my family and well understandably is struggling to even see a future with me like this but I feel like hes in between a rock and a hard place with the fact that he does love me and how he doesnt want to leave me cause Im sick cause itd be like leaving someone whos got cancer which is an asshole thing to do And it doesnt help that Im struggling with my mums new diagnosis On top of everything else I personally am just really struggling with how beyond god damn emotional I am Late last year I fell down some stairs causing me to be bed ridden for 2 and a half weeks and in turn has caused me to develop or severely worsen potential already undiagnosed OCD Ive never been diagnosed before with OCD because truly I dont say out loud my thoughts and whatever I have disclosed or displayed gets pinned to my autism but since the fall Ive been consumed with anxiety depression anger guilt agitation and panic with mess things not being in a particular order mainly MY way of order I feel like a shell of who I once was I struggle to hide anything well I cry almost daily and have just started to learn either cry to myself when no one is around or wait for my therapist I dont ever want to leave my house cause if I stay at my partners house guarantee Ill be a sobbing mess when I get back cause my mum and brother always make a mess and they never clean up after themselves which in turn triggers me more I already am a pretty reserved person when it comes to my feelings cause I think itll come off over dramatic to others even though I know theyre valid but today I got proven why I think that because my partner asked me what was wrong when I got home and I spilt 14 of my thoughts and feelings and I got stopped with being told that maybe you just like to make things more difficult for yourself than it has to be Potentially thats true but also I dont mean to my brain just never shuts up which Im realising with typing this that yes it most definitely doesnt shut up The sadder thing is theres a lot more to my anxieties and why I cant take it anymore and maybe Ill just get a diary and deep clean till I cant walk I just want to be alone and lowkey sedated but I got an appointment in a couple days on an update to some scans and if Ill need surgery or not which is obviously another anxiety I frankly just feel a lot of pressure from my boyfriend and I feel pressure to look after and help my mum and if I dont well no one will cause my brother and her partner are useless I feel pressure on myself with my own mental and physical health getting a job and what kind of job realistically would even be good for me I feel temptation to go back into eating disorder tendencies or back into my addiction to smoking weed I feel beyond insecure about my appearance which I know is a vanity and self esteem issues I truly dont know what to do because try and take it day by day but I clearly have some control issues Im frustrated cause I dont want to die but I also dont want to be alive or at least conscious,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 15:04:42 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j796vy,I fear any possible future relationships for 1 particular reason,Im in my early 20s and Ive technically only had 2 relationships I say technically because the first was so onoff that it didnt even count as one plus she ended up cheating But what Ive noticed since the that one is that I tend to be overcaring sometimes clingy and think about whoever I have feelings for constantly as if an image of her is burned into my mind no matter where I look or even if my eyes are closed Ive been through some brutal ones where a girl I met at university a mates mate but single was so unbelievably beautiful funny wellmannered and smart that it was painful to keep thinking about her until I asked her out but she polited declined The other relationship was when I met an American girl studying here who actually liked me for who I am which was a surprise considering I believe myself to be the equivalent of Rocky Dennis in terms of looks but with the way I was around and to her I realise now I was too overcaring right at the start treating her as an already long term girlfriend when we just started dating for 2 days And then after a while of dating she tells me something resulting in a glorious stab in the heart where she quite literally said over these past few weeks dating you has made me realise I miss my ex and proceeded to fly back to Murica reddit wont let me say it properly for some reason THE NEXT DAMN WEEK FFS so naturally I crashed out and drank a lot So referring to the title of this the one main thing as to why I dont want a relationship is that I dont want to lose her ruin her life or make her detest me because of how I am with overcaring I hate it but better to stay alone than to ruin someones life And for those of you who say work on changing yourself trust me Ive tried but its pretty hard when you have little experience in the dating scene because you look like a damn goblin from clash of clans,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 14:50:04 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0
1j7b4sy,I spent years in love with my grandma,Three years ago I met a girl online and we hit it off instantly We texted every single day flirted shamelessly and honestly It was one of the best connections Ive ever had We never did video calls though so neither of us knew what the other looked like Were both introverts so it never crossed our minds to FaceTime weird I know but thats introvert life for you Despite that we developed a crush on each other but we decided to remain flirty friends who sometimes roleplay sexy things because were both not relationship people and and longdistance relationships are a hard pass for us So we just kept texting and gaming together Since I didnt know how she looks like my brain started creating an idealized version of her and I imagined her like this alluring confident intense and mysterious femme fatale One day this girl disappeared without saying anything Poof gone she deactivated all her gaming socials She was always quite depressive so my mind started to jump to the worst conclusions I was very worried And I endlessly tried looking for her everywhere but I only knew her name and country so I got nowhere I eventually gave up looking for her but she always remained haunting me in the back of my mind because of the way she had disappeared and the fact that I didnt know what happened to her So I kept thinking about her throughout the 2 remaining years replaying our last conversations to look for cues and all of that led me to dead ends It was frustrating And it was like a mystery that I needed to solve Alexa play oh whooo is sheee So one day I decided that enough is enough I was going to find her and I was going to get my answers even if I have to become the FBI myself I believe in manifestation and law of attraction so I spent a whole night visualizing me finding her personal socials the socials we had each other added were not personal socials it was gaming socials so I wanted to find either her Instagram or Facebook And it worked Next day I went full FBI detective mode I said the only information I had about her was her name and country so I used those leads and somehow I managed to stumble upon her real full name I think this was the manifestation and law of attraction at play or some kind of witchcraft I dunno It turned out that the name she had given me was a fake one but thats understandable so I dont hold it against her Whatever With her real name in hand I found out where she went to school where she went to college and of course her personal socials So I opened up her Facebook and Instagram filled with anticipation because finally I would be able to put a face to the ghost whod haunted me for 2 whole years And when I laid my eyes on her there she was THE SHEER REFLECTION OF MY GRANDMA WHEN YOUNG No really Like not kind of not a little resemblance I mean copypaste CtrlC CtrlV a perfect genetic duplicate of my grandma in her youth I had spent years chasing this mystery woman only for my brain to go Wait a minute is that grandma I WAS FUCKING IN LOVE WITH MY GRANDMA FOR YEARS Years of mystery longing idealization GONE IN A SECOND My attraction to her Instantly killed Biggest turn off of my life All the sexy things she had ever told me were no longer sexy and I just couldnt picture us physically together anymore We used to roleplay fear play scenarios AND NOW THE FEAR PLAY TURNED INTO FEAR FOR A DIFFERENT REASON Like instead of Im going to hunt you down and devour you being hot now its giving Eat your vegetables sweetheart and Im just sitting there like NOOOOOO THE MAGIC IS GONE This is the kind of thing that would send Freud into overdrive Tell me how does this make you feel LIKE SCREAMING FREUD IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE SCREAMING My brain had built up this intense mysterious alluring figure and then boom grandma vibes And I ended up in some kind of weird family reunion yay This is for real one of the biggest plot twists of my life I basically turned 3 years of longing into a detective saga with a twist ending and instead of crying Im laughing about it At this point Im just happy because I can finally close this chapter but at the same time I feel shallow for losing attraction towards her immediately after seeing her Oh well not everyone can be attracted to their grandma,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 16:21:03 UTC,0,1,0.5,,,0,0
1j7fegc,I guess life isnt really for me,Ive seriously been trying to find a less nihilist way to look at life but its the only thing that makes sense to me Any form of meaning like a passionhobby religion or living for the little moments feels very pointless because objectively speaking it is pointless in the long run Besides Ive always felt very useless Like Im not truly good at anything no matter how much time I devote to it Ive been fucking up everything to be honest with you I even dropped out of college a year ago because I was just doing terribly I think Im just really dumb Even if I passed what the fuck is the point Ill still work my ass off majority of my life for no reason whatsoever Ive never really shared my views on life with anyone besides my therapists so I just wanna leave something behind before going through with it I know its irrational but I guess being irrational is just a part of being a human and any living creature now that I think about it I wish you better luck,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 19:26:30 UTC,2,2,0.76,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0

1j6tw9e,i impulsively sent a personal letter to a situationshipfriend he told me i should do something with it,hello i hope im not going against any rules by posting this i intially wanted to post this to try and figure out how to turn this personal letter into an artistic creative thing that i can put out into the world but for now its just a letter that is true off my chest this is a letter i have sent a friendlover that is very important to me we have a weird secretive relationship dynamic somewhat of a situationship but much more communicative and relationshipy its weird the letter talks about it a little bit the thing is after he read it he told me that the letter was personal authentic and very beautiful that i should think about maybe doing something with it in the futurecreatively he meant we are both creative people studied creative writing together thats how we met anyways heres the letter keep in mind it is translated as it is originally in a different language Hi this letter contains things that are important to me that you know Every time I initiate a hang out with you to talk about things I end up not saying everything I want to say maybe because I forget or feel better at that moment when Im with you and dont want to create a worse mood for either you or me again dont want to be a burden so I end up not saying anything and end up regretting and getting upset when things dont work out between us So I want to take a moment here and write to you everything I can remember that I usually think and feel about us and hope that with all the recoil you probably get from this letter you can also take a moment of your time and read without too much pressure of responding quickly I want to start by saying that you are a person who is very very important to me I have said it many times and I have no problem saying it again simply because it is true you are the first person that I have ever felt true pure love a feeling that I thought people invent in movies that made me think it was not something that was even possible to feel You made me feel it It is real You know how sentimental and emotional I am it is very easy for me to look at a picture of us from a month ago and feel nostalgic because I miss a specific day that I had a really nice time with you Like for example on your birthday when you invited me to sleep over at your place and told me that I was really cute and that you wanted to kiss me in front of everyone These are things that are hard for me to forget and I hope I never forget because it makes my heart feel good Sometimes I am completely reluctant to mention things like this or talk about it at all because the fact that I talk about it means that in moments like these have a lot of weight It makes me very vulnerable and its scary I prefer not to mention any good moment we had not to say I love you not to say I miss something that happened two days ago and that way if you dont say something nice back I wont be offended by it I wont think its not mutual I wont think Im taking everything too personally and that for you Im just another person to have fun with every now and then even though i know if it was just fun it would have ended a long time ago for you But I choose to say it anyway because I want you to at least know how much good you can do even if you dont mean to I choose to get hurt a little every now and then I think you are very talented You write in a way that is very impulsive for better or worse In the pieces you wrote it is very clear that what you write comes from that moment deep inside and it is not calculated it is simply what is happening in your heart at that second and you bring it out Another talent you have is the way you get to know people Something that I am very jealous of but I feel I am lucky to experience it as a friend and even learn from you You ask bizarre questions that no one thinks to ask go into strange depths and we would sometimes laugh at you at that moment in class because it is really very funny that you ask things that no one thinks are interesting enough but it is a trait that I appreciate very much I think that I will move here in this letter between things that you might be flattered by and things that you have a chance of being offended by It is important for me to point out that it is okay to be offended just as it is okay to be flattered by everything I write but you should know that everything I write is things that I think and feel There are no facts here And there is not even a single intention to hurt If I could I would write this in a letter and bring it to you physically but right now we are after a not very pleasant interaction that was on through messages as there is every now and then between us And right now I am not in the mood to see you because I feel like I will cry and I will not be able to say anything coherent Maybe I am too sensitive and take everything too hard Maybe you love me but dont like me very much and sometimes try to hurt me It could be both Sometimes I feel like you really want to hurt me That you know exactly what combination of words will hurt me the most and you choose them specifically I dont think its bad intentions I think its more of you trying to defend yourself Maybe I say things that I think come out well but they hurt you and then you who feel attacked try to attack back because that way youll have the power and you can hurt and leave Sometimes we encounter a situation of unpleasant messages and at the peak youll say something like youre gonna stop answering me or something more cynicalpassive aggressive to imply to me that youre not going to answer anymore no matter what I say Sometimes Im in a good mood and after a conversation like that with you i get very sad in a restless way like i have to talk it out And when you cut off at the peak of this conversation I have no way to explain anymore no way to resolve no way to do anything All thats left for me is to sit with myself with the feelings I have about myself about how much I may have hurt you with the words I used incorrectly about how much I want you to understand that I dont think such bad things about you And to sit with myself with the feelings I have for you that with how much I love you you are the person who most manages to hurt my most sensitive points Once in a conversation of this style you managed to throw into the air that it would be better if we ended the relationship After that when we met and I mentioned it you said that you said it in the heat of the moment and that you didnt really mean it I think you did mean it just at that moment And then at some point when we managed to talk and get along again you regretted meaning it I think that both of these situations are correct and that they dont necessarily contradict each other Sometimes I really have thoughts like Wow maybe I should really end this relationship Sometimes I feel like the relationship with you is doing me a lot more harm than good Sometimes I feel like you hate me Detest me And maybe you stay in touch with me because its easier than breaking up And maybe thats true sometimes I dont know But I also dont think it necessarily contradicts other good feelings you might have for me sometimes In any case I can understand Theres not a single person in the world that I can say 100 that will never get on my nerves accidentally hurt me get tired of them and I also told you I think that if I spend enough time with anyone at some point Ill want to not be around them On the other hand youre one of the only people I prioritize spending time with And the only person I want to be around even if Im very hurt and were not at our best terms I think something happened the day we started hooking up for the first time That day I went out with you and a friend for a walk in the city we went into your old school the friend stayed outsid we were left with just you with the stories and experiences you had there with all the nostalgia from there and I was there and listened to you and I really enjoyed experiencing something sentimental with you A big part of your life you spent there and then I was there with you and somehow managed to be a small part of all of it of you Later that day after we hooked up when you walked me to the train and we were both very nervous because we had arranged to meet the next day but we were both afraid that suddenly we wouldnt want to meet again when the time came Because we both had that similar problem that weird avoidant way of dealing with life And then the next day came we still wanted to and it happened and it didnt exactly stop for a very long time Usually when I want someone as soon as they show interest in me back I stop wanting them It didnt happen with you You shared your flaws with me and not only did I identify with a lot of them but it only drew me in more I really fell in love with a person and not just an idea I think thats why its so easy for me to get hurt by you I love you very much The whole person that you are Im very attracted to you Physically emotionally mentally In just about every way What you think of me how you think of me is very important to me I really care about you and your opinions Sometimes you say things about me that you think Im not intelligent or things like that I say very directly that these are things that hurt me Insult me You take it more lightly and with a laugh and with a certain detachment towards me and how I feel I think you might have the feeling that youre above me in all sorts of ways That you have more power over certain things That your opinions are more important or true than mine And that facts are perhaps more important or true than my feelings Sometimes you are the most sensitive person in the world looking for a hug love intimacy making me laugh when Im not feeling well And sometimes you treat me as if you are a person who doesnt know how to be a friend That you have no ability to understand or contain my difficulty my feelings I think a lot of it is also my fault Every time I told you that you were crossing a certain line thats all it was I tell you that youre crossing a line And thats it there were no consequences beyond that I say my piece carry on as usual as always and then it repeats itself Again things are said again Im offended again I dont want to talk to you again in my life and then I come back to you the second theres a chance because I want you in my life Its like Im giving up a lot of myself so that I can feel good sometimes with you Ill say something now that if it wasnt clear before it can be very recoiling and disgusting to hear at least for me My relationship with you and you in general is very addictive to me Im addicted to you You feel like a drug to me and I cant find a better or worse way to say it thats how it feels to me When Im with you and everything is good everything is the best in the world When its bad its very bad there was another time at some day I was at your place I think a few days after we agreed not to sleep together anymore of course we met and slept together because how could we not There was one moment you put your head on my chest as if I were a pillow we just sat like that in bed for an hour cuddling calm comfortable quiet pleasant Why do I get so hung up on these moments Its like if Im not bipolar enough on my own theres another layer of bipolarity in our relationship I remember especially at the beginning of this relationship when I was at your place and I felt so nice and comfortable I didnt want it to end simply because it was the peak of the day for me The moment I had to go home just being on the drive back home alone sleeping alone suddenly that was the lowest point of my life Ive slept alone my whole life Why does it feel so heavy now Its like craving you helped me survive a little longer every time And this is the most unhealthy thing Ive ever experienced and the most disgusting thing Ive ever said Its embarrassing to admit it at all especially when Im sure its not mutual For a very long time I was emotionally dependent on you like if you were in a good mood it would be great for me but if you were feeling bad and would withdraw from the world I could easily take it personally Because when Im in a bad mood I still want to be near you I still want to talk to you And its disgusting to me Why is it different only with you Why am I not interested in sleeping with anyone except you Why did I think for years that I wasnt interested in sex at all and that I could easily live without it and then after I met you I became a nymphomaniac Why can I just say bye to people and leave without a hug but with you this intimacy is so important to me I dont even have one answer really I have no idea why its like this On the one hand I think if I kept my distance from you I would get used to being without you it would have been hard at first but little by little I would stop wanting anything like this with you and then maybe I would be able to quit you On the other hand Youre funny You love Why would I keep my distance just because its a little hard sometimes Im in these dilemmas every now and then But I really dont want to lose touch with you Sometimes I think you dont see or appreciate things I do for you take me for granted Why not actually you said so yourself no matter when you text me I will answer if you need a favor i will do it if you want me to come to you and be with you there will never be a situation in life where I will say no I havent given you a single reason to make you think that Im not simply there whenever you need or want So maybe its my fault Maybe Im too accessible not enough hard to get and its too convenient its easy to take it for granted I dont know Maybe youll read all of this and think Im a psycho Tell me that you think it would be best and most worthwhile to end the relationship and Ill understand from that that you dont want anything to do with me and Ill be offended and well never talk again and all that this relationship will be is some cute memories from time to time that are accompanied by a bad taste from how it ended Maybe youll read all of this and say nothing pretend you never got it maybe youll even see that you got this letter tell yourself wow this is really long Ill get to it someday and forget about ever getting to it Maybe youll read this and tell me what you think and feel too Share your side Tell me that everything is okay its okay what I feel its okay that Im an addicted psycho and that Im too important to you to lose touch with me over stupid things that can be solved in an instant with a little communication and the right mood I dont know what youll choose but everything is legitimate and Ill understand in the end even if not at that moment I love you I would be happy to talk whenever there is a problem I just want us to really be able to talk I am not here to apologize and I do not demand any forgiveness from you Whatever happened was Do you want us to stay in touch I would be very happy Just please try to pay attention appreciate me respect boundaries If situations arise where you feel that I am attacking you that I am unpleasant that I am unbearable that I am repulsive inconsiderate offensive tell me Lets talk about it It doesnt have to be at that moment when you are at your wits end you can do it at any moment but lets try to communicate more healthily and hug after that and be good please i love you id like to know your thoughts about this if it made anyone feel anything or anythig like that after he read this letter he has said that relates understand and he was the one to tell me to maybe do something creative about it in the future i never even thought about it until he sais it as it was a very personal thing that was meant for his eyes only thanks for reading,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 23:21:26

1j7xuap,UPDATE In five days Im coming clean and it will probably end my marriage,Tl dr My marriage isnt over but I dont think it will ever be the same First thank you to everyone that replied and messaged I read every single one I appreciated the hopeful comments and identified with the harsh ones Im no angel in this story So some extra info my husband has a very high intensity job and travels frequently I took over the bills so nothing would get lost in the shuffle when he was away from home and he could focus on what he needed to focus on Insert joke here right I wad a complete wreck last week I barely slept was physically anxious and was both absolutely dreading Friday but also couldnt wait for it to just get here already Fortunately my husband was on a work trip and my kids were busy with basketball friends theatre etc and were barely home I barely ate and lost like 3 lbs that Ive been stuck on Not recommended for a diet plan Friday we planned to each work a half day then have some lunch and look at our budget for the year Tax returns were pretty decent and my husband got a good annual bonus so it made sense to see what was what He was already talking about throwing some in a CD or investment and I just felt ill Friday comes and he comes home with InnOut and a chocolate shake for me and I just lost it Full on sobbing It freaked the hell out of him and took me like ten minutes to get myself under control Then I spilled it all I started with I love you and Im sorry and just let fly That wasnt my plan I had a whole thing written down to make sure I didnt miss anything and it didnt matter at all To his incredible credit he just sat there in shock and listened Then he definitely underreacted and went directly to well fix it together mode He wanted some time to absorb what Id said and then wanted to work through our accounts one by one to see what was actually up and he wanted to do this alone then wed come up with a plan I let him be and just did some cleaning and laundry After maybe 45 minutes I heard him leave the house with a door slam I wasnt about to chase him down after he asked for space to process I did look at the computer and it was a list of all our outstanding balances To everyone guessing figures here you go I assumed it would be 60k based on my rough math but I had forgotten a couple I had on autopay 96000 in debt that he had no idea about He messaged me a while later that he was going to stay by his mom for the night and would be back to pack a bag and that he would rather not talk yet I respected that and made myself scarce He came home the next day and we manufactured some time alone to talk by sending the kids out to run errands The oldest can drive and loves any excuse The heart to heart was basically this I fucked up royally here but he shouldnt have checked out completely and let it get to this point He is going to take over our finances Were going to do a HELOC or second mortgage for all the recurring stuff and buckle down HARD We will review everything together at least twice a month We will do marriage counseling together I agreed to absolutely every term and condition I honestly thought he wasnt going to come back Things are chilly at best right now and I am so desperately sorry and sick over the hurt I caused At the same time there is a deep sense of relief that whatever happens Im no longer lying about it and everything is out in the open Maybe hell still decide that he cant move on but Im going to own whatever happens,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 12:49:57 UTC,2405,130,0.97,,,0,0

1j61gar,Is there a right way to tell my Christian brother about my sexuality,Hi this is my first time writing here so I hope it makes sense I am a 21 year old female living in a generational Christian family Being told your entire that married and have kids is something I have to do and that if I dont now I will someday So when I found at the age of 14 that I am Asexual and just a couple years after Bisexual I kinda felt relived but also terrified I have only told my cousin and she was very accepting of me and we tell each our problems all the time I have been debating on telling my brother about my sexuality for a couple years Just the two of us are going on trip this can either going to ruin our whole trip or strengthen our bond The biggest problem is that I am worried he will think I am too young to talk about these topics and hell say I can change either when I am older or when I find the right person All that to say that I love my brother but knowing his biblical stance on sexuality has made this very difficult for me to say anything Anyways thanks for reading my rambling I havent 100 decided to tell my brother but I hope to soon,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 21:56:46 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j6i1fv,My gf violated me last night,So my girlfriend 32 and I 30M have been together for almost a year now and everything is going really well There have been Ups and Downs in our sex life in the past because of several health reasons but recently we both feel like our sex really took off I was kind of inexperienced before I met her so there are a lot of firsts for me A few weeks ago we started experimenting some more and talked about things wed wanna try and even watched some video footage of those things to get some ideas and stuff I told her that Id experimented with butt play on myself in the past and I would like to try that during sex not talking about pegging here We ended up buying a whole bunch of toys and stuff for both of us including some buttplugs Last night we ended up really tipsy and horny so I suggested giving it a try We did And at first it was really nice and hot We both enjoyed it and had some fun UNTIL all of a sudden I felt the plug pop out We stopped and looked around everywhere but the plug was nowhere to be found That was the moment we realized the moderately big plug even though it had a wide base got sucked up my butt and was in fact stuck there I straight up fucking panicked and my gf said she could see the terror in my face I instantly felt sick and started sweating felt like throwing up So it was like do we go to the ER or what do we do I preferred not becoming one of those embarrassing sex accident ER stories So we decided to try and get it out ourselves I kneeled on my bathroom floor with my upper body leaning over my bathtub because I felt like Ill throw up And yeah My girlfriend basically had to use half her hand trying to fish it out real deep up my butt It hurt like shit and when it finally got out I was grossed out felt violated exhausted and traumatized I ended up in fetal position in my bathroom with my girlfriend nearly crying for having to hurt me My butt still hurts today and was bleeding a bit this morning and Im severely traumatized Even though Id love to keep trying this I dont know if Ill ever be able to trust a plug again My girlfriend did an amazing job being there for me and preventing me from going into a full panic attack so we kinda bonded over this even more All in all a very traumatic but kind of funny story I wanted to share,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 14:15:20 UTC,0,14,0.32,,Positive,0,0

1j7izp6,Today I was that Karen that people vent about when theyre just trying to do their job and I feel so embarrassed,I really need to take this off my chest because today I fcked up multiple times and I feel extremely embarrassed Maybe I am in my head but Im definitely somewhere in the wrong Ok so my day started fine with me taking a ride to the airport The driver a super nice guy from Pakistan shared with me that he is fasting and he will only get to have water or something to eat after 6pm So what do I do I get all excited about Pakistani food and ask him to tell me what are his favorite dishes from his hometown Then I proceed to describe in excruciating detail all my favorite dishes from my country Recipes mouthwatering ingredients the whole thing By the time I realized that he must be starving it was 4pm after all I was already rambling for about an hour already I apologized immediately and he was super nice about it but this doesnt make me less of an idiot So after this great success fast forward to a few hours later I am on the plane seated near the back squeezed into the middle seat We are about to depart the plane is on the move and I realize that my seatbelt gets loose without me lifting the little lever thingy I ask for assistance and the flight attendant tells me Dont worry the seatbelt will work later So I ask him How is this possible thinking that I really dont do well during flights that I used to get panic attacks that I managed to control after a lot of therapy and ltltOMG I am about to fly and if something happens I will break my neck crashing on the roof of the planegtgt He sighs then tells me he will replace the belt and goes away Comes back after a minute or so and he says that the plane needs to depart and that there is no time they will need to move me There is quickly some commotion all the flight attendants make some signals to each other and they find me a free row at the front So I thank them profoundly I apologize for the last minute chaos that I caused and go to my new princess seat but the window with extra legroom that I didnt pay for I sit down I put the seatbelt on and I realize that the new seatbelt ALSO gets loose if I push the metal thing I test it out a little bit and then it hits me If I just pull the belt it stays locked If I put my finger under the metallic thing and push slightly it gets loose So that means that I did all this for no reason I close my eyes and start thinking that it cant be that Im so inconsiderate today And how embarrassing Meanwhile Im doing my breathing exercises trying to relax There is turbulence today and my mouth is dry I cant handle it anymore I open my eyes and soon as I see the flight attendant handing out chocolates I ask for some water She says I will check if we still have and Im thinking Oh wow how strange It cant be that they dont have at least one bottle Quickly she comes back hads me one and finally I drink some water Finally I can try to relax Im thinking Then I realize must have dropped the chocolate she gave me I start looking around and then I look to my left and I freeze On the seat next to me there is yet another water bottle that the flight attendants must have left for me while I was trying to breathe iiiiin hooooold exhaaale the plane is safe the plane is safe the plane is safe So thats it This is another successful day I am sitting here patiently writing this to distract myself and I think I will post as soon as we land Thank you for listening to my rambling dear reader lt3,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 22:03:29 UTC,0,9,0.47,,,0,0
1j7ks9r,I knowingly manipulate my friends and feel ashamed,I dont really know how to start this or end it or what Im really trying to say so please excuse any ramblingunnecessary information Im a 22 year old female who had little to no experience having friends throughout high school In elementary school I had a fairly large circle of friends but around the time puberty hit and I became more self aware I realized that my peers found me weird I was pretty much exclusively friends with guys and I was basically a full head taller than anyone around me including my male friends I was pretty bad at actually holding a conversation I still am and my interests strayed from even my small group of friends Middle school came and that was fine I still had my group of friends But in classes where I wasnt sitting with them or we had differing lunch periods I was basically silent I was too nervous to make any attempt to talk to those around me or try out social skills High school was terrible At first I had the same lunch period as my friends but then my table slowly filled with other people until my seat was seized by other people and my friends made no attempt to save me a spot It felt like I was unable to speak anymore I had a surgery that took me out of school for 6 weeks and by the time I came back I was basically a stranger I unironically tried to live high school like a shadow keeping my mouth shut except to participate in classes that required it and to participate in group projects I didnt really consider myself as having friends until I joined this group on discord The people in it have changed and weve hopped servers a few times but the central people have stayed the same The most relevant are Fake names although Im not worried theyll find this Cas NB 22 Ian M 22 and James M 23 These people form the core of my friend group I dont really know when it started I think I was about 19 I had been feeling depressed for a few weeks and self harming was basically my exclusive way of relieving stress I was questioning my worth even as a human being fantasizing about ways to remove myself from this world I guess I started questioning if my larger friend group even wanted me around since I was so easily discarded by the one I had since childhood I didnt disclose my depression didnt mention self harm didnt share that I wanted to die I wanted them to feel bad for me so I accused them of not valuing me as a friend and then to them disappeared off the platform for two weeks The next time I checked discord I had paragraphs of apologies and worried messages basically begging me to come back It felt euphoric Even people outside the circle that I consider my closest friends were messaging me wondering when Id be back At the time I dont think I even realize I was being manipulative But I definitely got hooked on the euphoria of their reaction The feeling of being wanted Ive spent the last 3 years doing basically the same thing Not at the same level I would guilt trip them for hanging out with other friends If they said something mean to me I would sulk for days until they apologized even if it was my fault I give them the cold shoulder if they do something that displeases me even to a minor degree I push their buttons until they snap to see what they let me get away with If Im angry they get quiet and relent to anything I say or do Even then they always come back Recently Cas has been hanging out with two different groups of friends more than us They keep getting involved in new communities related to their interests and being an important part of other peoples groups The time they spend with me and the others has dwindled so significantly that Ive become a twisted amount of jealous Ive been thinking of ways to convince them to cut those people off Ways to convince them that the others arent worth their time or that theyre bad people I actively want to isolate them from the other groups so that their only choice is us I want to make them feel bad for thinking that they should devote attention to anything else I got on anti depressants a month ago and started attending therapy The combination is opening my eyes to the things that I do I am disgusted with myself I am afraid that Im going to go to far and theyre going to realize what I do and cut me off I deserve it I want to be better for them but as I am now Im probably more comparable to cancer on the group than a friend I think Im afraid that its too late I dont know I dont really want pity Im even disgusted that I feel pity for myself when I put myself in this situation Even now I dont know if I can be a better person but Im too deep into anti depressants to think that I should just remove myself from this world I just needed to tell someone,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 23:25:12 UTC,3,2,0.68,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0

1j7v7kp,I had one of the most disturbing dreams of my life,I had a really disturbing dream last night and I feel like it carries a strong meaning It was incredibly vivid and I felt an overwhelming sense of guilt and horror throughout The dream I was sleeping in a hammock in the hall of my apartment building in my hometown when an old woman and her friends surrounded me claiming that she had left her jewelryone necklace and three ringson my hammock While I was still halfasleep I found the jewelry but she kept grabbing at me searching for it I hid the pieces because I wanted to keep them Later I ended up returning only the necklace which was worthless at the buildings front desk but I kept the rings for myself This threw me into a huge moral dilemma Then I spent what felt like an eternity waiting for my food delivery When I finally went to pick it up I found the delivery guy lying on the ground in a pool of blood his legs completely crushed Cars kept driving over him as if he wasnt even there There were two other bodies crushed beyond recognition one of them a child I was with David my childhood best friend a doctor and Sophie my best friend one year behind me in med school David went to help the injured Meanwhile Leo a former friend I used to do reckless things with appeared but he only walked beside me We greeted each other exchanged glances like we had things to catch up on but we didnt actually talk As I walked back to my apartment still holding the rings in my mouth I decided to give them to the front desk guy But when I got there the usual porter was gonethis one was heavily tattooed someone I didnt recognize Instead of taking the jewelry he encouraged me to keep the rings and spend all the money on cocaine He handed the rings back to me Then I got home and my familybut it wasnt my real family it was The Sopranoswalked in Their presence made me feel emboldened to keep the jewelry I put the rings on my fingers But then the old woman appeared again This time she confronted me directly and took the rings from me The entire dream was extremely vivid I felt a crushing sense of guilt and the violence of the crushed bodies was horrifyingI could smell the blood and flesh mixed with rain and I could hear the families crying in the distance At some pointeither in this dream or another oneI also remember seeing my father It was from a time before he was bedridden before everything went downhill He died when I was 19 after a 3 year long battle with cancer Context that might be relevant Im a last year medical student and a maybe recovering polyaddict Im like a week totally clean from everything except nicotine ketamine and weed were the last drugs I used maybe three weeks clean of a mild to moderate opiate habit Coke isnt really my thing but I had a conversation about my addiction with my roommate and cant stop reflecting about my use ever since David is my childhood best friend now a doctor Sophie is my best friend one year behind me in med school Leo was my main companion for reckless behavior including drugs For whatever reason he suddenly cut me and another friend off but recently started sending memes like nothing happened For the first time Im considering cutting him off completely Im currently watching The Sopranos This was one of the heaviest dreams Ive ever had and I cant shake the feeling that it means something important Immediately after I woke up I felt the urge to register it I was calm just felt like an uncomfortable dream but as soon as I started reading ChatGPTs output on its meaning I had a legit anxiety attack Ive had like 5 LEGIT attacks in my life and this one was textbook Hyperventilation and a physical urge to cry even though I wasnt feeling really emotional This hit me hard man It reeks of psychoanalysis so much its comical,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 10:03:57 UTC,3,0,0.72,,,0,0

1j5805v,Im so dense she was flirting with me I think,I really dont have anyone to talk about this to so Im just gonna share this here A year ago I 20M was at a party with some of my friends At the party there was this really pretty girl Im talking peoples heads were turning when she was walking by We were alone at the snack table and started talking I dont remember much details the conversation went really smoothly and at the end she invited me to go to a rap concert with her I politely declined as its not my genre of music The party went on everyone got slightly drunk and the girl invited me to dance with her At some point the dance became kind of intimate to the point she wanted me to grab her ass jokingly so ofcourse I excused myself and went to get a drink At some point me and my friends went upstairs to chill on the couch later in the evening the girl joined us and squeezed in right next to me Some time passed and it was getting late so people began to fall asleep I wanted to go find a bed for myself but it turned out the prettiest girl Ive ever laid my eyes on fell asleep holding onto me snug on the hoodie over my left ribcage Being the awkward fuck that I am I just spent the night with one arm parallel to my body and the other on top of the couch as to not hug her without consent My memory has never been the greatest so I probably left out some details but generally our chemistry when talking was great In hindsight it seems pretty obvious she could have been kinda into me or she was jus being nice guess well never know,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 22:26:17 UTC,1,4,1.0,,,0,0

1j6a28f,I found out why the Mormons stopped coming to my house,I live in a multi family apartment complex with my lover who stays at home most of the day when Im at work At one point our door was getting knocked on twice sometimes three times a day multiple times a week I hold no hostility towards Mormons but it is kind of annoying being interrupted while cooking or working at 8pm It was often enough that I noticed when it no longer happened We are very obviously a gay couple so I figured at some point or another they put that together and stopped coming I was wrong Turns out my lover who is lovingly and in their own words built like a brick shithouse answered the door freshouttheshower wet and in one of my silk robes at some point in the middle of the day and they have avoided the building since I still see them in the neighborhood but never on our floor my lover just confessed this during couples game night and I just started crying laughing Its been months They never told me because they were sure they had stretched my robe out in the shoulders and didnt want to upset me I personally think they look great in tight clothes but I can understand why seeing a big burly ginger man in a barely closed ill fitting silk robe could get us put on a religious shit list Maybe its just a coincidence and what lucky guys either way They never wear anything like that when Im home but regardless its so silly,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 05:20:16 UTC,11483,229,0.97,,,0,0

1j7ngez,I M23 just kinda feel sad about relationships and I think Im starting to see romantic relationships with women as interchangeable and I dont want to be like that,Dating is miserable and it feels like every person Im with seemingly has no clue of what they want and my actions have almost zero impact long term on the success of the relationship because every woman I date ends up falling into a spiral of self sabotage or the ones that are already emotionally independent arent interested I feel like at this point my desire for a relationship has evolved to the stage where any woman insofar as shes around my age and not a bad a person is alright enough for me As long as she loves me Ill be whatever man I need to be and shes can be whatever kind of woman she is Obviously this is toxic and nonsense but I cannot for the life of me shake my perception of things The minimum bar for me is extremely low and Im not even in a bad position Average looking a regular irl social group good career ambitions and in school for them etc But in every situation all I can think of is the long term position I need to be in and how much time Im wasting not doing and saying whatever I can to most efficiently get to that position a long term irl relationship,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 01:37:45 UTC,0,1,0.5,,,0,0

1j6qxcs,I cant get over my ex,I cant get over the guy I was in love with 3 god damn years ago and it makes me sick So I was never really in a relationship with this person we actually never even hang out together We met in 2022 and we had a friendship that you wish on everyone but the friendship got stronger and so did our feelings At first he started getting feelings at the time it was not appropriate because I was still in a relationship I broke things off so I could be with him but when that happened he didnt have the same feelings anymore and everything went downhill Im not gonna explain everything that happened in those 6 months but I can say that nothing went back to how it was Because I was still in love with him when he basically ghosted me at the time I never got the closure I needed I think And I begged him to let me stay in his live as friends and now that Im hearing myself I sound so stupid After everything that happened in those 6 months we kissed etc for like 2 more times and that made it even worse to get over him Like I said we stayed friends and talk like 3 times a year new years birthdays and holidays I even got a new amazing boyfriend whom Ive been together with for almost 2 years and who I really love and could see myself marrying one day But I still think about him the ex Last week he even responded on a story I posted on Snapchat and we exchanged maybe 10 sentences I wake up the next day and he deleted me from snap I would like to think his new gf made him do it because it would honestly hurt more if he did it himself So now 1 week later and everyday Im thinking about it and everything that happened almost 3 fk years ago So my question Reddit users is why cant I get over him Why cant I get over the memories that we made Why not after everything this person has put me through English is not my first language so Im sorry for my grammar Side note 15 years ago he moved to another city so I havent seen him in 1 year And I see him maybe once I year now I was supposed to see him last week but he couldnt come,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 21:03:59 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j4xbz7,My wifes family are a bunch of ungrateful aoles,TLDR Wifes family felt entitled to my money to help with their mothers retirement and none of them have ever expressed one word of gratitude Not looking for advice just venting Backstory Im 65M wife is 61F Married 36 years Wife has three siblings one older brother one older sister one younger sister We were very close with all of her siblings and their spouses for many years we went on dozens of vacations with all of them always had gatherings at holidays spent weekends at each others homes etc Her brother and I were as close as we could be always hanging out playing music and having a great time I loved him more than my own brothers He began to hate me in 2020 because I had the gall to disagree with his political views When he found out I voted for Biden he screamed at me WERE FUCKING DONE at a family gathering Hes barely said two words to me since then Her older sister and her husband have had a simmering illwill towards my wife and I for many years Back in the 80s and 90s I was earning great money and we used to take them and their kids on vacations that were 99 percent paid by me because they didnt have two nickels to rub together If we bought a new piece of furniture or TV or whatever we would offer them our barely used stuff for free which they seemingly gladly accepted We did these things because we loved them Evidently they took our generosity as treating them like a charity case Now that they are both in highearning careers and dont need anything from us they basically hate us for treating them that way and now simply look down their noses sneer and snub us Her younger sister and her husband have always been good Christians but have become more fervent Evangelical Southern Baptist over the years I made the mistake of having a discussion about religious beliefs I am an atheist with the husband several years ago I know a thousand times more about his Holy Bible than he does and the discussion did not go well for him Ever since then they have done their best to ostracize us from the family at every opportunity Fast forward My wifes 80yearold father passed away a couple of years ago leaving his wife my MIL also 80 widowed They relied almost exclusively on Social Security for their retirement income After his death there was a shortfall in the MILs monthly SS income My wifes three siblings had a meeting and decided that the shortfall would be made up by the four siblings split evenly Each share came to 2500 annually to make up the MILs shortfall All three of the other couples are fairly wealthy with annual incomes in the 250350K range and all have 401k accounts over 1 million which they brag about My wife does not work I own a small business which has slowed dramatically since covid I make around 75k in a good year I would like to retire at some point so I am trying to save every dollar that I can in order to do so I will rely heavily on Social Security for retirement income The long and short of it is that I had to funnel 2500 per year into MILs retirement needs that would have otherwise gone towards my own retirement savings The way the siblings view it is your money is your wifes money therefore she needs to chip in to help her mom Fortunately two years into that arrangement the MIL sold her house she moved in with one of the siblings and netted around 200k She told my wife that with that money plus her SS income AND the 50000 she already had in savings I would no longer need to contribute to her income especially since her expenses were now basically zero So thankfully I only had to donate 5000 of my retirement money to the MIL The shitty part is that not one of the siblings or the MIL have ever expressed one word of thanks or gratitude to me even though they are well aware that the money we contributed came 100 from my earnings We still have to see them every now and then at weddings or funerals or whatever and they have never even acknowledged my contribution and sacrifice Their sense of entitlement is appalling especially in light of the fact that they all have a great disdain for me and consider me to be their asshole brotherinlaw,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 14:59:10 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j5q2fl,Wife and I got kicked out of a therapy session,Things have been rough at home Im 30M wife is 27F Fighting virtually every day I take my lumps for escalating in certain situations but I feel its primarily my wife that breaks the peace and gets upset and acts over the top angry Then Im angry at her for how she acted in her anger then shes angry at me for being upset by it all Its a vicious cycle Anyways her dad offered to pay for us to go to therapy Therapist was a 70 year old guy thats been doing it for 50 years Seems very wise Is all about accountability Doesnt want to hear what the other person did to you he only wants to know how you contributed to the situation My wife has missed the last two sessions Which hurt me alot as things have been so bad Ive been desperately wanting the help to break the cycle The first time she was angry and didnt want to come The second time she said she forgot the appointment I vented out alot of our problems when I was alone this last session and was grilled for my part of it I talked about things Ive done shes done and things that are affecting the children He said we will plan to get her side of things when we come back together We both showed up yesterday and he wanted her side of the issues I talked about Every time she went to talk about something she prefaced it by saying I only did this because he did this first etc even an issue i had with how mean she was to our daughter recently Our daughter is 6 But the story still started out with well she yelled at my sister so I did this He became irritated and impatient with her Told her that he wouldnt keep trying to beat the issues out of her and that she needs to stop blaming other people and just admit to what she did She stammered and couldnt talk without trying to shift some guilt first It went back and forth between them for a minute with me sitting silently to the side She couldnt get any kind of admission out without having someone else to blame first Eventually she started reading out some horrible texts she had sent me out loud on her phone It was painful to hear her read it off so robotically but to me it seemed like a step in the right direction because the things she said were awful and she was technically admitting to it by reading it out loud She got towards the end but threw in one more then he did this so I did this He said Both of you need to get out This sessions is over As soon as she finished reading We both left silently As I went to leave the building I had the urge to go back I knocked on his door and asked for a few more seconds of his time which he obliged I asked why he ended it at that point because in my mind she seemed to be cooperating He said that its a combination of things Firstly her not showing up to appointments He helps us outside of his normal office hours as a favor to her dad who he knows from a rehab program Her not showing up is disrespectful at best Secondly it was the combination of the horrible things she said via text the robotic way she read them and her inability to take accountability I said I understood and thanked him for his time I dont know where to go from here Things have been so awful Shes been fighting with me and other people nonstop over the smallest things After that appointment she has flipped a switch thats been engaged for weeks now and is acting as sweet as possible I feel like its a love bombing facade I dont know what advice Im really looking for Im just sad and afraid I know what I have to do Anyone have any advice towards something like this,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 14:58:31 UTC,1473,169,0.98,,,0,0
1j3ahkl,Being a teacher makes me hate everything,Im a teacherlibrarian at an elementary school in my tenth year and it has become increasingly apparent that this is not the job for me Despite not wanting to be another statistic in the world of education I need to get out before I completely lose it Reading and libraries used to be my life I would spend countless hours reading books and browsing through the stacks in libraries Whenever I traveled my first stop was always the library Growing up no one ever doubted that Id become a librarian Life took some twists and turns along the way but I finally finally made it back to the libraries I love Now I fucking HATE IT Along with anything else that used to give me joy in life I used to love to go hiking shopping working out just be out and about for no reason at all but now all I do is crawl into bed and sleep until the next morning And calling it sleep is very generous Running on about four hours of sleep has become standard and dont think that the lack of sleep contributing to my overall feelings about life has gone over my head Problem is that nightmares about going back to work wake me up and fretting over the students for several hours after makes sleep a luxury for me Im sick of spending the majority of my day managing behaviors Im sick of trying to find engaging lessons for the students to absolutely not be able to handle it Im sick of the constant NOISE the SCREAMING and the VIOLENCE Why is violence the first thing these kids turn to Im sick of these kids leaving the library and the books in pieces acting as though they havent had me since kindergarten and know how the library is supposed to be kept Im sick of the students acting like its their first goddamn day on Earth Im sick of hearing the phrase Im sorry and just watching them do it again five minutes later I told one girl that her apology had less meaning than a pigs fart and I dont even feel bad saying that Im sick of their entitlement and how they think they deserve to take every piece of me without giving a modicum of respect in return Im sick of getting excited and emotional over a book I bought the students thinking that theyll like it just for them to roll their eyes Its like these kids have only two settings mean little bastards or asleep I used to be a creative I used to spend my free time drawing painting knitting and writing Boy how I loved to write I looked at some old Google docs of my stories and I miss that girl the one who could spin worlds out of nothing and create endearing and courageous characters But that girl is dead I couldnt write even if you pointed a gun to my head These goddamn energy sucking vampires disguised as children left me bereft of any emotion willpower or desire to do anything I cant even distract myself in the company of other people The single life has plagued me for over two years and I want to get into dating but Im such a miserable person that I dont think its fair to subject someone to the unpleasant experience of being in my presence I barely want to be in my own company The only other people I occasionally hang out with are other teachers so our primary form of entertainment is drinking and trauma dumping I dont even like reading anymore Reading For a librarian I pick up a book and it reminds me of school a straight up hell and thats enough to turn me off The thought of having to do this for another twenty years drives me to despair Can you believe I used to win teaching awards I used to be a good teacher I dont know where I went wrong Like the only thing that is keeping me here is my dog and shes 13 years old But with a lot of spunk Once shes gone I wont know what to do with myself So like I dont know what my aim is with this The jobs here are pay a fucking joke and I already feel like a failure enough that losing my house will definitely send me over the edge So here I am day after day spending the better part of my life with people I hate,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 13:14:19 UTC,18,16,0.92,,,0,0

1j49dv1,I think my perception of a healthy relationship is whats sabotaging them,Most of my perception comes from observing from my parents relationship They love each other a lot and spend pretty much all of their time together However there are times when my mom feels a bit smothered by my dad and this has led to arguments in the past but I would say that overall she enjoys spending most of her time with him Ive even tried inviting her to different events but she would often turn me down to spend time with my dad I feel like this has led me to create an unrealistic expectation that my partner and I should be spending a lot of our time together A few of my partners have told me that they felt smothered or that I was never satisfied with them Was it a matter of different needs or was I truly doingexpecting too much Or is it a little bit of both People say a relationship is supposed to feel easy or natural in the beginning but its never felt that way for me I have to be doing something wrongwhether its not communicating well enough expecting too much from my partner or not setting firm enough boundaries for myself or maybe all of the above,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 18:02:26 UTC,1,4,1.0,,,0,0

1j4nzfg,Spent the weekend with someone special and I regret it,I 36f went on a weekend trip with this guy 43m He lived abroad most of his life so he doesnt know our tourist destinations that well We went to this tiny town that everyone who lives here has been to multiple times and because it was a long weekend everything was fully booked so our hotel was far away from the towns center I liked him for almost half a year but Ive known him for years he is one of my favorite artists and he has a very niche IG account We met in person last year and we were both awe struck about each other when we met like I couldnt believe how handsome he was in person and he kept asking me to hug him I could feel him smelling my hair I went to visit him while I was abroad in his city back in January and when I saw him he totally tricked me into getting to his apartment and well We ended up doing it But I didnt want to catch feelings for him so I decided not to visit him again while I was in his city He then decided to come visit here for the long weekend Hes pretty handsome and definitely draws female attention to him and he always tells me about all the girls that approach him in public I guess he wants to make me jealous Anyway I punch back and I tell him about the guys I date Dumb little game I know So this weekend we went on this trip together since he doesnt know his way around I had to be on top of the booking I booked two separate bedrooms My plan was to have a nice weekend with him and NOT GET ATTACHED because tbh hes way too handsome and I dont think I could manage all the jealousy that comes with having someone like him as a partner The getaway went ok We couldnt get our hands of each other but my poor planning skills ruined some parts of the trip and he was noticably irritated but didnt blame it on me I ended up knowing him better we had long talks he was very sweet to me He showed me some of his work unedited We talked about our childhoods and all At some point he said something like I know that for you this is something superficial and when I asked him what he meant he said that he knew I was there for the sex and that I only used guys for pleasure I told him that I actually had admired him for years and that I wasnt at all interested in sleeping with him when we first met I was just so glad to meet one of my favorite artists And I did tell him I cared deeply about him but I knew that I wasnt special for him at all either and I had no reason to believe he wanted anything else than just having a good time with me as he is surrounded by beautiful woman all the time I was just the flavor of the week He seemed a bit offended by that comment he said he doesnt see girls that way and that he only opens up to someone special We agreed that we both like each other and we both café for each other so that the best thing would be to take advantage of the time together and maybe do physical stuff while we still can when we have the chance but remain good friends until were old I dont know it was a weird conversation and i cant shake the feeling that he was just trying to make me say that I was in love with him or something because of his narcissistic nature I have shielded my heart from guys like him years ago because I know falling for them doesnt ever end well Anyway at the end of the trip we couldnt get a bus back to our city and he got pretty mad I felt awful and I wasnt looking forward to spend the next 3 hours next to him being mad But he explained to me that it was just his survival skills nothing personal He went back to being all touchy feely and even told me he had referred to me as his wife to some lady who asked him who I was to him I told him he was full of it I knew he was just trying to manipulate me He fell asleep on my lap for most of the trip holding my hand while I caressed his hair He drooled on my pants and he was so embarrassed haha so sweet And then Once we arrived and left the bus he just asked me if I could get a bus to my place from where we were Plain and cold I said yeah so he just turned around and said see ya then No kiss no hug nothing I called him out on it he turned around gave me a small peck kiss and then went away I was just in awe about how he could just shift from being so sweet to basically abandoning me there like as I was some stranger I think thats what really bothers me We shared some good moments and I opened up about my feelings for him I told him that maybe we couldnt be good as a couple because neither one of us is willing to settle down but that I did want him in my life as a friend as I admired him too much And he agreed But the way he left me there just made me feel like he never really cared And I am here now as a 36 yo woman crying like a teenager because I feel I lost someone I was really starting to care about I know I cant get his heart Im not special Im not as pretty and I am old so I dont even entertain the idea of him ever falling for me and I know I knew since we started this whole thing to prevent myself from getting hurt but I did want to be able to maybe go out with him for coffee and talk about art for years I wanted a friendship Im so confused I guess I just wanted to write about it and get it off my chest so that it doesnt eat me anymore I dont want to and I also cant tell my friends because he is kind of famous in our circles and one of my best friends told me he was a major player so I should stay away from him and Im kind of embarrassed of how it played out I miss him I messaged him a few hours after I got home back from our trip he just put a heart react on my message and that was it I dont think I can push it anymore I should wait for him to write me and Im dying thinking he might never write again Ah well I ended up being hurt despite all my efforts not to Thanks for reading If you have any advice about how to handle this it would be highly appreciated,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 05:04:53 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j6vs1y,I 26f cant feel sexual pleasure anymore and its killing my relationship,basically what the title says Ive slowly lost sensitivity since we got married 4 years ago I thought at first it was due to my depression so I got therapy Then after overcoming depression I was still experiencing very lownonexistent libido no sensitivity nothing It didnt matter if I was on my antidepressants or not before during and after it was about the same I used to be able to enjoy sex and finish but now I cant even remember the last time I finished at all No Im not interested in masturbation nor has that ever done anything to me My husband has gotten mad at me over the years and accused me of being asexual or lesbian which I dont think is the case because I KNOW I am sexually attracted to men and not women and Ive experienced normal sexual response cycles many times before especially as a teen I did save myself for marriage if that makes any difference I then thought well maybe its not my depression maybe its sexual trauma from seeing and hearing my parents doing it a lot after they always told me sex was bad religious upbringing and so I went to a sex therapist and she said she couldnt help me I had another therapist after that who I really liked and helped with everything else in my life except my ability to enjoy sex have a sex repsonse cycle despite thoroughly discussing that topic and my traumatizing experiences as a child with my parents I went to my primary care doctor and he basically told me there were no meds except one that costs 1000 a dose and only has a 10 chance of working He did blood work on my hormone levels and those were all normal so basically no one can help me and it leads to dissatisfaction on both sides of this relationship and makes me so sad I feel like I should just divorce my husband so he can find a functional woman who can have and enjoy sex with him,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 00:54:53 UTC,1,7,1.0,,,0,0

1j82bj4,Ive been collecting teeth my whole life and I practice dentistry as a hobby,When I was younger I used to steal my siblings teeth that they placed under their pillow for the tooth fairy idk why I did it but once I had a few teeth in my collection I found it very exhilarating In 5th grade my parents got called into the school because they found out that I was using my lunch money to pay kids to remove their loose teeth I successfully extracted 4 teeth before being caught I was in trouble but it was also a moment of oh a silly entrepreneur boy thing I kinda got a pass The teacher even joked that perhaps I have career in dentistry In middle school I got caught again the elementary school was attached to our middle school and I was convincing the much younger kids to give up their loose teeth Id give them snacks or candy as a trade and they were happy to oblige I was in much more trouble this time and my parents made me attend therapy I played it off as an interest into wanting to become a dentist but really there was something about taking a tooth and keeping it that was so exciting By this time I was building quite the collection My parents never learned that I actually kept the collection of teeth And now theyre both dead anyways In highschool I slowed down quite a bit I focused mostly on my studies Freshman year was rough I witnessed a fistfight that left another student with a tooth that was almost knocked down a lateral incisor 23 on the bottom it was kinda just hanging there The guy was in my class and we were acquainted so I went to help him When I saw how loose it was I just reached in and grabbed it It just came right out Everyone was shocked and I ran pretty cringe moment and everyone treated me like a weirdo after that By junior year they seemed to forget I even had some dates I subconsciously would target women in sports or heavy party girls because they tended to either lose teeth quicker or have dental issues It worked in my favor on more than one occasion After highschool I worked on going towards dental school but quickly realized it wasnt for me The science behind it just didnt interest me I really just wanted to perform extractions I had no care about restoration So I kinda just floated around working odd jobs I collected a lot of dental tools that I would use on friends and family and women I would date Today I have 97 teeth total About 49 of them are baby teeth Most of which I have taken when I was younger Some were from the children of the women Ive dated When they have a sore tooth it saves a lot to just do the extraction ourselves and we turn it into an adventure game with the kids The rest are adult teeth Ive collected over the last decade The majority of these I obtained consensually I plan to continue dentistry as a hobby My dream would be to open up a clinic in maybe Africa or India or something where I do extractions for free That way Im helping out but also enjoying myself at the same time,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 16:12:48 UTC,1,8,0.57,,,0,0

1j5ij2t,I wish I had ignored his suicide note,TLDR I am a sex worker and I let a client get too obsessed He threatened suicide when I ended things with him and I went to the police on the off chance he was serious It turned out to just be another ploy to try and get me to talk to him Lets preface this with I am an independent sex worker I do in person sex work by the hour and its my job because I enjoy it and it gives me a lot of financial security My best friend Celia also does sex work and we share notes about the job and even have the same clients on occasion She met John first John is an obese 300lb man early 30s and a high maintenance client He was very recently divorced because he cheated on his high school sweetheart wife with another friend from high school He left his wife only to have his new girlfriend leave him about a month later for another man Why did he cheat on his wife Because she had gained so much weight that he no longer found her attractive I saw photos of her she was barely overweight He on the other hand nearly doubled his weight since they got married John is a home inspector for an insurance company He makes good money by inspecting a high volume of homes but part of the job is using all the data collected to write personalized reports on each home inspection When John was married his wife did the reports for him this was illegal because the information is supposed to be confidential but he was able to get away with it because they lived together and she used his work PC to help him out So he left his wife then his girlfriend of two months left him He was desperate to get her back any which way and knew she needed money so he offered to pay her to do the reports for him which worked out because his wife was no longer willing to do them He figured out a way to log into his work from her PC trained her up and used his position as her boss to make her spend as much time with him as possible so he could potentially win her back he would only ever pay her in person for example and coerce her into spending hours with him before he paid her the money This isnt important to the story it just gives background information on his history of inappropriate relationships and manipulating women In the meantime he started seeing escorts to fill the sexual void Eventually he met Celia and very quickly fell into limerance For the first time since his ex girlfriend left him John had a new woman to obsess over He shared his whole life story with Celia texted her all the time and visited her more often than he could afford She found him exhausting to see he had strangled dick syndrome from a porn addiction and struggled to get off but would urge her to keep trying He talked constantly about himself overshared about his childhood trauma and would stay longer than he paid for forcing her to have to kick him out each time She set boundaries about him texting her so much and taking so much of her emotional energy but he kept breaking them So she enlisted my help I have a few more years experience under my belt and felt confident that I could handle his neediness After she talked me up he agreed to meet me The appointment was a success I was able to work around his strangled dick problem and he began to see us both regularly But it became obvious that he was obsessive and inappropriate He talked about Celia nonstop and shared personal details about their time together with me He also shared private details about his exwife and exgirlfriend When he saw Celia he talked about me and overshared in a similar way It made her very uncomfortable and she set boundaries around it He didnt abide by the boundaries so she fired him He was devastated But I was able to distract him and help him process the heartbreak He felt betrayed by her because she treated him as a client and he felt like he deserved better treatment I gently defended her actions but not so much that it would offend him By this point I was earning steady money seeing him so I didnt want to risk jeopardizing that cash flow I could see that he needed the full girlfriend experience so I gave it to him He was very insecure so I often needed to reassure him that he could count on me that I would be a stable person in his life so long as he kept paying my rates for time together I allowed him to take me to dinner off the clock occasionally and texted him back on occasion I didnt get triggered by his incessant texting in the same way as Celia It worked out pretty decently for a few months I felt like I was meeting his needs and he seemed happier and more stable Unfortunately my carefully set boundaries started to erode He didnt see me as an escort anymore he saw me as a sugar baby Then as a girlfriend He told me he loved me Often He started celebrating anniversaries for us and booking me for holidays I too found his company exhausting The whining the complaining the bad decisions the love bombing the delusional thinking It started to be too much I felt like I was wearing a thick mask while I was with him forcing myself not to show my disgust I hated the way he bragged about how much money he made while breaking the rules to do it I hated his nice guy syndrome and how entitled he felt to attention from women I hated the way he would eat dairy despite being lactose intolerant I hated the way he binged on McDonalds after eating a large dinner with bottomless cokes I hated the way he touched me and kissed me I hated the self obsession and the victim mentality he had I couldnt stand his inability to take any personal accountability in his life I eventually learned that despite making over 300k a year he was completely maxed out in debt because he had a gambling addiction in addition to his sex addiction He learned to count cards at the casino and managed to con a younger card counter I think he was only 21 into lending him tens of thousands of dollars to invest into being an advantage player at the casino Unfortunately John lacked discipline and lost everything on slot machines To his credit he is planning to pay the kid back but learning about this made me incredibly nervous and I started to get the sense that I was in over my head I hated the way that he would talk about being sexually abused as a child without warning in excruciating and disgusting detail I hated that he would rather spend money he didnt have on escorts and gambling than see a therapist I felt gross and drained for hours or even days after seeing him and would sometimes have to turn down other work because I didnt feel up to it The last straw for me happened Feb 16 We were supposed to see each other on Valentines day but I fell ill with the flu a few days earlier He complained every day while I was sick and pestered me dangling the money for my overnight fee over my head He wasnt able to schedule another overnight until March so if I didnt see him by Sunday I would lose out on the 2000 Also he just really really really needed to get laid and if I didnt see him hed go see another escort So still feverish and really fucking ill I let him come see me Its important to note that the first time he booked me for an overnight he touched me in my sleep This is a hard NO for me and I let him know Subsequent overnights he did not cross that boundary But this night I woke up again to him assaulting my body in my sleep My heart was racing and I felt so violated that I wanted to cry I didnt want major confrontation so I just pushed his hands away and told him I was still trying to sleep But I spent the rest of the night on high alert only able to doze for short periods of time After that I knew it was time to stop seeing him Because we planned our appointments for each month up to two months in advance it did not seem appropriate to simply ghost him I struggled to find the right way to end it I knew he was obsessively attached to me and it would be chaotic no matter how gently I tried to let him go Then an opportunity presented itself He saw another escort and fell asleep in his car in her parking lot He woke up to the police questioning him and searching his car and phone He cracked under pressure and admitted to paying for sexual services He told them about me and about her They chose not to arrest him or press charges but when he related all the information to me I decided to seize this excuse to stop seeing him I told him that for my safety I did not want him to ever contact me again At first he said he understood and said goodbye And then for the next five days he bombarded me with texts and emails He also sent YouTube videos of him crying and begging snot dripping Or drunk and begging and crying Then sober and matter of factly laying out the reasons why my fears about his interaction with the cops was unfounded More texts more emails from different accounts I responded to none of it It made me feel even more disgusted by him honestly I hoped that he would eventually tire and just go the fuck away Then he emailed me a suicide note I didnt receive it until nearly four hours after he sent it because I was busy working It stated that by the time I received it it was already too late to stop him But then three hours after the email he sent me a YouTube video suicide note which seemed fishy It has my already frazzled nerves in shambles I worried that I could somehow be found responsible if he was found dead and they traced the cause back to me I eventually gave in and called the police I posed as a girlfriend and I hoped it would be a one and done call but they kept calling me back for more information I knew his address and full name and vehicle and they wanted copies of his suicide letters They tracked him down and it turned out he was absolutely fine He just wanted me to talk to him and was willing to do anything to make it happen I guess the cop successfully conveyed to him that he needed to stop harassing me because the emails texts and videos stopped He did message my friend but she told him the same thing the cop did that he had to stop harassing me through her or else wed go to the police I wish I had ignored his suicide note I feel tricked and Im still angry about it,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 08:03:59 UTC,570,36,0.93,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j52yjk,The obsession with control with Muslim arab parents,Ive always wanted to live life on my own terms but my Muslim Arab parents make it feel impossible Even though Im an adult they still try to control every aspect of my life my career my choices even how I spend my time The moment I push back Im met with guilttripping and emotional manipulation Youre disobedient Youve dishonored us I will never forgive you until the Day of Judgment And many of the things they react this way to arent even that big of a deal For example Ive always wanted to cut my hair short but my mother made it clear that if I ever did she wouldnt forgive me and that it would be a a sin hanging over my neck until Judgment Day Even something as small as asking them to knock before walking into my bedroom turns into an argument as if having basic privacy is an act of rebellion And if not through words they use threats They tell me theyll force me into marrying someone against my will or that theyd lock me in a room if I disobey them Even if they dont act on these threats just hearing them is enough to make me feel powerless like my life isnt really mine to control It feels like their love is tied to control as if I can only be a good son or daughter if I follow everything they say without question Their obsession with obedience and authority makes it impossible for them to see me as an independent person Its as if my life belongs to them and any choice I make for myself is seen as betrayal I know they believe theyre acting out of love but it doesnt feel like love It feels like a cage Its exhausting to constantly be torn between my own happiness and their expectations Im tired of feeling like my worth is tied to how obedient I am I just want to be allowed to make my own decisions without fear guilt or the weight of their disappointment crushing me What hurts even more is that when I try to talk about this Im always met with the same dismissive responses Theyre your parents you must obey them no matter what Society expects the owns who go through this to just accept it as if their love should come with conditions and control But I dont want to spend my life suffocating under obligations I never agreed to,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 18:54:15 UTC,2,1,0.75,,,0,0
1j7nn6g,I hate love,I dont feel any hatred towards anyone but when I see couples in public on TV books I also hate love songs Once again I dont hate the people themselves or anything If anything its cute its just I want that too I think I could be lovable to someone but I never really have been apart from that one 18 year old I edated when I was 14 if that counts Heh Ive never kissed anyone held hands or cuddled with anyone and thats what I want With some one I love deeply and they love me back Theres also the fact that dating is much more difficult to me since I can only ever really be interested in someone if were close friends first plus I have different veiws towards sex essentially Im only interested in it with someone Im Iove with and I have no feelings towards any other people because thats all I need I want someone to feel the same way as me and that feels almost impossible,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 01:47:32 UTC,1,2,0.57,,,0,0
1j86p6k,My girlfriend broke up with me because I told her that do not call me man,Hi I am 21 yo person who identities as a woman though I do not have any effort to transition Only my inner cycle knows it I generally do not hide my thoughts or behaviors Many of my close friends knew that I am a trans before I told them so I am not sure if I truly identify the situation or not but hope that you understood I was dating with a girl who seems masculine She is cishet even though I did not think so when I met with her We were doing okay Cute dates romantic bonding sexual tension Everything was fine as I wish One day she refereed me as a man which I hate to hear I thought she said it by mistaken Did not talk about it until it occurred a few times more After the third time I decided to talk with her about the pronunciations ps In my native language we do not use pronounces Though still a person can be called as a man or a woman which hurts me in this context In a proper time I told her to not call me a man or mr and she asked why I explained everything I discovered about myself She was shocked by the things I told her said that she has no idea what to do and doesnt know even what to think I said its fine you have time etc to relax her A few days passed and everything was fine as I expected I have never faced with a negative things after I told my identity crises to my friends Until 14th of Feb aka Valentines day In the morning she text me that she feels awkward due to the situation and wanted to talk to me Then she called me with a crying sound Did not say anything new though it was impossible to feel the uncomfortable feelings of her We had a planned date at night which she canceled Two days after that day we broke up Just because I am not comfortable with hehim pronounces I feel ashamed and useless I have never been ashamed this much The only thing I told her that do not use man as she describes me It led us to break up I was left alone since I said truths about myself I feel anger against her want to take a revenge Though I think that it is a reasonable to breake up with somebody due to herhim identity,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 19:11:10 UTC,0,5,0.17,,,0,0
1j7fwtg,I feel left out by my girlfriend,Hello guys I really have to get this off my shoulders so i decided to make this post on here already appreciate you guys for reading it So i am M22 and my gf is the same age we are together since three years now and everything did go well for the most part The thing is i am an absolute introvert and probably suffer from social anxiety I hate to go to places where a lot of people are i cannot eat when a lot of people are around me and i just get exhausted and overwhelmed so fast this makes my life really hard tbh and its even harder because i cant understand why i feel that way like i was grown up in a great lovingly household have a good job and i am basically just a normal guy who should not complain about his life However my gf knows all those things and we talk about it and all she also tells me shes there for me and just tries to help me out as much as she can And then there was this situation yesterday it was the 20th birthday of her brother who is also a really close friend of mine and he was throwing a party with approximately 40 people and what can i say i felt like absolute shit the whole week my anxiety hit rock bottom and i felt like i couldnt handle it the night before the party i had a fucking panic attack while falling asleep So i was talking to my gf talking about how i feel and how i am getting the worst anxiety ever and so on she then tried to make me feel less anxious she told me she is there for me the whole evening she wont let me be alone and stuff and idk just trying to pick me up thats also one thing like i feel giga weak in those situations why cant i handle such things shouldnt i be the one protecting her however i am also really insecure about myself The party was on saturday 1900 in a bar my heart was racing all day i tried to calm myself down with playing some video games some csgo and some league but nothing really helped So at around 1830 i left home and was driving to the party you can imagine how i felt when i arrived we were in a group of maybe 5 people i really didnt know many people there maybe like 3 or 4 then i went to the wc to calm down a bit and when i cam back my gf was grouping with her friend the other people i knew where also with their other friends and suddenly i find myself standing in this bar alone trying to talk to some people i didnt even know just to make it less akward it was my personal hell However i couldnt just go to my gf and her friends because i would have felt ultra weird when being the only guy there coming out of nowhere i would have appreciated it so much if she would have came up the me and just would be on my site but she didnt she didnt the whole evening like in 8 hours she wasnt coming up to me once one time she was looking at me she wanted to ask me if everything was okay by signaling it i was shaking my head and telling her no nothing is ok and then she turned around and did go somewhere else like why i dont understand that i feel like the biggest loser on this earth my feelings are ultra hurt and i cant stop thinking about it i could have never done it like this if roles were switched maybe i am overreacting but honestly i dont think so like why do i even tell her how i felt like shit because of this party should i have just came up to her and her friends idk i still think it would have been easier for her to come pick me up then for me to go to them especially when she knows how i felt idk this evening made me just feel like absolute shit i feel hurt as hell i could literally start to cry right now Why do i have to be such an insecure and anti social person i just dont get it however now i am here sitting at my pc listening to music and writing this down idk if anybody will even read this but if so sorry if my english is not the yellow from the egg but i tried my best have a nice sunday evening,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 19:48:09 UTC,0,1,0.33,,,0,0
1j3j1up,Found out my partner has cheated on me with countless people for at least 2 years of our relationship,I was with my nowex fiancé for almost 4 years engaged for almost 3 years Gave him every single part of me and gave him the benefit of the doubt even after he did extremely questionable things and yep everyone on my other post was absolutely correct and he was cheating on me for around 2 years with more people than i can count saying and doing the most vile things I just took pictures of as much as i could stomach I got to 42 different chats and wanted to get as far away from those disgusting chats as possible I cant sleep I cant eat Im numb I cant even cry Im not mad Im nothing Nothing feels real I want to hate him but I dont I feel nothing I ignored my gut feelings for literally years and convinced myself I was crazy he would never do that But I was wrong I have moved into the living room I cant afford to move out We have numerous animals too He has lied to not only myself but every person around us telling them that we were in an open relationship We definitely fucking werent I gave him numerous outs and tried to break up a few times over the last 2 years which he vehemently denied but then cheated anyway While inwas miscarrying his child While I was going through the hardest part of my life While I was having trauma therapy for SA and abuse so many occasions The one thing he knows I never forgive I would forgive him for literally ANYTHING else but not cheating Ive had to do STISTD kits because I cant believe a word out of his mouth How am I supposed to believe he didnt sleep with anyone when he managed to hide all of this it goes too deep to even begin to put into words I dont trust someone who can happily hide their uncountable amount of affairs sexting flirting and fuck knows what else I feel disgusting I feel ugly I have never felt so low He wants to be friends but how can I be friends with someone who used me for years and tossed me aside I want to rip off my skin so that I can get rid of his touch I feel so violated Honestly I dont think Ill ever recover emotionally mentally or physically from this,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 19:22:06 UTC,29,9,0.93,,,0,0

1j31y7l,Grindr broke my brain and its affecting my relationship,So I 20M and my boyfriend 32M have been in a relationship for about a year Before I started dating him I was very active on Grindr and had multiple hookups Just to give you some context I really think my boyfriend is an attractive man and he is very sweet and kind to me Yes we do have a big age gap which I initially liked because Ive always been into older men but now I feel kind of insecure about it since he already works has his own apartment and can do whatever he wants while Im in college living with my parents But thats not the problem Recently Ive been feeling very turned off by him Its not that the sex isnt good but I really miss going out with different guys and I dont know why I mean I still think hes attractive but I kind of want to sleep around again even though I felt very empty when I did that before Its also been almost two months since we last had sex I study medicine and dont have much time to see himwe usually only see each other on Sundaysso its not like Id have time to go on multiple dates or anything again But I think the issue is that our relationship has reached that phase where the initial spark has faded a little Sometimes when Im at the gym I catch myself looking around at other guys My TikTok and Instagram feeds are basically just shirtless men and I still follow some of the guys I used to flirt with so their stories catch my attention At the same time while part of me wants to break up and go back to Grindr I also really like him and I know he really likes me This is my first real and longest relationship so I dont know if what Im feeling is normal And even if it is normal what should I do Id really appreciate some advice and Im happy to answer any questions you might have,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 03:51:00 UTC,0,5,0.46,,,0,0
1j73u2x,To late to regret but happy,I know the title makes no sense but its how I feel I 36f have been living with the regret that I could never apologize to someone back from high school To give some context to that I was in a sort of commonuncommon situation back in high school Being viciously bullied at school and abused outside of it Lead me to be somewhat of a target The only thing was girl bullies dont normally bully to your face they do everything if not most behind your back which lead me to blaming the only person who openly made fun of me but what he did wasnt even that bad Example he would snicker to his friends where I could hear or throw snow balls at me Chomp change in comparison to what I was going through at the time Although it was enough for me to tell everyone I hated loathed and despised him For Years and only when I became an adult did I realize that what I was saying about him was somewhat the same as what I heard about myself Hatred with no context Ive felt bad ever since and even though its been 20 years Ive always wanted to say Im sorry but could never find him Till tonight at 2am I found him and hes engaged and looks very happy So I just wanted to get this off my chest since I will stop looking now I have no intention of trying anymore cuz he deserves to not have this random piece of knowledge Thats otherwise useless to his happy life and is more so for me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 09:12:41 UTC,1,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j6zmot,I 35m think my Brother 32m hates me,I dont know what spurred this on our relationship was always seemingly good I 35m think my Brother 32m hates me Ive been in a rough phase of my life moved back in with my parents had just a terrible string of events dovetailing with my business failing and the loss of my Father all in short period He died suddenly Im still working through that I was the one who took him to the hospital a few times that week but the last time it was a serious emergency and he didnt get out He died a few weeks later after being in a coma for the time This sort of at least in my opinion galvanized us into having a closer bond Or so I thought Dad dying was only a few months ago It hasnt been a year yet But Im still trying to pick up the pieces and start moving forward And it was like our relationship with each other improved over it We were a very loving family before but this hurt us and we leaned on each other more Then I learned the other day my Mom brought the hypothetical prospect of me being homeless I dont intend to be homeless But she brought it up to him or he brought it up to her and he flat out told her that if I ever end up homeless I am not going to be living in his and his wifes house For the record I didnt ever ask or mention this But this conversation took place behind my back and he apparently said that I was never going to be allowed to live with them They have a very large house btw essentially half the rooms are empty at any given day That shocked my Mother to hear that and she told me And quite frankly it shocked me too I am not going to be homeless But to hear someone you thought you could rely on if things ever went to total shit say that its sad But what made me more sad was remembering a conversation I had with him a few months before He told me his wife 31 fs best friend 30 f who has a kid and either got kicked out of her own house or cheated or something became a single mother My brother told me he was actively considering moving her and the kid INTO their house She who has had numerous problems from heavy drug use alcohol use partying hard who has seemingly reformed her ways was welcome to live with them It didnt end up happening because she QUICKLY found a new guy But that was a total shocker to me that I who has had no problems with drugs and alcohol who helps take care of his kid who buys her toys and plays with her who has bought them gifts every holiday is lower on the totem pole than the single mom best friend of the wife It totally blindsided me and I feel betrayed Im not at any risk of being homeless but the conversation came up between my Mom and him and thats how it went To think your own brother wont be there for you but will be for some sketchy broad is totally insane And for me its like Im feeling just heartbreak resentment sadness disappointment all mixing together I love him I still do but I feel like I just got betrayed Betrayed over something that hasnt happened yet But that he thinks so low of me is shocking really I dont know what to do,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 04:27:13 UTC,2,5,0.75,,,0,0

1j5ij2t,I wish I had ignored his suicide note,TLDR I am a sex worker and I let a client get too obsessed He threatened suicide when I ended things with him and I went to the police on the off chance he was serious It turned out to just be another ploy to try and get me to talk to him Lets preface this with I am an independent sex worker I do in person sex work by the hour and its my job because I enjoy it and it gives me a lot of financial security My best friend Celia also does sex work and we share notes about the job and even have the same clients on occasion She met John first John is an obese 300lb man early 30s and a high maintenance client He was very recently divorced because he cheated on his high school sweetheart wife with another friend from high school He left his wife only to have his new girlfriend leave him about a month later for another man Why did he cheat on his wife Because she had gained so much weight that he no longer found her attractive I saw photos of her she was barely overweight He on the other hand nearly doubled his weight since they got married John is a home inspector for an insurance company He makes good money by inspecting a high volume of homes but part of the job is using all the data collected to write personalized reports on each home inspection When John was married his wife did the reports for him this was illegal because the information is supposed to be confidential but he was able to get away with it because they lived together and she used his work PC to help him out So he left his wife then his girlfriend of two months left him He was desperate to get her back any which way and knew she needed money so he offered to pay her to do the reports for him which worked out because his wife was no longer willing to do them He figured out a way to log into his work from her PC trained her up and used his position as her boss to make her spend as much time with him as possible so he could potentially win her back he would only ever pay her in person for example and coerce her into spending hours with him before he paid her the money This isnt important to the story it just gives background information on his history of inappropriate relationships and manipulating women In the meantime he started seeing escorts to fill the sexual void Eventually he met Celia and very quickly fell into limerance For the first time since his ex girlfriend left him John had a new woman to obsess over He shared his whole life story with Celia texted her all the time and visited her more often than he could afford She found him exhausting to see he had strangled dick syndrome from a porn addiction and struggled to get off but would urge her to keep trying He talked constantly about himself overshared about his childhood trauma and would stay longer than he paid for forcing her to have to kick him out each time She set boundaries about him texting her so much and taking so much of her emotional energy but he kept breaking them So she enlisted my help I have a few more years experience under my belt and felt confident that I could handle his neediness After she talked me up he agreed to meet me The appointment was a success I was able to work around his strangled dick problem and he began to see us both regularly But it became obvious that he was obsessive and inappropriate He talked about Celia nonstop and shared personal details about their time together with me He also shared private details about his exwife and exgirlfriend When he saw Celia he talked about me and overshared in a similar way It made her very uncomfortable and she set boundaries around it He didnt abide by the boundaries so she fired him He was devastated But I was able to distract him and help him process the heartbreak He felt betrayed by her because she treated him as a client and he felt like he deserved better treatment I gently defended her actions but not so much that it would offend him By this point I was earning steady money seeing him so I didnt want to risk jeopardizing that cash flow I could see that he needed the full girlfriend experience so I gave it to him He was very insecure so I often needed to reassure him that he could count on me that I would be a stable person in his life so long as he kept paying my rates for time together I allowed him to take me to dinner off the clock occasionally and texted him back on occasion I didnt get triggered by his incessant texting in the same way as Celia It worked out pretty decently for a few months I felt like I was meeting his needs and he seemed happier and more stable Unfortunately my carefully set boundaries started to erode He didnt see me as an escort anymore he saw me as a sugar baby Then as a girlfriend He told me he loved me Often He started celebrating anniversaries for us and booking me for holidays I too found his company exhausting The whining the complaining the bad decisions the love bombing the delusional thinking It started to be too much I felt like I was wearing a thick mask while I was with him forcing myself not to show my disgust I hated the way he bragged about how much money he made while breaking the rules to do it I hated his nice guy syndrome and how entitled he felt to attention from women I hated the way he would eat dairy despite being lactose intolerant I hated the way he binged on McDonalds after eating a large dinner with bottomless cokes I hated the way he touched me and kissed me I hated the self obsession and the victim mentality he had I couldnt stand his inability to take any personal accountability in his life I eventually learned that despite making over 300k a year he was completely maxed out in debt because he had a gambling addiction in addition to his sex addiction He learned to count cards at the casino and managed to con a younger card counter I think he was only 21 into lending him tens of thousands of dollars to invest into being an advantage player at the casino Unfortunately John lacked discipline and lost everything on slot machines To his credit he is planning to pay the kid back but learning about this made me incredibly nervous and I started to get the sense that I was in over my head I hated the way that he would talk about being sexually abused as a child without warning in excruciating and disgusting detail I hated that he would rather spend money he didnt have on escorts and gambling than see a therapist I felt gross and drained for hours or even days after seeing him and would sometimes have to turn down other work because I didnt feel up to it The last straw for me happened Feb 16 We were supposed to see each other on Valentines day but I fell ill with the flu a few days earlier He complained every day while I was sick and pestered me dangling the money for my overnight fee over my head He wasnt able to schedule another overnight until March so if I didnt see him by Sunday I would lose out on the 2000 Also he just really really really needed to get laid and if I didnt see him hed go see another escort So still feverish and really fucking ill I let him come see me Its important to note that the first time he booked me for an overnight he touched me in my sleep This is a hard NO for me and I let him know Subsequent overnights he did not cross that boundary But this night I woke up again to him assaulting my body in my sleep My heart was racing and I felt so violated that I wanted to cry I didnt want major confrontation so I just pushed his hands away and told him I was still trying to sleep But I spent the rest of the night on high alert only able to doze for short periods of time After that I knew it was time to stop seeing him Because we planned our appointments for each month up to two months in advance it did not seem appropriate to simply ghost him I struggled to find the right way to end it I knew he was obsessively attached to me and it would be chaotic no matter how gently I tried to let him go Then an opportunity presented itself He saw another escort and fell asleep in his car in her parking lot He woke up to the police questioning him and searching his car and phone He cracked under pressure and admitted to paying for sexual services He told them about me and about her They chose not to arrest him or press charges but when he related all the information to me I decided to seize this excuse to stop seeing him I told him that for my safety I did not want him to ever contact me again At first he said he understood and said goodbye And then for the next five days he bombarded me with texts and emails He also sent YouTube videos of him crying and begging snot dripping Or drunk and begging and crying Then sober and matter of factly laying out the reasons why my fears about his interaction with the cops was unfounded More texts more emails from different accounts I responded to none of it It made me feel even more disgusted by him honestly I hoped that he would eventually tire and just go the fuck away Then he emailed me a suicide note I didnt receive it until nearly four hours after he sent it because I was busy working It stated that by the time I received it it was already too late to stop him But then three hours after the email he sent me a YouTube video suicide note which seemed fishy It has my already frazzled nerves in shambles I worried that I could somehow be found responsible if he was found dead and they traced the cause back to me I eventually gave in and called the police I posed as a girlfriend and I hoped it would be a one and done call but they kept calling me back for more information I knew his address and full name and vehicle and they wanted copies of his suicide letters They tracked him down and it turned out he was absolutely fine He just wanted me to talk to him and was willing to do anything to make it happen I guess the cop successfully conveyed to him that he needed to stop harassing me because the emails texts and videos stopped He did message my friend but she told him the same thing the cop did that he had to stop harassing me through her or else wed go to the police I wish I had ignored his suicide note I feel tricked and Im still angry about it,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 08:03:59 UTC,570,36,0.93,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0
1j47j8o,I gained 50 pounds in a year and feel miserable about my body,Hey guys Throwaway account hereI 20F just want to vent after a trip to the mall recently that legitimately made me realize just how much my body has changed I tried on a dress in the size I was last year and after I tried to force the zipper and it didnt work I felt so disgusted with myself I weighed myself on my scale for the first time in a while and realized Id gained about 50 pounds in less than a year Id just started college and a healthy eating and exercise routine Id gotten into in my senior year of high school went down the drain during my first year as I began drinking more getting takeout and eating out at least 4 times a week and not exercising trying to balance a crazy social life with academics was just not something I was cut out for This year Im getting more into home cooking exercising and staying away from junk foods but whenever I feel like Im making progress I end up relapsing for some reason For example I made excuses during exam season and ended up getting a lot of takeout again ruining my progress Whenever I go out with friends or am with family I feel too embarrassed to mention Im trying to diet because Id always been the chubby kid growing up and I wanted to continue living as the thinner glowed up person Id become when that isnt who I am anymore As a result I end up eating a lot during hangouts or just giving in to temptations I also sometimes have the bad mentality of I ate something unhealthy today already might as well just use today as a cheat day way too often Overall this isnt just about the weight gain itself I feel like Ive lost the discipline I once had and my selfconfidence just keeps slipping away Its been a week or so after a stressful life season and Im attempting to start this process again Im now 3 days into my new routine of encouraging myself to get out more as well as eating healthier and reducing portions and Ive been seeing some good calorie deficits without even feeling too worn out I hope I can keep up the progress this time I need to do this for myself not only for my physical appearance but my mindset and to reinstill discipline Im not trying to make excuses just ranting about everything here to get it off my chest If anyone sees this thanks for reading,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 16:48:47 UTC,43,62,0.96,,,0,0
1j657gu,Am I being used,Am I being used Do I 26F need a reality check Ive been friends with my friend Blake 26M for over a year now We have been pretty close since the beginning When we first met we bonded over our shared love for playing soccer together and music I would say we have many similarities We both enjoy adult animation like Studio Ghibli raves and playing board games Since we shared many similarities we kept in touch daily through text messages phone calls and FaceTime We had a mutual friend named Jennifer Jennifer and I were very close until I noticed that whenever we spent time together she spoke negatively about everyone around her As a result I gradually distanced myself from her Around the same time Jennifer and Blake started dating Although I wasnt close to Jennifer and didnt personally like her I wanted Blake to be happy Blake and I maintained a consistent relationship and communication We talked every day even during our lunch breaks via FaceTime However things took a turn when Jennifer informed Blake that I had feelings for him and wanted to pursue a romantic relationship with him That was not the case and I was even in a relationship at the time As a result Blake ended our communication to preserve his relationship with Jennifer We did not talk for eight months However in January he reached out to me He told me that Jennifer suddenly broke up with him in December Since then weve been hanging out again In February we attended a rave and ended up having sex that night A week later we confessed to each other that we had both harbored feelings for one another since weve first met At this point I informed him that I didnt want to be a rebound and he responded by stating that he wasnt ready for a relationship and wanted to focus on healing I accepted his decision We continued spending time together and continued having sex However I later told him that I no longer wanted to have sex with him because I was struggling to separate our friendship and romantic feelings Around the same time his exgirlfriend Jennifer filed a protective order against Blake Sidebar Personally I have had past experiences with abusive men which may have influenced my perspective However I must admit that I am not entirely aware of the details of Jennifer and Blakes relationship Given Jennifers personality I cant help but wonder if this situation is a attentionseeking ploy On the other hand I have only heard Blakes side of the story However I suggested that we establish boundaries We agreed to refrain from having sex and I told him I need a break from constant communication I also told him to fine another trusted friend to confide in about the Jennifer situation because I havent healed from my own trauma from the abusive I had endured Blake expressed his agreement to the physical boundaries and expressed he didnt want to lose me again and our friendship Since implementing these boundaries our relationship has undergone a significant change We dont talk that much anymore and when we do the protective order case seems to be the main topic of discussion Although last night I visited Blakes place to watch Star Wars During the movie he asked me to engage in a platonic cuddle We did and he said Thank you I inquired about the reason behind his gratitude He mentioned that my presence was naturing and made him feel less lonely Am I only in his life because he feels lonely,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:52:22 UTC,2,4,1.0,,,0,0

1j82bj4,Ive been collecting teeth my whole life and I practice dentistry as a hobby,When I was younger I used to steal my siblings teeth that they placed under their pillow for the tooth fairy idk why I did it but once I had a few teeth in my collection I found it very exhilarating In 5th grade my parents got called into the school because they found out that I was using my lunch money to pay kids to remove their loose teeth I successfully extracted 4 teeth before being caught I was in trouble but it was also a moment of oh a silly entrepreneur boy thing I kinda got a pass The teacher even joked that perhaps I have career in dentistry In middle school I got caught again the elementary school was attached to our middle school and I was convincing the much younger kids to give up their loose teeth Id give them snacks or candy as a trade and they were happy to oblige I was in much more trouble this time and my parents made me attend therapy I played it off as an interest into wanting to become a dentist but really there was something about taking a tooth and keeping it that was so exciting By this time I was building quite the collection My parents never learned that I actually kept the collection of teeth And now theyre both dead anyways In highschool I slowed down quite a bit I focused mostly on my studies Freshman year was rough I witnessed a fistfight that left another student with a tooth that was almost knocked down a lateral incisor 23 on the bottom it was kinda just hanging there The guy was in my class and we were acquainted so I went to help him When I saw how loose it was I just reached in and grabbed it It just came right out Everyone was shocked and I ran pretty cringe moment and everyone treated me like a weirdo after that By junior year they seemed to forget I even had some dates I subconsciously would target women in sports or heavy party girls because they tended to either lose teeth quicker or have dental issues It worked in my favor on more than one occasion After highschool I worked on going towards dental school but quickly realized it wasnt for me The science behind it just didnt interest me I really just wanted to perform extractions I had no care about restoration So I kinda just floated around working odd jobs I collected a lot of dental tools that I would use on friends and family and women I would date Today I have 97 teeth total About 49 of them are baby teeth Most of which I have taken when I was younger Some were from the children of the women Ive dated When they have a sore tooth it saves a lot to just do the extraction ourselves and we turn it into an adventure game with the kids The rest are adult teeth Ive collected over the last decade The majority of these I obtained consensually I plan to continue dentistry as a hobby My dream would be to open up a clinic in maybe Africa or India or something where I do extractions for free That way Im helping out but also enjoying myself at the same time,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 16:12:48 UTC,1,8,0.57,,,0,0
1j4a10l,In an instant I saw two lives change forever in two completely different ways,I have been trying to process and work through what I saw yesterday but it has been really hard The event itself was a lot but now Im dealing with the whys which make me feel guilty since what happened has nothing to do with me I was just a witness I tried writing through it but it hasnt been enough so Im trying again thinking that if I get it in front of others I can start to live past it Yesterday evening I was sitting on this big rock while I was waiting for the bus A little ways down the road there was a taxi van He was either backing out or adjusting his Uturn but obviously reversing and not moving super fast From where I was sitting I didnt see how fast the bike courier was going when he hit the front side of the van And the biker immediately went under the front wheel of the van and I could hear him and his bicycle crunch under the tire The position the biker was on the ground was how he stayed for the whole 20 minutes that he was out there He never moved So Im almost positive he died during the collision or if there was some way he survived he could have been fully paralyzed But there werent many people to see the accident head on like I did A man in his Jeep came out and a few security from the booth around my stop is near a campus came out to help They checked for signs of life and directed traffic around him and had someone call 911 Police came and did much of the same The fire department came and started doing CPR but they didnt take off the mans helmet The ambulance came and I didnt see any defibrillator or adrenaline unless they did those things in the back once they loaded him on the gurney and took the man away But even after they put him in the ambulance it didnt leave or take off There wasnt a rush It felt like I was out there for two hours but it all happened in about 20 minutes And its hard to think about the collision and how if the biker hasnt passed away Im sure the injuries will last a lifetime And I think about the taxi driver who just sat in the van with his head down and how he will most likely lose almost everything because of an accident I dont know why I had to see it but I did and I dont know what to do with it if anything at all,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 18:28:08 UTC,7,2,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCEDEATH,0,0

my chest and put my experience somewhere in hopes itll make me feel better Im also posting this here because I dont want anyone to try and intervene itll just make everything worse Content warning for violence as well but suicide is mentioned first so I used that flair sorry My mom is an okay mom most of the time but shes very quick to anger and has total freakouts over small things that always result in herself threatening to kill herself or saying shes going to kill herself I have a little brother who is 13 and my mom is 45 with a history of suicidal thoughts and one attempt before we were born which she told us about Whenever we get into huge fights she usually takes my stuff and threatens to destroyburn it she never does she never lets me talk and always screams over me and then of course she threatens to kill herself and says its because of me and my brother and she says we ruined her life I can understand why she resents us to an extent my brother and I are rape babies and we look like our dad On the topic of him hes an abusive rapist who wasis addicted to drugs and who hasnt been in our lives since I was 3 He has gone off the radar for a few years and nobody knows where he is My mom keeps threatening to send us back to him and has shown us her text in him multiple times telling him shes done with us and that he needs to come get us He never has obviously The last few times weve gotten in fights I never even yelled once and just keep talking calmly because I heard that helps calm angry people down it doesnt work she just keeps yelling and theres even been a few times when I do raise my voice that she literally covers her ears and says lalalala like a toddler until I stop talking After she threatens this she usually leaves the house and says shes never coming back and says we can live with our grandmother She says either that shes gonna drive off a cliff into a brick wall etc etc or that shell just straight up abandon us and start a new life somewhere Then shell come back some time later and act like nothing happened very rarely shell apologize but if I ever try and bring up what shes done again when shes calm shell just get enraged again Ive tried talking to her about it through text only once when she was out of the house sending her a lengthy few paragraphs about my concerns but she responded back basically just shaming me and when she came home she was angry and she said she showed the text to all of her friends which are mostly my friends parents and she said they dont like me anymore and I wont be able to hang out with any of my friends anymore I started avoiding all of my friends and eventually began online school because of this and now my mom claims all my friends and their parents miss me and they dont understand why I dont talk to them anymore I dont know what to believe anymore When she isnt in these weird freak out modes shes an okay mom but she snaps at random stuff before flipping like a switch and being happy again Just yesterday she was yelling and slamming around her computer because she couldnt upload her photos to Facebook shes a photographer A few people had just been over to fix our dryer about an hour earlier which has been broken for months so mid yelling at her computer she just got up and went to go text out the new dryer and then when it worked she was all smiles and apologized for yelling She also frequently tells me and my brother that were the only thing keeping her alive and that she would probably kill herself without us and shes told us multiple times that she doesnt own a gun because shes afraid that when we grow up and move out shell kill herself because she has no one to rely on anymore This scares me and I want to move away for college when Im grown I planned on leaving this household as soon as possible but I dont really want to anymore because she keeps saying things like that She says stuff like that and says she loves me and my brother but then says the exact opposite when she gets really angry and says she wants to die because of us and she blames everything shes mad at on us stressing her out Shes also gotten physical with me and my brother multiple times like digging her nails into the back of my neck and holding my face into a pillow because I wouldnt give her my phone because she said she was gonna break it chokeholding me and dragging me out of me room before locking me out of my room and tearing it apart because I hid my art tablet from her and more Shes done stuff with my brother too and Im ashamed to admit this but I dont know what because whenever shes mad at him I just hide in my room so I wont get punished for helping him He does the same when she does that stuff with me I only know she hurts him because I can hear it I dont want to call the police Im scared and I dont want to live with my grandma or in a foster home or anywhere else and I dont want to be separated from my brother and pets She actually encourages me to call the police on her and says shed rather go to jail than live with us I just want to explain to her how her her actions hurt me and my brother and I want to get her to stop Theres been periods of times where everything has been fine for a while and my family is just a normal happy family and I cry sometimes thinking about how thats what my family could be like if my mom wasnt the way she was I know Im doing it to myself at this point by not calling the police but Im just scared and keep hoping things will change Right now is one of those times where everythings fine my mom is currently

1j83oid,My dog was my whole world and now hes gone,My dog and I had been through a lot the past couple years He was a stud at a puppy mill and was abandoned then found by a rescue My sister found the page for him and I fell in love with him immediately A wheaten terrier with a torn ear who was scared of everything and everyone It took some time but he became the sweetest dog Id ever seen Still easily scared but god was he a good boy There are so many moments from my time with him that I look back and wish Id cherished more He had so many oddities and I loved him He never demanded attention but he always wanted to be present No matter what room I was in he wanted to be there I set up blankets for him around the house so no matter where I was he could hang out with me He got sick a couple years ago and because of a really bad vet the underlying condition went untreated for a long time After some surgery and a lot of medication we got it under control He required constant care but I never complained I loved taking care of him and given the life hed lived before me he deserved to be loved and taken care of I knew when I adopted him at 6 or 7 years old that hed get old and sick in time During that time my marriage to my partner fell apart I learned after we separated that shed cheated on me with her boss which led to the end of his marriage as well Shed lied to me manipulated me and abandoned me I was miserable but I still had my sweet boy She demanded so much in the divorce She took so much from me financially physically and emotionally But I still had my sweet boy Well in January the divorce was finally settled and I was so ready to move on to a new chapter But my dogs regular checkup revealed some unfortunate news The medication he was on made him susceptible to UTIs and a drugresistant strain took hold of him and basically never let go He needed surgery he needed medication he needed so much but when none of the three antibiotics we tried worked he didnt want to eat he didnt want to drink he just wanted to rest I realized it was time I work from home and I havent gotten out much with everything going on So all day every single day he was a part of every facet of my life My morning routine my work routine my bedtime routine my meals His bed next to my desk The sound of his collar jingling or the little whimpers when he was dreaming At home he was my whole world Everything I did I did with him And now hes gone I havent been this alone in ten years It doesnt just feel sad or empty or lonely it feels wrong It feels like these patterns in my life made sense with him in them and without him every room in this house feels like its missing something My personality makes me very focused on problemsolving and I feel like Im sitting in a problem that cant be solved I just have to exist in it until it doesnt feel like a problem anymore And I dont know if or when thatll be I just miss my dog Im thankful to have had such an incredible creature be part of my life but I just miss my dog,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 17:08:21 UTC,11,7,0.92,,,0,0

1j4judy,I was the daughter they finally learned how to control,Everyone talks about the eldest daughter trauma the one who raised her siblings like a second mother the one who carried the whole house on her back while nobody even asked if she was tired But no one ever talks about the last daughter the one everyone thinks had it easy The one who was loved a little more spoiled a little more protected a little more but never really seen They say I was the lucky one the child who walked on a path already cleared by others I always knew when to be careful and when to stay silent because my sisters had already made the mistakes I wasnt allowed to make Every fight had already been fought before I even reached that age Every heartbreak came with a warning before I could fall too deep They think I had it easy because I never had to struggle for my freedom What they dont know is I never got the chance to fight for it either I was the daughter who grew up watching the cracks in the house but I was never allowed to acknowledge them I was the one who learned how to laugh off the fights how to pretend I didnt hear the shouting behind closed doors I was the daughter who learned how to act dumb because if I smiled enough if I played the little girl they wanted me to be theyd believe they protected me from the ugliness of this house What they never realized is I saw everything I just stayed silent because youngest daughters arent supposed to know what pain looks like Nobody ever asked how I felt Nobody ever wondered if I was okay because the youngest ones are always supposed to be happy by default I became the light of the house not because I wanted to but because someone had to be The clown who made everyone laugh at the dinner table so they could forget how broken everything really was The one who took up responsibilities without being asked peeling garlic in the kitchen making tea for guests finishing the little chores nobody wanted to do Not because anyone told me to but because the guilt of letting my mother do it alone would eat me alive I was the obedient one the daughter who never crossed the line The one who said yes to everything who stayed quiet when she wanted to scream who shrunk herself down to fit into the version of me they wanted to see My sisters got to rebel got to be wild got to disappoint the family but by the time it was my turn my mother was already too tired There was no space left for me to be difficult I had to be the perfect daughter The easy one The one who never asked for too much Maybe thats why I feel so distant from my own mother She had nothing left to give by the time I came along I watched her have those long deep conversations with my sisters conversations I never got to have The only thing she gave me was rules Maybe she thought if she was harder on me she could save at least one daughter from turning out like the rest I was always loved I was always taken care of But not because of who I was because thats just what youre supposed to do with the youngest child Love them spoil them protect them but never really see them Nobody ever wonders what happens when the child who made everyone laugh starts crying behind closed doors Nobody wonders if the girl who had it easiest was silently drowning in the weight of trying to be perfect They called me lazy when I took two gap years not knowing I spent more time peeling vegetables with my mother than studying for my own future They called me spoiled when I got everything I wanted not knowing I gave up dreams before I could even name them just to make life easier for everyone else They called me the lucky one but how lucky can you be when your whole life is built around making sure nobody in the house feels like they failed you I was never the rebel but I dont think I ever wanted to be the perfect daughter either,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 01:25:32 UTC,88,34,0.86,,,0,0

1j6gkb7,Obsessed with my best friends pornstar girlfriend,Im still trying to wrap my head around the fact that my friend from high school is dating a pornstar I mean Ive known him for years and weve been through thick and thin together But when I stumbled upon her videos my mind was blown I couldnt believe what I was seeing Shes doing some extremely hardcore stuff Im talking multiple giant cock gangbangs and her body is just wow She has a gigantic ass that seems to be the center of attention in almost every scene At first I felt a mix of emotions shock curiosity and a little bit of jealousy I wont lie Ive always thought of my friend as a bit of a shy guy so its hard to imagine him with someone whos so outgoing But as I watched more of her videos I started to feel a twinge of concern I mean this is a whole different world that Im not familiar with and I worry about my friend getting hurt or caught up in something thats not good for him But at the same time I have to admit that Im also kind of fascinated Ive never seen anything like this before and its like my eyes are glued to the screen I feel like Im getting a glimpse into a secret world that most people dont know about and its both thrilling and terrifying I dont know how to process all of this to be honest Part of me wants to talk to my friend about it to ask him if hes okay and if he knows what hes getting himself into But another part of me is afraid of judgment of being seen as a hypocrite or a voyeur I mean who am I to judge what hes doing or who hes dating All I know is that my mind is reeling and I dont know how to reconcile my feelings about this I guess all I can do is wait and see how things play out and hope that my friend knows what hes doing,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 12:54:39 UTC,0,142,0.47,,,0,0

1j4bxql,The only thing I will ever regret,Hello everyone I 20m miss my 19f exgf so much When we first met eachother 2 years ago everything was perfect We were in love and having good times no matter what We were long distance about an hour and 30 minutes from each other and we hated it but it never mattered The more days that went by the more in love we were At the time I was struggling with really bad paranoia and I quit my job and ran away to go live with her I left my family and most importantly my grandmother behind I wanted to show her everything I wanted was with her and her only but I think that was one of the worst decisions we made during our relationship We were only together for 23 months at the time and I stayed with her brother while she lived with her mom and step dad We started spending every second together and it was just getting even better but we started getting aggravated with eachother more I eventually got a job 12 months after moving in with her brother Then things started to pick up again probably because of the motivation of going to work and getting money to spend on her She never cared about the money I did its the only way I knew how to prove my love Her mom and step dad were both alcoholics and abused eachother quite often and they really werent a fan of me for some reason They got in a fight one night and started treating my ex wrong so I stepped in and pulled her out of that situation before she got hurt and I took her to taco bell at 3am After that we started fighting a whole lot more because money was getting tight and it was the only thing that made me feel stable I wasnt comfortable living with her brother at all and was starting to wish I never moved in We started getting more and more distant until the day she got me a cat A beautiful baby and I named her Honey She was the sweetest thing ever and it brought me and my ex closer than ever Then I got kicked out of her brothers for unknown reasons I just had to be out by the weekend so I called up my family for some help and me and my ex moved into a camper with some of my distant relatives We were still arguing and growing more distant but we worked out some of the problems but it just wasnt enough We ended up moving back in with our families separately and only seeing eachother on the weekends but going from living with eachother for over a year and then all of a sudden splitting apart again brought some issues My trust issues got very very bad and I started with my outbursts and starting arguments for no reason We both did and we would blame eachother for everything I broke up with her and got back with her multiple times I started running from our problems and coming back expecting it to be the way it was when we first got together but it never turned out that way I started focusing on myself and what I could do to be better for her I tried so many things and so many ways but I could never find a way that worked and made us both happy I wanted it to work out so much but she got fed up with me and blocked me on everything I broke her heart so many times and lied to her because I didnt wanna admit I was wrong I miss her so god damn much and wish I could go back in time to fix things I want to hold her one more time I want to give her all the affection she deserves I wish I payed a little bit more attention to her and put myself to the side for once My only regret so far in life I wish I treated you a little bit better Peyton If by any chance you find this and read it just know Im still trying my best and not giving up just for the chance I get to love you like I should have Honey was the best thing we ever had and youre the only other person that I share those memories with You have her kitten and I miss getting to see her Youre my fucking soulmate Peyton and I will never love anyone else like I love you If my life ends with you not by my side then it was all a waste My life will have no meaning,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 19:43:50 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j3bpsl,My wife had an affair when my mum died and blames me for the relationship breakdown,Hi all I 30m started posting some of these incidents in AITAH but it soon became clear that in some of these cases she very clearly is TAH and theres no point in even asking So Ive come here just to list all the effed up things that have happened to me in the final months of 2024 I anticipate this will be very long have fun So for some context In late 2023 my wife and I bought a house and I was spending a lot of time for a couple of months working on the house almost every evening and weekend I could spare During this time my wife started going out with some new friends including this guy J Randomly one evening she looks a bit funny and says to me I dont trust myself around him I hear this my heart sinks a bit but I feel like we have a strong relationship and I tell her I trust you not to do anything stupid just be sensible about what time and how you spend time with him She liked this and we moved on but I decided to keep an eye on the situation She started spending more and more time with him and these new friends going out and getting drunk while I was working late on the house It was starting to make me uncomfortable and eventually I said so I didnt ask for anything I just expressed my feelings She said she understood but theyre just friends and theres nothing to be worried about They keep hanging out until one day his partner a woman married to another man forbade him from speaking to my wife because she was jealous So he ghosted my wife and she got really upset It hurt me to see how upset she was for two reasons 1 My wife is upset thats upsetting 2 Shes so upset it feels weird and shes acting like a breakup She asked me to proof read a message she wanted to send and I read a bit and had to put it down I said this is a breakup message I refuse to do this She remained adamant they were just friends and nothing more I accused her of having an emotional affair again she denied it and was adamant they were just friends and that I need to get over this Some weeks later J comes back on the scene having broken up with his previous gf My wife says shes going to talk to him but be very boundaried I tell her that Im uncomfortable with all of this if shes going to see him she should be careful A week or two later she comes stumbling in at 5am I ask where shes been and she explains that she has been out with J went back to his place at around 2am and they played guitar I was hurt and upset this was the antithesis of everything we discussed I said you cant do that to which my wife took great offense accusing me of controlling her and being misogynistic To be clear I never forbade her from seeing him I never tried to tell her what to do beyond please be careful and dont do anything silly and please respect me That time I said you cant do that was the first and only time I specifically said what she could and couldnt do And to me its obvious I wasnt controlling her I was just not saying the quiet part out loud which is you cant do that unless you want to ruin our relationship She is adamant nothing happened and weirdly I believe her The issue for me is that she did the opposite of what we both agreed she disrespected me and my feelings and she is putting our relationship in jeopardy To her the issue is that I tried to control her by being upset and that Im putting restrictions on her She pointed out shes a grown ass woman and she can spend time with her friends if she wants to My being upset about it is a mode of control and I need to stop In principle I have no problem with her seeing her friends but this guy makes me uncomfortable So that all happened we were on the rocks she is clearly having an emotional affair at the very least but adamantly refuses to acknowledge it Im trying desperately to find a way to move forward and recover our relationship if we can Then October 2024 My mum died suddenly I wont go too much into it but it happened very sudden shocking it sucks My dad died when I was young so a lonely time as well This is where my wifes behaviour started to seriously turn Im going to list the major events as I remember them in the order they happened I will also try to list areas where I was less than perfect but to be perfectly honest I dont think there are many Like really I have to keep checking myself surely it wasnt all so one sided surely I contributed meaningfully to this Just doesnt seem to be the case Anyway here goes The day after my mum died we are at the pub with a friend we are talking about it all My friend asks my wife how shes doing and she says Im worried everyone is going to forget that my mum died For context her mum passed away 34 years ago from a long contracted period of illness It spanned over COVID and lock down I lived in their house with them over all of lockdown and helped look after her mum watching her die and taking care of her for over a year My wife had been dealing with this tragic and difficult loss for some time so I had some sympathy to her reaction But bottom line its a shitty thing to say to your partner who lost their mum one day ago that youre concerned youre not going to get as much attention any more That my loss will overshadow hers It speaks volumes and sets up what is to come A day later she says shes going to go and see this J guy I mentioned above The one Im really uncomfortable with I made it very clear that I am uncomfortable with this and now is not the time to be testing me like this I know hes just your friend and theres nothing actually happening Im an idiot but this does upset me and I dont need to deal with this right now Id appreciate it if she didnt go She said she understood but not to worry this is the last time shes going to see him really Their relationship has petered out more or less so it will just be the occasional coffee which is all shes going for Oh and they had plans to go see a jazz band in a few weeks time but shell cancel that on account of the funeral Shes barely going to see him so dont worry I said it was fine I saw it as if shes being truthful then I can accept the cost of one more uncomfortable period if the payoff is they really do just leave each other alone for a while She went and came back a couple hours later no big deal So the following week we had a spa trip booked I bought it for her for Christmas We decided to still go in spite of everything because why not I need it It was great Had a lovely time reconnected I was able to relax and destress a bit But on the last day were in a hot tub together sharing a cocktail and shes on her phone Shes messaging J and arranging to meet the next day I took offense and said I thought you werent seeing eachother any more Its just to study Im falling behind on my thesis So the next day she gets up early and leaves we agree shell be back at lunch Im very unhappy about all of this and just basically sulk all morning I leave my phone upstairs and try to get on with my day as best I can waiting for her to come home and talk about it 3pm comes and goes I take a nap 5PM comes and goes I check my phone a couple messages and a couple missed calls Apparently she decided to stay out for lunch and asked if it was ok When I didnt reply she decided to stay out for dinner and drinks too She didnt get home until after I went to bed I spent the whole evening feeling miserable and hurt I dont need this She comes home and I confront her asking if she thought any of that was ok Turns out its all my fault because I didnt reply to her and my lack of immediate response was me emotionally blackmailing her to come home It really wasnt I just didnt want to have my phone on me and was expecting her to be home at the agreed time Maybe a little silly and selfish in my part Maybe But Im grieving and shes already pushed my boundaries I needed some alone time to deal with it I had no idea I was emotionally blackmailing her So anyway she stays out all day with the person that makes me uncomfortable days after my mum died days after she promised she wouldnt and Im the asshole for not keeping my phone on me in case she decided to change her mind Great A week goes by and its the day before were due to leave for my home town ready for the funeral in a few days She asks me if we can hold off going for one extra day so she can go to this jazz thing with J I say wtf you said that wasnt happening Thats why you saw him earlier because you werent doing this She says she knows but she really wants to go I confront her and say I really dont feel like Im your top priority No youre not my top priority Please elaborate Well I just dont see it as a hierarchy Everyones in a circle around me and youre all equal priority You J etc Right but Im your husband and my mum just died Does that not put me ahead of anyone else No Looking dead in my eyes No Fine Go to your jazz thing idgaf She says might as well the damage is already done by me even asking right Yeah The damage is already done I cant believe what she said to me so cold so heartless so unempathetic so selfish Btw this woman is a qualified therapist let that sink in Hope you dont get her as your therapist good lord So she fucks off the next day and I delay my departure for her social plans I contemplated going down without her but the ensuing drama and questions from family would not be worth it It was my mums funeral after all not my marriages The funeral goes fine the week is fine She doesnt say or do anything shitty I focus on the funeral and family and everything and mostly not think about the fireball train wreck that is now my marriage On the drive home my wife decides to tell me that she thinks her ex boyfriend from school days is the one that got away Im dumbfounded because 1 What a thing to fucking say as I drive us home from burying my mother 2 Its just patently untrue So completely ludicrous that Im not even bothered by the notion that she might be serious It is at this point that it dawns on me that she may be hurting me on purpose The next day we are having coffee and she says to me I never wanted this house I never wanted this dog and I dont want kids Lets be clear I did not push her to get the house or the dog If anything she pushed for both of them but it was pretty mutual She is now tearing up the entire foundation of our marriage She is lighting fire to the entire future plans we had The house and dog that I poured my heart and soul into for her for us She never wanted apparently Just brutal Savage She acted shocked when I started crying I didnt expect it to upset you this much Incredible The next day I go to my friends place and just cry on her for hours I am in a complete state Its all too much overwhelming awful and just confusing Why is she being so mean I wondered if she hated me then I thought maybe shes trying to get me to break up with her Shes clearly having an affair of some variety My mum just died Maybe she just doesnt want to be the person to break up with their partner when their mum died Especially a partner who cared for her dying mother And especially because she was having an affair Shed be seen as such an asshole so rather than just admitting everything and being an asshole she decided to torture me until I pulled the plug myself Not her fault then is it Anyway that thought occurred to me But Im in no state to decide the fate of my marriage Im grieving Im distraught Im reeling from the various harrowing incidents listed above Barely enough time to process one before another comes along It may seem obvious to you and me now but at the time I just couldnt see clearly what was happening or exactly why My friend gave me some advice that I didnt need to decide anything right now that settled me Took some pressure off At around this point my perception of time gets a bit funny Mixture of grief and brain fuckery So now Im pissed at her I dont trust her I feel badly hurt She says shes going out with J again I say I dont care Resigned to this shitty behaviour unable to reason with her unable to discuss it unable to make the call and leave She comes back at 4 in the morning high AF they had taken MDMA together The oxytocin drug Under the influence of this drug he confessed his feelings for her She was totally shocked by this and said it was all a little uncomfortable Ok I said Whatever The next day were driving somewhere and I really cant remember what she said but it just set me off I think it was something along the lines of I dont know why youre so upset with me I was furious I was worn down I was mistreated For the first time I raised my voice I was shouting at her Listing all of these shitty instances that were cutting me up whilst I grieved I raised my hand clenched my fist and brought it down on the steering wheel in anger It made a dull bang noise This was the start of a new narrative from my wife The scary aggressive husband narrative The perfect excuse in her eyes to leave me without raising questions about her betrayal and complete lack of empathy Youre scary she said I was cowering in the passenger seat she said Youre just like my aggressive father she said I tried defending myself but please remember I was in a complete mess mentally and emotionally I started to believe her Maybe I did lose control maybe I am one of those guys Maybe I threatened her I thought that yes it was an outburst but no it wasnt threatening Im not a big scary person Im just a human being that has been deeply hurt and wounded when theyre at their most vulnerable But maybe thats not a good enough excuse Maybe I crossed a line She sowed the seeds of doubt in my vulnerable mind I started doubting my memory of events did I black out for a moment and do something really scary She told me that I was potentially abusive To be clear shes not accusing me of being abusive shes accusing me of maybe becoming abusive in the future And she cant take that risk Im not safe to have children with you know the children she said she didnt want before I ever shouted I believed her What a monster I was How could I be so terrible I never thought I was like this No wonder she was having an affair for the last several weeks I shouted at her and hit my hand on the steering wheel in frustration She lent into it but not too far She was manipulating me telling me its ok You just need to go to therapy and sort yourself out As long as Im going along with her narrative shes all ok my side If I ever doubt her Im terrible and hurtful and potentially abusive She decided it was time to end things she had the get out of jail free card she wanted She didnt leave me for another man and emotionally abused me when my mum died she saved herself from an potentially abusive relationship My greatest crime was hitting a steering wheel One of the last things she said to me She spoke with a friend of hers who had broken up with her partner of 8 years had two wild years and then they got back together for several years I asked what she meant by wild years just connecting with lots of people So she turns to me and says I think were a lot like them you know I wanted to say I bet she didnt abuse her partner I bet she didnt hurt him when his mum died I bet she didnt manipulate him into believing he was abusive And the sheer audacity of sitting there and looking to me to approve of her fucking a bunch of people for two years before I take her back I said nothing she nudged me Desperate for me to implicitly condone her actions and behaviours by giving even the slightest inkling that I might take her back when shes done fucking around I turned away and left I was done Not two days after our official break up she declared herself in a relationship with J But to her family she accused me of being aggressive and scary and forcing her to leave She denies having had an affair pretending that her and J are not an item She goes to my friends and asks them to meet her new partner J Again implicitly asking them to condone her actions by meeting this J guy My friends all refuse and begin to cut contact with her Theyve seen what shes done They knew what she was doing to me before I did They wont tolerate her BS I love my friends My wifes sister knows everything she heard it all from my wifes point of view and STILL she took my side Then she heard what I had to say boy was she pissed She told her whole family the truth my wife tried to convince them that her sister was a liar That she didnt understand Shes pregnant btw My wife just tried to turn her family against her pregnant younger sister In her attempts to not be seen as a terrible heartless B that would abandon her husband when he needed her most she turned herself into an even worse monster An abuser according to some A liar a manipulated a nasty piece of work Sometimes you meet your destiny on the path to avoid it Im 2 months free I dont want to let another human being close to me like that again but maybe that will change with time My therapist and my wifes sister whos also a qualified therapist both said that she has been emotionally abusive to me Coercive controlling behaviour I dont know about that but I know Ive been treated unfairly Thanks for reading this far I hope it was entertaining X,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04

1j4njw2,Im helping someone and everyone tells me Im a great person for that but I dont really feel that way,There is this girl Im helping out because she was kicked out of her place She is not my friend just an acquaintance of a good friend of mine She is staying with me for a bit because I have the space I also got her a job at the same warehouse Im at Everyone is telling me that it is such a nice thing to do and that Im such a good person Honestly I dont feel that way I usually just respond with Im just doing what I wish someone would do for me on that situation I dont really feel that way I dont really care about it The only reason some people at work know my boss and a few coworkers in management its because I dont want rumors going around seeing us on the same car or getting in together I know Im supposed to feel flattered about the compliments and all that but it just feels awkward to me There was a time I would be happy for all the good comments but now it just feels hollow,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 04:39:19 UTC,1,2,1.0,,,0,0
1j3pwgn,my friend left me and i dont know what to do with myself anymore,my friend left me and i dont want to be here without him i would normally never turn to reddit for help but im here right now i female have been struggling so much lately i large factor of struggling is about this one guy i bet you hear that so much but this is the only time in my life that ive ever ran into a problem like this i guess i can full on lore drop here i met this guy that ill call steve in early 2023 ever since i met him i had this deep connection with him i have serious feelings for him and ive never crushed on somebody before it took me up until october 2024 to tell him about how i actually feel i visited him at his college right before i told him its the main reason why i told him in the first place when i told him he never really told me about why he didnt like me back steve has always been a very private person but i assumed this would be different after i opened up to him i was struggling so badly i eventually told him that i needed to stop talking to him when i told him that which was in november of 2024 he finally told me that he was gay i really dont know why he was keeping that bit of information from me for so long he had talked to me about liking girls before so i just assumed that he couldve been bi because he did kind of give off gay vibes me not talking to him only lasted like a week and a half because i took a gummy and texted him i tried to tell him that i needed to stop again but he just kept on texting me and i felt bad for just not answering him this man has been the light of my life for such a long time it feels texting him was one of my favorite aspects of the day and it was what got me through dark times because it felt like he was there for me fast forward a few weeks he tells me about this guy that he was talking to he told me that he had been talking to this guy for 3 months and that this was the first time he has ever really liked someone back he randomly texted steve saying that he only had platonic feelings for steve and steve got so upset he sent me a voice message of him almost on the verge of tears i told him that i shouldnt be talking to him about this but i did anyways because i loved him i tried my best to help him through the situation i shared what i did when he told me that he didnt like me back and i told him that i would be there for him day and night which he never ever took advantage of even though he said that this was one of the darkest times of his life all was good until last month steve was starting to act really weird towards me he said that hes sorry if he has been weird he was never answering me despite texting me 247 days prior so i confronted him about it he told me that he went on a date with another guy i ended up leaving him on read and he said I was going to send a text to you in the morning but honestly it just feels more right to do one now Im sorry I was slightly inebriated in my last response and thats not fair for you I do just want to let you know I am doing well enough mentally right now Like am I the best lve ever been no but Im definitely very much in a manageable position right now I know whatever I say or do wont stop your anxiety but I want to ensure you that if there was something going on I would let you know You are a very close friend of mine and you are definitely someone I come to when things are not right The reason I initially said I was just busy yesterday and not what I was actually doing was because I didnt want to make you uncomfortable for anything like that But it is for the best for me to be honest with that kind of stuff and lll make sure to keep you in the loop As for the insert boy name here stuff I dont really want to concern you with a lot of it because it honestly does depict me at my worst sometimes I try to handle most of that without mentioning anything because its usually easier and I dont like getting people involved that shouldnt have to be I hope this kinda helps digest a little bit i still left him on delivered because i just couldnt handle the pain he has put me through i texted him almost a week later stating that i am in so much pain and i cant take it anymore every single time that i try to make it clear that im deeply struggling he never seems to care although hes said that he cares for me deeply just last week i had this very depressive episode and he asked me how things were going and i said not well i genuinely think i am the most depressed ive ever been right now i am at my lowest point i can barely eat sleep or focus im just empty i cant even get up and be productive i dont even feel like im living im just existing you wouldve thought that i wouldve been so happy and excited on saturday but i didnt even care about being at insert my favorite place here im starting to lose interest in everything and after i said that he didnt answer as a follow up message i said im taking this radio silence as a strong sign and i dont want to hear some excuse like sorry i forgot to respond or i couldve sworn i responded originally i had a way bitchier intro to this message but thats not me all the times you said that you cared about me i knew they were all lies i knew i shouldve listened to my gut the entire time i really really really wish i wouldnt have responded to that one message in february of 2023 i feel like all of our friendship has been is me constantly doing shit to be such an amazing friend for you but you NEVER returned the favor and im sick and tired of it i made you all those bracelets i made that painting for you i always checked up on you i sent you a heartfelt message on your birthday but did you ever do anything like that for me sorry for doing so much for people and expecting something small back every single one of my friendships ends like this all youve ever done is just constantly lie to me and i bet you think that i just havent noticed cooking dinner till 11pm going home because you have a headache immediately passing out when you go to bed ill try my best to respond to you any of these sound familiar im so tired of how horrible of a person youve been towards me i try my absolute hardest for you ive gotten out of bed eaten kept my grades up tried to take care of myself picked myself up off the ground and smiled just for you maybe im just too generous loyal compassionate empathetic and sympathetic as a person i genuinely dont know why you still talk to me or why i still talk to you ive given our friendship so many second chances but this is my breaking point im so fucking sick and tired of everything i really hope that when i do end up taking my own life that not a single tear falls from either one of your eyes i always wanted to tell you that id make the sky so pretty and orange for you but i dont want to do that anymore notice how i didnt even mention my feelings for him in that message once now that we arent talking i dont know what to do with myself anymore ive grown so attached to this man and i dont know what to do without him he has been my rock ever since we met he was all i had and now i have absolutely nobody ive been lonely my entire life and i would say that it got worse when i started having feelings for him but now that hes gone my loneliness is ten times worse i am seconds away from writing my notes and saying goodbye i am so picky with who i want to be with if they arent aligning with what i want to do in my future i wont be happy with them long term i dont date just for fun i date to marry the reason i grew so attached to steve was because he aligned with my future im so alone and empty with him gone and i feel like it would be a better place if i said my goodbyes i dont want the space if thats what hes giving me i unfollowed him on everything but i havent blocked him i just dont want to keep going if it means that im not friends with him

1j7wgza,Every good friend I make ends up leaving me,Before I get to it I wanna say I do have friends IRL but theyre just shallow friends that I only hang out with for fun if I tried getting a little deep with them theyll get disgusted the good friends Im talking about here are two friends that I made online and they both left for no reason The first one is a girl from another country that Ive met in a game at first our friendship revolved on Playing together but with time we became close and she opened up to me about her depression and struggles with life I also opened up to her and we comforted each other She invited me to talk on discord and so on we kept talking about fun stuff and life after a month she just blocked from everywhere I still dont know why I tried contacting her through her friend and she just acted out cold and thats it I keep thinking about why she did that could be because I was annoying and message her a lot could be because I was too depressing for her The second one is also a girl from another country and this one I got really close with cause I told her about my experience with the first one I tried to avoid the mistakes I made with the first one she invited me to talk on Instagram we would talk for hours and all night our conversation would go from laughing to talking about hobbies and life we would tell stories from our childhood and she also opened up about her problem and tried my BEST to comfort her and it worked she tried to get me to talk but I just refused with time and as we got closer I give in and talk and she was soo supportive we continue talking for a month with almost the same energy until one day she also blocked me from everywhere I dont understand I made sure I dont pressure her I give her the space to want to talk to me yes I might of messaged more but I made sure she not busy I even end a conversation if I sense that she needs to study I tried reaching out for her from another account and she said nothing personal dont overthink it I asked for a reason but she didnt answer so I just said it was nice knowing you she said me too what have I done wrong I was supposed to make her a birthday gift and sent it to her because she did the same but it took both of us time that cant be the reason I told her Im still working on it my only hypothesis is that she didnt like someone being too close with her she wanted to be alone again and she didnt want to make me feel bad so she just blocked me she didnt block me from the second account yet should I send her this thing or not I dont know if I can get close with people again after this I feel like just staying alone for the rest of my life,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 11:30:52 UTC,1,7,0.6,,,0,0

1j5ox11,Boyfriend wants to get married and Im indifferent towards it,Back story Im F28 and my M30 wants to be married We were on and off from the years I was 1920 and when I turned 21 we got together offically and I was convinced by him and his mom to move in since I was living alone and my parents are retired in a different country From the years 1922 he was just not nice very rude and he would always choose his friends over me and his friends were always females In the early stages his friends or family will tell him to leave me and he would do it and then be adamant on staying friends when I would say no He also kept crying to me about his ex and how much she hurt him and he hid the fact he would talk to her mom like once a week When I found out he stood his ground and said no to cutting her off He only agreed to cut her off because I was pregnant with his child When I turned 23 during Covid we fell pregnant although I took Plan B I didnt realize I was ovulating so it didnt work We kept our son but he was just so rude during my pregnancy he took it upon himself to be there for a female friend all because she was dating a guy and needed help and instead of her going to her female friends my bf was always available He went as far as to stay out all night and get drunk with her and their other friends and the guy she was dating when I didnt want him to and when he returned home he cursed me and his mother out because I held him back in life I also had told him for years how important marriage was to me and he was just so whatever about it I told him while I was pregnant just ask with a ring pop since we didnt have too much money and I wanted to be married before having a kid and he came home a few days later and as I was lying on the couch he threw the ring pop and said you going to say yes right I said no because he made it seem like a chore or obligation rather than him wanting to He also spend all my pregnancy mad at me because I didnt want to name our son after him When Ive told him since I was 19 and even before when we were sort of friends at 16 that I do not want to name my son after their father name Fast forward our son is born and he is currently 4 and throughout these 4 years he keeps wanting to be married and I told him unless he has a career were he can care of the home expenses what is the point Since our son been born Ive made almost all the money paid our rent our bills hes has jobs here and there He just made one year at his current job and he does pay his part but even before our son and now Im also paying like 6070 and he pays the rest and theirs been times Ive paid 100 I told him if he becomes a police officer id feel okay and comfortable marrying him since its a good paying job and he can support us and he wants to and hes doing it for him and for us to be married But I also feel so indifferent like I dont see the excitement in calling him my husband since we skipped over the step Sometimes I feel like its my fault and I should of ignored that he threw a ring pop at me and other times I feel like if I would of accepted it I would be open to constant disrespect from him in the future Him as a father super good and kind he takes our son to school and picks him up he lets me sleep in and sleep whenever He tries to pay for dates when we are out our son and him have a strong bond He gets me flowers offers to cook even it it doesnt taste the greatest Overall him as a dad and a partner is nice I do feel spoiled But because I cant let go of how he treated me Im always going to have this fever hes going to revert back,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 14:15:54 UTC,3,9,1.0,,,0,0

1j6xt9p,i 19F at the time was kidnapped and raped by a siblings friend 32M and now hes trying to come back into my life,im going to try keep details to a minimum as i dont want anyone to recognise me from this post so identifying details like genders names ect will be changed i would also like to note that i do suffer from a form of neurodivergence that can make me incredibly naive at times in the few months preceding this kidnapper event i had a partner who i suffered quite a traumatic miscarriage with he ended up cutting me off the day i was in the hospital it was terrifying and incredibly lonely at the time a sibling of mine whom i live with had been having some friends over often and naturally i started getting to know them and would hang out with their friends too this was something i did often as i was struggling heavily with the grief of losing both my pregnancy and essentially being broken up with and left to think about it alone After hanging out with my siblings friends for a few weeks Taylor M32 started giving me gifts I have quite an interest in sterling silver religious jewellery and he had given me a few pieces during this time of us hanging out a silver chain with a saint pendant a very dainty 14k gold bracelet another small silver bracelet I thought nothing of it its quite common amongst us here to exchange gifts often among friends and family so i didnt see it as anything more than that as i myself have given people fine jewellery randomly before One day he asked me if i wanted to go to his home to see his pets and just chill and do some art I agreed as he had some very unique reptiles which i was curious to see After getting to his house it was then that things took a really bad turn He sexually assaulted me on several occasions I was not allowed to leave the house unless he was supervising me and it would only be to his garden that i could go I was also not allowed to wear any clothes in his home he would take them from me under the guise of washing them and not return them unless he wanted me to go outside with him He allowed me to return to my own home on two occasions however he was present the entire time and would not let me out of his sight and would regularly complain about how we needed to leave back to his home He would regularly belittle my appearance try to convince me that i would have to laser remove all of my tattoos as they looked disgusting he told me that my earrings were disgusting and masculine and how he couldnt believe anyone would ever have had sex with me because of how gross they were He would force me to stand on weighing scales when i didnt want to so he could know my weight and then proclaim to me that well have to fix that I know that people will probably wonder where were my parents in this situation and the reality is that they were on vacation They left the family home for multiple months at a time and whenever my mother would call me he would answer the phone on my behalf and tell her how i was happy and i was okay and convinced her that i was his girlfriend even though i was being held against my will and assaulted in his home I asked on several occasions to go back home and he would tell me maybe next week and next week would just never come and even then i had no clothes so i simply couldnt leave i managed to escape because i had a large concert planned and after arguing with him for days he finally let me leave so i could go to the concert as soon as i got home i messaged him and told him never to speak to me again or i would be calling the police for a few weeks after this he harassed me on different platforms he posted pictures of me he had taken against my will on social media saying for people to look at his girlfriend he would change his profile pictures to pictures of me or would make profiles in my name in the end i ended up blocking him and changing all of my social handles that brings us to now its been about 10 months since this happened i did not go to the police as i did not want to have to relive what happened to me he also told me many stories of violence he had committed against women who had called the police on him in the past we also had no text conversations at all prior to me being harassed by him amp i truly just believe the case would get thrown out i have had a reoccurring nightmare about him breaking into my house killing me almost every night for the past few weeks i confessed this to my sibling who introduced me to him and was told that he had been trying to contact my sibling he was claiming to have purchased gifts for them and sending them photos of the gifts he had bought and how much he had paid and that this had been happening for weeks and my sibling had been simply ignoring his messages i feel sick why would he do this why would he want to come back into my life after the terror he put me through he told me on several occasions that he in his own words felt like he was the predator and that i was the prey and it was his natural instinct to hunt me down he also told me how he had only been coming to hang out at my house because he had been fantasising about me i dont know what to do in this situation all i know is that im scared and i feel like i have no one to tell who can truly understand my story or my fears of him trying to pry his way back into my life and into my

1j4cb0j,FINAL UPDATE I went on a date with my exhusband last night,Update from this post My 35M exhusband 36M and I recently reconnected I wont go over the details of why we split or our reconciliation since Im sure the average redditor can click buttons and most likely read He was the one taking me out and promised that it would in his words knock my socks off to make up for his neglect of me He sure as hell delivered A little backstory weve been together since we were 15 and 16 respectively and have never moved out of our hometown This year would have been our 20th anniversary of getting together not marriage We were dating secretly for about five years before our parents caught us one day during summer break The fallout from finding out their son was gay actually made his parents split His dad wanted to send him away to conversion therapy Hes seen his father maybe once per year on average and every time hes incredibly cold towards me Would never refer to me as his soninlaw only my husbands pal I wonder why Anyway not what youre here to read Ill get on with the lore He picked me up from the house and wouldnt tell me where we were going but told me to dress warmly He ended up taking me to the place where we met a run down ice skating rink in our town He used to do hockey and I spent some time trying to learn figure skating until people started beating me up for it Both sports would practice at the same time and I remember barely being able to keep my eyes off him We went skating I tried to pull off a few of the moves I remembered he only had to catch me from falling on my ass once or twice and I wont complain about an attractive man that I love hooking his arm around my waist and we spent an hour or so there until our feet hurt At one point I said that my face was getting cold so he skated around in front of me and placed his gloved hands on my cheeks to warm me up I just about burned a hole in the ice from how hard I was blushing I swear to God He wasnt done then We left and went to dinner specifically the restaurant where we had our first date Its a cheap holeinthewall place seeing as we were poor teenagers when we first met We chatted and ate food that probably took 5 years off our lives he was an incorrigible flirt and even held my hand underneath the table like he did all those years ago I know I said I never stopped loving him and I stand by that but I think I somehow fell in love with him a thousand times over again during that meal At the end of dinner he asked if I had energy for one more simple thing to which I agreed He took me a while out of town to a dark sky zone park specifically the one where he proposed to me ten years ago He set out a blanket to sit on and another to cuddle under and we went stargazing all bundled up together You never know how much you miss the sound of someones heartbeat until you havent heard it for so long We shared a bottle of sparkling grape juice in plastic champagne flutes and dumb giggly kisses It felt so similar yet so different He told me in a moment of quiet that he loved me and oh God It took everything I had not to cry I barely hesitated before asking if he wanted to change venues He seemed surprised but eagerly accepted I ended up at his place as some of you may have seen from my edit on my second post yesterday I wanted to take it slower than this but it was so hard to I was so starved of affection and hadnt been intimate with anyone for just about six years Im gonna keep what happened at his between us but all Ill say is that his medication was no issue and all of you should be jealous I woke up in his bed this morning reached over for him and pulled him close just like I used to do I havent been this happy in a long time We had a sleepy discussion and decided to get back together but were not using the term boyfriends It just feels weird after all this time So hes my partner or my lover Hes mine Thank you reddit Wouldnt have done it without a little push from the internet Lets see where all this goes,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 19:58:59 UTC,107,20,0.99,,,0,0
1j5fikp,The nights are too quiet now,I didnt care how much sleep I lost each night I never got tired of hearing her voice or seeing how pretty she looked each time she smiled or laughed I wonder if she knew just how beautiful she looked when she talked about something she loved Everything with her felt new and exciting as if I was experiencing love for the first time all over again The nights are too quiet now I still check my phone knowing her name wont appear I scroll through old messages replaying our conversations and wonder if she thinks of me If she does I hope it brings her a smile the way those memories always do for me And if not thats alright too Because I know in that time we shared something truly special a spark of pure joy that Ill always cherish I dont know when or if Ill ever see her again but I know this for sure she was one of the best moments of my life I hope she knows that she is still deeply loved and profoundly missed,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 04:43:06 UTC,3,0,0.81,,,0,0

1j4i0nn,I want to help people my entire life but the issue is I feel like I am the touch of death,For complete transparency I wrote this out first on wordpad can post the original if requested but since my grammar and wording is never great learning disability I ran it thru a AI grammar editor The message and feelings are still mine as I reread it to be 100 sure Just thought you all should no Im writing this because its been weighing on my mind for a long time It keeps happening and I cant shake the feeling that Im the common factor For as long as I can remember Ive wanted to make a difference in someones life In high school I dreamed of becoming a teacher to help kids At one point I even considered becoming a doctor or a nurse to be there for people in their worst moments But over the years those dreams fadedbecause every time Ive tried to help things have ended the same way It seems like whenever someone needs emergency medical care and I step in to help they dont make it The Moments That Haunt Me One of the first times this happened I was around 1820 years old I was walking home from Walmart when I heard a crash Looking over I saw a motorcycle had been tboned by a car and the driver was on the ground Without thinking I ran toward him weaving through traffic I took his hand and spoke to him trying to keep him calm while others applied pressure to his wounds He handed me his phone and asked me to call a family member to let them know he was going to the hospital I did exactly that then gave the phone back to him Soon after paramedics arrived and took him away Later I read that he had died from his injuries At the time I didnt think much of it beyond the tragedy of the accident A few years later I was at home when my stepfather suddenly jumped up and said Call an ambulance We did and while waiting I ran upstairs to grab him a shirt as asked I helped him put it on talking to him reassuring him that everything would be okay The paramedics arrived and took him away Shortly after he went into heart failure and died Then a few years after that I was living in an apartment building One day I glanced out the window out of boredom and saw my neighbors unloading groceries Out of nowhere the wife collapsed and her husband barely caught her in time I didnt hesitateI bolted out of my apartment without even locking the door ran down the hallway hit the elevator button and after a few seconds of waiting said Fuck it and took the stairs I got to them as fast as I could Her husband was on the phone with paramedics while I held her trying to comfort her as he gathered her meds and health cards The building superintendent came out just standing there saying Shes going to be okay Just being completely useless It took the paramedics over 30 minutes to arrive The moment I stepped back to let them work they had to use a defibrillator there heart had stopped She didnt make it The Fear That Lingers These are just a few of the moments that have left me feeling this way I may add more as I remember them But because of them I feel like I cant help peoplebecause when I do it only seems to end badly I honestly have never had someone survive going to the hospital after I help Its been about three years since I last experienced something like this and I hope I never do again But Im scared that if it happens again Ill freeze up That fear eats at methe fear that I wont be able to help that Ill hesitate that Ill fail someone when they need me most Im shaking as I write this scared of being judged of being called a coward But I needed to get this off my chest because its been haunting me for far too long I am shaking trying to hit the post button,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 23:57:50 UTC,6,2,1.0,,,0,0
1j4owse,I accidentally brought an explosive through TSA and got away with it,The title sounds crazy but in 2023 I was visiting family out of state during the 4th of July At the party that I went to with my cousins we were obviously setting off large fireworks we ended up not using all of the fireworks and later that week while hanging out with the friend that hosted the party he gave me the firework as a joke I guess and I just put it in my backpack that I had with me note the firework work is the type you put in a mortar so IT IS NOT SMALL I completely forgot about the firework in my bag so when I was packing to fly back home I wasnt looking for anything in my backpack and was just throwing my clothes in Turns out I never took the firework out covered it with all my clothes and brought it with me to the airport I went through tsa the whole airport and my flight without knowing I had this firework in my bag I hadnt realized that I even had it till I got home and was unpacking and it fell out of my bag Funny thing is my aunt got stopped in tsa on a separate flight from mine because there was some kind of flammable residue on her stroller that was detected and she had to be patted down and all her stuff looked through but they couldnt detect a fucking big ass firework at the bottom of my backpack,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 06:02:00 UTC,99,24,0.95,,,0,0

1j7jwdn,I love my dog but I dont like her,My husband wanted a dog and I had never had one before Ive had plenty of pets in the past cats rabbits and fish and I loved each one of them deeply So we decided to get a dog He did the work of finding the exact dog he wanted and we drove three hours to adopt her Even though he took on most of the feeding exercising playing and training she bonded to me The bond feels like an obsession When Im around my husband doesnt exist to her She never wants to be more than three feet away from me and often shes touching me When I need a break I go into the bedroom and shut the door She just sits outside waiting I can put her in the office with my fiancé on the other side of the house and then go to the bedroom and shut the door But she waits at the office door whining and whimpering My husband tries to interact with her but she doesnt care She just wants me And I cant handle this level of attention You can take her outside but if she knows Im inside she wont leave the door If I leave she panics A few minutes later she calms down and does her own thing She never bothers my husband this much Ive heard mothers talk about feeling touched out with toddlers and thats exactly how I feel with my dog The difference is I dont think shell ever grow past this stage Shes a dog Weve worked with trainers to help her become more independent but it doesnt seem to work Im thankful that theres more nuance in the adopt dont shop movement Sometimes it might actually be better to get a dog from an ethical breeder as shelter dogs can come with their own set of challenges My dog has trauma and that trauma will stay with her for life It shows up in our relationship where were in a sort of quasicodependence Its frustrating because shes fine when Im not around My husband can take her places and shes as happy as can be If Im not home shes completely relaxed Its only when Im around that she becomes obsessed with me I dont get to experience the playful silly dog everyone else sees because in my presence shes consumed with me My husband takes her to his brothers farm and he sends me videos of her It breaks my heart because I want to see that happy playful dog too I want a dog I can sit outside with playing with toys and rolling in the dirt without her needing to touch my leg at all times But I never get that dog I love her so much but her constant affection drowns me I look forward to when she goes to the farm because I get to be home without her on top of me I dont love my job but I dread going home because at least at work I get some alone time I love my dog but I dont like being around her,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 22:44:06 UTC,24,21,0.79,,,0,0

1j6sdqy,My girlfriends mental health struggles are draining me,Me 21M and my girlfriend 22F have been together for 4 months now After the first 2 months I started to notice and understand better all the things she has to deal with in her head bad experiences in past relationships that affected her deeply and left her with traumas that are now being reflected in me just because we are in a long distance relationship and we cant see each other 247 and know what the other is doing or know entirely what is happening to us Although she never saw a specialist or therapist to treat these problems which she admitted to me was out of fear or pride I always try to explain to her that right now it is impossible for me to be devotedly aware of her every second of the day with my career my activities my friends and my own life in general Every day I talk to her to accompany her in the little free time I have during the day and when I return home exhausted I also make sure to communicate with her and ask her about her day and if she would like to talk about something with me in which most of the time her answers are I have nothing interesting to tell There are also times when a harmless joke I make unleashes hell where she gets offended at me and I need to reassure her of how much she means to me and how much i really love her I apologize for upsetting her with something I said to which she apparently accepts my apologies and also apparently everything is resolved Last night I even went out with my guy friends to a bar after a hard week and all day long I let her know who I was with and what our plans were for the night to which she ended up responding as a way of throwing it in my face that I will never be able to understand her and solve all the damage she suffered with me with a simple forgiveness and acussed me of not caring about her and not being able to see things the way she sees them That made me feel like like Im worth absolutely nothing like all the sincerely unconditional love I give her when were together isnt worth it even in the slightest that all the moments in which I was there to listen to her and understand her also meant nothing I need honest and direct opinions on this,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 22:10:19 UTC,4,6,1.0,,,0,0

1j5ox11,Boyfriend wants to get married and Im indifferent towards it,Back story Im F28 and my M30 wants to be married We were on and off from the years I was 1920 and when I turned 21 we got together offically and I was convinced by him and his mom to move in since I was living alone and my parents are retired in a different country From the years 1922 he was just not nice very rude and he would always choose his friends over me and his friends were always females In the early stages his friends or family will tell him to leave me and he would do it and then be adamant on staying friends when I would say no He also kept crying to me about his ex and how much she hurt him and he hid the fact he would talk to her mom like once a week When I found out he stood his ground and said no to cutting her off He only agreed to cut her off because I was pregnant with his child When I turned 23 during Covid we fell pregnant although I took Plan B I didnt realize I was ovulating so it didnt work We kept our son but he was just so rude during my pregnancy he took it upon himself to be there for a female friend all because she was dating a guy and needed help and instead of her going to her female friends my bf was always available He went as far as to stay out all night and get drunk with her and their other friends and the guy she was dating when I didnt want him to and when he returned home he cursed me and his mother out because I held him back in life I also had told him for years how important marriage was to me and he was just so whatever about it I told him while I was pregnant just ask with a ring pop since we didnt have too much money and I wanted to be married before having a kid and he came home a few days later and as I was lying on the couch he threw the ring pop and said you going to say yes right I said no because he made it seem like a chore or obligation rather than him wanting to He also spend all my pregnancy mad at me because I didnt want to name our son after him When Ive told him since I was 19 and even before when we were sort of friends at 16 that I do not want to name my son after their father name Fast forward our son is born and he is currently 4 and throughout these 4 years he keeps wanting to be married and I told him unless he has a career were he can care of the home expenses what is the point Since our son been born Ive made almost all the money paid our rent our bills hes has jobs here and there He just made one year at his current job and he does pay his part but even before our son and now Im also paying like 6070 and he pays the rest and theirs been times Ive paid 100 I told him if he becomes a police officer id feel okay and comfortable marrying him since its a good paying job and he can support us and he wants to and hes doing it for him and for us to be married But I also feel so indifferent like I dont see the excitement in calling him my husband since we skipped over the step Sometimes I feel like its my fault and I should of ignored that he threw a ring pop at me and other times I feel like if I would of accepted it I would be open to constant disrespect from him in the future Him as a father super good and kind he takes our son to school and picks him up he lets me sleep in and sleep whenever He tries to pay for dates when we are out our son and him have a strong bond He gets me flowers offers to cook even it it doesnt taste the greatest Overall him as a dad and a partner is nice I do feel spoiled But because I cant let go of how he treated me Im always going to have this fever hes going to revert back,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 14:15:54 UTC,3,9,1.0,,,0,0
1j85hv5,I am a man I got sexually assaulted She twisted it and accused me everyone only believed her,Its been a few years since this happened I had to quit college and end my studies because of it I have mostly pretended it never happened but Ive recently been looking back and processing it and I need to talk to someone about it I dont have anyone to talk to about this so I decided to come here Many years ago I was 17 and had just started college I befriended a girl lets call her Emma Emma started dating this Bisexual girl lets call her Jenny and once she came into the picture the three of us formed a friend group We were a good friend group for a while and had lots of fun hanging out and studying together Still at some point Emmas and Jennys relationship started to go really sour Jenny had BPD and their relationship had started to become really unstable They had arguments almost daily even at our college And during these times I became the therapist whenever I individually met them they would rant to me about each other And Jenny and I really bonded and became good friends since she actually listened to my rants too The day it happened the school had organized a disco party Emma was working and had to get home get ready and head straight to the party So Jenny had invited me to hang out at her place before the party get ready together hang out and then head over to meet Emma at the party We were just hanging around typical college kid age things and everything was light hearted But suddenly things got really weird she started talking about sexual things asking me about my kinks and fetishes asking me about all sorts of sexual questions and it somehow evolved to her taking out her computer and showing me the kind of porn she watches and yes when I say showing I mean putting on the actual videos of her favourite porn and asking me to show mine From there it kept escalating into much weirder sexual things after the porn she started talking about Emma and telling me what they do in bed then she pulled out her phone and started showing me nudes of Emma without Emmas permission or knowledge of it The next part which I feel extremely uncomfortable thinking about and trying to forget Her parents were downstairs eating dinner after showing me a bunch of nudes of Emma without her permission she opened the door and at that point her parents could probably hear whatever we were talking about Then she sat down next to me started talking about how much she misses being with a guy put her hands inside my pants and Sexually Assaulted me while making remarks about how much she liked feeling me Eventually her parents started to come upstairs She stopped and at that point I said I had to go and went home skipping the party I didnt want any of that I only saw her as a friend and I didnt consent I justfroze Many people have asked me when I tell this why I didnt stop her and said to me that I Consented by not stopping around the part she started showing porn or Emmas nudes But I was dissociating the whole time I cant really explain it but I was in shock the entire time Afterwards the next day when I came to college she had told Emma at the party that she cheated on her told her I had made a move on her and she reciprocated it This broke our friend group entirely and I was left alone with no friends It all went completely sideways when a mutual asked me about what happened to our group and once I told her the story she asked me Isnt that sexual assault and thats when it hit me what it really was to which I said yes Not too long later that person talked to Jenny about it Jenny told her a completely different story that she was the victim of SA and I was the one who did it she twisted the whole story in a way where she told people I did all the things she did that night the kink questions porn begging to see nudes of Emma and then I assaulted her No matter how much I told the truth No one listened they all believed her It didnt take long for the whole school to believe her and paint me as a sexual predator I became an outcast and everyone treated me like a monster It led me really close to suicide and I dropped out of school and have never gone back not long after I dropped out I developed very heavy substance abuse and have been struggling with it until recently I am sober for around 9 months now I really dont know how I feel about posting this but I genuinely just needed to tell my story I just needed to vent Im sorry if this is too much I hope you all have a good day,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 18:23:02 UTC,428,32,0.96,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j53tt6,TIL that my coworker had a Title IX case against him from my predecessor and hes still here,I dont really know what to make of this and I dont really have anyone to talk to about it I 23F started my masters this academic year and was brought in as a graduate assistant in one of the academic advising offices on campus Our office has a new director who comes from a high school administration background and relatively new advisors two of them both have been here five years max Until yesterday I didnt know why the previous GA left her role She clearly left in a hurry because my office her office still had wall decorations cork boards with posters and flyers supplies and cabinets chockfull of folders with papers guides flyers you name it its here It looked like the place was already in use is what Im getting at She created entire binders about our departments programs and even fully stocked the supply closet that we have I knew she hadnt left due to graduation it had to be either right before she graduated or she hadnt renewed her contract but I didnt know why Its not really my business but I was curious and wanted to be sure it wasnt for something nefarious So my suspicions rise when a classmate of mine M recognized the office that I said Im a GA for a handful of us are GAs most of them for our college but me in this advising office and she brought up that she used to work there in undergrad until she graduated last year M started asking about names from when she was there and it became apparent weve had a lot of staff changes in less than a year I thought Interesting I wonder why She also did not like most of the people advisorsdirector who arewere here I kind of shrugged it off figuring that she probably just had some bad experiences or that the leadership prior to our current director was suboptimal because I liked my coworkers Naïveté on my part Ill admit But something hasnt quite left me since that day M said the previous director lets call him Colin resigned after being caught in a relationship with a student I took this with a grain of salt because I hadnt heard that not even from the other student workers who like to gossip and M had made it clear that she didnt enjoy the office atmosphere Things came to a head for me yesterday when I met with the current director to discuss some issues with the website Things progressed to how she doesnt like how disorganized the supply closet currently is and her plans to clean it out with our administrative assistant over spring break She mentioned having so much stuff left behind by the previous GA like thick binders of whoknowswhat and not knowing what to do with them Theyre multiple 5inch binders stuffed to the brim Bringing up the GA snowballed until Director casually mentioned how my coworker lets call him Andrew one of the two advisors in our department was the one caught making sexual advances and toward the previous GA They had gone out for drinks afterhours unsure if it was with a group and he had texted her inappropriately about hooking up The thendirector Colin received word of this but didnt want to do anything about it He was promptly fired for his inaction once an actual fullblown Title IX case opened against Andrew The GA left after this incident and no one has seen her since She left everything behind Her friends harassed the office to try and hold Colin accountable but it wasnt until the case was opened that action was taken Im in shock and just dont know how to process these instances He came onto my predecessor yet she left and he is still working here I dont even know if shes graduated but it makes sense now why her stuff was left behind and why nobody talks about her aside from the student workers who dont know the truth,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 19:29:57 UTC,9,3,0.74,,,0,0

1j6qkav,I stood up to my father who treats me like garbage,Hello everyone I am writing this in hopes to get it off my chest no matter how familiar or boring the subject may be I am a 24yo woman I am a student currently unemployed and I live with my boyfriend I consider myself a normal person nothing out of the ordinary in my life or in my character I am healthy i have hobbies i have friends and normal healthy relationships and nothing in my life is out of line I am giving this info because the story concerns my fathers behaviour towards me basically since i was 11yo He has always been the provider for our family my mom sister dad and i The problem in my story is his character and his behaviour towards everyone in his life i mean family and close ones Since I was a little girl he has always used derogatory language with me and my mom He has fits of rage every day and shouts at us and mostly her because i do not live there anymore Name calling of all sorts for no reason I will give an example once i was going out for a walk and i took a bottle of water with me 1L small bottle nothing insane He saw it and started screaming at me every offensive word you can think of He said no person in his right mind takes water outside on a walk Another example he screamed at my mom and the didnt speak to her a whole week because HE forgot his lunch on his way out Apparently she needs to be there every second and remind him to even blink He is the same with my sister and his parents my grandparents No one in my family has ever talked to him about this and they are enablers to his behaviour For the years that I spent living with them when he would get home from work I would stay in my room and not even go to the bathroom for hours even if i needed to just because to get to the bathroom you have to go through the living room and that is where he watched tv and spent the evenings Over the years i developed severe anxiety low self esteem binge eating disorder and many more characteristics and conditions that make my life miserable The binge eating disorder came because all my life he would call me fat and huge and enormously big I have always been 5055kg at 165cm height i work out at the gym and have been a runner for a few years so yeah I am slim and have even been very skinny for some time So this person with his insane behaviour has long ago lost my respect and fondness of him Although until now i have been silent Today at dinner i couldnt take it anymore For months ive been having dreams of him screaming at me and while asleep I felt the hatred in my heart So today he started to insult me again and I didnt stay silent this time I told him that respect has to be earned and he doesnt have mine because of all the years of name calling and treating me like garbage He was stunt and said that i dont have a father anymore To be honest ive felt like that since i was 11 Even though it hurt him he cant begin to imagine the pain ive been feeling for years I cant stop crying because of the words I said but I know I had to say them at some point in my life to free myself and defend myself I feel pity for him and nothing else I am sorry that he is the way he is because it can only end badly for him I am proud I defended myself for the first time but I will always be in pain because hes been brought up to be the person he is He is incapable of change and I am sorry for him,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 20:47:15 UTC,7,5,0.9,,,0,0

1j52yjk,The obsession with control with Muslim arab parents,Ive always wanted to live life on my own terms but my Muslim Arab parents make it feel impossible Even though Im an adult they still try to control every aspect of my life my career my choices even how I spend my time The moment I push back Im met with guilttripping and emotional manipulation Youre disobedient Youve dishonored us I will never forgive you until the Day of Judgment And many of the things they react this way to arent even that big of a deal For example Ive always wanted to cut my hair short but my mother made it clear that if I ever did she wouldnt forgive me and that it would be a a sin hanging over my neck until Judgment Day Even something as small as asking them to knock before walking into my bedroom turns into an argument as if having basic privacy is an act of rebellion And if not through words they use threats They tell me theyll force me into marrying someone against my will or that theyd lock me in a room if I disobey them Even if they dont act on these threats just hearing them is enough to make me feel powerless like my life isnt really mine to control It feels like their love is tied to control as if I can only be a good son or daughter if I follow everything they say without question Their obsession with obedience and authority makes it impossible for them to see me as an independent person Its as if my life belongs to them and any choice I make for myself is seen as betrayal I know they believe theyre acting out of love but it doesnt feel like love It feels like a cage Its exhausting to constantly be torn between my own happiness and their expectations Im tired of feeling like my worth is tied to how obedient I am I just want to be allowed to make my own decisions without fear guilt or the weight of their disappointment crushing me What hurts even more is that when I try to talk about this Im always met with the same dismissive responses Theyre your parents you must obey them no matter what Society expects the owns who go through this to just accept it as if their love should come with conditions and control But I dont want to spend my life suffocating under obligations I never agreed to,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 18:54:15 UTC,2,1,0.75,,,0,0

1j30kev,I was in the NCA Dalles crisis,Im a cheerleader on a special needs team I will be censoring the names due to privately Where about to go to warm us taking a team picture before we go I was happy at realizing where my spot was as last time I was worried I was in the wrong spot but my coach thought it was ok suddenly a buch of cheerleaders started screaming and running passed us at the time I assumed they way excited to get to warmups and was about to say why there where so happy being confusedamused three things happened however one of the cheer dads shouted at us to run and I realized that not only was EVERYONE running but they where all terrorfied and I realized something was very wrong I panicked I was trying to get in the middle of the crowd hoping to shelter me ran to a secrutly guard I also started to slow down both because I was looking for people on my cheer team and was also in shock Thankfully another team member found me and told me to go with her lets call her 1 she was being really rational so I was following her thought I felt a bit silly since shes a teen We also found three more 2 3 and 4 We where directed to go up to to a place that was more dirty think a warehouse where found our coach she was talking on a phone I never seen her so scared Mind you shes normally a very tough cheer coach she was crying while talking on her phone later found out it was a her dad saying that she had to find someone since she cant run later found out it was another team member who has cerebral palsy and a bad knee They where directing us to go over a this thing its kind of like a cliff inside of a basement if that makes any sense sorry not sure how to get call it where all trying to get coachs attention eventally I gotten louder and touched her arm and told her to over there and we all did with some help down Once where walking we where told to grab hands I grabbed the woman next to me thinking she was a member of my cheer team though she was not she laughed and told me it was fine things gotten calmer was thinking it all over and maybe even as 1 said that it was a misunderstanding and there wasnt any gunfire some people where crying and I told her them it was going to be ok But then people started screaming and running again I also heard what i thought was gunfire sounding like pop pop pop we ran back again I lost the hand of the cheerleader and grabbed 2s hand instead she started crying and saying that she didnt know what was going on I felt really bad for because while where both autistic shes higher support needs then me in my head I was thinking there was an mass shooter in here though I didnt want to tell her that since it would freak her out even more so I didnt say anything she also asked if it was going to be ok and I told her yes to ease her which seemed to help I paniced again and tried to jump over this fence like thing but I wasnt good enough so i gave up and ran way along with some others During the chaos we lost sight of our cheer coach and her assistant coach Also durning all of crisis I had a couple of thoughts in my head admitly I was thinking of want to post to trueoffmychest but I was also wondering on why on earth a mass shooter came and shot up cheerleaders like did he had some vendetta against them I was also thinking maybe it was like 2017 Las Vegas shooting and there was no reason he just wanted to shoot up a place yes I was aware that we just didnt know the motive but that was the shooting that came up I was praying to God that my dad and my other cheermembers where not dead especialy one of them since she was in a wheelchair I didnt know where she was and she couldnt move as fast as 1 in her wheelchair not her fault 1 is just really fast she also couldnt run I felt bad for my dad since I know he was proctive over me and I left my phone with him we wont allowed to take with us for warmups so i thought he was terrofried and upset that he couldnt even contect me to make sure i was ok when things where calmer I was also thinking of jokes to make in the group me such as worst thing i thought at first we might lose worst thing now literal gun statistic and in mist of chaos 3 still makes friends she likes to make friends with everyone and while where walking she started to chat with other cheerleaders Once we got outside things again started to get calm and I again started to think it was going to be ok but again they started to scream and run and I think i heard the popping sound again where all run down towards the bottem of the bridge to shelter us I sprained my ankle a couple of days earlier so it was hard to run on half of hill especially with holding 2s hand once I got to the bottem I accidently step into mud in my daze I thought I liked my shoes but it was ok thinking I was wearing my normal shoes instead of the cheer ones they again directed towards up to hill and to the fence at first I didnt want to go thinking it was safer down here since I wanted shelter 2 kept on tuggin on my arm to go up I did eventally trusting them so we ran up again a cheerleader fall down into mud I didnt want to go down to hold her up thinking it was unsafescary but I did yelled at to get help she did to my hapiness once we got up there things where calm and thankfully remained calm ever since 3 at this point was crying and the cheerleaders she was talking to her contiuned to ask her questions to keep her distrated I jouned in I hugged 3 to help her and she hugged back I also hugged another cheerleader who was also crying I saw the women that fell in the mud and she was fine so I didnt talk to her but was happy she wasnt dead again At one point I started to zone out thinking of all the event today 1 noticed and told me not to go someplace else as she needs me here I told her ok and I wasnt daydreaming she was doing breathing excerise to calm herself down We where again directed towards to walk over a bridge once we got to the other side we set by some buildings again we talked to other cheerleaders and coaches I again tried to comfort another cheerleader who was crying along with her friends one of the coachess offered to call our parents though she could ony calltext 3s mom since I didnt know my parents phone numbers 1 always had her phone with her since she hide it lol over time 1s 4s dads came every time I heard screaming of people calling for their family member I gotten nervous because at that time I assoalted screamingrunning and gunfire though i did think we where safe since if there was a mass shooter we where no longer by the NCA building also I looked over there and saw what appeared to be I asked on her the other cheerleaders where ok and they said I was too worried to ask about my dad I was still prying for them instead my head Eventally my dade I told my dad I was happy he came later 1s mom came we sat and talked about the entire thing the helicopter that I saw that I eventally told them my jokes again I did say to earleir cheerleaders and coaches my dad confirmed that the heliopter that I saw circuring around was connected to the corrent issue orginally I just thought it was normal helicopter I was wrong about being a police helopter it was news helicopter there was an active news story so we talked about that apparantly two cheer parents got into a fight and there thought they pulled out guns I ended up saying nothing says rationality like gunfire though officaly my dad and 1s mom says that was no gunfire I felt like the parnets would be banned for life and I felt bad for the daughtes because they got punished for something their parents did the phones where also going off with a warning about avoing the place and ther was a cheer perfomance that had inturpted for they can be evacuated my dad also said how people where being trumped and he saw one cheerleader with her leg bent I asked if she was alive and he said yes but crying I asked her if she was going to get it amputed and he said no it wasnt that bad The youngest cheermember came we all comfoted her since she was hugging later found out she was crying for hours My dad 2 want to our moms we came togather along with 5 it was a long walk and my back and ankle where really hurting I have very slight Lumbar scoliosis there was a misnderstanding and we had to walk back 2s mom meet as half way for she can hug 2 We made it back 5 and i hugged and she was crying my mom hugged me and wanted to take a picture I asked if this was for something like our familys group text or the prayer team she said yes I think I said if it was called Im not dead photo and she laughed and agreeed later found out was for the group message though maybe also the prayer team as she today said she made it On the our way there we read the news story and how they thought there was no gunfire but there was a genera agreemtn that they was gunfire since more then one of us heard it thankfully no one dead My mom said even it was no gunfire it was real to us I agreed with this I got mad when I found out some people online thought it was funny the fear was very real and most of the people there are either teenegers ND or maybe even both and even with that its safer to get out then risk it not being realsince more then one of us heard it thankfully no one dead When I got home I did more reaserch we talked about in the car but I wanted to read for myself there where dads and got in a fight the offical statemnt was that the poles being pushed it was sounded like gunfire I also heard other things while reading around like one dad having a seizure is what sounded like gunfire or the music in the cheer routine mixed up with the fight sounded like gunfire Im netural but the general consensus is still among the cheer group was that it was gunfire since again we heard it and my dad said he heard it even outside Where at a pool for parents could have a meeting about it and we talked more NSA was going to be put in houstin next year and 5 thinks it would be from now on our coach doesnt want to come back to NSA andinto there is more secrutiy which was pretty surpsing to me since it where want every cheer season even whiel I was in Mexico for my brothers wedding she pushed NCA to march instead of skipping it lol 5 also says our coach wants us to have the wrist bindsblack marker lighting saying our phone number theres even as statement around the group of her changing the no phone role but thats not confirmed 5 also thinks she broke her big toe because while everyone was running someone stepted on her toe and it was really bruised there was more sayings on the group panic running but I had no issue with that myself so it was kind of shocking on the phone thing I later told my mom about it she said she wants me to memorlized her and dads phone number as she didnt realize I didnt know it We also talked about the cheerleading compention most everyone ended up complenting on sunday instead except for the special needs teams which was canlled though even if we didnt our coach said wouldnt complete anyway since again gun panic the first day we wont in first place so the first day team ended up winning she and her coach assasiant was fighting it since she didnt think it was fair because neither them or us gotten the second day she even said even if our team won she wouldnt accept the reward for this very reason We had a group party plannedwe where worried we might have to cancell if everyon was too upset but thanfully we didnt and it was fun,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 02:38:02 UTC,1,0,0.99,,,0,0
1j79hp6,I cant really take it anymore,Sorry for the long ass post I would have made it longer but wanted to spare you the novel Im honestly just really lost and struggling so much right now Im 25 and suffer from a long list of mental and physical disabilities Im not really able to work right now due to my disabilities but am in the middle of a long process of trying to get on disability payments I still live at home with my mum and brother dad is deceased and I just found out last week my mum has stage 4 bone cancer My partner of 3 years doesnt live with me but is soon having to move out of his family home so has been putting pressure on me to move out with him as weve been together for a significant amount of time and we should be moving onto the next stage of our relationship Ive tried to explain that its difficult for me to move out as I dont have a job and the income I do get from the government isnt going to be enough to pay for rent let alone my food medications my dogs food and be expected to save for my doctor and specialist appointments but also to save to eventually buy a house like how he wants us to be able to do before turning 30 He just keeps telling me to apply for work and I only have experience in retail but due to one of my medical conditions I cant even stand for more than 5 hours on a good day without being in debilitating pain where I literally struggle to walk I have no experience in being a receptionist and no matter how many jobs I apply for no luck He wants me to move out as well as Im being treated as a stay at home mother looking after my mum and brother this is well before the cancer diagnosis I dont think as well that its sitting in for him that I very badly need and rely on being on my mums health insurance considering Im chronically ill and it can turn at anytime for me and sadly Im having a different surgery at least once a year sometimes twice a year so idk how Id be expected to afford that if I wasnt living at home with no job He refuses to live with my family until we can save enough to buy a house because he hates my family and well understandably is struggling to even see a future with me like this but I feel like hes in between a rock and a hard place with the fact that he does love me and how he doesnt want to leave me cause Im sick cause itd be like leaving someone whos got cancer which is an asshole thing to do And it doesnt help that Im struggling with my mums new diagnosis On top of everything else I personally am just really struggling with how beyond god damn emotional I am Late last year I fell down some stairs causing me to be bed ridden for 2 and a half weeks and in turn has caused me to develop or severely worsen potential already undiagnosed OCD Ive never been diagnosed before with OCD because truly I dont say out loud my thoughts and whatever I have disclosed or displayed gets pinned to my autism but since the fall Ive been consumed with anxiety depression anger guilt agitation and panic with mess things not being in a particular order mainly MY way of order I feel like a shell of who I once was I struggle to hide anything well I cry almost daily and have just started to learn either cry to myself when no one is around or wait for my therapist I dont ever want to leave my house cause if I stay at my partners house guarantee Ill be a sobbing mess when I get back cause my mum and brother always make a mess and they never clean up after themselves which in turn triggers me more I already am a pretty reserved person when it comes to my feelings cause I think itll come off over dramatic to others even though I know theyre valid but today I got proven why I think that because my partner asked me what was wrong when I got home and I spilt 14 of my thoughts and feelings and I got stopped with being told that maybe you just like to make things more difficult for yourself than it has to be Potentially thats true but also I dont mean to my brain just never shuts up which Im realising with typing this that yes it most definitely doesnt shut up The sadder thing is theres a lot more to my anxieties and why I cant take it anymore and maybe Ill just get a diary and deep clean till I cant walk I just want to be alone and lowkey sedated but I got an appointment in a couple days on an update to some scans and if Ill need surgery or not which is obviously another anxiety I frankly just feel a lot of pressure from my boyfriend and I feel pressure to look after and help my mum and if I dont well no one will cause my brother and her partner are useless I feel pressure on myself with my own mental and physical health getting a job and what kind of job realistically would even be good for me I feel temptation to go back into eating disorder tendencies or back into my addiction to smoking weed I feel beyond insecure about my appearance which I know is a vanity and self esteem issues I truly dont know what to do because try and take it day by day but I clearly have some control issues Im frustrated cause I dont want to die but I also dont want to be alive or at least conscious,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 15:04:42 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j4q5vg,54 and struggling,Hi I when I was 12 I was playing in an arcade on the slot machines and a guy came up to me and started feeding my machine with cash I went back every week and he paid whilst I played This happended over a period which I cannot remember and then one day he started to stroke my penis Nobody had ever touched me here before so naturally my body reacted and I got erect even though i was scared as hell I continued to go back for six months then one day he took me to a cafe on the pier and bought me dinner Burger chips etc He undid my zip on my trousers and got my cock out and jerked me off and I came my first ever ejaculation I keep blaming myself because I kept going back to get jerked off and fed My mom was single parent and dad moved away I was left alone for hours when she was working I now realise I was groomed and sexually assaulted I still have these feelings of excitement when I remember this first time which then turn immediately to disgust at myself for saying nothing and letting it continue I have had therapy when i was 16 Long story but I was addicted to the machines by now and another guy started doing the same and pay me 40 for the privilege The money just went back on the machines This second guy groomed me so much I ended up going to his flat to see his spectrum computer and he continued there which turned to blowing me and paying me 40 The last time i went he raped me I ran away after and stayed out late and the police were out looking for me I was scared to go home as much bottom was so painful The police found me hiding under the pier and took me home I told them and mum that I had realised I was late home and rather than face the music stayed out as I was scared of getting into trouble So naturally I was in a vicious circle the later it became The accepted it and nothing was said about the assault I dont remember how I dealt with the pain but my brain has blocked some stuff out FF three years and the police turned up at myself home and said I had been exposing my penis to the public I seriously honestly have no recollection of this at all They cautioned me and my mum shouted and screamed when they went asking why until I broke down after she said has someone hurt you She got the police back and I made a statement To this day Ive never been told what happened the guy Whethery they caught him or not but I never had to go to court For years I thought they filed it nfa as I was just a dirty rent boy who deserved what he got I feel let down by the police as I know now that I was a child and it was grooming secual assault and rape I am a gay man and have never been able to take it sorry for the crudeness due to the memory I know its not everything but I know Im a disappointment for not being a real gay man When I have these feelings of not being good enough for anyone or deserving of anything I struggle and want to run away As i am a let down to others for not getting over it Ive been in a relationship for 28nyesrs and my partner he knows everything but I still regularly have these days of being not enoug people pleasing and feeling like everyone would be better without me For some reason I just had my first nightmare in over 35 years and it started with the first day of being touched at 12 and ended with the rape and police I woke up to my disgust with an erection which soon went down when i was awake I feel sick and cant believer my body reacted in this way to a traumatic memory I have felt guilty all these years that the guys who assaulted me made me erect and ejaculate but the therapist said it was just a natural reaction to being touched down there And Ive accepted it wasnt my fault Until now That dream has taken me back over 40 years and to wake up erect makes me wanna kill myself What sick fuck am i Or was it my 12 year old inner person that made meerect I am due at work in a cople of hours and cant face the world I am disgusted with myself again after all the years of counselling and accepting i was a child and they were adults and as such I took no blame whatsoever But this fucking nightmare has moved the goalposts Why the fuck would I wake up sexually excited over something so traumatic The only thing I can think of is yesterday my partner and I and his sister found out their dad my dad in law has secondary cancer and metastatic cancer which is obious a traumatic Could this trigger earlier trauma But the sick feeling of waking up with an erection makes me feel so low i cant tell anyone I wont kill myself dw I am a people pleaser and would never put my friends and family through that I have cptsd as 8 years ago my best mate took his life and I found him So I could never put others through what I have So in not killing myself I am

1j499mz,Im finally free of him,I 22F broke up with my boyfriend 20M of 6 months on new years of 2024 I broke up with him for a plethora of reasons including him accusing me of stealing 500 him accusing me of cheating him proposing how he treated me him telling me he was going to commit suicide and it was my fault and much more For the record I didnt do any of the things he accused me of Well it didnt end at the breakup This specific individual is in the military and most of our relationship was long distance He sent me death threats after the initial break up which I did contact the police and his commanding officer about I told him to leave me alone and blocked him However for the year of 2024 he had his friends that live where I live follow me and threaten any guy I was seeing into breaking up with me he constantly messaged me on different numbers saying words coated in honey to try to get me back and he even showed up to my house when he was on leave One of the many reasons I broke up with him was that he was home for Christmas of 2023 and refused to see me and I got really upset because I still loved him at that time I have now learned through therapy that it wasnt love I was just caught in the web Well Christmas of 2024 came around and he was back on leave and he had his mom message me telling me that he was going to commit suicide if I didnt show up I told her to leave me alone and it was of course an empty threat maybe even a test He left after that and apparently according to his mom he was deployed Well I got a text on my birthday February 4th saying that he still loved me and yada yada which went ignored and then I got a call from his military base Apparently he had went missing in action and I was his beneficiary I havent heard anything from him since but I feel free finally I have a date this week and Im going to see if anyone threatens my date into ending it with me I kinda feel bad that I was so harsh but I also think it was survival I think that if I was any less harsh it wouldve been a lifetime of pain for me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 17:58:07 UTC,5,5,0.73,,CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCEDEATH,0,0

1j6ol0l,The work I did for CPS still hauntsrevisits me 10 years later,I worked for Child Protective Services in a metropolitan area of the US for 12 years I did both long term case management and later investigations that led to the removals of children With about a decade of time and reflection Ive come to realize the following I was a young woman with lots of privilege who did not understand the lives or needs of the people over whose lives I made decisions for This now causes me great pain Turns out I was dissociating through most of it due to secondary trauma and moral injury The ability to dissociate although we just saw it as toughing through back then was seen as showing that you were a great worker and could get shit done I wanted to do good in the world and I wanted to help children And I did But I also caused harm because I had too many cases not enough supervision and no real selfawareness It took years of therapy to understand and grieve the harm I had caused and the harm caused to me I dont even remember the first few years of my childrens lives because I was so dissociated I often have to look at a photos to remember events with them I still get flashbacks of things I was exposed to and am swapped with pain Sometimes it all comes back Just this week I was contacted by a former colleague and a child who was on my caseload many years ago The colleague reminded me of a child death case we worked on It was particularly searing because we both had children that were about the same age as the child who died She also reminded me about the death of another colleague through an aneurism and the suicide of a couple others Yes our work had a death count The girl now an adult reached out to me to say she is doing well and to thank me for helping her find an adoptive home Its a mixed bag And these memories reinforce in me the idea that nothing in life is guaranteed and Im just trying to do the best I can each day I screw up and I repair where I can I put kindness and compassion into everything I do but that isnt always enough I dont really have a purpose for this post Just wanted to get it off my chest,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 19:17:14 UTC,566,28,0.98,,,0,0

1j6pyo0,I witnessed domestic violence and didnt do anything about it,I was walking home from school this was the 90s so we were all just walking around freely for miles and passed by the same neighborhoods I always passed There was this one small house on the left side of the road and coming up on it I could hear splitting noises like someone was being hit but I think I couldnt believe it until I actually got close enough There was this guy 20s maybe both of them standing over his wife or girlfriend on the front lawn she was lying down on her side and had her arm stretched out Then as I walked by slowly unable to stop for some reason he started beating and slapping her and grabbing her by the hair and yanking her towards the house He also kicked her multiple times I think he might have called her Alicia But the eerie thing was that she was surprisingly quiet about it not like crazy screaming but just like please stop You would think shed be screaming and crying out for help or something I remember that I was just walking in horror the guy didnt seem to notice me or if he did he didnt care I couldnt stop and I couldnt stop looking at them I think I was trying to figure out what street I was on but I had never thought to memorize the alley way streets so I didnt know The whole scene moved in slow motion but I still remember the entire beating the sounds the sounds of grass scraping the shape of his hands Just broad daylight at 3pm on a weekday front lawn no one else on the street but them and me springtime I ran home in tears and told my mom who just told me not to get involved When I tried to tell her that I think he was going to kill her she asked me what street and address this happened because if we report it Ill have to know all these things I had no idea so again she told me to mind my own business I was 10 or so when this happened and Im in my 30s now I still have the exact same fantasy memory of having gone back in time and instead of walking away and running away from the scene I get in between them and save her somehow If not save but at least make such a fuss that someone calls the cops Its always the same thing that I dont care if I get hurt in the process I would have done the brave thing Instead of what I actually did just run away in literal horror I feel so haunted by this scene I dont think Ill ever forget it for the rest of my life honestly,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 20:19:25 UTC,11,10,0.92,,CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCEDEATH,0,0

1j493kq,Group of Friends Fucked Me Over,Title The sad truth is I was a compromised person when I made these friends and the relationship became really one sided and they fucked me hard Lost money time respect friendslost pretty much everything I have basically The fucked up thing is when I take a step back from the situation I see that these people dont even look at it like I do They dont even really care or realize they have done anything And in a way they didnt do anything because I was looking for the type of support that a family is supposed to give you when in fact they were just friends and our social backgrounds became really obvious as we grew up and we sort of grew apart I see them from time to time Thats all I really want Sometimes I want it to go back to when we were all tighter but then I remember that the person who really made that a family space was me and the truth is that after what happened Ill never really be the same and my desire to put out that kind of energy isnt really there anymore because Im sick of being used and abused,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 17:51:31 UTC,1,1,0.67,,,0,0

1j7547j,I feel like Im stuck in a relationship and dont know what to do,I 25F have been in a longdistance relationship with this guy 23M for the past 15 years He was really sweet and caring in the beginning and I talked to him for a considerable amount of time before starting a relationship with him Its just that I think his behavior has changed compared to how it was during the talking stage and the first few months of the relationship He says hes a faultfinder and that its just a part of his personality In the beginning he only used to praise my appearance but over time he started commenting on my facial features nose forehead etc and many other things Ive had a bad case of acne throughout my adolescence due to sensitive skin and genetic factors so it couldnt be cured completely While I dont have cystic acne all over my face anymore I still occasionally get breakouts The skin on my body also gets inflamed easily after waxing Earlier he never said anything about itin fact he used to love and support me despite all of this But eventually he started telling me to use certain products to improve my skin Ive told him multiple times that this isnt how things work since Ive undergone treatment for most of my life but he gets irritated and says I dont even want to try and that I lose hope too easily Similarly he made comments on my facial features and said I need to get plastic surgery When I got upset he claimed it was just a joke I have a very chirpy bubbly personality and get excited easily We recently went to a concert and everything was fine until we were walking back As we were side by side with his arm around my neck we reached a narrow space where only one of us could pass at a time I was focused on our conversation so I stood there for a second or two before moving He got annoyed removed his arm grabbed me from behind and pushed me through the space After that he started scolding me for being too dumb to stand there and not move immediately which I dont think is even a reason to fight For the next hour he kept verbally abusing me asking if I was really dumb or just pretending to be around him He even mocked my excitable personality saying I get too excited to see him and then start acting dumb He also said I dont deserve anything he does for me including the concert which was my birthday present from him He kept going on and on while we walked back for an entire hour My head hung low and I was holding back tears the entire time When I had to catch the train to return home he held my backpack tightly from behind and forced me to jump onto the moving train even though I was scared and there was a huge risk involved in doing something like this I mean anything could have gone wrong We had gotten late and almost missed it Just two weeks ago he faked breaking up with me to teach me a lesson because he thought that was the only way I would understand He said he had fought with me multiple times over a single issue and since I didnt seem to get it he had to do this At first I thought he was just angry and didnt take it seriously But the next day he texted me dryly and told me it was final I was heartbroken and broke down in tears desperately trying to reach out to him That afternoon I videocalled him while crying hysterically begging him to come back He laughed in my face and told me not to cry that everything would be fine in two to three months and that I should just leave him He was completely unemotional and unnecessarily cold Each word hit me hard and I kept wondering where all his love had gone He knows Ive had traumatic experiences in my past relationships yet he took advantage of my biggest emotional vulnerability He knows I get anxious overthink everything and become inconsolable Despite that he played on my emotions The very next day he went on a fiveday trip with his friends which they had been planning since the previous week He barely responded to my texts or calls while I was a crying mess unable to eat sleep or work properly When he came back I decided to talk to him one last time because I was so hurt that I had finally made up my mind to end things But when I called him he acted as if nothing had happened I lashed out and told him everything he had done wrong and how I felt all those days After listening he finally realized how horribly he had treated me and admitted that he thought we would reconcile He had only pretended to break up with me so I would realize my mistake It was never real He thought wed just talk and sort it out I wasnt in the right headspace but I still gave him another chance There are other things that bother me and Ive told him a million times to work on them I always get excited for the weekends because were busy all week and I look forward to spending time together I usually plan for us to watch a movie and he always promises to be there at a certain time But then he keeps postponing because his roommates drag him along saying he cant stop them He keeps pushing it forward until its too late and I end up waiting At the end of the night I just say I understand and go to sleep He apologizes promises it wont happen again and then does it again the next weekend After the breakup drama we discussed this and he promised to change But that very day he did it again And then again this weekend He has also told me multiple times that if I dont start making good money and move in with him soon he might get attracted to someone else and leave me He constantly tries to make me jealous by talking about other girls even saying he doesnt want to waste the best years of his life in a longdistance relationship and wants to hook up with other girls Later he claims hes just joking and doing it to motivate me to work harder earn well and move in with him On the other hand Ive never belittled him or made negative comments about his appearance or insecurities He has acne scars and body dysmorphia but Ive always loved him as he is making sure he feels comfortable in his own skin I tell him hes the most perfect guy for me and that he doesnt need to change anything to feel good or deserving But he constantly criticizes me mocks me when I express my struggles and calls me weak whenever I try to talk about things that hurt me He says he doesnt like weak people who crib all the time which makes me feel like I cant even discuss my problems with him If I do he gets annoyed fights with me and tells me Im playing the victim instead of being strong Honestly Im just really confused I love him and dont want to leave but I dont know if hes good for me PS The mistake he wanted me to realize was that he thinks I need to develop new skills to switch to a better job My current job is hectic and lowpaying but I have to work hard throughout the week With my parents declining health I cant study every weekend Sometimes I slack off because Im overwhelmed and need to cool off He tells me I need to hurry up and when I explain my situation he fights with me mocks me and says Ill never earn well or do anything in life because Im not trying hard enough Edit Additionally he has told me multiple times that other peoples opinions of him matter a lot He wants to be likable to everyone He said he used to get a lot of attention before developing acne but things changed after that which is why he constantly seeks validation from others He gets upset when girls in general dont give him attention Whenever I ask why he seeks attention from other girls when Ive always appreciated and motivated him he simply says its because Im his girlfriend so my words dont count He also gets noticeably excited and happy whenever he finds out that a girl is interested in him as it satisfies his need for validation Ive always brushed it off but idk if its a concern or not,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 10:46:43 UTC,1,3,1.0,,,0,0

1j34wfr,I gave my eldest daughter up for adoption 15 years ago today,I was 18 when I had my first born Between no support system and post partum depression I never bonded with her It was just me and her I would ask my friends to watch her her while I worked to be able to afford daycare so I could make a life for me and her yet I still never felt any connection with her I knew it wasnt her fault she never asked for me to be her mother I told myself I would push through and hope for a better future I despised her Her cries sounded like nails on a chalk board and I would end up crying after taking care of her I still reminded myself she never asked for me to be her mother I had to push through My post partum depression progressed I never got treatment because of fear I feared she would be taken away from me because of how we were living Section 8 a messy house not having enough food for both of us I always gave her my meals what little there was I went from 150 to 114 in a very short amount of time I was hungry tired overwhelmed but she never asked for me to be her mother Her father came back into our lives when she was around 14 months It felt like my saving grace Maybe we could be a little family and have a home full of love and laughter He was a drunk I was still alone with my daughter and now I had the heavy burden of having someone in my house that could help but chose not to 2 months later I fell pregnant again I was horrified when I found out I couldnt restart everything again I kept her because of a previous miscarriage I felt it wasnt right for me to be ungrateful I had a rough pregnancy I was very depressed and had a turbulent relationship He left me constantly during my pregnancy He said cruel things It only got worse when I had to go on maternity leave I was called lazy and a bad mother for not working up until I gave birth My daughter was born 10lbs 1oz I was exhausted and I hurt severely My second daughter was born and everything was so easy I connected with her immediately She was such a happy baby She never cried just to cry She only cried when she needed something When I took care of her needs there was no crying She was happy and content at such a young age I realized this is what motherhood was supposed to feel like It wasnt supposed to feel like a burden I wasnt supposed to secretly despise my child I wasnt supposed to be angry at a helpless newborn Havjng my second really changed me I was so much more nice to my first I still found her annoying most of the time but I felt I loved her for the first time It was short lived unfortunately The post partum depression returned when my youngest was 78 months She was still the apple of my eye but I turned my hatred to my oldest again That was the moment I realized I needed to consider adoption How could a mother hate her child As the months went on I found myself not giving affection towards her I would ignore her tantrums and yell at her for them I would tell her no when she asked if I could hold her I stopped kissing her forehead or cheeks She wasnt an easy child since birth but it got so much worse as she aged I laid in bed next to her and admitted to myself I hate my own child I hated her as I would hate a person who has done wrong by me for years The night finally came I had enough I had been trying to put her to bed for an hour Hearing screaming being kicked having my hair pulled I snapped I pinched her Hard Multiple times until she fell asleep Then once more after she fell asleep The same punishment my mother would do to me I was turning into my mother The person I promised myself I would never be like I had the most rude awakening that night and cried for hours after she went to bed I took her to the CPS office the following morning and told them I couldnt be her mother anymore That was all I said I left her in the waiting room I didnt hug her I didnt kiss her I just left It ate at me for years and still does I was the only person she knew in her life I knew her finding a loving family was better than having a mother like me I moved a few states away 2 days after I didnt want to be found I didnt want any possibility of them trying to return her to me because I knew I did this for her own good It was the only genuine loving gesture I had to offer her since she was born They never reached out or tried to find me as far as I knew I still carry the guilt and shame I still cry for her How confused and scared she must have been to never see her mother again Why couldnt I be the mother she deserved 2 12 years of thinking the bare minimum was the most love she would ever receive Im glad I gave her up Not for me but for her I searched through multiple schools near my old town a few days ago I found her I took the information I had and found her as well as her adoptive family on Facebook She has an amazing life She looks radiant in every picture I found of her Shes absolutely gorgeous I know I couldnt have given her that life I hope this was a selfless act not selfish I hope she doesnt remember me I married and had one more daughter Im so in love with my 2 other children which brings a perpetual guilt to my life I wish I couldve been her mother I still mourn her I havent allowed myself to feel negatively about giving her up only for the way I treated her It was for her She never asked to have a mother like me so I gave her to a mother that could love her the way she deserved,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 06:48:08 UTC,58,144,0.59,,,0,0

1j73qfo,My partner is completely irresponsible with money and Im considering breaking up,I apologize in advance for any grammarspelling mistakes english is not my first language For context me 27F and my bf 25M have been in a relationship for 5 years and living together in my fathers house for 4 in my country living costs are really high so its pretty common to still stay with your parents beyond your 20s At the end of last year my bf decided he needed a new phone for posting content tiktok and reels since his current phones camera wasnt good and his career gym instructor personal trainer could use a boost from social media While I agreed that a new phone with a better camera would help and I knew that he had saved some money I asked him to wait a little longer 1 month or 2 before making any impulsive puchases since I was unemployed at the time and that money could be used for any emergencies Well he disregarded everything I said and decided to buy the phone anyway and to make a long story short it was a scam in wich he lost almost 800 To say I was disappointed is an understatement because i told him before that even though the money was his and he could use it any way he wanted the shop was really suspicious and it was better to buy from an official store if he was going to spend that much in a phone It was really frustrating but I tried to help him contact his bank to see if there was anything we could do and to my surprise they refund almost half of the money but my happiness was short lived because the very next day he fell for another scam and lost both the recovered money plus 300 250 from his account and 50 from mine I was livid at this point the car had broken down another 600 expense we had no way to pay our share of the bills plus the repair costs and he had to ask for money from his mother bless her to solve everything but we survived Well now Im employed and things were better until yesterday when he told me he was thinking again about buying the phone to wich I told him no way not right now since were not completely stable yet to spend that much money and I thought he would be at least a bit more mindful since were still paying for his poor decisions from last year and we barely have money for bills but he didnt want to listen to my reasoning kept justifying why he needed it and Im sure hell buy it even though he knows that if he does that Ill have to cover his share of house expenses and Im honestly mentally and emotionally exhausted I feel like he isnt my partner anymore just an oversized toddler and its draining me For additional context hes been betting his money on soccer games and although he wins most of them last week he almost lost all of the grocery money Our currency is not USD so those are all approximate values If you survived my ranting thank you for reading everything,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 09:04:59 UTC,10,7,0.87,,,0,0

1j4egl8,My brother passed away 5 years ago today at the age of 18 this is that story,Im not sure if this is the right sub but i need an outlet to post this anonymously when i was 14 my brother passed away suddenly he was born with HLHS Hypoplastic left heart syndrome which is a rare congenital heart defect in which the left side of the heart is severely underdeveloped He had many surgeries as a child which i wont get in to but the important thing to note is that from the ages of 718 he was physically fine sure he sweat a lot and slept more the most teens but nothing extreme in February 2020 he got sick his livers started failing he would faint randomly and when they got it checked out it turn out he was in heart failure however he started taking new meds and was seemingly improving one night at the beginning of March he and my sister had a baking contest and both made desserts we tasted them and ranked them his chocolate mousse won by a landslide i had the grand idea of putting whipped cream on the back of my hand and hitting it into the air and the trying to catch it in my mouth me and my siblings all tried it and my brother laughed so hard his face turned blue it was a night filled of laughter and jokes thats the last time i saw himalive the next morning both of my parents went out to work which was unusual because my mother works from home and was my brothers primary caregiver i stayed home from school for a reason i cant remember now at around 10am my father called me to check on my brother who wasnt answering his phone and to make sure he takes his meds while still on the phone with my dad i go to my brothers room when i walk the smell hits me like a ton of bricks but my father was rushing me so I tiptoe over to his bed and i see him with his eyes rolled back and mouth slightly agape i tried to shake him but his skin was cold and thats what i noticed his arms were a deep shade bluish purple i told my dad to call the EMTs because my brother was not waking up i remember drinking water unlocking the door and waiting in the living room emts burst through the door professional looking people running in and out of our small apartment and then the rush slowed down i wasnt informed on much and i was nervous to interfere now there are more professional people running in and out with my small apartment although now some were patiently waiting for my father to arrive and since my mum wasnt answering her phone oblivious to her only sons passing all i could do is wait i remember feeling awkward and unsure of what to do with all these personnel in my home so i just kept offering everyone water and snacks but they would just look at me with sad eyes and politely decline I was only 14 so there were some issues of them telling me things but after about an hour while My Father was on his way a kind man with a thick southern drawl sat me down he informed me that my brother had passed away by the looks of it he had already been gone for quite some time I responded with an understanding nod i didnt cry I remember when My Father came home hearing the news and holding back tears I let the professionals do the talking while I sat in my room my Father joined me and I held his hands while the police questioned us Ill never forget the whale of agony my sister let out when she got home and heard the news the rest of the day is a blur his funeral was the next day and rained and hailed so hard my shoes were soaked through to my socks I had a complicated relationship with my brother but at the very least Im glad that he died at home in the comfort of his own bed and not in a hospital bed hooked up to machines and wires he hated the hospital its so incredibly hard and painful especially since five years ago was a different world He passed away right before Covid lockdown started happening it feels like i knew him a lifetime ago sometimes I forget his face and struggle remember what he looks like and it scares me because its only been five years and statistically speaking I have around 70 more years to go every family event is painful all days of celebration and holidays are surrounded with this dark cloud that feeling that theres someone that isnt here that should be here I hope this post is coherent im after a long day at work feel free to ask anything in the comment if anything needs clarification,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:25:42 UTC,10,2,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCEDEATH,0,0

1j629ya,I am having problems with my relationship and I feel trapped,I dont know where to start with it all This is going to be long and if any of you get to the end I appreciate you taking the time to read my story I would say that this feels like a common place story that happens to a lot of people in different ways I just need to get my story told almost feels like I am just asking for pity maybe I am and that is an issue with myself because seeking pity is not good for ones mental health but what Ive been holding in also isnt good for my mental health Ill start the story at 4 years ago when my relationship started It started 7 years ago I start there I was a lonely type of fella and I did not have much relationship experience from my time growing up and being in high school total of 2 relationships before this current one I find myself in one 8 months with it ending with me getting cheated on and the other 15 years with me proposing and then getting cheated on Both inperson and then transitioning to longdistance youd think Id learned my lesson the first time Anyways I go about a year of being single and searching for love as all young people do and nothing worked for me dating apps social events or just finding people in places that youd want to be able to share interest with Until one day I posted a nice thirst trap online to get the selfseeking validation that I felt I needed at the time and someone slid into my DMs someone that I had known from HS but never truly talked to I began talking with this person and then we grew closer every day despite being long distance with a 3hour time difference We Facetimed each other every once in a while and then twice a week and then every day The problem at the time in that relationship was two things I was not emotionally intelligent and I had a group of guy friends that were semitoxic My significant other was not fond of my friends as they wanted to go out and party all the time which I didnt mind doing but it wasnt my cup of tea So I spent more time talking with her and then one day I tried to introduce her to my group of friends on Facetime and she talked to everyone a little bit and just found them all disgusting and asked to talk to me again She said something along the lines of Wow cant believe you did that and hung up on me Now for me I was confused because my buddies did the same thing with their signifcant others and no one was upset and it was nice getting to know the person they loved back homefor a little context me and my SO had not met up yet we were still having facetime and what not It was also a surprise for her because when she called I was hanging out with my buddies and one of them picked up So after she hung up I called her back in private and I asked her what was wrong and she told me that she felt disrespected by what happened and that was our first big fight with each other and it ended with me texting her updates of when and where I am so she knows if she can call with me I agreed with it all not thinking that it was a big deal We continued the relationship with one another with basically a gradual turn of all my free time being spent with her I neglected friends and became somewhat isolated from my world As an inexperienced youngling I didnt see that issue I kept the good friends and started distancing myself from my friends wed hang out with but it started to be less and less as the month went by I would say that we are about 8 months into this relationship with each other when we first decided to meet up with each other and have about a week together Now before we met with each other she alluded that there were things that she wasnt going to give me or ask of me unless we were dating because I hadnt asked her to be my girlfriend and I dont know why but that enticed me to figure out what she was alluding to and that brought me to the point of when meeting up with her I asked her to be my gf and she said yes but I was so nervous asking her it felt like she was a bit hesistant on that matter when replying yes That happened the first day and then we started dating with our first week in a relationship of hanging out with each other I stayed at her place the whole week and we did various things and hung out with each other It felt like things went well for the week that we spent together it felt like we connected and everyone had a good time before we had to say goodbye and continue our longdistance relationship After I got back to my home things started to change with our relationship she wanted more from me in ways of being more emotionally aware of my day and tell her my feelings and how things made me feel and as the emotinally unintellegnet person I was it was hard for me to change that in my everyday life I was just going with the flow of life and never realy discussed my emotions with others becasue it never really came up in conversation We argued about how I was still just discussing my day with her and not sharing my emotions with her so I worked on it and slowly got better with being in touch with my emotions yet I feel like it was never really enough for the relationship As the months went by she continuously felt like I wasnt telling her enough about my life and felt left out the more I told her about my day so I committed to telling her everything that happened in my day as she was doing to me Now my struggle was that there was a lot that happened in my day so I would sometimes do it when it happened in my day Still I would eventually tell her about it when we called each other every day Still she would then get upset that she missed out on knowing when it happened and what I felt in that period Once again being the emotionally unavailable guy I was I tried my best to do what I could to satisfy that need for her At this point youre probably wondering why we just didnt break up I have no clue its probably just me being weakwilled At this point I spent just about every waking moment texting and talking to this girl and we got into arguments just about every single day either about me missing information I was telling her or me not being emotional Being young I thought this was healthy because the arguments led to deeper conversations with each other and figuring out what made us who we are I would say about 4 or 5 months after our initial meetup I had pretty much completely distanced myself from my friedns with rarely ever hanging out with them but maybe once in a blue moon but it made it harder in my relationship to hangout with them becausea of her wanting to know everything and me jsut wanting to spend time with friedns so there was communication delay from waht was happening in the conversation and what I was doing vs what was acutally happening in my life This all led to arguments down the line and then our next meet up this time I was meeting her parents and she was coming to me I set things up so that I could stay with her and got a friend that I was closer with that she seemed to like because he was married and approved more of our relationship We spent the time together for about 2 weeks this time one week just me and her at my place and then a week with her parents It seemed like another good meet up with both of enjoying ourselves but a little bit of tension between us from the arguments and the fact I was moving from a 3 hour time difference to a 13 hour time difference which we both imagined would put more of a strain on our relationship her parents liked me on a side note We parted ways and I began my new path in life with her being in college and me being abroad for work We had both been right tensions did increase with each other as I was abroad it became even hadrder for me to comunicate with her with everything that was going on in my day to day life as it was for the most part always unpredictable and hard to keep up with myself and she would sleep half way through my day as the time differnece so if she didnt wake up to a butt load of text about my day she felt upset and always had this feeling of misisng out on my life so I continued to distance myself from others and not participating in group events and when I did I tried to keep to myself to minimize the updating I had to do At this point she just felt like I didnt love her because I wasnt involving her in my life the same way she was involving me in her life She told me everything about her day so this wasnt a double standard and she was also busy but I would say that I was definitely busier than she was I continued to apoligize about the communication issues with keeping in mind I still was telling her about everything that happened in my day whenever we talked on the phone especially all the things I forgot to tell her and she felt that I conviently kept forgetting to tell her about the interations that I had with Females throughout my day beacuse as you can imagine she was jealous that other females got to interact with me throught out the day more and she didnt I was better about telling her about female interaction through my day but I still missed a few here and there Sometimes I got rides from females and shed get upset that I didnt tell them when it happened She always felt she never got the full story the first time and she had to ask multiple questions to get the whole story and that was tiring for her and it got to the point where I thought I was doing a good job but was not and I just gave up on updating her one day because life just got overwhelmed and I couldnt handle life and my relationship at the same time and she ended it after that day I was devastated as we had been going through this struggle for almost 3 years and it just felt like it was all for nothing We met a third time before breaking up and were going to meet up a 4th before COVID19 occurred and travel bans happened which didnt improve our relationship We broke up I got friends and started to move on with my life slowly finding myself and what makes me happy For about a year I was single I decided to move back to the same timezone as her and go to the college that she went to Not expecting her to be in the area not ever really knowing why I did it either I wanted to complete college not being in a relationship but that was not what occured As you can expect we ran into each other again and started dating because she felt like I was a changed man and was able to prioritize things in my life a little better I can say that I did grow in the time after we broke up and explored my inner workings a little more The thing is she thought I started dating her again because she was a different person but she hasnt really changed all that much still wanting the same things and I was more able to provide those things she wanted and it felt like things were going in the right direction We moved in with each other and where dating for a year until she said that she wanted more and didnt feel we were growing and she said it was because I had not asked her to be my gf so about 3 months of me trying to find the right time to ask and it not working out we get into an argument about it and I asak her and she says no ask another time So I dont plan for it and just start asking her once a week until she just says yes about 2 months later while we are living and sleeping in the same bed with each other Anyway things started getting a little tenser between us I dont have many friends as I learned not to make friends in this relationship and I dont talk to my old friends much because it just causes conflict and Id rather avoid than lie We continued dating and for about 2 years we lived in the same place We have had our ups and downs through the two years I changed my job twice and have a female supervisor as you know she is upset about that but she ignores it better She says she just at this point in the relationship buries her emotions and hides her concerns because she doesnt want conflict in the relationship and she only ever feels that she has problems with what is going on in the relationship We still argue a lot and have those arguments turn into deep conversations and I become more and more emotionally drained as these arguments happen and I can barely keep up with my studies work and relationship yet I push on We are starting to get to the real point of this story and why I am just done is that we were initially very active sexually in the beginning of our relationship like once a week and then it moved to once a month which you know I didnt think to much of it because I figure sex drive just went down as the relationship got more secured but we just moved to a new place and signed a 15 month lease that niether of us can afford to break and I tried to be sexual with her this morning and she told me that it felt nice but shed been thinking of her ex when weve been doing stuff and that its kinda always been that way becasue she used to be very sexually active with her ex but he was fine with not having sex and she puts herself in his position and wouldnt want that pushed uponed her and makes her feel sad and turns her off from anything that we are doing and I tried to help her get to the root of it this morning before leaving to work and I just felt that I disrepected myself by doing that and not being more upset about her thinking of her ex and it just hurts because it means just about everytime we do sexual stuff its about how she feels about her ex and makes sense why she has to sometime watch things when I go down on her Honestly I know that this is a super toxic relationship but I love her so much and have tried so hard in this relationship with the time and effort I put in everyday it just sucks all of it TLDR GF thinks of ex during intimate time after 7 years of relationship and gets turned off just about every time because she pushed herself on her ex and her ex didnt care about having sex and she didnt like the idea of being in his position So it has tanked our relationship and everything feels distant and We moved to new place with 15 month lease no one can afford to break I feel stuck,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 22:32:58 UTC,2,1,0.75,,,0,0

1j5wpag,i told my friend that she needs to stop victimizing herself and i dont really feel that bad about it,keeping events and names vague on purpose i have a very close friend A who i love very dearly but shes been in bind after bind her family had disowned her and she has been in like 5 horrible relationships in the past two years and both the places she has worked at in the past two years have gone out of business none of this stuff is her fault but i think it puts her in a shitty place where she feels justified in her own mind to just not hang out with friends or justified to be rude to friends in a way i love hanging out with A and i love just sitting around and chatting and watching tv with her while i do art and such like that but i also love getting out of the house on occasion if im invited for example As roommate B invited Bs GF me A and another friend out to go get food we got all ready and then A was like i actually dont have alot of money so im gonna sit this one out and we were all super sad and then we all look in our wallets and agree we could chip in a few bucks each to cover As meal because shes been in hard times so much and we go tell her and shes like no i dont want to so we go out to eat without her and have a great time and come back and even bring her food back from the restaurant and shes all angry and depressed and sad she didnt get to go Two weeks ago B took a bus to stay in her GFs dorm for a few days and when she came back i picked her up from the bus stop we got some fast food even got some for A and then came back home and me and B were talking and being silly when A goes i hate hearing you talk and have fun like that when you got to go do something fun while i had to work for all those days with no break and then A goes back to her room I went to class and didnt hear anything for a few days but i know that A and B argued then some friends from me and As highschool that we still regularly talk to texted me and said theyre gonna do something fun over this coming weekend and i was like hell yeah i love hanging out with my friends and they told me to ask A if she wants to join in and i call up A and ask her and she goes idk i dont have my work schedule yet and i said ok could u text ur boss and ask for the day off we really all want to hang out with you and she says ill see weekends coming around and i just texted A to ask if shes gonna hang out with us and she goes no i have work i say oh im sad you couldnt get work off and she goes oh i didnt really try they highschool friends didnt directly ask me so i figured i wasnt invited like girl i literally asked you because they wanted you there and i showed her the texts from our friends asking if A is coming because theyre so excited to see her both friends live a ways away so we dont see each other often and one of the friends hasnt seen A for about 4 years due to moving states and then coming back and we were all excited and waiting for her to join us but i go ok i wish u could have joined us maybe we can pick u up after u finish working and hang out and she just goes no i think your all going to have fun without me and i kinda was a bit pissed w her so i said she should have take the day off when i asked a while ago and shes just like oh i could have but i didnt girl this is around when i told her she needs to stop victimizing herself i hung out with her roommate later that day and we discussed how shes kinda been and B said she would talk to A about how she needs to stop isolating herself I also ended up inviting B to hang out with us over the weekend instead as the highschool friends have all met B in passing and like hanging out with her ik this is gonna piss off A a bit but like A could have also hung out with us and then A is gonna be mad and not want to hear about what weve all done for a while im just so tired of her self deprecating behavior where she always HAS to be the victim who just CANT hang out or CANT do anything fun and all that bull TLDR exactly what the title says i told my friend that she needs to stop victimizing herself and i dont really feel that bad about it thats the end,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 18:53:01 UTC,2,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j3qh3b,I Am Watching My Best Friends Fiancé Ruin His Life Day by Day,Long time lurker first time poster I have reached a boiling point where I cannot keep this within anymore My wife and I have been watching my best friends life crumbles in front of us due to his fiancé and her manipulations For the remaining of my story I will refer to my best friend as T and his fiancé as Z T and Z met on Tinder during late 2021 and T introduced Z to me and our friend group in early 2022 Ever since I met Z my wife and I had identifed so many red flags about her Here is a summary of what I can recall 1 Z has a habit of trauma dumping her past to everyone she met Even during casual conversations when people asked about her life before meeting T she would reveal about her previous engagement where her exfiancé would beat her in front of her mom just all kinds of sob stories her suicide attempts and generally just all sorts of stories that Z loves telling people that she just met making every conversation with Z extremely uncomfortable for everyone 2 Over the course of their relationship Z had convinced T to cut off his friendships with all of his childhood friends who all warned T about Zs questionable character I remember that the day T told his childhood friend group that he no longer wishes to speak to them that whole group messaged me on Facebook warning me to watch out for Z and that she is bad news even though they have never met me my guess is that T talked about me with them given that T and I are really good friends who went through a lot in life together This is the beginning of Zs gradual removal of Ts friends and her plan to isolate him from his support system What I also noticed is that Z is unable to make and keep any new friends any new friend group that met Z through T eventually got so repulsed by her that they distanced themselves from T and Z 3 Z casually bragged to me and my wife that she read all of Ts personal messages on Facebook and texts to his friends even the things he said before they met My wife and I kept telling Z to be more respectful of personal boundaries especially when it comes to the past but Z did not care and kept reading Ts personal messages to friends and family til this day 4 T and Z bought a house together in 2023 and the moment they signed it off Z quit her job claiming mistreatment even though she always bragged that the job allowed her to nap in her own office anytime she wanted and everyone treated her like family there 5 Now that T and Z are a singleincome household with T working his ass off to cover their mortgage and living expenses Z always asked for T to take her to lavish restaurants frequent trips to Disney parks even having him take her to a week in Disneyworld in Florida after she left her job Every weekend she would have him take her to LA for a different expensive restaurant so that she could take pics and flex for her IG stories 6 Z got a diagnosis for Bipolar 1 sometime in 2024 Ever since she frequently asked T to leave his work early to come home because of her not feeling well for whatever reasons Note that because of this T eventually got flagged for declining performance at his work but despite knowing this Z still had T leave work early often for her 7 It is interesting to note that despite always claiming of not feeling well almost every day during the times that I would come over at Ts place to hang out I observed that Z was frequently able to drive herself late at night to play video games at her brothers house which is a half hour drive away and come home late just fine What pissed me off the most was that during my wedding which was the only time in life that I asked to spend a lot of time with T Z asked T to leave my wedding early because you guessed it she wasnt feeling well To make matters worse Z wore a white dress to my wedding and my wife and I got asked many questions from our friends about that but we just shook it off because we were speechless about that as well 8 While she was unemployed Z decided to go to college for an accounting degree even though she has no goals of working anywhere after She always openly bragged about how she had T doing her college homework and coursework for her because she has difficulty learning since English is not her first language 9 T eventually got fired from his job for his declining performance My wife and I was able to meet up at Ts house to provide T some guidance and support to look for a new job During that time Z told us that she already asked T for a boob job she claimed that she feels insecure in college for being flat chested and she also wants T to pay for a few other cosmetic procedures well knowing that T doesnt have a source of income anymore T and Z will get married at some point in 2026 and I feel like theres nothing I can do about it My wife and I know it to our core that Z is a terrible human being but T keeps giving her excuses and falling for her trauma dumping When my own family briefly talked with T and Z at my wedding they have also all noted that Z came off very disingenuous and manipulative Since my wife and I spent the most time with T and Z our friend group for the most part doesnt know as much about Z as we know I feel like I am watching Ts life crumbles in real time as Z keeps draining his life away for her own use I honestly wish I put in more effort in talking T out of dating Z when they first met I never expected T to end up with someone that feels no remorse ruining his life like this Guess since I cant talk to anyone else IRL about this aside from my wife I am better off letting this out on Reddit,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 00:41:23 UTC,2,6,1.0,,,0,0

1j5qsiz,I accidentally walked into a secret Russian spy base,Back in 2019 I had an appointment at a Jewish school in Amsterdam I was told to look for a schoolbuilding with a large fence around it and camera security Once I arrived at the location I saw a building that fitted the description I couldnt find something that seemed like an entrance but I noticed a gate and door that were open because someone was talking out the trash and walked in trough there I had taken notice that inside the compound there were two luxury cars parked one with Russian licence plates and one with diplomatic plates Once inside it took me a while to find a person but after searching a bit I found a man who didnt speak dutch and was looking at me with confusion I explained I had an appointment at the school and he simply pointed out to me that the Jewish school was the building next door and directed me out of the building At the school they couldnt tell me what was in that building there was noting indicated there on google maps And for years I have wondered about what it was because it had a vibe as if I had just stumbled into a secret Russian base that I wasnt supposed to find I was reminded of this incident earlier today and finally decided to do some research into the building located at the Veluwelaan in Amsterdam And as it turns out the building was indeed closed a couple of years ago because it was a base for the Russian secret service Holy cow I literally walked into a Russian spy base 5 years ago And more importantly I got to walk out of a Russian spy base alive,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 15:24:05 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0

1j77ugw,Despite believing I am worthy I dont see any reason why anyone would care about me,Okay so this might come across as a little sad and bleak and I doubt that I will get any gentle responses Might as well be ranting because I have found a haven in Reddit lately I often wonder why anyone would like to be friends with me I struggle a lot with anxiety and maintaining attention and usually when I offer advice it is not that helpful usually overly philosophical and impractical Some people may like to engage in that kind of discussion I guess I dont have any interesting hobbies besides going to a cafe by myself and having a cigarette browsing and looking for jobs to advance my career I have a very niche sense of humour that can be overly sarcastic and easily offend I try to pick up hobbies but I end up wanting to escape my reality via watching too much TV cleaningdecluttering and spending time with my partner which I also dont see why he would stay with me after the initial attraction wears off I am probably extremely depressed as I grew up with a childhood trauma that I tried to address via therapy but it felt like the benefit wasnt outweighing the expense and somehow it felt even more depressing as my only only hope for getting better didnt look that hopeful A few therapists seemed to make me feel like my system was in a kind of a deadlock I find myself lately thinking often about why anyone would like to be friends with me even though I dont think less of myself I am young 32F attractive fit and financially independent I am welleducated and have a decentpaying job I rarely lie gossip and I like to support people by understanding their goals I like to treat my friends every now and again but I dont like transactional relationships I used to have creative ambitions but quit them and settled into a boring life when I saw nothing was really materializing How can I improve this sense of isolation helplessness with years of therapy as a last resort,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 13:40:00 UTC,3,7,1.0,,,0,0

1j6sqzk,Years ago I had a close call with a motorcyclist Now I cant stop worrying about it Am I overthinking,I recently remembered an event from the past and I havent been able to stop thinking about it It happened a long time ago so its possible that what I remember is not exactly what actually happened A few years ago in 2022 when I was 14 I was coming home from school with some friends when an idiot thought it would be funny to open my backpack and ring a doorbell without telling me Immediately afterward everyone started running I quickly zipped up my backpack and for some reason I dont remember I decided to cross the road to the other sidewalk instead of running forward Maybe it was because there were too many people in front of me making it difficult to run quicklyI dont know I really dont remember The thing is as soon as I stepped onto the road an older man on a motorcycle appeared right in front of me just a few meters away I moved away as fast as I could and got back onto the sidewalk where I had been before I think I remember the driver swerving a little when he got scared after seeing me though Im not entirely sure about this I didnt hear any noise that would suggest the man had fallen nor did I hear a scream of painjust a Me cago en la madre which roughly means For fs sake in Spanish which I believe means he kept driving I think The problem is that I dont know if I started running once I stepped back onto the sidewalk which could have prevented me from noticing an accident if it happened But its more likely that I stayed still after stepping away from the roadat least long enough that I would have noticed if anything had happened Im not sure what exactly happened in that moment It all happened so fast and its been a few years since then When I saw the idiot who opened my backpack again all he did was laugh I guess he saw what happened in some way and thats why he made fun of me when we met again Or maybe I told him about it and then he started laughingI dont remember I also seem to recall that I had two other friends behind me on the other side of the road and when they caught up with us they were laughing too If what I remember is correct that would mean nothing actually happened I got home feeling like an idiot but at no point did I think I might have caused an accident Ive walked through that area dozens of times since then and while I wasnt specifically looking I never noticed any signs that an accident had happened I also searched online for news from that year in my city and I didnt find anything similar to what I experienced I never heard anyone mention that day again which reinforces my belief that nothing actually happened I recently remembered this incident and I think Im becoming paranoid Im scared by the possibility that the man could have had a serious accident or that someone nearby might have been hurt since it was a very busy area at that time with lots of cars and many kids coming back from school Ive been really worried for the past few days and I honestly feel bad about it Do you think Im just being paranoid I need someone to reassure meIm a bit scared,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 22:27:28 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j4guer,Im a bad friend and its affecting people I care about,Recently I fell out with a friend of mine who Ive known for a little over a year Its most likely my fault given that I A have talked to them about it already B Am somewhat aware that I probably sucked at some point in time that I dont entirely remember It started around 34 months ago when all my friends made plans to hangout together out of town a few dont show up because of curfew although they didnt make any real attempt to meet with any of us or let us know where they were until leaving to go home They argued they told us about curfew beforehand we mentioned how we deliberately shifted the schedule up by a few hours to accommodate that they then said we didnt even agree on a meeting place we did they apologize and swear it wont happen again After this I was upset for quite a while with one of them whom I was closer to and gave them the cold shoulder for a while We dont talk for ages since I dont speak much with others in lessons and they kept wandering off with my other friend Meanwhile another one of my friends who organised the hangout trip is slowly losing patience with friend A and B because they keep ditching her when leaving to buy lunch which also kinda ticks me off because Its getting hard not to see a pattern forming Distance grows I dont do much about it since I attributed it to something else entirely and wanted to give them space this is around 2 months back We still dont talk properly They ghost me starting from around a month ago and dont talk to me in person or respond to my texts Eventually I ask to meet up and talk about it and they agree When asking them they say the reason why is that I dont really talk to them kept moving away whenever they sat near compared their skills to another persons even though theyre the same grade made snide comments people whore friends with me arent nice to them etc I dont remember a ton of this and while some of it is probably coincidence moving away from them theres a solid chance that some of it IS stuff Ive done I can be pretty horrible sometimes especially when Im not doing so well mentally and Im so angry with myself that I crashed a friendship with someone I cared about over crap communication and my own assholery I wish I could say that I atleast know where I went wrong but I cant since I dont remember the whole bloody thing happening Another of my friends has distanced themselves from my current group to join another group with this person and I cant tell whether they actually want to remain friends with me or if its just because they cant bring themselves to stop talking with me entirely Theres also the chance that their negative impression of me is creating a negative impression of everyone associated with me AND that Im 90 sure their new friends keep talking shit about me since they all go quiet whenever I get too close although there could be any random thing theyre talking about To top this all off Im not even sure if my own friends enjoy my presence and I feel myself drifting from them although this part is probably in my head and a reflection of current circumstances TLDR I hate myself my friend hates me their new friends hate me I cant tell if another friend hates me and my current friends might hate me Its been a long week Im sick And tired,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 23:02:01 UTC,1,0,0.67,,,0,0
1j4f0wx,Im crushing on this girl and its only deepening,I 25M got this gorgeous girls number at a bar last Saturday she and I had this amazing and absolutely fluid conversation before I invited her and her friend to join my table where my friends sat It was extremely enjoyable and she and I were flirting backandforth mind you Ive hardly flirted with anyone since my ex cheated on me sometime ago Before she and her friend left for another bar I asked for her number but I quickly told her If youre not comfortable with it you really dont have to I just think youre cute and witty and Id love to talk to you more She replies with and this made my smile like an idiot Im not uncomfortable at all I was waiting for you to ask Got her number wish her a great rest of her night and we separate to our respective friend groups Then I text her the following afternoon and since then weve had these fantastic flirty and personal conversations Heres the issue She doesnt text back too often Let me preface this by saying I know people get busy or preoccupied or even forget to text others back but Im talking hours on hours without a response from her When she does she immediately reciprocates my energy and the conversation returns to being wonderful This isnt an attempt of mine to gripe all things considered I just find myself feeling like a high school with a crush again she genuinely makes me grin like a fool and fills my stomach with butterflies More than anything I want to talk to her Of course I busy myself while she isnt responding and try not to think too hard on it while Im occupying myself but I really pray she texts back soon Im tempted to ask her to FaceTime if shes cool with it because of how greatly I want to keep talking to her,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:48:27 UTC,8,12,0.9,,,0,0
1j77ugw,Despite believing I am worthy I dont see any reason why anyone would care about me,Okay so this might come across as a little sad and bleak and I doubt that I will get any gentle responses Might as well be ranting because I have found a haven in Reddit lately I often wonder why anyone would like to be friends with me I struggle a lot with anxiety and maintaining attention and usually when I offer advice it is not that helpful usually overly philosophical and impractical Some people may like to engage in that kind of discussion I guess I dont have any interesting hobbies besides going to a cafe by myself and having a cigarette browsing and looking for jobs to advance my career I have a very niche sense of humour that can be overly sarcastic and easily offend I try to pick up hobbies but I end up wanting to escape my reality via watching too much TV cleaningdecluttering and spending time with my partner which I also dont see why he would stay with me after the initial attraction wears off I am probably extremely depressed as I grew up with a childhood trauma that I tried to address via therapy but it felt like the benefit wasnt outweighing the expense and somehow it felt even more depressing as my only only hope for getting better didnt look that hopeful A few therapists seemed to make me feel like my system was in a kind of a deadlock I find myself lately thinking often about why anyone would like to be friends with me even though I dont think less of myself I am young 32F attractive fit and financially independent I am welleducated and have a decentpaying job I rarely lie gossip and I like to support people by understanding their goals I like to treat my friends every now and again but I dont like transactional relationships I used to have creative ambitions but quit them and settled into a boring life when I saw nothing was really materializing How can I improve this sense of isolation helplessness with years of therapy as a last resort,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 13:40:00 UTC,3,7,1.0,,,0,0

1j5wepk,Out of nowhere I met this really gorgeous girl and now Im over here secondguessing everythinglike am I even doing this right,Hey everyone to whoevers reading this story Id love to hear your thoughts on it I guess I should start with a little backstory Around early autumn last year I was walking through one of the neighborhoods in my city It was my last day at work and after finishing up I decided to take a stroll grab something to eat and soak in the last warm sunny days I found a nearby bench sat down popped in my earphones and just listened to music as I made my way to a café At some point I noticed a girl who looked really upset I hesitated for a moment but then decided to go up to her and see if she was okay Turns out shed had a really rough day We ended up walking together exchanging contacts and chatting later on when we had time Our first few meetups were easygoing and fun We talked got to know each other and with every meeting we started growing closer After about a month I started visiting her place after the gym to unwind a little And then at some point things between us started feeling like more than just friendship There was this warmth this physical closeness that Id been missing even though I had plenty of friends I was single at the time Shes absolutely gorgeouslike the kind of girl who turns heads wherever she goes Shes tall about 185 cm has an amazing figure a beautiful face and these deep brown eyes that just pull you in Shes got a great body though thats far from the only thing I like about her Shes also a few years older than me Then about three weeks later after lots of time spent together and some really great conversations I went over to her place again this time bringing flowers to surprise her I rang the doorbell and when she opened the door my jaw literally dropped There she was standing in front of me in red silk shorts and a top looking absolutely breathtaking I just stood there speechless until she pulled me inside wrapped her arms around me and kissed me We headed to the kitchen where she was cooking some meat for dinnersomething she knew I liked even though Id never actually told her That moment just hit differently It was like she knew me better than I knew myself That was when I realizedthis girl had completely stolen my heart Later she even got me a pair of shorts and an Tshirt so Ive have something to wear around her place I changed sat down with her on the couch and we put on some YouTube Before long we were cuddling and yeahthat was when we kissed The whole evening was just perfect And now every day I catch myself wondering am I doing the right thing Because I honestly love spending time with this girl I could really use your advice,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 18:42:58 UTC,4,4,0.83,,,0,0
1j7ngez,I M23 just kinda feel sad about relationships and I think Im starting to see romantic relationships with women as interchangeable and I dont want to be like that,Dating is miserable and it feels like every person Im with seemingly has no clue of what they want and my actions have almost zero impact long term on the success of the relationship because every woman I date ends up falling into a spiral of self sabotage or the ones that are already emotionally independent arent interested I feel like at this point my desire for a relationship has evolved to the stage where any woman insofar as shes around my age and not a bad a person is alright enough for me As long as she loves me Ill be whatever man I need to be and shes can be whatever kind of woman she is Obviously this is toxic and nonsense but I cannot for the life of me shake my perception of things The minimum bar for me is extremely low and Im not even in a bad position Average looking a regular irl social group good career ambitions and in school for them etc But in every situation all I can think of is the long term position I need to be in and how much time Im wasting not doing and saying whatever I can to most efficiently get to that position a long term irl relationship,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 01:37:45 UTC,0,1,0.5,,,0,0

1j6wnuu,Teen Nightmare,Teen Nightmare This happened many years ago I dont want anyone to get in trouble or press charges I just need to finally be able to speak about what happened I was 17 at the time and I volunteered as a Sheriff explorer during this time I met a deputy who in the beginning was really nice to me I had just graduated highschool but my 18th birthday wasnt until a few months later I was scheduled to go on a ride along we were required to go on patrol at least once every three months or so and he volunteered to take me on this day This first time went fine I was super shy but he got me to open up he talked about himself and asked me about what my plans were after graduating It wasnt until the second time I went on patrol with him around a month later that things took a turn I knew he had a girlfriend she was only two years older me but this time around he started talking about how things were rocky between them I didnt think much of it I thought he was just venting and no harm done However he was being super touchy and was flirting and at that time I was too shy to say anything He ended up kissing me out of nowhere and he just smiled and said he needed to know if I was attracted to him Im not going to lie I was he was good looking but I asked him about his girlfriend he said she wouldnt care He offered to take me home after the shift and he did but not before he ended up taking me to an abandoned field and said he just wanted to talk We ended up making out in his car and i told him i didnt want to have sex that it was as far as i would go he said it was fine but kept pushing and pressuring for more He said if i really had feelings for him i would be willing to go all the way He took me home after about an hour and explicitedly told me that if i was asked by any other deputy to just say were friends I liked how special he made me feel and the red flags were there but i honestly thought he wouldnt force me to have sex with him since at that point he did stop when i told him to even if he continued to ask From this point on whenever I would patrol with him things would go further Until finally one day after my 18th birthday he said he would take me home but instead he hopped on the freeway towards his apartment I was scared but at that point I felt speaking up would get me abandoned somewhere unfamiliar or worse We made it to his place and he gave me a beer and led me to his bedroom I felt like I couldnt say no he told me to relax that I would like it that it was just my nerves We ended having sex but I finally was able to tell him he needed to stop that he was hurting me but all he would say was just let me finish its OK youll like it in a minute No amount of pleading worked until he finally rolled off me By then I was shaking and oddly felt numb about the whole thing He took me home and again told me to say we were just friends He would lose his job if anyone found out making me feel guilty I ended up quitting the program a few months later and foud out he was being investigated for misconduct on a whole different issue I regret keeping quiet but at the time I was confused and developed feelings for him Other deputies became suspicious since they noticed he would go out of his way to talk to me but no one ever asked me personally if anything happened I know this is long and confusing but it feels good to finally speak about it Ive held this in for 16 years I had posted and then deleted I freaked out a bit that it was shared but if it helps anyone else in a similar situation so they speak up then it is what it is Also for clarity he was nine years older than me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 01:41:28 UTC,1,0,0.99,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j3x4w1,My abusive mother tried to raise baby birds it did not go well,Edit i forgot the obligatory Click meniton I 16M have a mother who loves birds especially cockateils she has three in total until about 2 months ago two of them ended up getting a little too close and WHAM babies Now my mother is overall not very good at parenting she messed up me and my sister pretty bad But when it comes to her pets she at least acts like she loves them Now when these babies hatched two survived and they were looking really nice and healthy that was until a couple weeks ago my mother was starting to get annoyed at their constant screaming you know as babies do and decided that they were eating enough seed it wouldnt matter if they were seperated or not from their parents they were still being fed by their mother and father occasionally throughout the day so cue her forcibly taking them cramming them into a small cage and not letting them see their parents anymore so they wouldnt scream again i was going to say something but due to being too scared to say anything if anyone disagrees with her on something big she gets explosive i kept my mouth shut i mainly helped her with them when we had to hand feed them when they were infants so i wasnt as worried as checking on them as i should have been becuase i thought she could handle it aparently i was wrong she cant and her decision to seperate them ended up being fatal for the youngest in heindsight i think he was stressed from being seperated from his mom so suddenly and so he stopped eating according to my mom he haddent really been eating too much over the past two weeks or so ie since she seperated them i could be wrong though i have some experience with birds and i at least do my reserch the youngest couldnt stand up just trying to walk resulted in him just stumbling and falling over i asked my mom why dont we take them to an avian vet to see if something was wrong and her words were i dont want to deal with some sick bird its too stressful if they die they die and plus the vet bill will probably be 200 dollars and i dont want to spend that much so cue me flabbergasted i try and hand feed the bird at least a little bit and it works hes eating some and putting him on his mothers cage floor and hes slowly eating some seeds im estatic and i think oh ill check up on him in an hour cue me falling asleep for a few hours instead and i wake up to check on him and hes already passed away i tell her and what does she say oh well ill bury him tomorrow put him in a plastic bag until then not really relevent she buried all our previous pets in plastic ziplock bags and such so thats going to be a nice supprise for the next owner i recommended that she stop doing that but she still does anyway i cant belive im related to her how can one person be so heartless she loves all her pets until they get sick then theyre just another burden to her talk about unconditinal and worst thing is i bet she wont even listen and pretend like it died from some illness again it could have been something else but im pretty confident she killed it tldr my mom shouldnt have birds and especially never should have tried to hatch and raise baby cockateils if she really gets annoyed that easily birds will be noisey i know from experience,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 06:45:29 UTC,3,0,0.81,,,0,0

1j37fax,I keep remembering when I was groomed,This happened years ago but I still remember it vividly Honestly it was one of the worst nights of my life I was around 1314 at the time It was mid December A week before Christmas I met him online but I forgot how He was 19 and average looking He lived only a two hour walk away I remember I waited till it was around 12 pm He came over to pick me up and I snuck out of the house He picked me up It was very awkward When we got to his place he told me to be quiet because his grandmother was there or something Honestly it was so weird Red flags all around but I was too nervous to do anything I remember lil peep Beamer boy was playing quietly in his room when it happened It was a messy room It had red LED strips around the room We sat on his bed and had a very awkward conversation that I dont remember He kept scooting closer and I kept awkwardly scooting away His bed was in the corner so soon I had no room to scoot His phone was ringing over and over but he ignored it and let it ring Turns out it was his girlfriend but I was too scared to protest I didnt want to sleep with him And him having a girlfriend made me want to sleep with him even less I did NOT want to be there but everything was so sketchy I felt I had no choice but to go along with it After all he was bigger older and stronger then me Anyways I was in the corner of his bed I was scared but I didnt show it or at least I dont think it showed I tried not to seem scared But I was terrified and I was sweating He was rubbing my thighs and leaning closer and closer I felt like I was suffocating Thing is I didnt tell him no I just kept awkwardly trying to start a conversation Awkwardly moving his hand away It was clear I did not want it His hands trailed from my thighs to my you know He fingered me for a while I hated it I wasnt even aroused I did not want it It was awkward as hell do I wanted it to stop as quickly as possible so I just faked it Faked an orgasm because I was worried if I didnt hed hurt me or worse Thats when he stood up and started undoing his pants He put a condom on Ill give him that Thats when he turned off the lights and all there was was the glow of the red LED lights dimmed all the way It didnt last long But I hated every second he was inside me and the phone was still ringing He didnt look at me He didnt even finish He got frustrated and pulled out threw the condom out and walked me out of his apartment and called his girlfriend and left me outside Remember when I told you it was December Yeah It was snowing And no not a light dusting It was snowing hard My jacket and pants were still in his room I had to walk home on my own alone in the middle of a storm in nothing but underwear and a long tshirt No one pulled over to help I was crying the whole way home I was too embarrassed and ashamed to call my mother to pick me up I remember frantically texting friends to call me Only person who was awake was someone from a group chat a friend put me in ages ago I never talked to him personally But he called me Tried to comfort me the whole 2 hour walk home My feet were frost bitten and my legs were cramping and sore when I did get home My mother was still asleep so I snuck back into my room He stayed on the phone all night that night Became my friend Im happy he was there for me He was a good friend I was close with him for years Recently we drifted apart but Im thankful for him being in my life even if he wasnt in my life for long Anyways I just wanted to tell someone It has been bugging me for years If you read it all thank you and I hope it didnt trigger anyone I just needed to get it off my chest And no my mother still doesnt know,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 09:59:44 UTC,4,1,0.75,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j61aoy,Im turning 18 today and i cant even afford a cake,Today is my 18th birthday a milestone thats supposed to feel like the gateway to adulthood independence and new beginnings But instead of feeling celebrated I feel overlooked Instead of joy theres this heavy weight in my chest pressing down on me making it hard to swallow the disappointment For almost two months now my father hasnt been able to work due to a jobrelated injury Money is tight so tight that even something as simple as a cake a small token of acknowledgment is out of reach I understand I really do I know its not their fault and I know they love me but that doesnt make it hurt any less Birthdays are supposed to be special a day when you feel seen But mine never really have been Ive had birthdays forgotten birthdays I had to share like they werent fully mine birthdays that felt more like an afterthought than a celebration And now here I am reaching a turning point in my life and it feels like just another ordinary day except worse because deep down I wanted it to be different What makes it harder is the facade I feel forced to maintain Everyone around me assumes Im fine that Im well off that things in my life are smooth My friends ask me what my plans are and I dont even know how to answer Do I pretend I have something lined up Do I admit the truth How do you explain to people that your birthday this huge symbolic moment feels hollow because even the simplest things are out of reach I keep telling myself to be grateful to focus on what I do have but Id be lying if I said I wasnt struggling Its not about material things its about feeling valued feeling like this day matters feeling like I matter And right now I just feel invisible I know life isnt about birthdays that one day in the grand scheme of things shouldnt define anything But when you spend every other day just pushing through birthdays are supposed to be different Theyre supposed to be a pause a moment where you feel like the world sees you But today I feel like Im standing in the middle of a crowded room screaming for someone to notice me and no one even looks up,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 21:49:53 UTC,12,13,0.93,,,0,0
1j3g5dd,From Zero To Something This is to those that is going through hardships do not give up,Hi everyone I have always read other peoples stories I figured I want to share my story with everyone to show that no matter how hard your life is there is always a way I had reasons to give up but I chose not to I hope this story can help other people who is going through hardships I Had NothingSo I Built My Own Future There was a time in my life when I had no financial security no degree no legal certainty and no real future I had no backup plan no connections to rely on and no one to help me figure things out I had to navigate everything on my own making difficult choices to survive Early Life amp Family Background My biological father left when I was two years old to become a monk He was completely absent from my life never attempting to reconnect My mother overwhelmed with life was also absent for long periods When she became pregnant with my stepbrother she left for Malaysia and was gone for nearly a year During that time my grandmother took care of me and my elder brother She was everything you could hope for in a grandmotherkind nurturing and always present Then one day my mother returned and took us to Malaysia without telling anyone My brother and I didnt understand what was happening we simply followed instructions Like anyone leaving home we missed Brunei but we had no say in the matter Life with My Stepfather At around seven years old my stepfather entered my life I was excitedI had always wanted a father He owned a business selling screen protectors and phone covers and as it grew our financial situation improved But despite his success he was abusive Mistakes were not tolerated He beat us for small things like forgetting to turn off a light No matter how well we behaved we were constantly reminded that we were not his real children As his business boomed he became more absent but his abuse never stopped When his business thrived we moved to Johor Bahru and for the first time we lived comfortably But the abuse continued At 14 we moved to Kuala Lumpur I had no idea that my life was about to take a drastic turn Australia amp The First Collapse At 16 I was sent to Australia to continue my studies I enrolled in Year 12 at Taylors College Diploma of Business at Deakin University Bachelors Degree in Psychology Applied Science In early 2013 my stepfather suddenly announced that we had to return to Malaysia His business had gone bankrupt I didnt want to leave but I had no choice Returning to Brunei amp Struggling for Direction Back in Brunei I took a job as a marketing executive at a magazine company It was straightforward work but I realized that Bruneis work culture and lifestyle werent for me At first Brunei made sense because I didnt have the right documents to stay in Malaysia But after working there I knew Malaysia was where I wanted to be So I left Returning to Malaysia amp Facing Reality I was jobless for six months before landing a job as a Private Investigator During this time my stepfather did not support us financially He claimed to be paying our rent but we later found out he wasnt One day our landlord told us the rent hadnt been paid for months If we didnt leave immediately he would call the police That night we quietly packed our essentials and left We were shocked terrified but also relieved to get away from the lie we had been living Later I found out my stepfather had another family His former business partner secretly told my mother that he had two daughters in their early twentiesmeaning he had been maintaining a second family for over 20 years without telling us Survival Mode Private Investigator amp Visa Struggles I found my PI job through a newspaper ad It was advertised as a Market Researcher position but when I went for the interview I realized it was for a Private Investigator The work involved tracking down counterfeit products and investigating individuals I struggled at first but got better over time Still the job was stressful and I knew it wasnt my future On top of that I had major visa issues I was forced to travel in and out of Malaysia every two months to renew my stay Eventually immigration warned me that I would be blacklisted if I kept doing this Desperate I turned to an unconventional way to secure my visa But it backfired The person handling my passport ran away with it for years I was trapped in Malaysia with no legal identity I was terrified I wanted to report it but I feared I would be deported I had to stay quiet and find another way The Turning Point Finding My Strength in Teaching My wife now saw what I was going through She offered to marry me so I could get a spousal visa When she said that I broke down in tears I had been fighting for so long and finally I had a way forward I knew I couldnt continue the PI job so I looked for something more meaningful I found a job as a special needs educator and quickly realized I was good at it I understood behavioral strategies like the ABC Chart and could see real progress in my students I also took a side job at a tuition centre teaching English I worked from 8 AM to 9 PM every day It was exhausting but I kept pushing forward Soon parents started coming to me directly Word spread and I had so many clients that I had to hire another teacher to help me Building My Own Centre amp Surviving COVID19 I always wanted to run my own business When the tuition centre owner tried to take control of my earnings I knew it was time to leave I gathered my savings and opened my own special needs centre It was terrifying but I knew I had to do it Then COVID19 hit I lost over half my clients overnight I had to choose check_mark Let the business fail or check_mark Adapt and push through I transitioned to online teaching and borrowed money to keep my employees paid I sacrificed my own salary to keep the centre alive It was the hardest time of my life but I refused to give up Moral of the story Do not give up despite all the adversities If you hit rock bottom and felt aimless Always remember to do with what you can and progress forward,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 17:25:28

1j5y2vu,I accidentally killed someone as a kid and I regret it every day,I have decided to make a account to admit to this one thing so none of what I admitted ruins my life this happened around 20 Years ago in the early 2000s I was still a kid around 8 or 10 when I wanted to play in the forest with my friends who were around the same age it was a very hilly forest with even some mountains one of my friends maybe 12 I think the oldest one I had said he wanted to go to the highest point that looks over a river to see the view it was getting dark so my other friends were to scared to go with so they said they were gonna leave so I went with him because I never really went to that area and was curious to see what it looked like looking back I wished I just said we should go there tommorow and left it there but I diddent wanna look like a scaredy cat infront of my older friend so I went with him it took a bit of a while and I thought it would be funny to play a prank telling him I would go pee in the forest but scare him by that time we had already arrived so I jumped out from behind a tree and yelled as loud as I could he flinched and screamed in panic and I saw him trip down the edge I panicked and ran away back home as quick as possible I stayed inside for a few days but my friends asked me one day where was our older friend and I lied and said he decided to go home after we got there and looked and I havent seen him sense I havent told anyone about this yet,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 19:40:23 UTC,0,13,0.25,,,0,0

1j657gu,Am I being used,Am I being used Do I 26F need a reality check Ive been friends with my friend Blake 26M for over a year now We have been pretty close since the beginning When we first met we bonded over our shared love for playing soccer together and music I would say we have many similarities We both enjoy adult animation like Studio Ghibli raves and playing board games Since we shared many similarities we kept in touch daily through text messages phone calls and FaceTime We had a mutual friend named Jennifer Jennifer and I were very close until I noticed that whenever we spent time together she spoke negatively about everyone around her As a result I gradually distanced myself from her Around the same time Jennifer and Blake started dating Although I wasnt close to Jennifer and didnt personally like her I wanted Blake to be happy Blake and I maintained a consistent relationship and communication We talked every day even during our lunch breaks via FaceTime However things took a turn when Jennifer informed Blake that I had feelings for him and wanted to pursue a romantic relationship with him That was not the case and I was even in a relationship at the time As a result Blake ended our communication to preserve his relationship with Jennifer We did not talk for eight months However in January he reached out to me He told me that Jennifer suddenly broke up with him in December Since then weve been hanging out again In February we attended a rave and ended up having sex that night A week later we confessed to each other that we had both harbored feelings for one another since weve first met At this point I informed him that I didnt want to be a rebound and he responded by stating that he wasnt ready for a relationship and wanted to focus on healing I accepted his decision We continued spending time together and continued having sex However I later told him that I no longer wanted to have sex with him because I was struggling to separate our friendship and romantic feelings Around the same time his exgirlfriend Jennifer filed a protective order against Blake Sidebar Personally I have had past experiences with abusive men which may have influenced my perspective However I must admit that I am not entirely aware of the details of Jennifer and Blakes relationship Given Jennifers personality I cant help but wonder if this situation is a attentionseeking ploy On the other hand I have only heard Blakes side of the story However I suggested that we establish boundaries We agreed to refrain from having sex and I told him I need a break from constant communication I also told him to fine another trusted friend to confide in about the Jennifer situation because I havent healed from my own trauma from the abusive I had endured Blake expressed his agreement to the physical boundaries and expressed he didnt want to lose me again and our friendship Since implementing these boundaries our relationship has undergone a significant change We dont talk that much anymore and when we do the protective order case seems to be the main topic of discussion Although last night I visited Blakes place to watch Star Wars During the movie he asked me to engage in a platonic cuddle We did and he said Thank you I inquired about the reason behind his gratitude He mentioned that my presence was naturing and made him feel less lonely Am I only in his life because he feels lonely,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:52:22 UTC,2,4,1.0,,,0,0

1j63j0w,UPDATE My gf beat the shit out of someone who broke into her house,I dont know if anyone remembers me but a while ago my girlfriend and I had a home invasion incident that culminated in her beating the shit out of the intruder Im tired of saying my gf so Im going to call her Diana Turns out the guy was a drug addict from the next town over He was in his 60s and he had an extensive history in jail and mental hospitals Unfortunately about two months after my post he passed away We didnt know anything about why until we got a chance to talk to his sister who insisted she didnt blame Diana and that the doctors even said that he probably didnt have much longer anyway Diana was visibly distressed during this conversation so Im not sure whether or not the sister just said that to comfort her After that Diana went on a trip to a national park during a week she knew I couldnt take off and forgot her meds She has seizures that look like mild psychosismagical thinking and ended up refusing to come home at the end of the trip She kept saying that she felt like she couldnt leave the woods because she was certain there was something she needed to learn there that she hadnt yet and when I asked her how long that might take she said some people take a lifetime I asked if she was breaking up with me and she said something about feeling like she was too attached to me her house her pets etc and that she needed to meditate on that for a while I ended up going to her temple to see if anyone was willing to give me some perspective on the situation since she was seeing things through a Buddhist lens It was the right choice A monk actually drove the six hours out to her with me to talk to her in person since she wasnt picking up calls I am so so unbelievably grateful for that monk because Diana started taking her meds again and came home soon after Ive never been religious but I started to read the Pali canon afterwards and that shit slaps Diana was already volunteering her time at the temple so now we both go together when we can All things considered since then things are back to normal and going well Were both children of divorce so even before all this we were doing prophylactic couples counseling every few months and for a while after we were going once a week Diana has started seeing a therapist on her own as well which I am so proud of her for since shes always hated the idea of individual therapy We also stepped up our home security game Diana already had plenty of cameras but now we have doorwindow alarms and motion sensors I also convinced Diana to get another dog so now we have a 75lb puppy I know a lot of people were rooting for us to get married but thats not going to happen Legal marriage isnt something that interests us and it never has But we did buy each other rings and its been a great comfort to have something physical to remind me of her on my person all the time Were also considering having a small commitment ceremony next fall lt3 Thanks again for all the feedback on my previous post I got a lot of great advice and some good criticism I showed it to Diana and she got a kick out of the comments and we had a little mutual cry over how kind a lot of you guys were I asked her if she was okay with me posting this update and she clucked at me and told me to do whatever I want online as long as Im being nice and anonymous lol So hope this qualifies,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:30:31 UTC,2521,62,0.97,,,0,0

1j7pkns,I ended my relationship due to financial infidelity,I recently broke off a 5 year relationship one year engagement because of financial infidelity Im 30 years old 20k in cc debt 100k owed in loans 25k owed in student loans and I was too embarrassed to ever tell my partner the truth Covid struggling with mental health lifestyle creep all contributed to overspending not utilizing credit cards correctly and trying to be something Im not in front of everyone in my life for the past 3 years Essentially and everyone in my circle thinks Im well off when Im actually a lying coward The guilt and anxiety of the debt got so bad that I ended my long term relationship My partner makes 45k and I make 3 times their salary so planning our wedding was nauseating as I knew there was no way we can afford it as my partner has been depending on me for financial support Little did they know we are so poor and Im in so much debt that it would crush me to continue our relationship and go through with a wedding with this gigantic mess They dont deserve it and they deserve better than me Im so embarrassed But I realize that ending the relationship and working towards paying down debt aggressively was the only way I can move forward without feeling more like a piece of shit than I already do Right now they still dont know the truth and they are probably so confused hurt and angry right now because the relationship seemingly ended out of nowhere But Im only trying to protect them and I hate myself that I let this drag on for as long as it did I only hope that the damage and hurt Im saving them from will outweigh the damage and hurt Ive already caused For now Im just relieved that the love of my life is now safe from me my lies and my debt I love you and Im sorry I wasnt able to be a better person for you Thank you for all these years,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 03:29:37 UTC,31,31,0.73,,,0,0
1j3tv4x,Coworker ranted off on me after I tried to give friendly advice for a specific kid we both work with,So I work as an RBT which in my specific job is working with kids that have autism My center is skewed toward younger kids That being said the other day one of our new hires had session with a kid for half an hour Then immediately after I had session with the kid and he had a potty accident So I grabbed his clothes and we went to the bathroom to change Later in the day when I had another kid I was in the same room as the guy who had my first kid for half an hour and shared like hey He has a newer potty protocol he isnt doing too well with I had to change him at the start of session it can be a good idea to check him more frequently thinking it was a friendly tip next time he worked with that kid again Spoiler alert he did not think so He basically ranted off on me about how he didnt think he should be getting the blame for something that he didnt even do because he had already checked him didnt specify when or how many times it sounded like it was maybe just once but with a half hour session thats not bad and it could have been from when someone else earlier had him because the other person was with him for like 4 hours He also tried to call me out on how I heard the walkie call of you asking for extra underwear for the kid and it was made a while after you started session for him And I didnt even realize this until now but I made that call 15 hours after I started session with the kid for a separate potty accident The first one I saw he was wet after standing up maybe like 12 minutes after I started session with him and we were right at his table so I just went ahead and grabbed everything I needed and took him to get changed So I didnt even make a walkie call for that first accident anyways This is also the same guy who had a rough time with another client the other day and kind of talked down to the kid for going into a behavior And it was like kind of aggressive I get working with these kids can be tough but thats just not okay If you react like that to a kid after 1 session with him you clearly do not have the capacity to be dealing with some of the high stressors this job brings,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 03:30:33 UTC,7,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j41czf,My boyfriend 26 M was cheating on me 19 F I feel Im actually losing my grip on reality,For the context our love felt more beautiful than anything Id read in books or seen in movies deeper and more real in a way thats hard to explain Part of it was because we both had real trauma growing up which made us so similar We bonded so purely and beautifully expressing our truest selves to each other It was more than I ever couldve dreamed of Even our first kiss after nearly a year of waiting was unlike anything else the world didnt just feel like it stopped it did We trembled overwhelmed and he cried like babies as he kissed me tears streaming down his face Thats how strong our connection was I never wanted long distance so he promised hed move to my city but he never did mentioning financial reasons Still he visited every few months and we always looked forward to those moments He even deactivated his socials on his own though I never had any problem or concern with them Of course not everything was perfect His one toxic trait whenever things didnt go his way or we argued hed start disrespecting and insulting me It was a dealbreaker but I still tried to be understanding He had no real human connections all his life He never even got to talk much to his family because of it being dysfunctional no close friends zero experience in relationships I told myself he just cant do any better or could be because BPD runs in his family or maybe because of the traumatic environment he grew up in But now for the last four months things were rough We even broke up for a few days ironically after our first intimate experience I felt insecure or anxious afterward he was my first boyfriend and I have a bit of sexual trauma too but he misunderstood it assuming I didnt like it or didnt want it again After that he changed became indifferent stopped reassuring me and didnt seem to care about the relationship at all or even if we break up It reinforced my fear that he didnt feel the same anymore trapping us in a cycle of blame and misunderstandings I had spent so many nights crying during that time He eventually felt sorry and we fixed things but I had already noticed a red flag he seemed to care about physical intimacy more than anything and shut down when he thought he wouldnt get it So then I started noticing more During this rough phase he reactivated his accounts made new ones and never mentioned even after we patched up and tried to hide them when asked It also started needling me for the first time that why had he never added me on his instagram and its been so long were together and I once saw a text from a coworker that felt off I couldnt ignore it all anymore So I decided to have a sudden intense conversation with him hoping his reactions would reveal the truth Then his reactions did reveal A lot Not just cheating or anything but about his whole identity I started asking he was so confident with his grand words and said that I can have his passwords and his phone because he knew Id never do that I dont believe in invading privacy in a relationship He kept manipulating me into believing there was nothing and I almost fell for it he was that good But then we stumbled upon the conversation with his coworker He initially refused to let me see it then tried to manipulate the situation When I finally read it I noticed he had tampered with it The last text had originally been 12 weeks ago but now it showed 17 weeks ago And then the part that made my heart sink them talking about how fun it would be when he will move to Germany and how she would be waiting for him That explains why he was so obsessed with moving to Germany for his remote job just to connect and work together with all his coworkers there Those texts were from months ago right after he started that job Now five months in i believe they must have something concrete going on Its pretty clear from the way he provided no further clarifications when I saw that and refused to show anything else they converse usually on discord which he didnt even show But what struck me even more than the cheating was seeing in real time how good he is at manipulation My friends warned me but I never believed it He seemed too purehearted But that day I saw it how effortlessly he lies Ive never seen anyone lie that efficiently Even when I was trying to ask he turned down all of my questions with so great replies that I started feeling like What am I even thinking He was even at that time making a grand gift for my birthday It included multiple handmade beautiful gifts including a giant scrapbook different boxes each with 50 different kinds of letters and tapes in it for different situations and a painting which he painted himself He was even better with words the things he said and the way he made me feel Its driving me insane How can someone be that person and be cheating at the same time For an example he kept repeating that he wanted to move here to strengthen our relationship that I was his life dream that after being with me he needed nothing else from life But now hes moving for her instead Its giving me a complete identity crisis If hes really this good at manipulation like I saw yesterday then none of his words were real His entire personality was fake He was standing there so willing so confident about giving me passwords or proving his loyalty But the moment I actually asked he changed completely He stalled started arguing and gaslighting clearly anything to buy time He tried deleting chats right in front of me thinking I wouldnt notice thinking he could gaslight me again Maybe he was too frantic to cover his tracks this time but it was so obvious This time he was maybe too much in a panic to realise how evident his manipulation is or to control what Im thinking And I know the coworker thing is just the one thing I happened to catch The way he deleted other chats before giving me a bit of an access it all proves there was so much more happening in those months Until now This has traumatized me to the point where I feel like nothing is real Like Ill wake up and everything around me will be gone like everything is in my head I know this is just the trauma speaking and hopefully Ill be okay soon But it has shaken me to my core If this is true then everythinghewas a lie How can someone be so convincing so manipulative For the first time in my life Ive seen deception on this scale and its terrifying In a nutshell I observed so big of a contradiction between what he is portraying so confidently and the

1j6w2w8,Ive formed a little bond with an elderly homeless man who frequents my favorite cafe,He doesnt speak English very well so communicating with him is a little challenging but hes very sweet For example before we even started really interacting he brought me napkins when I spilled something Since then we always say hello how are you etc But Ive always gotten the impression that hes selfconscious about a lot of things His scent is not ideal and as I mentioned above his English isnt great and not everybody in the world is understanding about those things Today he seemed to feel more comfortable with me than ever before He came over said hello and sat down near me for the first time I tried to use Google Translate to communicate but he needs glasses and couldnt read the text so we just tried our best It was the most complex discussion weve had so far We discussed politics This is what he has to say on the current situation Im trying my best to remember precisely what he said Politics bad bad things Politics hurt people Mexicans woman good people Social Security Medicaid I assume he was expressing worry about the continued existence of both programs I just wish I could speak Persian so we could understand each other better Its clear that his life in America hasnt gone the way he must have hoped it would when he came here and Im extra worried about him now Anyway when he needed to leave I gave him a big hug I hope our interactions make him happy,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 01:10:16 UTC,155,20,0.98,,,0,0

1j7ks9r,I knowingly manipulate my friends and feel ashamed,I dont really know how to start this or end it or what Im really trying to say so please excuse any ramblingunnecessary information Im a 22 year old female who had little to no experience having friends throughout high school In elementary school I had a fairly large circle of friends but around the time puberty hit and I became more self aware I realized that my peers found me weird I was pretty much exclusively friends with guys and I was basically a full head taller than anyone around me including my male friends I was pretty bad at actually holding a conversation I still am and my interests strayed from even my small group of friends Middle school came and that was fine I still had my group of friends But in classes where I wasnt sitting with them or we had differing lunch periods I was basically silent I was too nervous to make any attempt to talk to those around me or try out social skills High school was terrible At first I had the same lunch period as my friends but then my table slowly filled with other people until my seat was seized by other people and my friends made no attempt to save me a spot It felt like I was unable to speak anymore I had a surgery that took me out of school for 6 weeks and by the time I came back I was basically a stranger I unironically tried to live high school like a shadow keeping my mouth shut except to participate in classes that required it and to participate in group projects I didnt really consider myself as having friends until I joined this group on discord The people in it have changed and weve hopped servers a few times but the central people have stayed the same The most relevant are Fake names although Im not worried theyll find this Cas NB 22 Ian M 22 and James M 23 These people form the core of my friend group I dont really know when it started I think I was about 19 I had been feeling depressed for a few weeks and self harming was basically my exclusive way of relieving stress I was questioning my worth even as a human being fantasizing about ways to remove myself from this world I guess I started questioning if my larger friend group even wanted me around since I was so easily discarded by the one I had since childhood I didnt disclose my depression didnt mention self harm didnt share that I wanted to die I wanted them to feel bad for me so I accused them of not valuing me as a friend and then to them disappeared off the platform for two weeks The next time I checked discord I had paragraphs of apologies and worried messages basically begging me to come back It felt euphoric Even people outside the circle that I consider my closest friends were messaging me wondering when Id be back At the time I dont think I even realize I was being manipulative But I definitely got hooked on the euphoria of their reaction The feeling of being wanted Ive spent the last 3 years doing basically the same thing Not at the same level I would guilt trip them for hanging out with other friends If they said something mean to me I would sulk for days until they apologized even if it was my fault I give them the cold shoulder if they do something that displeases me even to a minor degree I push their buttons until they snap to see what they let me get away with If Im angry they get quiet and relent to anything I say or do Even then they always come back Recently Cas has been hanging out with two different groups of friends more than us They keep getting involved in new communities related to their interests and being an important part of other peoples groups The time they spend with me and the others has dwindled so significantly that Ive become a twisted amount of jealous Ive been thinking of ways to convince them to cut those people off Ways to convince them that the others arent worth their time or that theyre bad people I actively want to isolate them from the other groups so that their only choice is us I want to make them feel bad for thinking that they should devote attention to anything else I got on anti depressants a month ago and started attending therapy The combination is opening my eyes to the things that I do I am disgusted with myself I am afraid that Im going to go to far and theyre going to realize what I do and cut me off I deserve it I want to be better for them but as I am now Im probably more comparable to cancer on the group than a friend I think Im afraid that its too late I dont know I dont really want pity Im even disgusted that I feel pity for myself when I put myself in this situation Even now I dont know if I can be a better person but Im too deep into anti depressants to think that I should just remove myself from this world I just needed to tell someone,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 23:25:12 UTC,3,2,0.68,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0

1j31y7l,Grindr broke my brain and its affecting my relationship,So I 20M and my boyfriend 32M have been in a relationship for about a year Before I started dating him I was very active on Grindr and had multiple hookups Just to give you some context I really think my boyfriend is an attractive man and he is very sweet and kind to me Yes we do have a big age gap which I initially liked because Ive always been into older men but now I feel kind of insecure about it since he already works has his own apartment and can do whatever he wants while Im in college living with my parents But thats not the problem Recently Ive been feeling very turned off by him Its not that the sex isnt good but I really miss going out with different guys and I dont know why I mean I still think hes attractive but I kind of want to sleep around again even though I felt very empty when I did that before Its also been almost two months since we last had sex I study medicine and dont have much time to see himwe usually only see each other on Sundaysso its not like Id have time to go on multiple dates or anything again But I think the issue is that our relationship has reached that phase where the initial spark has faded a little Sometimes when Im at the gym I catch myself looking around at other guys My TikTok and Instagram feeds are basically just shirtless men and I still follow some of the guys I used to flirt with so their stories catch my attention At the same time while part of me wants to break up and go back to Grindr I also really like him and I know he really likes me This is my first real and longest relationship so I dont know if what Im feeling is normal And even if it is normal what should I do Id really appreciate some advice and Im happy to answer any questions you might have,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 03:51:00 UTC,0,5,0.5,,,0,0

1j789eo,I think Im falling out of love,Im so lost I know relationships are never easy but Im just starting to think that maybe we didnt meet at the right time in each others lives I have so many insecurities in regards to being included in outings Her communication is really lacking and forgoes telling me how she feels about things Our most recent disagreement has been in regards to travel we cant come to a compromise and find a balance between her travelling with her and also my friends with time for us to spend together We promised wed travel with each other after this year fell through for similar reasons Instead I had to leave it at she will go with her friends instead of me Im hurt because it feels like she doesnt want to go away with me but shes hurt because I think that Shes promised to do better and apologised so many times for not communicating I feel like our bad times are more frequent than the good I want to push through because she is so loving caring and sweet but Ive got a massive piece missing rn and if I explain this to her she breaks down and stops talking entirely Im stuck I know I am so far from a bastion of perfection in this relationship but I just cant help but be frustrated and saddened by this Today I was sick and quite feverish so I spent a while thinking back to a past relationship While Im absolutely over that girl I just couldnt help but reminisce about how that short relationship three years ago made me feel I do hold it in very high regard because I was in the wilderness prior to it alone and totally confused about my place in the world before she showed me so Im now quite nostalgic about what she was for me especially now my needs just arent being met That girl and I met in the wrong time and the wrong circumstances to last but we ended very amicably I know its horrible and so unfair for my gf as well as the previous girl to keep thinking like this I love spontaneity and random intimate things and I have told her this but never does she ask me to come over for a karaoke drive at midnight with the windows down Never does she say she wants to spend the night with me somewhere random I sometimes ask but its usually a no I feel like Im right back to where I was preprevious relationship and Im lost and so sad I want to make things better and I know constantly comparing my last relationship to my current is really poor I know Im focusing on the negative things she does I know I could be better but Im so fucking demotivated bc she just doesnt talk and we just dont go out to do things Then a rift forms and I have to be the one to try and pull it back and then shes extremely upset and scared that I might leave her or she thinks shes a bad person I cant say how I really feel because of that It takes days for our usual fun side to return and then theres a couple weeks of good Rinse and repeat Longterm relationships are loads of battles to stay in love Some are so much harder but I do love her Though is it worth losing parts of who you are when Im this age Im emotionally exhausted by the constant confusion and stress of slow and lacking communication as well as my physical needs just not being met Im 23 so Im not looking to waste her or my time any longer if this just wont work I like solving things but this feels like its becoming bigger than me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 14:02:11 UTC,2,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j54s03,My best friend tried to off herself yesterday night and I still havent cried,Basically the title heres some context I F19 and my best friend DF19 have been close friends since elementary school The summer before COVID me and my parents moved to South Florida for the start of high school and still we talked everyday We would talk on Facetime for hours fall asleep on the phone play multiplayer games and watch movies through shared play together We got through college app season together first jobs and she was the first person I came out to Ive never had a sibling but Ill always call her my sister Even though weve practically been 1000 miles apart for almost 6 years shes always my 1 call I tell her I love her everytime we hang up D is in college in New Jersey for nursing and just recently started sessions with a psychiatrist She is actively on medication for depression and sleep Shes always been a very introverted person but recently she has been telling me that shes been going to different club meetups and parties I was excited for her because this was a chance for her to make some friends and get out more We downloaded Life360 together and I told her to keep her phone charged text me when she got back and have fun Im not dumb I know kids are drinking alcohol and smoking at college events Personally Ive made a life choice to stay away from that crap but I dont hold judgment to my friends and others partaking However D has skipped the little white claws and high noons and started drinking straight vodka and tequila whenever she goes out At first when she told me I just assumed she was taking a little shot here and there and calling it a day However some of her friends who know me and our relationship have let me know via Insta that shes drinking to the point of blacking out and keeps multiple bottles of alcohol in her dorm room Ive called D and told her that shes turning into an alcoholic that she should stop going out as much and that drinking leads to more destructive behaviors She brushed me off and called me judgemental and stuck up Shes even blown off our gaming nights to go smoke with her friends Last night she texted and told me she had to call me about something serious She told me that she was drinking alone last night to the point of wanting to kill herself Her roommates had found her called the police and she was brought to a psych ward She told me that the police and her dad found out about the alcohol and that she ended up coming out to her dad unintentionally Shes also been lying to her psychiatrist and has been skipping her meds She said shes been admitted and was calling to let me know so I wouldnt worry I just told her that I love her like always and that Im glad shes still here But after getting off that phone call all I could think was I fucking told you so I told you the dangers of drinking and you ignored me Ill I feel is anger I feel angry that she would think that way about herself and want to leave me and her parents and her little sister Im angry at her on campus friends who observed this behavior and didnt stop it They let her get this bad and I wasnt there to help her It kills me that Im halfway across the country and cant afford to see her and make sure shes okay And most of all Im upset that if she ended up killing herself I wouldnt be able to do anything about it Im just her former middle school friend on FaceTime a million miles away I havent cried or felt sad and Im not sure if this is normal,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 20:10:06 UTC,1,1,0.67,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0

1j4xbz7,My wifes family are a bunch of ungrateful aoles,TLDR Wifes family felt entitled to my money to help with their mothers retirement and none of them have ever expressed one word of gratitude Not looking for advice just venting Backstory Im 65M wife is 61F Married 36 years Wife has three siblings one older brother one older sister one younger sister We were very close with all of her siblings and their spouses for many years we went on dozens of vacations with all of them always had gatherings at holidays spent weekends at each others homes etc Her brother and I were as close as we could be always hanging out playing music and having a great time I loved him more than my own brothers He began to hate me in 2020 because I had the gall to disagree with his political views When he found out I voted for Biden he screamed at me WERE FUCKING DONE at a family gathering Hes barely said two words to me since then Her older sister and her husband have had a simmering illwill towards my wife and I for many years Back in the 80s and 90s I was earning great money and we used to take them and their kids on vacations that were 99 percent paid by me because they didnt have two nickels to rub together If we bought a new piece of furniture or TV or whatever we would offer them our barely used stuff for free which they seemingly gladly accepted We did these things because we loved them Evidently they took our generosity as treating them like a charity case Now that they are both in highearning careers and dont need anything from us they basically hate us for treating them that way and now simply look down their noses sneer and snub us Her younger sister and her husband have always been good Christians but have become more fervent Evangelical Southern Baptist over the years I made the mistake of having a discussion about religious beliefs I am an atheist with the husband several years ago I know a thousand times more about his Holy Bible than he does and the discussion did not go well for him Ever since then they have done their best to ostracize us from the family at every opportunity Fast forward My wifes 80yearold father passed away a couple of years ago leaving his wife my MIL also 80 widowed They relied almost exclusively on Social Security for their retirement income After his death there was a shortfall in the MILs monthly SS income My wifes three siblings had a meeting and decided that the shortfall would be made up by the four siblings split evenly Each share came to 2500 annually to make up the MILs shortfall All three of the other couples are fairly wealthy with annual incomes in the 250350K range and all have 401k accounts over 1 million which they brag about My wife does not work I own a small business which has slowed dramatically since covid I make around 75k in a good year I would like to retire at some point so I am trying to save every dollar that I can in order to do so I will rely heavily on Social Security for retirement income The long and short of it is that I had to funnel 2500 per year into MILs retirement needs that would have otherwise gone towards my own retirement savings The way the siblings view it is your money is your wifes money therefore she needs to chip in to help her mom Fortunately two years into that arrangement the MIL sold her house she moved in with one of the siblings and netted around 200k She told my wife that with that money plus her SS income AND the 50000 she already had in savings I would no longer need to contribute to her income especially since her expenses were now basically zero So thankfully I only had to donate 5000 of my retirement money to the MIL The shitty part is that not one of the siblings or the MIL have ever expressed one word of thanks or gratitude to me even though they are well aware that the money we contributed came 100 from my earnings We still have to see them every now and then at weddings or funerals or whatever and they have never even acknowledged my contribution and sacrifice Their sense of entitlement is appalling especially in light of the fact that they all have a great disdain for me and consider me to be their asshole brotherinlaw,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 14:59:10 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j5q831,Parents called me a communist for wanting more hours on my job,I 17M am a Filipino and have been living in Canada for about 6 months now Just last month did I finally land a job at the deli in a supermarket after months of seemingly endless jobhunting However my manager at the deli is lets just say a not very nice person Shes very condescending and pretty much just has something against the students that work in the deli me included Her very obvious and not well hidden hatred towards the students finally came to a full fruition when she scheduled ALL the students for the rest of the month just less than 10 hour shifts a week In fact one of us was even getting just 4 HOURS in a week Its not like we were being greedy or anything All of us need the money One of us needs it to buy insurance for his new car and another one of us needs it to buy a new car I need it to pay the internet bills in my house help my parents with their payments and maybe soon buy a PC for myself When I saw my schedule for the rest of the month as expected I was pissed I mean seriously We havent really been slacking off either all of us even do our jobs arguably well When we went to ask our manager about it she was supposed to STILL be at work another one of the employees at the deli said she already TOOK OFF Of course we are planning to ask her about the schedules tomorrow But when I told my parents about it they were not happy They thought I was asking for too much Of course I was once again pissed For someone who works as a STUDENT and earning MINIMUM WAGE helping his OWN PARENTS PAY THEIR BILLS I think I should atleast have SOME right to extend my hours no But no of course not When I told them it should be MY RIGHT to ask my manager for those few extra hours they then went to comparing me to protesters No joke heres how the conversation went Dad What if the next time I start seeing you on the streets holding a placard What if you end up like those pink protesters back home Referring to what happened back in the Philippine presidential elections Me I dont think it will go THAT far Besides even if it does I think protesting about our hours should also be a part of our rights no Mom What are you thinking The way youre thinking now youre gonna end up a member of the NPA A Philippine communist terrorist organization Now this made me even more pissed But to my parents credit they DID try to diffuse the situation How did they do that Why by insulting the way I do my chores at home of course They said I needed to Prove myself at home first Do the chores well first Like huh I already do my jobs to the best of my ability as far as I know I dont really know what else I need to prove at home I mean I guess fair enough I suppose theres still a few things to work on I guess Just so yall know I DID consider telling them that my manager was a notsonice person But considering they already called me a communist for wanting more hours I dont even wanna KNOW what they would wanna call me if I complained about my manager Just do your job and bow down to your bosses thats their motto after all Not even joking Honestly my brainrotted side thinks this is pretty funny but it kinda made me feel bad at the time My parents would literally rather compare their own child to a bunch of terrorists rather than siding with them Amazing TLDR Manager is an asshole gave me bad hours and when I told my parents I was gonna ask for more hours they compared me to communist terrorists,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 15:03:46 UTC,19,10,0.96,,,0,0

1j3m1c0,Called out my boyfriend feel a little guilty now,So let me F19 start this off by saying my boyfriend M22 is most likely autistic and also very socially awkward He doesnt have any irl friends and pretty much only talks to me and his mum His mum is an alcoholic and a lot of the time they fight because shes drinking and he has to raise his voice and be stern to get any point across He hates that he has to and does try to talk to her normally I understand this However he does kinda do it towards me too I mentioned hes most likely autistic I am autistic so he could entirely not be I just think he is as well and this very much presents in the way he gets irritatedoverwhelmedupset when he doesnt understand something or something doesnt have a logical answer or fit the logical answer he has in his head I put up with this because I understand getting frustrated when things arent how they should be but last night I really just couldnt handle it We got into a stupid disagreement over a movie he wanted to show me because he likes the perspective its shot in He asked if I knew what he meant and I said yes I just couldnt articulate it out loud I do have a problem with that where I can know the answer to something but the more someone prods at me to say it it ends up just completely leaving my mind and it makes me feel stupid He asked if I just said that because I didnt know but didnt want to sound dumb and i explained the above point and told him I learned perspectives in drama class Now this is not the first time Ive mentioned to him that I had to learn basic cinematography in two of the 4 years I took drama in high school but he either forgot or just got too in his head where he was making me seem stupid and he kept saying things along the lines of drama is acting Cinematography is filming Theyre different I even tried to remind him multiple times about the fact I needed to know it for class but I kept getting interrupted which annoyed me since he gets so aggravated if anyone interrupts him and says interruptions only lead to arguments until he finally just pretty much said the point I had been saying and ended it with him yet again reminding me drama isnt cinematography and asking if I saw why he was getting misled I ended up saying he needed to stop calling me stupid which at first he tried to defend because hes never outright called me stupid which is true just the way he treats me occasionally makes me feel lesser and he ended up getting upset because his defence turned into him saying he didnt get why people always made him feel like an asshole when thats just how he is and I told him this might just be the way he talks but its disrespectful and thats why he feels that way I also dont really get this because he always says hes changing but nobody else is and while its true hes growing as a person losing weight got a job gaining confidence and setting goals his behaviour does need work and he cant expect everyone else including me to immediately change when he doesnt like certain things but then use the excuse of thats just how he is We ended up not talking for the rest of the night and while I do feel justified in what Ive said I do still feel guilty for making him upset I was kinda hoping he had work today so he wouldnt be in a bad mood until I say something he really likes his job and also doesnt have a specific schedule he kinda just goes as hes needed but as guilty as I feel I dont want to apologize for anything,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 21:25:52 UTC,0,2,0.4,,,0,0

1j6wish,Im done holding on to the scraps of relationship my father and I have left,Very long and emotional story short or as short as I can get it gt013 I grew up a daddys girl I love my father with my whole heart and cherish his presence I am inherently anxious and suffer from undiagnosed AUDHD anxiety disorder and depression but it doesnt affect me as much because my family is loving and kind gt gt13 My mother and I caught my father cheating on her He told us he stopped and that he was sorry gt gt1315 I didnt talk to my father directly as I felt betrayed and hurt This was made worse when my mother kept trying to stand up for him I later learnt she was trying to stop the mistress from contacting my father so that she and him could work on their relationship gt14 My mother is diagnosed with cancer but they cant tell what kind or how far along it is My father grows even more distant from us and the arguments increase gt1516 My mother is hospitalized and my father starts talking to this woman on his phone I start to feel more anxious My mother advocates for my father but it just makes me more mad and hurt They argue more now and I find myself becoming emotionally distant from my father gtLate 16 My mother dies and I shut down as well as shut myself off from my family friends and peers I am angry at my father as he does not seem as affected and was also the cause of my mothers stress before she died My older brother tries to soothe me and we traumabond My father tries to relate to me as his mother died a few months before mine but he doesnt understand that it isnt the same gtMy father dates moves in and then marries a woman I have never met in less than 8 months His friends my trusted adults all support him as well as his family and peers I am hurt but I pass it off as him just grieving differently I was sure it was a phase and that they would break updivorce soon enough I later find out its the same woman he cheated on my mother with lied to us about and then continued to talk to while my mother was battling cancer I confront him about this and he says that he thought I knew who she was despite us never being formally introduced to her To this day I know next to nothing about her Only her first name where her mother lives and the name of one of her children gtFathers wife is emotionally and verbally abusive towards me and my brother but I being the younger and more emotional one take it harder gtShe tells me that Im killing my father by arguing with him and that he will end up dead just like my mother I yell back at her to defend my father as I take it very seriously when someone wishes death upon another even indirectly but my father takes her side and berates me for defending him gtHe does a myriad of other things threatening to sell off my cats locking them outside and causing one to die from the cold as punishment for me not agreeing with him as well as pretending not to hear when his wife flat out threatens to kill me He was right next to her when she said it mind you gtUnder the advice of my older cousin from my moms side I report the wife to the CPS but he denies hearing her threaten me to the social workers which makes me look like an emotional teenage girl We get placed into family therapy but the therapist is borderline sexist and just wants us to be a family unit regardless of the womans blatant disregard for my safety gtI ask my father why hes choosing his wifes needs over the safety of his biological children whom he claims to adore and he simply says that the Bible says wife before children Id argue that doesnt apply to wife that you cheated on your childrens mother with and who threatens you children but okay dad gtI sleep with a knife under my pillow just in case she tries to harm me My anxiety and depression levels are through the roof gt17 19 I cant remember much from these years but it mostly involves me trying to bond with my father as hes the last living parent I have I go through 3 relationships and have no one to talk to or seek comfort from when it goes downhill My father thinks were getting better because of him and not because of the gigantic effort and emotional stuffingdown Im doing as even being near his wife makes me anxious to the point of insomnia As angry as I was before I still love my father and want him in my life I tell him that he can pick any other wife just not her and I would be genuinely happy with that He doesnt care and only treats me well when shes not there away on vacation or at her mothers house When she is around though he is more distant and visibly more tense gt20 My father announced that he wants to split our house physically half of it is to go to me and my brother as it was built when my mother was alive and she paid for and designed it I tell him that I dont want him to do it as it will just drive us further apart but his reasoning revolves around his wife and her comfort My brother and I have long assumed that his wife is just with him to benefit from his money she doesnt treat him nicely but he doesnt seem to notice I know its childish and naïve but I didnt want him to distance himself from me even though he has hurt me so much for so long I still cry Ive actually just stopped crying as Im typing this whenever I think about how far weve already drifted apart Our relationship went from one of trust smiles secret fastfood lunch breaks and long hugs to me not even being able to tell him about the girl that broke my heart and how I would love to have one genuine dadhug from him so that he can tell me its alright I would love to have him at my wedding one day but I dont know if that will ever happen I dont want to grow up not in a world where he dies alone and regretful but it seems that thats the only way for me to not end up living my entire life clinging to his leg begging him to look back and maybe love me the way he used to So Im done Im done wanting his love and Im done waiting on him to realise he was wrong and that I still needed him Im going to be something and Im going to love someone and let them love me in return I deserve better TLDR My father has hurt me with his actions and his words for too long Im going to learn how to live without him no matter how much it will hurt to let him go,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 01:33:45 UTC,31,5,0.92,,CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCEDEATH,0,0

1j6cvlf,Ive been living with my abuser and my mothers rapist since 2012 and her 7 siblings protected him,Sorry in advance for this being DENSE with context and a little bit nonsequential at the end but its necessary to me understand the gravity of this I think My mother was raped by my grandfather when she was 26 He was 60 but strong My brother and I were 5 and 8 at the time and we were in the house when it happened I vaguely remember the screaming and having to be temporarily resituated at a friends house until my mom found out where to go Two of my uncles showed up one kept grandpa restrained while the other spoke to the police I think one of them threatened to kill him or something but regardless he never saw the inside of a cell for it I still dont know why more on that later He has ZERO criminal record except for vehicular manslaughter the young womans underwear was found in a nearby field and she knew our family for which he spent some time in a mental hospital My mother told me he was observed to have had antisocial personality disorder but Im not sure how she would know that because he would never tell her something like that This is a man that says shit like Ive never been depressed in my life I dont even know what that is Anyway we moved somewhere so he couldnt find us Problem there is Grandpa had a stalking habit so he found us after few months You have to understand my brother and I were in no position to understand what happened or at least that is reasonable enough of an assumption that mom didnt tell us what happened All I knew was Grandpa wasnt around anymore and that I missed him despite abuse of my brother and I up to this point which I will get to Once he found us he would spoil my brother and I to gain favor and make it harder for my mom to keep him out of our lives a pattern that would persist indefinitely My mom saved up money during Move1 and we relocated to an aunts house She was a close friend of my mothers that was stalked by my grandfather prior to all of this The aunt was also a pedophile I was too young to understand that the teenagers she was messing around with were not adults My mom was too traumatized to worry about anything other than feeding us loving us and killing the pain on her downtime with pills and partying She balanced it well and her recreational activities never interfered with us beyond waking us up in the middle of the night for a taco bell run so we wouldnt be left alone in the house Somewhere in there he found us again because of the stalking bit During this time he sank his claws deeper into my big brother and I Christmases and birthdays were always huge to us both because even though we were poor we were spoiled senseless by grandpa AND by my mothers dogged determination to outshine his efforts She had to spend every one of those Christmases and birthdays watching us thank and hug him in front of her telling him we loved him After a few years of living in that creepy shithole my mom made enough to move again She even wrangled us a stepdad for security SPOILER he loved crack and bullying us However he was young 27 and deeply troubled himself He actually kind of kept grandpa at bay for a minute but we still LOVED grandpa so much Our fathers never met us between my brother and I so there was a sort of role that needed fulfilling which was another reason she was scared to tell us what happened During this time my grandfather was abusing me by interrogating me about whether or not I was gay and forcing me in front of the mirror to pop my acne until I bled and the acne became infected My pockmarks are much worse than they need to be and he reinforced a lifelong belief in my hideousness and I was made to go to therapy at the age of 10 to address my latent homosexual tendencies What prompted his obsession I do not know I think he was scarred from when I wanted to be a girl for Halloween 3 years in a row from ages 3 to 6 A few years after Move3 came Move4 but it at this point my mom considered losing contact with him to be futile She would move further and further each time and he would constantly show up unannounced At this point Im in middle school brother in high school During this time my 15 year old brother kicked my stepfather out so my grandfather was around much more often so he could pressure me intensely to be confirmed Catholic our family is heavily Irish Catholic This would eventually cause me to have a psychotic break later at 15 where I had religious delusions for a whole year Around the time I finished high school my mom met my now stepmother and we moved 100 miles away Which was perfect considering grandpa would have an accident that made it harder for him to want to drive on the highway ever again The last time he saw my mothers face was at her wedding 15 years ago I would say his presence tarnished it but it was full of drag queens and LGBTQ folks so I like to think it was a difficult day for him the man is a vicious bigot This is around when mom tells me about how he raped her when she was 26 Im 19 at this point and I have been conditioned to worship my grandfather He was my father for all intents and purposes more than any other man in my life I was resistant and resentful I was stupid I buried what my mother told me and it created a rift between us that is since mended but it is one of my deepest regrets My absolute deepest regret is moving in with him Move5 left me in a rural town with only a grocery store to work down the street and I had no car or license TIP FOR YOUR KIDS Do not let them get away with thinking they are better than working their way out of a situation or that they wont be grateful to themselves for it Anyway I wanted to go to college and grandpa lived in Baltimore He offered to let me stay and I told my mother I loved her but I couldnt get stuck in that town I wasnt stuck I was undisciplined and ignorant I will never forget my mothers crying face as I left in his car So I guess that is the last time he saw her From 2012 onward I was living in Baltimore going to school working partying and going on trips with friends I was having a merry fucking time and rent free to boot undisciplined Somewhere in the first 2 years I did mushrooms and I gained a bonedeep certainty of how awfully I had betrayed my mother I called her and apologized for everything begged for her forgiveness I didnt have to because she understood Then she told me EVERYTHING EVERYTHING Not just about her rape but the vicious abuse of her 6 other siblings the rape and physical assault of my grandmother and the manslaughter Out of her 7 siblings 2 brothers defended her after the rape initially One said that grandpa was dead to him but reconnected only 3 years later The other just plain acted like it didnt happen even though he was the one keeping grandpa at bay while we left the house When my mom told her sisters 2 were silent one acknowledged that my mother was traumatized and the one I hate the most said He must have been so lonely The remaining 2 brothers kissed his feet like they always have without skipping a beat They still do My grandfather viciously beat every single one of his children He beat and raped my grandmother and put a gun to her head with his foot on her neck An uncle tried to defend my grandmother with a bat grandpa caught it midswing and completely blackened my uncles torso He coerced a neighbors wife to crawl across the floor to him to ask for a kiss in front of the neighborhood and his own wife and children at a party He hit me and my brother for as long as he and I were too young to defend ourselves at least until we acted like he wanted He beat me for bleeding on the floor when I cut myself by mistake at age 3 I was hit and screamed at if I cried At age 5 I watched him choke my then 8 brother like it was Bart and Homer for correcting his math He stalked my mothers friends and called them in the middle of the night to say disgusting shit He then raped my mother for god knows fucking what when I was 5 I have no idea what else hes done to my aunts and uncles Im suspicious that he did something to me too because I was absurdly sexually obsessive when I was 4 and 5 By obsessive I mean I cornered a girl when I was in kindergarten and tried to rip off her clothes while screaming Youre mine Where did those instincts come from How often do 5 year olds do that So I was drinking pretty heavily after what my mom told me enough to keep me from being able to move out from my moms rapists house and then I met my current partner in 2018 Like everyone I was with up til that point I begged her not to be friendly with him and I told her why She has some sort of hyperaltruistic reflex plus her grandfather treats her like shit so she just made my grandpa her grandpa After I begged her not to get close to him He then exposed himself to her multiple times and whispered something disgusting into her ear that to this day she will not repeat I know it wasnt age because when I confronted him on this he never did it again Between 2018 and 2023 I was basically killing myself with booze about this and a lot of things 5 hospitalizations in 2023 My mom confronted the one that said he must be so lonely and she said none of those things happened My grandmother can corroborate however and has Im posting this one because apart from my partner I have no one to talk to about it Im not looking for moral validation I know how badly I hurt my mother and what it says about me Grandpa is 91 now and I think its fair to say most of who he was is gone I dont forgive I see it as irrelevant to who is now Hes a scared husk thats been glued to a chair since 2008 I tried so hard to be a changed person in sobriety got into the habit of hugging him and telling him I love him but by the time I realized it makes me feel slimy I couldnt afford to stop My mom knows this and she is according to her at greater peace with everything than me My present disquiet comes from the constant thoughts like WHAT KIND OF BROTHERS AND SISTERS DONT DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO PROTECT THEIR SISTER There were 7 of them and they left us for the wolf There were 7 of them that never EVER let grandpop babysit their kids WHY HUH WHY CAN HE COME AROUND US AND NOT YOURS Why are we the black sheep Why did no one believe my mother after what theyve been through I have an uncle that still tells me he has always loved me hes my godfather and the sensible one and he has the fucking BALLS to ask me why mom doesnt talk to him anymore Last year every single one of my mothers siblings gathered to celebrate his 90th birthday Two of my mothers sisters are sitting on his lap in a photo they took together The one that said he must have been so lonely is so pleased with herself in the photo Recently she told me I was the favorite grandchild of his 9000 grandchildren and she looked like shes hated me for it for a while I wasnt the favorite I was a pressure point for a predator to make sure my mother could never get away None of these people have any idea that I know Neither does grandpa Neither do their children They just think Im a lazy alcoholic part true Been thinking about writing a book But also I just needed this If anyone can relate or just have some insight as to how in the fuck 7 siblings side with the incestuous predator and abuser Whats worse is how Ive found this to be far less unique than I thought I know more people than I would like that have relevant experience with men growing families as punching bags and sex objects Every kid I see makes me worry for them and I have a hard time seeing a father with their children and not have an immediate fear for the kids TLDR Seriously Just kidding Grandpa raped my mom and stalked her my brother and I through life and I eventually ended up marooning myself in the same basement where he did all of the worst things you can do to a person while his children treat my mom with denial and even resentment PS My mother is the strongest and happiest shes ever been and I love her and my stepmother so much She has chronic illness and PTSD but she is creating all the time and excelling at her work Ive never been more proud of her My brother is the same as hes always been stoic and quiet about all of it in a way that scares me PPS My aunts and uncles have been snooping while Im at work and leaving obvious signs they were in my fucking bedroom Where I fucking sleep If you are reading this good You should be fucking ashamed of yourself You were all in your fucking thirties and were successful when you shielded her attacker You had the resources to help your sister and put the man away You chose her rapist over her Youre not the

calls you by your first name like that To the other no wonder your daughter doesnt call you at all For all of you it is not close enough to karma that you have to literally wipe that mans ass now You

1j4yx7b,The cp case against my ex husband has been closed and I dont know how to feel about it,In the beginning of the year my 27f ex husband 27m came to me after not talking for a year since the divorce finalized to confess to me of having sexual fantasies about children and looking at cp while we were together I took this information to the police and have been working with an investigator since then and made a controlled call to him with the investigator where he confessed only to looking at animated cp because the real stuff is really hard to find Today I was told that they spoke with him and looked at his devices and havent found any evidence and are closing the case And its a relief that to the best of my knowledge he didnt hurt any children or consume any content that hurt actual children But I was also warming up to the idea that he would face some kind of consequences for his actions Because he also emotionally manipulated and raped me throughout our entire marriage I know that I could still try to press charges for what he did to me but I dont really have any proof except for my own words And I want to be able to just move on and enjoy my life now that Im free from him But he has a new girlfriend who is significantly younger and reminds me of me when I was young and fell for his bullshit It feels so wrong that he can just do all of this and put me through so much and have nothing happen I hope hes telling the truth about getting help and wanting to change but I also cant help but believe that every word that comes out of his mouth is a lie even when he believes its the truth But Ive done what I can it cant be my responsibility anymore,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 16:07:52 UTC,32,10,0.83,,,0,0

1j4ipqp,Its a real story I have sleep paralysis and it getsnsfw,Im not sure where to post this but I really need advice thats why I made an account just fot this because Im starting to question my sanity I recently started living alone in my first apartment Im extremely careful I always lock the doors and windows at night and I dont have any pets I used to have occasional bouts of sleep paralysis during a stressful phase but they were relatively harmless dark figures just staring at me hearing weird noises etc But since Ive lived here its different Now I wake up several times a week in the middle of the night completely paralyzed I can only move my eyes hear and feel And every time I see this big dark shadowy figure in my room But it doesnt just stand in the corner It slowly comes towards me It pulls my blanket away then my pants and then it starts touching me in a way that feels far too real It starts touching me with its mouth It licks me sucks me as if it is completely obsessed with my vagina And the most disturbing thing is I feel EVERYTHING Every detail Much more intensely than any real human contact I have ever had It brings me to orgasm over and over until the sensations are so overwhelming that I pass out And when I wake up in the morning my blanket is actually at the foot of the bed or on the floor my pants exactly where it threw them For the ones who wants to imagine it the figure is black shadowy with glowing white eyes but sometimes they look red and it is very large It has a somewhat human shape but also somehow not There is a dark aura around it like black smoke The hands are very large and the fingers are extremely long The only thing I remember is that in one of my earlier sleep paralyses years ago I saw these hands or very similar looking hands trying to grab me But I was able to free myself from the paralysis in time bec my sister suddenly came in my room and turned the lights on Its mouth is not visible but when it begins with the act I can make out the outline of the mouth and it has a very long tongue You can then imagine where the tongue goes It doesnt say anything or even talk to me I know it might feel like a particularly realistic sleep paralysis but how can things be moving in my room Im scared It happens almost every night and although it doesnt hurt the thought that it might do more at some point scares me What if its not just a hallucination And before anyone asks No Im not desperate or lonely Im single right now but Im happy with it I dont miss anyone feel untouched or crave closeness Ive had relationships in the past but right now Im enjoying my own life so I understand even less why this is happening But my biggest concern is that deep down Im starting to enjoy it There are moments when I catch myself thinking Dont stop Keep going And that terrifies me even more I have a disturbing theory What if it isnt just a sleep paralysis I know its not a dream bec Im fully awake Im just unable to move or make a sound What if it is some kind of entity or demon that possessed me I know how crazy this sounds but if you were in my shoes would you really rule it out I feel like I cant talk to anyone about this Its so humiliating and the worst part is what if it keeps coming to me every night until the day I die bec I dont do anything about it Im desperate and conflicted because as terrifying as it is it also feels good And Im starting to crave it I dont think a real man could ever satisfy me again like this Ive tried to relax before sleep and I dont have any stress in life at the moment but it still visits me almost every night And like i said Im extremely embarrassed to talk to other people in real life because Ive started to enjoy it and I dont have any money for fancy therapies What if this continues for years I feel everything and when I wake up in the morning my intimate area feels a bit numb and tingly as if someone had been fiddling with it so its not fake its really happening to me I almost always pass out from all the orgasms Being satisfied so intensely every night can be dangerous right Idk Have any of you ever experienced something like this Am I just crazy or is something going on here that I cant explain,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 00:30:48 UTC,37,89,0.62,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0
1j42ewg,It feels like I was SAd even though it probably wasnt sa,The whole thing happened over 10 years ago and I had actually repressed the situation pretty well until my ex messaged me again recently Now I think about it every day and have panic attacks because of it Back then we werent together yet but he knew that I was in love with him One evening we were at his best friends place and the two of them were smoking a bong They wanted me to smoke as well I asked what it was and they said weed Being stupid I took a hit but whatever it was it definitely wasnt weed At first I got extremely dizzy then I couldnt move anymore and I started panicking inside because I couldnt speak or even breathe After about 10 minutes his best friend told him to check if I was still breathing which he did When he confirmed that I was still breathing the other guy left the room to go to sleep Thats when my ex started undressing me and then had sex with me It must have lasted for several hours and towards the end I was somewhat conscious again and could have said something But I didntI just couldnt At some point he stopped and I went home I had never felt as horrible lying in my own bed as I did after that night Afterward I desperately wanted to be with himprobably because I thought it would somehow undo what had happened About a year later we actually got together But maybe Im overinterpreting the situation After all he knew I loved him so maybe he thought I wanted it too Ill probably talk to my therapist about it but Im afraid Im making it into something bigger than it actually was Besides it was my fault too I dont know I just wanted to get it off my chest,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 12:55:19 UTC,0,4,0.25,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0
1j5l5t1,My Mom hates me,Sorry for the bad writing i attempted to post it in an german subreddit first but they ave a limit of 3k letters max and also dont allow blocktext wich is what this would have turned into if i tried to stay within said margin plus deleting a paragraph So i had to use Google translate Sorry I 25f always have disputes with my 59f mother Whenever I dont do something the same as she wants she gets pretty acidic and even if I do it the same way as she wants she somehow always has something to complain about Example of today Because of the beautiful weather I should hang my duvet out of my window but the problem is that the winter garden roof is right in front of my window and I cant hang it out because it is a more or less flat level So I decided to hang the blanket over the edge of the winter garden roof mind you at one point that was quite clean in my opinion at least And if I had hung the blanket directly out of the window she would have been dirty or even dirty anyway I also had planned and also discussed with my mother that I would wash the blanket this weekend anyway Nevertheless she then sniffed me about half an hour later and she also found it very shit that I sucked at the same time as I was sucking We have a solar system that produces a very nice amount of electricity in very sunny weather and I thought that it would already be finished with sucking because I hadnt heard her vacuum cleaner anymore and then started sucking my room However she still has a problem with it because she apparently continued to suck again after a moment which I couldnt hear because of my loud sucker and also ran the washing machine which I didnt know anything about because I couldnt see or hear her from my room on the first floor and that I was not explicitly told that it would be hired In addition she also complained because I took a break when sucking I have a cold and dont have enough endurance to create everything at once My room consists of two adjacent rooms of which I usually only do one because I am more in this but this time I wanted to do both and only took a break in between After I had explained Mama that she told me that I always had an excuse I then started crying no idea why sometimes happens during such confrontations and Mama asked in a rather aggressive tone why I would cry now even though there is no reason for it and that we would only have a reasonable discussion Incidentally the howling is nothing that I have an influence I dont because it is to cry afterwards or something I have zero control about whether or when this happens In the surplus she also titled such moments as psycho shit and attempted manipulation Not today but in other similar situation Incidentally she mostly teemers my attempts to explain and or counter arguments or ignores them entirely I often have the feeling of being shouted at in these moments even though she only talks to me very quietly her words I dont even want to do something in the household anymore because it is almost always wrong or not right And almost every interaction with her consists that she tells me something what to do or indicate that something is wrongdirty or somehow not correct That would be okay but everything is just too much I dont want to come down to her or talk to her When I come home and your car is not there Im already relieved Is probably not your fault Im probably just over sensitive or overreact or something Also i havent stopped crying the whole time while writingtranslating this and my mom came in and asked me in a really passive aggressive tone what was up and why i am still crying I told her to leave and she left Idk what to do I feel like she truly hates me and idk why she does all of this like that Maybe it makes her happy When asked she always says that she doesnt but Idk if i can believe that,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 11:14:08 UTC,1,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j5wpag,i told my friend that she needs to stop victimizing herself and i dont really feel that bad about it,keeping events and names vague on purpose i have a very close friend A who i love very dearly but shes been in bind after bind her family had disowned her and she has been in like 5 horrible relationships in the past two years and both the places she has worked at in the past two years have gone out of business none of this stuff is her fault but i think it puts her in a shitty place where she feels justified in her own mind to just not hang out with friends or justified to be rude to friends in a way i love hanging out with A and i love just sitting around and chatting and watching tv with her while i do art and such like that but i also love getting out of the house on occasion if im invited for example As roommate B invited Bs GF me A and another friend out to go get food we got all ready and then A was like i actually dont have alot of money so im gonna sit this one out and we were all super sad and then we all look in our wallets and agree we could chip in a few bucks each to cover As meal because shes been in hard times so much and we go tell her and shes like no i dont want to so we go out to eat without her and have a great time and come back and even bring her food back from the restaurant and shes all angry and depressed and sad she didnt get to go Two weeks ago B took a bus to stay in her GFs dorm for a few days and when she came back i picked her up from the bus stop we got some fast food even got some for A and then came back home and me and B were talking and being silly when A goes i hate hearing you talk and have fun like that when you got to go do something fun while i had to work for all those days with no break and then A goes back to her room I went to class and didnt hear anything for a few days but i know that A and B argued then some friends from me and As highschool that we still regularly talk to texted me and said theyre gonna do something fun over this coming weekend and i was like hell yeah i love hanging out with my friends and they told me to ask A if she wants to join in and i call up A and ask her and she goes idk i dont have my work schedule yet and i said ok could u text ur boss and ask for the day off we really all want to hang out with you and she says ill see weekends coming around and i just texted A to ask if shes gonna hang out with us and she goes no i have work i say oh im sad you couldnt get work off and she goes oh i didnt really try they highschool friends didnt directly ask me so i figured i wasnt invited like girl i literally asked you because they wanted you there and i showed her the texts from our friends asking if A is coming because theyre so excited to see her both friends live a ways away so we dont see each other often and one of the friends hasnt seen A for about 4 years due to moving states and then coming back and we were all excited and waiting for her to join us but i go ok i wish u could have joined us maybe we can pick u up after u finish working and hang out and she just goes no i think your all going to have fun without me and i kinda was a bit pissed w her so i said she should have take the day off when i asked a while ago and shes just like oh i could have but i didnt girl this is around when i told her she needs to stop victimizing herself i hung out with her roommate later that day and we discussed how shes kinda been and B said she would talk to A about how she needs to stop isolating herself I also ended up inviting B to hang out with us over the weekend instead as the highschool friends have all met B in passing and like hanging out with her ik this is gonna piss off A a bit but like A could have also hung out with us and then A is gonna be mad and not want to hear about what weve all done for a while im just so tired of her self deprecating behavior where she always HAS to be the victim who just CANT hang out or CANT do anything fun and all that bull TLDR exactly what the title says i told my friend that she needs to stop victimizing herself and i dont really feel that bad about it thats the end,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 18:53:01 UTC,2,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j32iaa,My dads girlfriend tried to get me to forge documents,My mom and dad have been separated since I was 13 and it was because of my dads abuse and neglect He has brain damage from a bad car accident and has poor impulse control as a result Despite this Ive tried my best to be on good terms as an adult but his psycho girlfriend is too much to deal with Her name is Cherry He started dating Cherry about 3 years ago Shes had three kids and lost them all to the system because shes too crazy to care for them bipolar and sometimes else shes estranged from all of them important notes for later she is loud rude quick to anger and prone to simple and complex delusions when something doesnt go her way Im positive the only reason my dad is still with her especially after she killed his cat supposed by accident is because she came into a lot of settlement money from hernia mesh complication Since then theyve been living it up together About a week before Christmas Cherrys oldest son got hit on a moped on the highway by a big truck He felt into a coma and is brain dead His long term girlfriend and mother of his son was given power of attorney aa per his medical wishes Now Cherry lost custody of him when he was just 9 years old and havent spoken to her in over 5 years She had never met her grandson or his girlfriend until she came to the hospital Cherry immediate assumed she was in control over his medical decisions and requested the plug be pulled and openly discussed lawsuits and burials in front of his girlfriend and son Girlfriend told her to stop and said she didnt have the right and before long Cherry is banned from seeing him and banned from the hospital as a guest forever In Cherrys mind and version of events his girlfriends grandfather forged her sons name on the medical records declaring her to make decisions on his behalf in case of coma the reasoning is her grandfather works for the county court as a traffic ticket clerk and her evidence is I know my son Shes repeatedly asked my opinion on the matter because I work in critical care nursing and Ive explained it multiple times as simply as I can but she refuses to believe that a common law partner with a child of 10 years would be granted power of attorney over an estranged parent who lost custody for mental health and sex work and drug convictions This leads me to the trap I feel in Theyve been bugging me about meeting for lunch for weeks to discuss something and every time Id ask what for they say we need to talk in person I was going to be in town that way last Saturday so I agreed and figured a free meal and theyd stop bugging me The day before my dad ask me to bring my notary stamp Im a notary good side gig and I press and they say we need you to look over some papers I get suspicious and stiff out what theyre up to I call them out of it and they insist that it isnt related to it I get there we order our food and they pull out power of attorney forms They try to say that the court told them they just had to fill these out get them notarized and Cherry would get power of attorney over her son I explained these forms required her son to sign them and says it doesnt because hes in a coma I explained this was forgery and her rebuttal was well that bitch forged her name to take my son and I had to calmly explain that even if it did happen nothing would change without a lawyer and they dont take this stuff lightly Cherry has a melt down and accuses me of plotting against her and my dad had to get her to stop because at this point she causing scene yelling slamming her hands on the table I get up and leave and my dad tried to call my four times before he got the message Today he texted me saying why couldnt you just do it if youre right they wont accept the form noways like he didnt ask me to commit a crime for his psycho girlfriend They deserve each other and feel horrible for her children ever having to deal with crazy crack head One day Ill never have to deal with her or my dad and Ill celibate with KFCs finest to commemorate the time they tried to bribe me with a 5 fill up to commit forgery to get control over a person in a coma,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 04:19:06 UTC,27,4,0.85,,,0,0

1j7l8u4,One choice can blow up your life,I 27f got engaged 6 months ago to my now ex fiancé lets call him Ross 30m However that month was hell with my grandma who I was extremely close to dying I wasnt dealing with it I was just ignoring the pain and saying I was fine Well about 3 weeks after we got engaged and my grandma dying I had drinks with a friend 27f What started off as just a drink or two quickly turned to shots and not remembering even leaving the lounge Now most of this is from what I have been told by the friend her husband and my ex fiancé Friends husband lets call him Craig had to come and pick us up and took us back to their place My fiancé had his son and we lived about a hour away from the friends and where we got drinks so he was not able to come get me The friend and I apparently crashed in their bed with Craig having to wake me up when Ross called Now this is where stories have changed At first Ross and I were told that my friend and Craig started doing stuff in the same bed I was in and I woke up and joined in Whereas recently they have started to say I started everything The only memory that I have during any of this is thinking what the fuck am I doing and I then proceeded to run out of the room According to my ex fiancé I then called him and was trying to seduce him over the phone This is when I apparently told him what happened and he said I sounded excited My next memory is being on the phone with him and him yelling at me that I had called him just to tell him I cheated on him We apparently talked a little longer and then hung up And that night is the night my life fell apart Since that night we have tried to make it work but as you can tell he is now my ex fiancé He continues to holds resentment towards me and the friends on what happened I would also like to say that they are no longer friends either after that and the friend texting me telling me that she was the martyr in my relationship Well now that everything has ended and stuff has come to light I am struggling Craig was sober through the whole night and the friend while originally saying she didnt remember anything is now saying that she remembers all of it I am the only one that doesnt remember leaving the lounge or anything at their house besides that one thought and the one line from the phone call I am feeling very used and taken advantage of because sober or even buzzed I would have never hooked up with anyone but my fiancé Together we have experimented but it was together I am so unsure of how to feel about that night Now I am not looking for advice sympathy or really anything I just thought it might help if I write this all down And maybe someone can learn from my story that just because you think you can trust people to protect you that may not be the case and one night can take the life your building away If there are questions Ill do my best to answer them in the comments Thanks for reading,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 23:47:34 UTC,4,2,0.62,,,0,0

1j3tjoq,Found a girl ODing and saved her life Found out more about the girl and what happened to her later,This is a bit long but its also how it happened Sunday afternoon my wife daughter daughtersfriend the dog and myself went to the river to play and collect some pretty rocks since it was so nice outside We live within walking distance and on the way back we were about to leave the levee along our normally used path when both my wife and I spotted something on the levee about 50 feet away we couldnt tell what it was I asked my wife to take the dogs leash so I could go check and to please take the girl a little way further away while I go make sure its just garbage As I got closer and saw it was a person I quickly told my wife and asked her to call 911 I went over to the person and found out it was a young looking girl and she was still breathing I ran back to my wife who was on the phone with emergency services and relayed the info that it was a young female still breathing not conscious I then ran back to the girl and tried loudly talkingshouting at her to see if I could get some reaction but I was very hesitant to touch her since I could see she was actively breathing Her phone which had been in her open hand the entire time began to make ringing noises and I tried to answer it but it was some kind of Instagram thing and not an actual call I dunno I set her phone back into her hand and about 30 seconds later a police officer showed up I waved at the officer to get his attention to the exact location He quickly ran up to me and gave her a very brief checkout before administering a dose of narcan He waited a few seconds and began to shake her and shouting a bit to get her awake which resulted in a moan and partial roll from her He kept trying to get her awake for maybe another 30 seconds and the ambulance showed up they almost drove by but saw me waving at them and managed to just barely make the turn 3 EMTs hurried up to us and checked her vitals and pupils and in the next 90 seconds they had her standing and eyes open I figured the was nothing else they needed me for I thanked them and quickly got out of the way A side note Im very impressed with the reaction time of both the police and the ambulance they were both on site with within 5 minutes of my wife calling them The next day at work I mentioned this to a coworker whose father I know owns the trailer part right next to where I found the girl My coworker found out more about what happened and I hate it Apparently the girl had gotten some weed from her cousin which had been lacedcontaminated with fentanyl It also sounds like her cousin was with her and left her laying there when she collapsed Also found out she had to be administered 2 more doses of narcan while in the ambulance and that she was only 13 years old Also learned I sort of know her I actually know her parents as I worked with them both about 10 years ago I remember seeing her as a small 23 year old kid havent seen her since though so I obviously didnt recognize her Im glad it was my family who found her and she will be ok someone could have easily drug her away down into the trees and she would have never been seen or heard again Im terrified for my daughter who is about half this girls age I cant believe how close I ended up being to her family I dunno how to end this but I needed to share the story Teach your kids how to be smart and responsible you wont always be there to tell them yourself And always wash your hands after touching random objects I vigorously washed my hands when I got home since I touched her phone which could have been contaminated with fentanyl for all I knew,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 03:13:53 UTC,1516,45,0.98,,,0,0

1j7ks9r,I knowingly manipulate my friends and feel ashamed,I dont really know how to start this or end it or what Im really trying to say so please excuse any ramblingunnecessary information Im a 22 year old female who had little to no experience having friends throughout high school In elementary school I had a fairly large circle of friends but around the time puberty hit and I became more self aware I realized that my peers found me weird I was pretty much exclusively friends with guys and I was basically a full head taller than anyone around me including my male friends I was pretty bad at actually holding a conversation I still am and my interests strayed from even my small group of friends Middle school came and that was fine I still had my group of friends But in classes where I wasnt sitting with them or we had differing lunch periods I was basically silent I was too nervous to make any attempt to talk to those around me or try out social skills High school was terrible At first I had the same lunch period as my friends but then my table slowly filled with other people until my seat was seized by other people and my friends made no attempt to save me a spot It felt like I was unable to speak anymore I had a surgery that took me out of school for 6 weeks and by the time I came back I was basically a stranger I unironically tried to live high school like a shadow keeping my mouth shut except to participate in classes that required it and to participate in group projects I didnt really consider myself as having friends until I joined this group on discord The people in it have changed and weve hopped servers a few times but the central people have stayed the same The most relevant are Fake names although Im not worried theyll find this Cas NB 22 Ian M 22 and James M 23 These people form the core of my friend group I dont really know when it started I think I was about 19 I had been feeling depressed for a few weeks and self harming was basically my exclusive way of relieving stress I was questioning my worth even as a human being fantasizing about ways to remove myself from this world I guess I started questioning if my larger friend group even wanted me around since I was so easily discarded by the one I had since childhood I didnt disclose my depression didnt mention self harm didnt share that I wanted to die I wanted them to feel bad for me so I accused them of not valuing me as a friend and then to them disappeared off the platform for two weeks The next time I checked discord I had paragraphs of apologies and worried messages basically begging me to come back It felt euphoric Even people outside the circle that I consider my closest friends were messaging me wondering when Id be back At the time I dont think I even realize I was being manipulative But I definitely got hooked on the euphoria of their reaction The feeling of being wanted Ive spent the last 3 years doing basically the same thing Not at the same level I would guilt trip them for hanging out with other friends If they said something mean to me I would sulk for days until they apologized even if it was my fault I give them the cold shoulder if they do something that displeases me even to a minor degree I push their buttons until they snap to see what they let me get away with If Im angry they get quiet and relent to anything I say or do Even then they always come back Recently Cas has been hanging out with two different groups of friends more than us They keep getting involved in new communities related to their interests and being an important part of other peoples groups The time they spend with me and the others has dwindled so significantly that Ive become a twisted amount of jealous Ive been thinking of ways to convince them to cut those people off Ways to convince them that the others arent worth their time or that theyre bad people I actively want to isolate them from the other groups so that their only choice is us I want to make them feel bad for thinking that they should devote attention to anything else I got on anti depressants a month ago and started attending therapy The combination is opening my eyes to the things that I do I am disgusted with myself I am afraid that Im going to go to far and theyre going to realize what I do and cut me off I deserve it I want to be better for them but as I am now Im probably more comparable to cancer on the group than a friend I think Im afraid that its too late I dont know I dont really want pity Im even disgusted that I feel pity for myself when I put myself in this situation Even now I dont know if I can be a better person but Im too deep into anti depressants to think that I should just remove myself from this world I just needed to tell someone,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 23:25:12 UTC,3,2,0.68,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0
1j7uunf,UPDATE My 21F boss 50M is in love with me and idk what to do,This is an update to a post I made back in October its the only other post on this account if you want to read that first I just wanted to thank everyone who responded and helped me realize it wasnt my fault All the kind words have been incredibly helpful Its been 5 months so buckle up because theres a lot to say this isnt exactly the update Im sure most of you hoped to get Its definitely not the one I thought Id get I havent received justice I probably never will In my last post I mentioned how I wasnt sure how my employers would react if I were to tell them I was assaulted Since then unfortunately another employee I work for was harassed and after months the harasser was fired Now I know theyd take it seriously but the difference is that I dont have proof I did kinda end up telling G He had asked me to work with Z and at first I agreed but after almost having a panic attack just thinking about being near him I finally got the courage to say that I didnt want to work with Z I didnt go into detail but G changed my schedule so that I wouldnt have to A couple of days after everything I was on instagram and clicked on one of those suggested accounts based on your contacts and stuff It was his poetry account and he had just posted a poem where he wrote all about me rejecting him and how people should feel bad that I didnt reciprocate his feelings but he conveniently left out the part where he assaulted me He committed a crime and then went and wrote poetry about it and posted it for people to read which is crazy I find this funny now but at the time it wasnt lol Some of my memory from that day has come back but its still mostly blocked out Its hard knowing that I might not ever know exactly what happened Even if Im not sure I want to I used up like all of my sick days after we came back for the spring semester because the thought of going back to work with that man made me physically sick Thankfully I mainly have only seen him in passing while Im working This is my last year working as a teacher I want to make it clear that Im not quitting because of him Ive been involved with this program for over a decade as both a student and an instructor and I feel like its time to close this chapter of my life I fully believe I would have come to this conclusion even if nothing had happened Im young and still trying to figure out what I want to do in life I want to take the opportunity to try out other passions of mine Im currently in the process of opening a theatre company with some friends and hope to have our first production in the fall This has been a dream of mine for years and I never thought Id actually get to do it Honestly for a moment I considered stepping away from theatre in all together It felt like he had tainted the thing I loved most Theatre was my first love and he ruined it He took the place where my happiest memories happened and made them bitter In the 5 months its been since everything happened Ive realized thats bullshit I have spent over a decade building a legacy in that department Ive broken and set records Ive advocated and I led recruiting I worked to prove to my community that the program and its students were more than just some underfunded extracurricular w kids who wanted an easy class I helped prove that they were talented and mattered The last thing I want is for my kids to think that theres one less person who cares about them because I left quietly or that their passions arent something worth pursuing because I gave up on mine He took a lot from me that day but Im not going to let him have this The 10 year old that dreamed of doing what Im doing now deserves better than that The girl that was trapped in that room when it happened deserves better than that I deserve better than that Ive hit the anger stage Im normally a very empathetic person and try to justify every bad thing a person does to me not great ik but w him I just get so angry when I see him and for once I cant think of a single reason why I shouldnt be Of course its all justified by the fact that hes starting to lash out in his own way A couple of days ago I was at a competition with my kids and I had my sister come up to me panicking because while I was helping unload equipment from our trailer he was talking to the contest manager to get my name removed from the program which meant I couldnt help them We were down 4 crew members and needed all the help we could get G had to get after him because wtf What was the point of that Later while I was helping them assemble their set they have to set up in lt7 minutes or get disqualified he pulls me aside and tells me just so you know we can be disqualified and not allowed to compete anymore if you touch anything else Dont forget youre just our assistant In a condescending voice This upset me because Ive been taking part in this competition for half of my life I know the rules I even studied the damn rulebook when I first got hired I told him actually if you look at the program for tomorrow Im listed as a director and directors are permitted to assist their students with the assembly of the set as long as students put up 70 of it Which is 100 true He didnt like my answer so I had to drag G away from where he was helping and have him say the same thing I did He was just wasting our time Its like he wanted the kids to get disqualified I explained that he was listed as just an assistant so I needed him to let me do my job because he didnt even have anything to do with our production other than suddenly showing up the day of contest to yell at the kids and stress them out he yelled at them for not moving fast enough when unloading the set even though we had arrived early to make sure we could take our time Like I said everything he does pisses me off for good reason I was definitely rude and me pulling rank is annoying but he could at least speak to me like Im adult deserving of respect rather than treating me like a child who has no idea what theyre doing I dont understand why he wants to punish me and my kids because he doesnt know how to respect boundaries and not cheat on his wife I from an area where its very conservative amp religious so It feels like the odds of someone believing me are low but I did tell my sister I knew if anyone was going to understand me it was her I was there for her when she was assaulted and its felt like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders having her by my side Im hoping to start therapy soon

1j4a5d8,Just need a little rant is all,I have never been the skinny girl or the pretty girl so when I became infatuated with a boy and finally heard him say yes to my request to date him I thought I was in a fairytale Last summer I 18 went to visit my boyfriend 21 who lived over 400 miles away I was given an ultimatum if I didnt go see him he would dump me So the naive me hopelessly in love agreed to take two weeks off my wellpaying job to meet him After a 14hour train ride I was enveloped in his embrace and I felt so happy thinking This is it hes the one I was exhausted from the long day and immediately fell asleep in his bed However I woke up to a strange feeling and found myself unable to breathe He was having sex with me and choking me When I opened my eyes in shock all he said was You like that you fucking slut I felt so stupid and used I couldnt look at him the same way again I stayed there for the rest of the two weeks but all we did was argue I wanted love and to spend time with him while he just wanted to play games use me and sleep Once the two weeks were over i got the train home to encounter a 7 hour delay I spent a total of 21 hours on a train only to be raped by a man in an alley at 3 am on my way to the hotel I called my boyfriend crying and upset as my face had been bashed in He called me a whore saying I shouldnt dress the way I did in public and that it was my own fault Then he dumped me I had a mental breakdown of sorts lost my job self harmed almost daily never allowing my skin to be clean and overdosed twice The worst part is no one believed me accusing me of being an attention seeker and dramatic and those who did believe me played it off as no big deal Although it has been five months I still feel unloved I have always craved affection and I genuinely do not believe anyone could ever love me for who I am without wanting to use me although i hope one day im proven to be wrong,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 18:32:52 UTC,0,1,0.5,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j6d566,Im going crazy for a very stupid reason,My sister stole an earring of mine Im sure A long fringed earring with a rhinestone on the head that I could remove that I bought about three years ago It was my absolute favorite basically the only one I wore and I wore it everywhere it was perfect for everything I didnt even need another one I wore it to a party in December and I clearly remember taking it off inside the house and putting it in my jewelry box But when I went to wear it again where was it It doesnt make sense I didnt lose that earring I put it where it should have been but someone took it didnt tell me and to this day has never given it back to me I live with my mother two sisters and my grandfather and my aunt is the neighbor in the apartment across the hall and she and her daughter have complete access to my house Ive already gone to everyone calmly asked if they had taken it if they had borrowed it and forgotten to return it everyone said no But heres the thing my older sister is a bitch She comes into my room and takes my stuff Shes already finished my perfume makeup skincare hair products expensive stuff She complains when I complain she takes absolutely no care with anything My whole life has been like this with her and my whole life Ive complained to my mother about it but my mother just told me to keep my stuff away from her Its kind of hard when we live in the same house but its okay Shes already taken some of my jewelry and broken it When I was a kid she took three of my rings and returned them to me broken that same night but I was a kid and the rings had cost 30 reais in total When I was 17 she took a pair of earrings that my aunt gave me for my 15th birthday big earrings with stones more expensive but besides everything else a gift the same thing happened they disappeared and one day rummaging through her room I found them broken She didnt even bother to show it to me This one caused me problems but this woman had the nerve to tell me to my face Im not going to buy another one theyre too expensive with the utmost disdain in the world and my mother did nothing I kept up the conversation for a while telling her that she was an irresponsible idiot who had stolen my earrings but it was no use and at 17 years old what was I going to do Sue her for a pair of earrings Alone even more so because my mother wouldnt help me Brother this story about that earring that she broke has been cooking in me all these years and along with everything I went through with her in my childhood God I hate this woman Now the same thing happened My earring disappeared and there was absolute silence I know she has it I know she took it But it was in December its already March Ive asked her on separate occasions if she took my earring and she said no Ive already gone to her room and turned everything upside down looking for those earrings and I couldnt find them I found other things of mine that I hadnt even noticed were not even with me anymore I want to look in her bag but she wont let me shell get stressed and throw them to my mother who will be on her side like she always is Brother Im going to go crazy because sometimes I stop and think about this piece of crap earring that I know she took I know I didnt lose it I know where I put it if it had been my fault if I had left it at the party where I wore it if I had put it in my bag and it disappeared if it had fallen on the street I know I would have gotten over it by now but no it disappeared in my house in the place where it should be someone took it The only person who has the nerve to steal it from me and act like the biggest sly person there is Practically every week I end up staging fights and fights with her demanding that she give me back the earrings that I know she stole but shell turn the story around and Ill leave like a crazy person because Ive already looked in her room and nothing And I swear that for real if I found that piece of shit earring with her I would sue her now I would sue her It costs a lot less than the earring she broke but I dont care I just want my earring I just want that bitch to give me back whats mine because I know she has it,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 08:53:21 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j7fwtg,I feel left out by my girlfriend,Hello guys I really have to get this off my shoulders so i decided to make this post on here already appreciate you guys for reading it So i am M22 and my gf is the same age we are together since three years now and everything did go well for the most part The thing is i am an absolute introvert and probably suffer from social anxiety I hate to go to places where a lot of people are i cannot eat when a lot of people are around me and i just get exhausted and overwhelmed so fast this makes my life really hard tbh and its even harder because i cant understand why i feel that way like i was grown up in a great lovingly household have a good job and i am basically just a normal guy who should not complain about his life However my gf knows all those things and we talk about it and all she also tells me shes there for me and just tries to help me out as much as she can And then there was this situation yesterday it was the 20th birthday of her brother who is also a really close friend of mine and he was throwing a party with approximately 40 people and what can i say i felt like absolute shit the whole week my anxiety hit rock bottom and i felt like i couldnt handle it the night before the party i had a fucking panic attack while falling asleep So i was talking to my gf talking about how i feel and how i am getting the worst anxiety ever and so on she then tried to make me feel less anxious she told me she is there for me the whole evening she wont let me be alone and stuff and idk just trying to pick me up thats also one thing like i feel giga weak in those situations why cant i handle such things shouldnt i be the one protecting her however i am also really insecure about myself The party was on saturday 1900 in a bar my heart was racing all day i tried to calm myself down with playing some video games some csgo and some league but nothing really helped So at around 1830 i left home and was driving to the party you can imagine how i felt when i arrived we were in a group of maybe 5 people i really didnt know many people there maybe like 3 or 4 then i went to the wc to calm down a bit and when i cam back my gf was grouping with her friend the other people i knew where also with their other friends and suddenly i find myself standing in this bar alone trying to talk to some people i didnt even know just to make it less akward it was my personal hell However i couldnt just go to my gf and her friends because i would have felt ultra weird when being the only guy there coming out of nowhere i would have appreciated it so much if she would have came up the me and just would be on my site but she didnt she didnt the whole evening like in 8 hours she wasnt coming up to me once one time she was looking at me she wanted to ask me if everything was okay by signaling it i was shaking my head and telling her no nothing is ok and then she turned around and did go somewhere else like why i dont understand that i feel like the biggest loser on this earth my feelings are ultra hurt and i cant stop thinking about it i could have never done it like this if roles were switched maybe i am overreacting but honestly i dont think so like why do i even tell her how i felt like shit because of this party should i have just came up to her and her friends idk i still think it would have been easier for her to come pick me up then for me to go to them especially when she knows how i felt idk this evening made me just feel like absolute shit i feel hurt as hell i could literally start to cry right now Why do i have to be such an insecure and anti social person i just dont get it however now i am here sitting at my pc listening to music and writing this down idk if anybody will even read this but if so sorry if my english is not the yellow from the egg but i tried my best have a nice sunday evening,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 19:48:09 UTC,0,1,0.33,,,0,0

1j7knoh,Reconnecting with someone but Im so sensitive to their teasing comments,Not really looking for any advice on this I just need to vent as I dont feel its a big enough deal to bring it up to them grinning_face_with_sweat Ive recently been talking to someone I lost touch with ages ago We used to be extremely close and always teased each other jokingly But since reconnecting with them Ive just been feeling a lot more sensitive to their comments It feels silly as I know they dont mean anything bad by their words but I just find myself wondering if they even really like me as a person or if theyre judging me Couple of examples I have pet cats and this friend knows I love them Theyve never liked cats which is fine They sent over a funny video of a cat but that somehow devolved into them telling me how much they hate cats and talking about how they also thought cats made their owners bitches etc I just tried to brush it off and joke back defending my stance on cats a little bit This isnt the first time Ive had to hear about someones grievances with cats but its just such a conversation killer for me Like cool you hate the animals I happen to really like I am so glad you have given me this reminder lol The other thing that bothered me a bit was just a comment that made me feel like they thought I was immature I said something like Oh this slaps and they immediately said Dont say that youre 31 Its such a small thing but I guess Ive always been a bit anxious about seeming mature enough to people so it did sting a bit I imagine a lot of this is just my own anxieties getting the best of me as well as the fact that its been so long that were almost strangers in a lot of ways I guess I dont really know what they think do me anymore If you made it this far thanks for reading grinning_face_with_sweat,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 23:19:06 UTC,1,0,0.67,,,0,0

1j629ya,I am having problems with my relationship and I feel trapped,I dont know where to start with it all This is going to be long and if any of you get to the end I appreciate you taking the time to read my story I would say that this feels like a common place story that happens to a lot of people in different ways I just need to get my story told almost feels like I am just asking for pity maybe I am and that is an issue with myself because seeking pity is not good for ones mental health but what Ive been holding in also isnt good for my mental health Ill start the story at 4 years ago when my relationship started It started 7 years ago I start there I was a lonely type of fella and I did not have much relationship experience from my time growing up and being in high school total of 2 relationships before this current one I find myself in one 8 months with it ending with me getting cheated on and the other 15 years with me proposing and then getting cheated on Both inperson and then transitioning to longdistance youd think Id learned my lesson the first time Anyways I go about a year of being single and searching for love as all young people do and nothing worked for me dating apps social events or just finding people in places that youd want to be able to share interest with Until one day I posted a nice thirst trap online to get the selfseeking validation that I felt I needed at the time and someone slid into my DMs someone that I had known from HS but never truly talked to I began talking with this person and then we grew closer every day despite being long distance with a 3hour time difference We Facetimed each other every once in a while and then twice a week and then every day The problem at the time in that relationship was two things I was not emotionally intelligent and I had a group of guy friends that were semitoxic My significant other was not fond of my friends as they wanted to go out and party all the time which I didnt mind doing but it wasnt my cup of tea So I spent more time talking with her and then one day I tried to introduce her to my group of friends on Facetime and she talked to everyone a little bit and just found them all disgusting and asked to talk to me again She said something along the lines of Wow cant believe you did that and hung up on me Now for me I was confused because my buddies did the same thing with their signifcant others and no one was upset and it was nice getting to know the person they loved back homefor a little context me and my SO had not met up yet we were still having facetime and what not It was also a surprise for her because when she called I was hanging out with my buddies and one of them picked up So after she hung up I called her back in private and I asked her what was wrong and she told me that she felt disrespected by what happened and that was our first big fight with each other and it ended with me texting her updates of when and where I am so she knows if she can call with me I agreed with it all not thinking that it was a big deal We continued the relationship with one another with basically a gradual turn of all my free time being spent with her I neglected friends and became somewhat isolated from my world As an inexperienced youngling I didnt see that issue I kept the good friends and started distancing myself from my friends wed hang out with but it started to be less and less as the month went by I would say that we are about 8 months into this relationship with each other when we first decided to meet up with each other and have about a week together Now before we met with each other she alluded that there were things that she wasnt going to give me or ask of me unless we were dating because I hadnt asked her to be my girlfriend and I dont know why but that enticed me to figure out what she was alluding to and that brought me to the point of when meeting up with her I asked her to be my gf and she said yes but I was so nervous asking her it felt like she was a bit hesistant on that matter when replying yes That happened the first day and then we started dating with our first week in a relationship of hanging out with each other I stayed at her place the whole week and we did various things and hung out with each other It felt like things went well for the week that we spent together it felt like we connected and everyone had a good time before we had to say goodbye and continue our longdistance relationship After I got back to my home things started to change with our relationship she wanted more from me in ways of being more emotionally aware of my day and tell her my feelings and how things made me feel and as the emotinally unintellegnet person I was it was hard for me to change that in my everyday life I was just going with the flow of life and never realy discussed my emotions with others becasue it never really came up in conversation We argued about how I was still just discussing my day with her and not sharing my emotions with her so I worked on it and slowly got better with being in touch with my emotions yet I feel like it was never really enough for the relationship As the months went by she continuously felt like I wasnt telling her enough about my life and felt left out the more I told her about my day so I committed to telling her everything that happened in my day as she was doing to me Now my struggle was that there was a lot that happened in my day so I would sometimes do it when it happened in my day Still I would eventually tell her about it when we called each other every day Still she would then get upset that she missed out on knowing when it happened and what I felt in that period Once again being the emotionally unavailable guy I was I tried my best to do what I could to satisfy that need for her At this point youre probably wondering why we just didnt break up I have no clue its probably just me being weakwilled At this point I spent just about every waking moment texting and talking to this girl and we got into arguments just about every single day either about me missing information I was telling her or me not being emotional Being young I thought this was healthy because the arguments led to deeper conversations with each other and figuring out what made us who we are I would say about 4 or 5 months after our initial meetup I had pretty much completely distanced myself from my friedns with rarely ever hanging out with them but maybe once in a blue moon but it made it harder in my relationship to hangout with them becausea of her wanting to know everything and me jsut wanting to spend time with friedns so there was communication delay from waht was happening in the conversation and what I was doing vs what was acutally happening in my life This all led to arguments down the line and then our next meet up this time I was meeting her parents and she was coming to me I set things up so that I could stay with her and got a friend that I was closer with that she seemed to like because he was married and approved more of our relationship We spent the time together for about 2 weeks this time one week just me and her at my place and then a week with her parents It seemed like another good meet up with both of enjoying ourselves but a little bit of tension between us from the arguments and the fact I was moving from a 3 hour time difference to a 13 hour time difference which we both imagined would put more of a strain on our relationship her parents liked me on a side note We parted ways and I began my new path in life with her being in college and me being abroad for work We had both been right tensions did increase with each other as I was abroad it became even hadrder for me to comunicate with her with everything that was going on in my day to day life as it was for the most part always unpredictable and hard to keep up with myself and she would sleep half way through my day as the time differnece so if she didnt wake up to a butt load of text about my day she felt upset and always had this feeling of misisng out on my life so I continued to distance myself from others and not participating in group events and when I did I tried to keep to myself to minimize the updating I had to do At this point she just felt like I didnt love her because I wasnt involving her in my life the same way she was involving me in her life She told me everything about her day so this wasnt a double standard and she was also busy but I would say that I was definitely busier than she was I continued to apoligize about the communication issues with keeping in mind I still was telling her about everything that happened in my day whenever we talked on the phone especially all the things I forgot to tell her and she felt that I conviently kept forgetting to tell her about the interations that I had with Females throughout my day beacuse as you can imagine she was jealous that other females got to interact with me throught out the day more and she didnt I was better about telling her about female interaction through my day but I still missed a few here and there Sometimes I got rides from females and shed get upset that I didnt tell them when it happened She always felt she never got the full story the first time and she had to ask multiple questions to get the whole story and that was tiring for her and it got to the point where I thought I was doing a good job but was not and I just gave up on updating her one day because life just got overwhelmed and I couldnt handle life and my relationship at the same time and she ended it after that day I was devastated as we had been going through this struggle for almost 3 years and it just felt like it was all for nothing We met a third time before breaking up and were going to meet up a 4th before COVID19 occurred and travel bans happened which didnt improve our relationship We broke up I got friends and started to move on with my life slowly finding myself and what makes me happy For about a year I was single I decided to move back to the same timezone as her and go to the college that she went to Not expecting her to be in the area not ever really knowing why I did it either I wanted to complete college not being in a relationship but that was not what occured As you can expect we ran into each other again and started dating because she felt like I was a changed man and was able to prioritize things in my life a little better I can say that I did grow in the time after we broke up and explored my inner workings a little more The thing is she thought I started dating her again because she was a different person but she hasnt really changed all that much still wanting the same things and I was more able to provide those things she wanted and it felt like things were going in the right direction We moved in with each other and where dating for a year until she said that she wanted more and didnt feel we were growing and she said it was because I had not asked her to be my gf so about 3 months of me trying to find the right time to ask and it not working out we get into an argument about it and I asak her and she says no ask another time So I dont plan for it and just start asking her once a week until she just says yes about 2 months later while we are living and sleeping in the same bed with each other Anyway things started getting a little tenser between us I dont have many friends as I learned not to make friends in this relationship and I dont talk to my old friends much because it just causes conflict and Id rather avoid than lie We continued dating and for about 2 years we lived in the same place We have had our ups and downs through the two years I changed my job twice and have a female supervisor as you know she is upset about that but she ignores it better She says she just at this point in the relationship buries her emotions and hides her concerns because she doesnt want conflict in the relationship and she only ever feels that she has problems with what is going on in the relationship We still argue a lot and have those arguments turn into deep conversations and I become more and more emotionally drained as these arguments happen and I can barely keep up with my studies work and relationship yet I push on We are starting to get to the real point of this story and why I am just done is that we were initially very active sexually in the beginning of our relationship like once a week and then it moved to once a month which you know I didnt think to much of it because I figure sex drive just went down as the relationship got more secured but we just moved to a new place and signed a 15 month lease that niether of us can afford to break and I tried to be sexual with her this morning and she told me that it felt nice but shed been thinking of her ex when weve been doing stuff and that its kinda always been that way becasue she used to be very sexually active with her ex but he was fine with not having sex and she puts herself in his position and wouldnt want that pushed uponed her and makes her feel sad and turns her off from anything that we are doing and I tried to help her get to the root of it this morning before leaving to work and I just felt that I disrepected myself by doing that and not being more upset about her thinking of her ex and it just hurts because it means just about everytime we do sexual stuff its about how she feels about her ex and makes sense why she has to sometime watch things when I go down on her Honestly I know that this is a super toxic relationship but I love her so much and have tried so hard in this relationship with the time and effort I put in everyday it just sucks all of it TLDR GF thinks of ex during intimate time after 7 years of relationship and gets turned off just about every time because she pushed herself on her ex and her ex didnt care about having sex and she didnt like the idea of being in his position So it has tanked our relationship and everything feels distant and We moved to new place with 15 month lease no one can afford to break

1j6mcdn,Ex Is Still With Her Rebound,I 18M dated a girl for a year and a half and broke up with her last year This was a time before I was saved so I engaged in fornication with her she claimed she was saved as well but I never had intercourse We went through a lot of problems in the later half of the relationship and had minimal contact after it ended A week after she broke up with me she dated a new person Today I just found out that after nine months shes still with the rebound I want nothing absolutely nothing to do with this person I want to make that abundantly clear But the idea that after a 15 year relationship that she moved on so quickly and ended up having a successful relationship with someone else really does hurt me considering that I myself havent been so lucky to find someone This might also be TMI but I also think about how she lost her virginity to someone who wasnt me I feel like God wants me to focus on my walk with him as opposed to finding someone else but it really does get lonely And my ex is always in the back of my mind when it gets too quiet,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 17:38:27 UTC,0,5,0.5,,,0,0

1j3m1c0,Called out my boyfriend feel a little guilty now,So let me F19 start this off by saying my boyfriend M22 is most likely autistic and also very socially awkward He doesnt have any irl friends and pretty much only talks to me and his mum His mum is an alcoholic and a lot of the time they fight because shes drinking and he has to raise his voice and be stern to get any point across He hates that he has to and does try to talk to her normally I understand this However he does kinda do it towards me too I mentioned hes most likely autistic I am autistic so he could entirely not be I just think he is as well and this very much presents in the way he gets irritatedoverwhelmedupset when he doesnt understand something or something doesnt have a logical answer or fit the logical answer he has in his head I put up with this because I understand getting frustrated when things arent how they should be but last night I really just couldnt handle it We got into a stupid disagreement over a movie he wanted to show me because he likes the perspective its shot in He asked if I knew what he meant and I said yes I just couldnt articulate it out loud I do have a problem with that where I can know the answer to something but the more someone prods at me to say it it ends up just completely leaving my mind and it makes me feel stupid He asked if I just said that because I didnt know but didnt want to sound dumb and i explained the above point and told him I learned perspectives in drama class Now this is not the first time Ive mentioned to him that I had to learn basic cinematography in two of the 4 years I took drama in high school but he either forgot or just got too in his head where he was making me seem stupid and he kept saying things along the lines of drama is acting Cinematography is filming Theyre different I even tried to remind him multiple times about the fact I needed to know it for class but I kept getting interrupted which annoyed me since he gets so aggravated if anyone interrupts him and says interruptions only lead to arguments until he finally just pretty much said the point I had been saying and ended it with him yet again reminding me drama isnt cinematography and asking if I saw why he was getting misled I ended up saying he needed to stop calling me stupid which at first he tried to defend because hes never outright called me stupid which is true just the way he treats me occasionally makes me feel lesser and he ended up getting upset because his defence turned into him saying he didnt get why people always made him feel like an asshole when thats just how he is and I told him this might just be the way he talks but its disrespectful and thats why he feels that way I also dont really get this because he always says hes changing but nobody else is and while its true hes growing as a person losing weight got a job gaining confidence and setting goals his behaviour does need work and he cant expect everyone else including me to immediately change when he doesnt like certain things but then use the excuse of thats just how he is We ended up not talking for the rest of the night and while I do feel justified in what Ive said I do still feel guilty for making him upset I was kinda hoping he had work today so he wouldnt be in a bad mood until I say something he really likes his job and also doesnt have a specific schedule he kinda just goes as hes needed but as guilty as I feel I dont want to apologize for anything,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 21:25:52 UTC,0,2,0.4,,,0,0

1j4wh50,Got committed to an insane asylum,Throwaway account Sorry if the story is too long because the details are a bit fresh I have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for a couple of years I am finishing up university but since I major in Humanities my career prospects seem bleak Also I had problems with with uni so I had to repeat a few semesters Both of these things are a source of my anxiety and depression I have friends and family members but not a significant other or a person with whom I can talk about my problems For the past several months I have been looking for a job without too much success At the same time I was trying to find help for my depression insecurities and suicidal thoughts Since Im broke and cannot afford a therapist I found an organization that offers free counseling After filling out their application they told me I should go to the hospital because they are not qualified to handle patients experiencing suicidal thoughts I had my reservations about doing that since public healthcare especially regarding mental health albeit free is pretty bad in my country Fast forward one month I managed to get two job offers one in a translation company which is a 9 to 5 and an evening teaching job I was pretty excited about the success in getting not one but two job offers so I decided to take it easy and not exaust myself with work I thought that the best course of action for me was to start doing both jobs until I figured out which one I liked more so I could focus on that job or even quit the other one Monday was my first day on the translation job In short it went pretty horribly The translation job turned out to be a regular office job where I had to scan documents and edit Word files and it did not involve any sort of translation or useful skill that could help me further my career Bear in mind I have had several translation jobs and I am not a complete beginner After coming back home I just started crying and felt desperate because that unpleasant experience on my first day on the job brought up all my repressed emotions to the surface uncertainty about my career loneliness and the fact that all people my age have accomplished something in their lives except me Therefore I gathered my courage and took a taxi to the hospital hoping to find a therapist with whom I can talk about my problems I went to the ER and talked to the nurse working at the reception who was very compassionate and patient Then she led me to talk to a psychiatrist who after listening to my woes politely informed me that I would be transferred to a psychiatric hospital or a mental asylum if you like since the hospital is full and they cant take me He also told me that I should not try and leave the hospital otherwise they would be required by law to call the police since I said that I sufferred from suicidal thoughts Then I waited for two hours until the ambulance arrived and an ambulance crew member escorted me to the car holding me by my arm so that I would not try to escape completely ignoring the fact that I came looking for help and did not try to hurt myself Fast forward to the insane asylum I was interviewd by a middleaged psychiatrist who gave an impression as if he wanted to be literally anywhere else but in that room talking to me After the interview he told me that I would have to be committed either involumtarily which would last for 48 hours or voluntarily in which case I would have to talk to a different doctor and stay in the insane asylum until she decided what is to be done with me I tried patiently explaining to the psychiatrist that I only wanted to find help for my anxiety and suicidal thoughts and that I did not want to be committed to this institution Moreover I stressed that my emotional issues are connected to my career and that I had to go to work on the following day I tried reasoning that missing the second day of my job and possibly losing both of the job offers is hardly productive for my mental health He shrugged it off saying that it wasnt the end of the world The nurses then marched me off to the psych ward gave me different clothes and showed me to my room The room had three beds and the furthermost one from the door had a heavilysedated patient whose arms and legs were tied to the bed The nurse in all seriousness even asked me if I would prefer to sleep next to the sedated patient or I would choose the first bed The lights went out and I took the sleeping pills that the nurse offered and slept peacefully until at least my roommate woke from his sedativeinduced stupor and started cursing swearing and yelling at the top of his lungs demanding to be released from the restraints Two days have passed since then I have not showered brushed my teeth or shaved since I wasnt prepared to be committed to an insane asylum and had not prepared any of my things when I initially went to the hospital to get help A lot of thoughts have gone through my mind in the past few days so I hoped that writing it all down and sharing with strangers would help me make some sense of it TLDR Tried to ask for help and find a therapist Got committed to an

1j3sl04,Thought I had i could win back my happiness but now I have such a gut wrenching wave of loneliness and shame,Since I was grade 3 there was almost been problems all my life Since growing up in a shitty environment I used to pray to get out of my living situation I had crazy family members causing scenes where the police would be called for noise complaints and question if i was getting abused From beg bugs to cockroaches filling the microwave I was so tired of it but knew I just had to thug it out Since gr38 teachers would have to question if everything was ok and i truly wondered if they were ever gonna call cps but i always hid it Then high school came around and had upgraded to a better living situation yet i felt so lonely I wasnt living with my parents and sometimes I just wanted their company despite the ruckus environment they have always caused However although i had a better living situation that was only thing that kept me happy and somewhat ok with my circumstances But high school ended and that was one of the darkest and traumatic moments of my life happened I realize I had large sums of money stolen from family members as well a spiral of physical trauma from that year From then I knew I had to add meaning to my life so I started working community based jobs and eventually researched getting into health care specifically med school ik a common dream many teens have in education but rarely achieve However I believed i could do it Now enrolled in post secondary i had big goals and was so fixated on getting one thing the typical rags to riches shitty environment to respectable status However one club i went to fucked me up story is in my profile Although it may seem like an overreaction and a story nothing to worry about it really fucked with my mental I overthink so much and made me feel like garbage worthless and scum Now after all these years I decided to call my mental health services at the uni i am enrolled in since I literally had a panic attack before class and started throwing up in the washroom Tomorrow is my first appointment and idk if this is gonna help my mental Idk if i ever had clinical depression plus i never went to see a psychiatrist to diagnose me I am writing all of this because i truly dont where to go online to vent I feel like a failure and wondered if i am ever gonna achieve the american dream or be stuck at the bottom of the totem pole I am trying my best to seem like a good human being but everything going really affects my perception of myself I hope I can show my parents I am worth something,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 02:24:42 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j3tjoq,Found a girl ODing and saved her life Found out more about the girl and what happened to her later,This is a bit long but its also how it happened Sunday afternoon my wife daughter daughtersfriend the dog and myself went to the river to play and collect some pretty rocks since it was so nice outside We live within walking distance and on the way back we were about to leave the levee along our normally used path when both my wife and I spotted something on the levee about 50 feet away we couldnt tell what it was I asked my wife to take the dogs leash so I could go check and to please take the girl a little way further away while I go make sure its just garbage As I got closer and saw it was a person I quickly told my wife and asked her to call 911 I went over to the person and found out it was a young looking girl and she was still breathing I ran back to my wife who was on the phone with emergency services and relayed the info that it was a young female still breathing not conscious I then ran back to the girl and tried loudly talkingshouting at her to see if I could get some reaction but I was very hesitant to touch her since I could see she was actively breathing Her phone which had been in her open hand the entire time began to make ringing noises and I tried to answer it but it was some kind of Instagram thing and not an actual call I dunno I set her phone back into her hand and about 30 seconds later a police officer showed up I waved at the officer to get his attention to the exact location He quickly ran up to me and gave her a very brief checkout before administering a dose of narcan He waited a few seconds and began to shake her and shouting a bit to get her awake which resulted in a moan and partial roll from her He kept trying to get her awake for maybe another 30 seconds and the ambulance showed up they almost drove by but saw me waving at them and managed to just barely make the turn 3 EMTs hurried up to us and checked her vitals and pupils and in the next 90 seconds they had her standing and eyes open I figured the was nothing else they needed me for I thanked them and quickly got out of the way A side note Im very impressed with the reaction time of both the police and the ambulance they were both on site with within 5 minutes of my wife calling them The next day at work I mentioned this to a coworker whose father I know owns the trailer part right next to where I found the girl My coworker found out more about what happened and I hate it Apparently the girl had gotten some weed from her cousin which had been lacedcontaminated with fentanyl It also sounds like her cousin was with her and left her laying there when she collapsed Also found out she had to be administered 2 more doses of narcan while in the ambulance and that she was only 13 years old Also learned I sort of know her I actually know her parents as I worked with them both about 10 years ago I remember seeing her as a small 23 year old kid havent seen her since though so I obviously didnt recognize her Im glad it was my family who found her and she will be ok someone could have easily drug her away down into the trees and she would have never been seen or heard again Im terrified for my daughter who is about half this girls age I cant believe how close I ended up being to her family I dunno how to end this but I needed to share the story Teach your kids how to be smart and responsible you wont always be there to tell them yourself And always wash your hands after touching random objects I vigorously washed my hands when I got home since I touched her phone which could have been contaminated with fentanyl for all I knew,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 03:13:53 UTC,1512,45,0.98,,,0,0
1j7qybi,My husband cheated on me and I decided to stay But now I just want another man to notice me,I understand I am a bad person I know that I am no better than my husband but I just cannot handle the lack of validation and love anymore I 23F got married last summer to my husband 25M who proposed to me after two years together A month later I found out hed been sexting girls on an anonymous website He had a whole separate email set up for these accounts he had There were hundreds of messages He cried claimed it was an addiction he was struggling with since he was young I was devastated I had never felt so much pain before in my life I still have flashbacks to that day dryheaving and sobbing after finding out the love of my life was off fantasizing about fucking moms and older women while avoiding having sex with me I always considered him the exception to men a devoted man who could never hurt me He swore hed never hurt me He knew I had family trauma related to cheating my dad cheated on my mom my entire upbringing and yet he still made that decision I made the decision to stay I think because of shame I really did think there was something wrong with me to have caused him to turn his back on me But also we come from a very religious very cultural community It isnt easy being divorced But I havent been the same since Its been almost eight months and although Ive gotten good at masking it I have not moved from that pit that Ive dug myself into I go to work as usual I hang out with my friends do what needs to be done My husband has to leave for work for months at a time so hes currently gone That leaves me a lot of time to sulk around in my thoughts Hes really trying to be a better person I just never really know what hes up to So I feel emotionally detached in a way I would have never imagined possible with him What kills me most is that Ive started developing a weird desire to be acknowledged Not by my husband by other men I want somebody to look at me see beauty and intellect like he used to when we first met I want someone to fall in love with me all over again And God I just crave a relationship where I dont even have to think about cheating I know a lot of people will tell me my marriage is doomed and that Im a shit person too And I know that may all be true but this is my reality currently I havent been able to speak to anyone about this ever and so Im here to vent I am trying to start therapy again something my husband is against mind you But I am doing it behind his back because I deem it necessary but that process is taking a while EDIT Those of you who keep messaging me with the intent of starting an affair or taking advantage of my vulnerability please think before you shoot me a message Women are allowed to talk about a situation like this and not still somehow be reduced to a form of sexual gratification I am not using this post to beg for attention I am simply getting it off of my chest looking for advice perhaps Its 2025 understand that there is nuance,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 04:50:28 UTC,118,42,0.87,,,0,0
1j5jdja,The time i feel like i need it the most i dont have anyone there for me,The one person who was always there for me was a girl i had fallen for She was the first one in years that made me actually feel this way about someone She was loving caring and amazing and she would drop everything for me If texted her she was there but today she was distant And i know why She told me she didnt have the same feelings and i know that and i have to be okay with that and Im trying to But its really difficult to She started talking to this new guy and Im pretty sure they went out today because she looked so nice in the one snap i got from her It was her going out look And the only time she doesnt instantly respond to me is when shes out with someone like that If its one of her girlfriends shes normally really quick and talkitive with me still And it sucks It really hurts and she called today to say she had a birthday gift for me which is nice because i dont really celebrate my birthday i dont like making a day about me but its such a kind gesture And i could tell she was really happy in her voice And she said she had a good day and wouldnt tell me why which means its probably the guy And its not like shes hiding that fact i asked her not to tell me about him and those experiences because it made me feel bad and insecure but honestly i dont know if hurts worse not being told but it still feels bad Anyways Im really lonely feeling right now and just wanted a connection from someone and nobody is there to answer me it seems All the people who i used to be able to pick up and talk to whenever whenever dont respond to me anymore and when i reach out in a time like this just to feel a small connection nobody is there And i feel so alone and Ive never felt this way Ive always been happy alone but its so different this time and i dont like it Its been a couple nights Ive felt like this but this just feels so bad in an empty way,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 09:08:46 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j5kpxw,I feel such deep gratitude towards someone and cant share it,When I was 17F I met someone A woman Online I never met her in real life even years later We only spoke on the phone once for an hour years later It was basically a purely texting relationship It was a blogging site one of those where you just wrote an online diary basically We hit it off as conversation partners but it wasnt more than that for around a year We didnt even talk that often but when we did it was magical She was much older than me and I knew it from the beginning She was 31 when we met It was weird for me to talk to someone older but it just worked and I didnt think about it much so I rolled with it We talked almost exclusively about a shared hobby A year later I was having a complete breakdown It was my first major mental health breakdown I think I was just lost in transitioning from school life to college life I suffered alone for a year I didnt really have a support system and after that I decided to open up about it in my online diary I didnt know what I expected if I expected anyone to care But she suddenly supported me She talked to me a lot She said she had been through the same things so she understood what I was feeling And thats how it started she explained to me A LOT about how mental health works When I was a teenager I didnt believe in mental health Till it bit me in the ass I mean I had this major breakdown and suddenly my nonexistent mental health incapacitated me I had severe fatigue panic attacks even diarrhea So the woman basically taught me some basic concepts explained some basic things to me I started to read up on therapy psychology wed discuss issues It was also magical she just got me Id never had the privilege of having anyone in my life who understood me gave me a manual to myself I internalized my familys approach of youre just a lost cause hysterical little shit and theres nothing left to do with you but ignore you when you get difficult And with her I suddenly understood that I wasnt hysterical That my feelings had a cause That I could actually fulfill my needs and there would be no breakdown So she taught me how to relate to myself in a healthier way how to be on my side always And the best part She never actually lectured me on anything never made me do anything never got mad at me for not trying anything And she was always respectful to me despite the age difference She never played the Im older and I know better card even though she was definitely older and knew better She just explained how things work for her and how she thought it worked for me too because were so similar and I could take it or leave it She just treated me the way that I understood how to treat myself Like shed do or tell me things thatd calm me down or help me get out of despair or a panic attack and I made a mental note oh thats what I need when Im having a panic attack Yes this works for me when Im overwhelmed Ok thats what Ill ask for when I need support next time I think I was going through this very major and lifechanging breakdown for about a year My health was never the same after that still isnt 13 years later but I was slowly learning to live with this new version of myself I felt more stable but I still needed a lot of support And she was there I dont think Id be alive or relatively sane right now if it wasnt for her during that first year if it wasnt for her guidance and gentleness I really had no one especially no one who understood me like she did Shes the one who made me try therapy Not by talking about it she never went to therapy herself but a couple of months after we started talking about my mental health I was reading some posts about therapy and understood that what I felt with her I could find in therapy And I got really interested in it with her I couldnt ask for more or for a more stable presence With a therapist I could get that presence for an hour a week on a regular basis Well I never found that therapist with whom I had this magic Never found anyone even remotely not hurtful actually I have a bad trauma from therapy by now tried 20 therapists The woman was really the only person in the world who got me to relax and listen to her without fighting and rejecting right away Others would just trigger me hard trigger a defensive response and then hurt me when I couldnt accept what they were saying even though I was fighting myself hard not to push them away With her it felt like she was going through the minefield of my psyche knowing exactly where to go and where not to go and how to neutralize at least some of the mines without setting an explosion off And the most awesome effect was that the neutralization usually had ripple effect shed make one small thing feel slightly better and I could feel the chain reaction of things correcting themselves months later things that were unrelated to the first conversation It went on for years I mean she wasnt my therapist but We talked about our lives hobbies mental health It was always the olderyounger dynamics but not in a bad patronizing way shed just explain things but she never pushed She never said that because Im younger I dont get to have a different opinion Never laughed at me Never tried to make me respect her She didnt need to Ive never respected anyone like this in my life She doesnt have a conventional successful life never married never moved out of her familys apartment she didnt even work most of her thirties for reasons I didnt fully understand but never pushed her to share But I respected her more than anyone who had all those She was very smart driven understood things deeply always treated people with respect everyone she had this quality of attracting people to her like she didnt wait for anyone to start talking to her like I did if she saw someone she found interesting shed just initiate And she treated vulnerability with care Doesnt matter what happened between us doesnt matter if I hurt her unintentionally Id never do anything bad to her intentionally doesnt matter what was happening she never used any one of my open wounds never chose to set any of the mines just to hurt me back And she could do it at any moment She spoke my language she knew how to put things exactly in a way that her words would have the most effect so she could destroy me She never ever even tried in all those years Not even when the relationship went sour and she was annoyed with me for years Shed snap at the small things once she started aggressively attacking me in a discussion about Harry Potter Not memy thought process Thats when I knew it wasnt just a rough patch but truly over but she never went for my traumas Not even when she didnt enjoy me anymore As I said the way she treated me had a ripple effect fixing things without her even trying Through the years the way she treated me talked to me I developed that inner compass as I call it basically this feeling that in my life Im the one who always knows best Even if I make mistakes Im still the one who knows best and Ill course correct if I make a mistake I dont mean that I feel that Im always right about everything just in my life in things that concern me It was very different from what my family told me youre incapable of anything you should listen to us you dont have a brain That inner compass made me finally start living my life Not what my family thought was best what I felt like doing And the most beautiful part of it was that these things were not what the woman wanted either They were truly mine I moved to another country something I always wanted She clearly couldnt understand my decision but that didnt matter It was mine I started speaking another language English more because thats what I always wanted and she couldnt understand it either And it didnt matter I knew what I wanted And a thousand choices like that that she watched me make and kept her mouth shut enough Because of this inner compass I feel like there will always be a part of her in me wherever I go As Ive said the relationship went sour With years I understood that this dynamics of her keeping me at arms length I never knew much about her her struggles she never let me support her doesnt work for me anymore And I wanted to actually talk on the phone actually meet her All I could get out of her was one phone call and after that she was always not in a good place for a call I finally was brave enough to admit to myself that I wanted more of her and that Im an equal in this relationship and an adult too so I have the right to pursue it and wanted to have a relationship She was vague about it And then her reaction made me not sure about it too At some point she did try to rely on me more and I didnt get it I guess and it hurt her immensely and when I understood that I hurt her it was hard to forgive myself she was someone I NEVER wanted to hurt Not for any reason And then we talked about everything the dynamics my feelings our wants and desires and just like that it was over slowly quietly not really too painfully and immensely painfully for me at the same time but I mean she didnt really hurt my feelings I was just hurting because it ended It was 7 years after we started talking But I could never forget her Id text her sometimes just to know how she is Nothing too personal just to know if she was ok Shed get annoyed at me for that I couldnt really understand why Shed say something about me trying to be a peoplepleaser and showing that I still care when I dont At some point I asked her if I should stop texting her because I clearly annoy her She said yes I tried I tried for two years And then I texted her again and said that Im not a child anymore I was 28 at the time and I dont want to live in a world where we dont talk We didnt have to be best friends but I was certain we had to talk Sometimes About anything At some point And she agreed It was weird and I was the one texting her mostly And then it fizzled out I never talked to her about it There was nothing left to talk about nothing left to say But I still think about her when something good happens in my life When something bad happens and I handle it like a capable adult without falling apart When I manage to choose myself instead of caving in Yesterday was one of those days I couldnt keep it in the last one was a year ago and she did acknowledge it even if briefly I texted Hey its one of those days when I cant help it but want to wish you the best So here I am wishing you the best Youre incredible and I feel so lucky to happen to live on this Earth when you exist She read it immediately and left me on read Im not sure why She used to tell me that she doesnt know what to say when people tell her good things and she used to do it with me too But she usually acknowledged it Now she didnt Did she think I was weird for texting it Did I make it awkward Was it too much I guess Ill never know But ChatGPT told me to try and write it in a journal so here I am on this sub trying not to bother the most magical connection of my life with my gratitude Ive been in love I have parents siblings well cousins Ive had best friends And this connection was everything in one an older sibling whos almost like a parent whos also my best friend and with whom Im absolutely in love She was my first adult love the love when you dont just fall for someone because you think theyre perfect but the love when the more you see the imperfections the more you respect and love the person You understand how difficult their life is and respect how beautifully theyre fighting and what a strong and capable person they are despite all their limitations My life and mental health are in no way perfect Ive made a lot of mistakes some of which I wont ever be able to fully correct But the peaceful moments that I have the good things the authentic parts of my life the parts where I feel like Im living my life and not someone elses I owe to her,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 10:43:48 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j88jdy,i feel like I dont have a right to be upset but I am,So a bit of background information which is needed for this all to make sense My first proper relationship was when I 17F was 13 with a boy the same age as me and for this to make sense in my head Ill make a fake name Leon Leon and I started dating the week before I turned 14 and had been intimate within a month baring in mind this was my FIRST relationship and probably his 10th Within 3 months of us dating he was cheating on me with other girls and it wasnt just like 14 year old cheating it was like sending intimate pictures of himself to these girls Obviously me being like head over heels first relationship I was easily influenced into thinking that this was okay We were so toxic and my mental health got so low I wasnt allowed to leave the house he would break up with me when I went to my friends house who was a girl and I am straight he would pressure me into doing things I didnt want to do I obviously thought this was all part of relationships as my parents live together and barely speak to eachother so Ive never really experienced what normal love is like We dated for a bit over a year and this was a constant When we finally broke up he was straight to another girl Obviously being a heart broken 15 year old I was going out with my friends to get over this I went to meet my friend and ended up at her friends house who were boys I posted a photo of us on BeRealface_with_tears_of_joy and he sent me threats saying he will leak personal photos of me and then got these girls who he knew I was TERRIFIED of as they used to bully me to make me never want to go to school again with my anxiety and stress at such a high I did stop going to school and only went in every now and again and to take my GCSEs During that 2 years we had been on and off getting back together would be intimate would message for months saying how much we missed and loved eachother then he would get with another girl and then come back everytime it didnt work with her For the last couple of months of school I became super close with this group of girls fake names Grace Mary Laura Laura I have known since I was born like we were basically sisters Would go on holiday together we like did everything together and we had finally become close again Mary I was so close to like we got close so quickly and were inseparable Then Grace we were also really close and we had so much fun with eachother and we knew the ins and out about eachother that we wouldnt tell the other girls I would tell her things about my ex and about how much I wished I could get back with him because of how much I loved him and shed always listen in full confidence and we would trust eachother with everything Literally 2 days before prom they had this party that I wasnt invited to but my ex was Obviously I was upset but it wasnt them that planned it so it wasnt their fault We were getting our nails done for prom and they then were talking all party like what they were going to wear where theyre spending the night and that obviously upset me and hurt as they were doing it so blatantly in my face because I wasnt going bearing in mind I still wasnt at school full time so they could easily talk about it when I wasnt there That night I ended up in hospital and not one of them checked up on me they werent at the party it was the day before but my ex did which obviously made me feel AWFUL as he does not care that much about me The next day they went to the party blah blah and then it was prom We went together and had a good time until the after party when one of our mutuals told me he was hammered that they were talking about how I was faking being in hospital and that I was basically just an attention seeking wh0re Obviously I have literal documents and stuff of all the medication and treatment I had to have that night so I was not faking and if I was doing it for attention I wouldve done it so blantantly to make them feel bad and I never even mentioned it to them I left it and then 2 days later we went on a leavers trip to a theme park all was fine again and I had an amazing time until the bus ride home when they didnt save a seat for me we were an inside group of 4 but had a larger girl group of about 10 so I had to sit by myself They then were shouting about planning anotjer party but the main girl saying it was Laura I just sat back and let them do this hoping they would invite me but that never happened I looked like a fool 2 days later the party was going to happen and it was in a heatwave and we have a lake about 45 mins away from where I lived and we all planned to go together I called Mary and I told her how the girls who bullied me was going to be there and she reassured me that everything was going to be fine My grandma had to drive me to the lake and I was waiting for the girls and when they got there I messaged Mary and Laura asking to meet them and then they just flat out left me I was stranded in this town with people who hated me My grandma had left and I was just sat balling my eyes out and I was so embarrassed I just blocked them all and got picked up luckily The minute I blocked them I was so happy I literally did not care at all that I had no friends anymore I started working at the local primary and fell in love with it My life has been on such a high since June 2024 But I found out yesterday again being no contact with them all including my ex since June and hearing nothing about them Grace is dating Leon I really just dont know how to feel Ive been so happy recently and for the whole of the day I just havent been able to feel anything Working today was the first time I just wished I wasnt there and I just wanted to curl up in a ball and cry Im not sad about it but it just feels like a bit of a kick My family are just telling me to be the bigger person and I am but it almost feels like Im not allowed to be upset about it I just dont know how to feel rn and any advice would be so so appreciated I just feel a bit lost and now I dont know what Im supposed to do The thought of them together makes me feel ill and I know in a couple months Im going to have to see them at this local festival I work at and Im terrified because I know it will just upset me and I wont have work to distract me as it will be during the summer holidays Please let me know what I should do,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 20:29:31 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j6yegx,i think i ruined the friendship between my sister and her best friend,another long post for context myf18 sister17 and her best friendf15 almost 16 lets call her Dana have been friends for almost a decade theyve always spent a lot of time together because our moms were friends the last few years have been very very rough for Dana and weve always been here for her especially my sister and that made them even closer so today during lunch my sister came to my mom and asked her if she could go out for a party night with Dana and her friend group BUT here in italy there are two stages of the party the first one is open to everyone the second one is only 18 and she wanted to go right to the second one that begins around midnight my mom immediately said no and my sister started whining saying that Dana went there too a few weeks ago and guess how she did that fake ID and some connections and that surely didnt help to have a yes as an answer a few hours ago i was with my sister and Dana just talking until my sister asked my thought about going to that party at that hour and i said honestly i dont approve that not because youre going there but because youre gonna do it illegally and she got angry saying that she wanted to do that experience because shes a teenager and blah blah blah to which i replied yeah youre a teenager and have to do your experiences but you can make them on the first half of the night where you can go without any problem and i think she expected me to be the cool older sister because she got angry and it only got worse when my brother21 also said he agreed with me so she went upstairs and i stayed with Dana so i started talking with her about all this the conversation then went to my sisters general behaviour and we went to my room to talk more liberally after a while we were talking about how she my sister almost never wants to go out unless one of us has weed or cigarettes and stuff like that and thats when i told her something i had forgot last august they both were at home my best friend was there as well and we were all chilling in the backyard when Dana told my sister that she had to go to herDanas place that she promised that but my sister was whining about it saying she didnt feel like it but not giving a reason to break the promise so they came up with a deal Dana would have gone home and my sister would go there about a half hour later so Dana left i stayed with my best friend and my sister who started saying things like i dont wanna go i dont feel like it and i replied other things like why dont you tell her if you stand her up without saying anything ill tell her and she freaked out saying that if i did i would be a bitch and i just rolled my eyes after a while she left and went to her room and i immediately gave my best friend a i know how this will end up look but didnt say anything almost a hour later Dana calls me and says your sister isnt answering my texts and calls where is she i took a deep breath and face palmed mentally before answering shes in her room ill go check on her and so i did i muted myself and went to my sister who was awake and told her Danas on the phone what do i tell her and she replies tell her that im asleep my heart dropped and i didnt know what to do so i just played along unmuted myself and said shes sleeping Dana was so disappointed and told me to wake her up so i started shaking my sister trying to wake her up but she just pretended to fall asleep again and again and i heard Dana say look never mind let her sleep i asked her if she was sure and she said yes and i just said okay then bye love im sorry and hung up i looked at my sister and said a few things like youre an asshole youre a shitty friend so returning to two hours ago i told Dana about it even though i probably shouldnt have but i just thought it was the right thing to do her face dropped and she became visibly sad and disappointed said something like i dont even know what to say i cant think or look at her the same and i felt kind of guilty but still thought that she had the right to know we smoked two cigarettes and she went to sleep saying that she would figure out what to do about all this again shes clearly disappointed and tired of my sister being disrespectful its currently 4am and im sorry for ruining her mood but also scared of my sisters reaction in case she finds out that Dana knows ive already made a post about my sister and her behaviour english is not my first language so sorry for any mistakes andor things like that i just didnt want all this to eat me up,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 03:16:28 UTC,0,3,0.5,,,0,0

1j3e9n1,My Mom cant hold a job and Im not willing to finance her lifestyle,So I realize I sound like an asshole I grew up in pretty bad poverty My mom had a really hard time holding a job and when she was able to had a spending problem As a result Ive been working full time since I was 15 I worked multiple jobs at a time to get around labor laws so that I could make and save money By the time I graduated high school I had enough money to buy a car in cash and pay for a majority of my college expenses cash flowed first 3 years with absolutely no help I continued to work through college and eventually ended up in a high paying job From the age of 17 to now Ive worked around 5060 hours a week in addition to going to school I had no free time I missed out on a majority of being young I never got to go to parties I hardly ever hung out with friends which caused me to lose a majority of them and I was always exhausted while I should have been young and lively Regardless I went through the grind and came out on top I now dont typically have to worry about money Im in a relationship with a fantastic man that I plan to marry and start a family with Everything seems to have worked out My mom has always had a very hard time working She has problems with all of her co workers everywhere she goes amp she seems to struggle with taking direction As a result she tends to leave jobs quickly usually without another job offer She decided when I was around 19 to stop working to care for my elderly grandmother While I understood this decision there were still times she could have held a parttime job at least and chose not to My grandmother was in an adult daycare program for about 2030 hours a week which could have been spent working Instead my mom chose to go out and spend what little money she had gotten from various loans and wherever else she was getting money from She also complained constantly about having to take care of my grandmother My grandmother passed away a year ago and my mom was left with no choice but to go back to work and again the cycle starts over Everyday I hear constant complaining about how much she hates her job and everyone she works with She makes very little effort to find other work and writes off entire industries for silly reasons I wont work in food service because I wont wear a hair net I wont work in retail because I dont have any experience Etc She is also not saving any money not towards retirement not towards an emergency reserve nothing She claims she doesnt have any money left after bills to save but she frivolously spends Every space in the house is occupied with something She purchased a freezer full of steaks that have been sitting uncooked for months She pays someone to wash her hair every few days because she doesnt feel like doing it herself She has so many things she doesnt need and every time I visit her there is more yet bills are being paid in increments because she cant afford to pay the full bill I even cover some expenses by putting her on my plans and yet she still cannot manage very basic expenses Meanwhile I work I live very well below my means and my partner and I save a lot of money both for retirement and for our future together I know my mother is planning on being able to live off of me and I wont allow it I dont know what she is going to do and I know it sounds cold of me but I worked too hard to hand over everything to someone who has never tried to better themselves or their life Im done Edit just because Im frustrated I came to visit her today and discovered receipts for various retailers for the past couple of weeks strewn about totaling over 700 She just complained to me about not being able to pay property taxes to stay in her home Its just so bad and I needed to vent more I apologize,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 16:09:29 UTC,170,60,0.97,,,0,0

1j6owam,Mourning Myself,Me and the Past A Meeting with My Old Self I turned on my old device from 11 years ago and listened to my old voice recordings I broke down crying I miss myself I used to be cheerful and innocent Now Ive been depressed for so long Ive lived through terrible things I keep picturing that girl from 11 years agothe one who used to sing in different languages record rap songs and create all kinds of things It feels like I lost her I cried as if I lost a loved one As if that girl died and Ill never see her again I lost myself I lost my teenage years I lost my laughter I lost my creativity I lost me I miss her I used to love myself admire myself I was confident I was innocent I was creative And now Panic attacks anxiety problems responsibilities endless worries I feel like Ive been dead for a long time Like Im just wandering among the living in some kind of dream I feel disconnected from life like a lifeless soul drifting through a world that keeps moving Why do I feel like I died a long time ago and Im just living these years backstage trying to figure out the cause of my death Why does my life now feel like an illusion while my past felt real God Im so tired of myself Why do I miss the past so much Why do I long for my old self She was strong and kind despite her young age The older I get the more scared I become And the more I need her She was wise creative confident Her soul was light and gentle like a breeze Everyone loved her She was mischievous but even her mischief was innocent Despite being quiet at times she was still wellknown because she left a soft lasting impact Even if she caused a little trouble it was never harmfuljust the kind of mischief that made people laugh later I admire her I love her I miss her the same way I mourn the people Ive lost in my life Im grieving myself Because I died Im nothing more than a body without a soul,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 19:31:21 UTC,3,2,1.0,,,0,0
1j4u79y,Sexually attracted to my friend who is the wife of another friend,Fake names My friend James introduced me to his wife Sarah when they first got together around a decade ago I dont think Sarah liked me at all until a couple months ago when we started hanging out through a shared interest To be honest Im not sure she likes me much now and I think she only spends time with me when her friends are busy I feel like James told her to be friendly to me because he knows Im socially awkward and suffer from depression especially recently Anyways we have been bonding over the same hobby for the past couple months and something about her drives me wild at times man When I first met her I didnt think of her like this at all and would have said she was probably a little above average looking After getting to know her as a person and seeing the way she carries herself she has become extremely gorgeous to me I respect both of them too much to do anything and Im genuinely content with being friends with Sarah because she is a fantastic person like James Ive been minimizing contact with her recently though and it sucks because I know that I would never act on these feelings The reason I havent been talking to her as much is because I dont want James to feel like something would happen between us I was spending much more time with Sarah than James because we are both into the same stuff right now Im glad Sarah doesnt feel the same way toward me as I do her but it sucks knowing that she wouldnt feel the same even had she never met James I feel so guilty and ashamed for liking her,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 12:19:37 UTC,0,12,0.3,,,0,0
1j3k2r8,My fathers image,When I was little I had a very grand image of my father shaped by my family since he was rarely home They often told me about his good looks intelligence and how much everyone admired him Much of what they said was truehe was handsome excelled in his studies and graduated from university with top marks But I never really interacted with him directly Growing up I always felt I couldnt match his intelligence or other qualities Even as an adult after a lot of studying and mental development I felt I wasnt close to his level Recently I started talking to him more to try and build some connection now that Im older Im a programmer and wanted to discuss a complex new app Im working on I hoped he would listen and offer some advice The app is detailed and sophisticated but since hes a mechanical engineer unfamiliar with the latest technologies I focused on explaining the user experience to show him what the app would do However during our talks I realized there was a significant gap between us in reasoning logical thinking and the speed of processing information which may be due to his age I dont know Surprisingly instead of feeling proud of my advancement I felt sad I wanted to share this because its a new and unfamiliar emotion for me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 20:03:56 UTC,1,0,0.67,,,0,0
1j880m4,True Story for English Project,A few years ago in 2019 I went over to a friends house to complete a project While there I noticed she had some cats roaming around her yard and she mentioned that her family also had a few dogs The dogs were medium sized and the cats were of normal weight and stature and I assumed that when the weather became extreme they would be brought inside for safety and comfort I barely spared them a glance trusting that they were cared for At the time I didnt think much of it Animals are a part of human life and in the lowincome neighborhood that my friend lived in it was common for pets to live in backyards or spend a lot of time outside She clearly seemed to love her cats even though they were not inside the house and it would be rude for me to question how things were done in her family In some Florida neighborhoods it is common for dogs and cats to spend their days outside the continuously warm environment with the occasional rain is perfect weather for those who cant afford to have more occupants in already small houses It was two years of being friends that led to our first sleepover That was when I started noticing a few odd things in my friends household For instance her family had recently found a kitten on the side of the road and had taken it in At first I thought it was a heartwarming act of kindness They allowed the kitten to sleep in their beds cuddle with them and receive affection However as soon as the kitten grew older they just put it back outside to fend for itself It struck me as odd but I dismissed it thinking perhaps they just didnt want a fullgrown cat inside This happened with several cats and they just found a new kitten a few months ago I didnt like it but it wasnt exactly illegal The straw that broke the camels back was in 2023 It was an extremely hot summer the hottest itd been in years I went over to her house per usual but this time with another friend We decided that before wed come in wed say hello to her dogs Usually she would tell us that the dogs werent important and would always steer us away But this time we wanted to play with them The dogs were confined in an unbearably small cageabout the size of a wheelbarrow The space was far too cramped for even one dog let alone three They had no shelter from the relentless 100degree heat and there was no shade to offer them any respite The food bowl was empty devoid of any evidence of kibble meat or any form of sustenance The water they did have was dirty contaminated with feces and entirely undrinkable Feces were scattered all around the cage indicating that they had been living in these conditions for a long time As soon as they saw us the dogs started panting and wagging their tails shaking with excitement at the sight of people They were desperate for attention for care for relief from their miserable existence It was heartbreaking No animal should have to endure such neglect These dogs werent just sufferingthey were being denied basic necessities space clean water food and protection from the elements My friends reaction to our concern was even more shocking When confronted about the state of the dogs she simply walked away without a word There was no explanation no sign of guilt or concern It was as if she didnt see anything wrong with what we had witnessed I was horrified I knew I could not ignore what I had seen This was not just a matter of differing opinions on pet carethis was neglect Leaving animals in these conditions without food clean water or shelter is not only cruel but could be considered animal abuse under the law This experience changed the way I felt about her from then on I had reported it to animal control but they did nothing and her family ended up moving the dogs into the garage a humid stuffy garage without windows to open and let air in but bigger than a wheelbarrow so progress is progress Animal control did not take the dogs away as I expected but instead gave a warning This is one of those stories with no real happy ending Some people dont deserve the love animals give so freely And sometimes walking away from a friendship is the only right thing to do We still keep in contact after all she was my best friend But every time I see her face Im reminded of those moments and it doesnt feel good,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 20:07:53 UTC,2,0,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING ANIMAL ABUSE,0,0

1j7uunf,UPDATE My 21F boss 50M is in love with me and idk what to do,This is an update to a post I made back in October its the only other post on this account if you want to read that first I just wanted to thank everyone who responded and helped me realize it wasnt my fault All the kind words have been incredibly helpful Its been 5 months so buckle up because theres a lot to say this isnt exactly the update Im sure most of you hoped to get Its definitely not the one I thought Id get I havent received justice I probably never will In my last post I mentioned how I wasnt sure how my employers would react if I were to tell them I was assaulted Since then unfortunately another employee I work for was harassed and after months the harasser was fired Now I know theyd take it seriously but the difference is that I dont have proof I did kinda end up telling G He had asked me to work with Z and at first I agreed but after almost having a panic attack just thinking about being near him I finally got the courage to say that I didnt want to work with Z I didnt go into detail but G changed my schedule so that I wouldnt have to A couple of days after everything I was on instagram and clicked on one of those suggested accounts based on your contacts and stuff It was his poetry account and he had just posted a poem where he wrote all about me rejecting him and how people should feel bad that I didnt reciprocate his feelings but he conveniently left out the part where he assaulted me He committed a crime and then went and wrote poetry about it and posted it for people to read which is crazy I find this funny now but at the time it wasnt lol Some of my memory from that day has come back but its still mostly blocked out Its hard knowing that I might not ever know exactly what happened Even if Im not sure I want to I used up like all of my sick days after we came back for the spring semester because the thought of going back to work with that man made me physically sick Thankfully I mainly have only seen him in passing while Im working This is my last year working as a teacher I want to make it clear that Im not quitting because of him Ive been involved with this program for over a decade as both a student and an instructor and I feel like its time to close this chapter of my life I fully believe I would have come to this conclusion even if nothing had happened Im young and still trying to figure out what I want to do in life I want to take the opportunity to try out other passions of mine Im currently in the process of opening a theatre company with some friends and hope to have our first production in the fall This has been a dream of mine for years and I never thought Id actually get to do it Honestly for a moment I considered stepping away from theatre in all together It felt like he had tainted the thing I loved most Theatre was my first love and he ruined it He took the place where my happiest memories happened and made them bitter In the 5 months its been since everything happened Ive realized thats bullshit I have spent over a decade building a legacy in that department Ive broken and set records Ive advocated and I led recruiting I worked to prove to my community that the program and its students were more than just some underfunded extracurricular w kids who wanted an easy class I helped prove that they were talented and mattered The last thing I want is for my kids to think that theres one less person who cares about them because I left quietly or that their passions arent something worth pursuing because I gave up on mine He took a lot from me that day but Im not going to let him have this The 10 year old that dreamed of doing what Im doing now deserves better than that The girl that was trapped in that room when it happened deserves better than that I deserve better than that Ive hit the anger stage Im normally a very empathetic person and try to justify every bad thing a person does to me not great ik but w him I just get so angry when I see him and for once I cant think of a single reason why I shouldnt be Of course its all justified by the fact that hes starting to lash out in his own way A couple of days ago I was at a competition with my kids and I had my sister come up to me panicking because while I was helping unload equipment from our trailer he was talking to the contest manager to get my name removed from the program which meant I couldnt help them We were down 4 crew members and needed all the help we could get G had to get after him because wtf What was the point of that Later while I was helping them assemble their set they have to set up in lt7 minutes or get disqualified he pulls me aside and tells me just so you know we can be disqualified and not allowed to compete anymore if you touch anything else Dont forget youre just our assistant In a condescending voice This upset me because Ive been taking part in this competition for half of my life I know the rules I even studied the damn rulebook when I first got hired I told him actually if you look at the program for tomorrow Im listed as a director and directors are permitted to assist their students with the assembly of the set as long as students put up 70 of it Which is 100 true He didnt like my answer so I had to drag G away from where he was helping and have him say the same thing I did He was just wasting our time Its like he wanted the kids to get disqualified I explained that he was listed as just an assistant so I needed him to let me do my job because he didnt even have anything to do with our production other than suddenly showing up the day of contest to yell at the kids and stress them out he yelled at them for not moving fast enough when unloading the set even though we had arrived early to make sure we could take our time Like I said everything he does pisses me off for good reason I was definitely rude and me pulling rank is annoying but he could at least speak to me like Im adult deserving of respect rather than treating me like a child who has no idea what theyre doing I dont understand why he wants to punish me and my kids because he doesnt know how to respect boundaries and not cheat on his wife I from an area where its very conservative amp religious so It feels like the odds of someone believing me are low but I did tell my sister I knew if anyone was going to understand me it was her I was there for her when she was assaulted and its felt like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders having her by my side Im hoping to start therapy soon and begin working on how to cope with whats happened I dont know whats in store for me in terms of trying to heal and what Im going to do once I finally quit but Im sure its going to be really

1j42ewg,It feels like I was SAd even though it probably wasnt sa,The whole thing happened over 10 years ago and I had actually repressed the situation pretty well until my ex messaged me again recently Now I think about it every day and have panic attacks because of it Back then we werent together yet but he knew that I was in love with him One evening we were at his best friends place and the two of them were smoking a bong They wanted me to smoke as well I asked what it was and they said weed Being stupid I took a hit but whatever it was it definitely wasnt weed At first I got extremely dizzy then I couldnt move anymore and I started panicking inside because I couldnt speak or even breathe After about 10 minutes his best friend told him to check if I was still breathing which he did When he confirmed that I was still breathing the other guy left the room to go to sleep Thats when my ex started undressing me and then had sex with me It must have lasted for several hours and towards the end I was somewhat conscious again and could have said something But I didntI just couldnt At some point he stopped and I went home I had never felt as horrible lying in my own bed as I did after that night Afterward I desperately wanted to be with himprobably because I thought it would somehow undo what had happened About a year later we actually got together But maybe Im overinterpreting the situation After all he knew I loved him so maybe he thought I wanted it too Ill probably talk to my therapist about it but Im afraid Im making it into something bigger than it actually was Besides it was my fault too I dont know I just wanted to get it off my chest,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 12:55:19 UTC,0,4,0.25,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j4qjzv,How to escape unhealthy mindset,Sometimes I just want to choke myself to death Theoretically I cant it is the given nature of humans to respond to threats so instead I just smash objects and choke my pillow I got angry and aggressive even with the slightest trigger but I didnt want to hurt anyone around me so I tried to keep my mouth shut and lock myself up whenever I felt crazy A little bit of background I was terribly sucks at social interaction and during work I was feeling useless My boss was kind as they explained to me that I have to show more passion and that they cannot offer to extend my contract which I agree with However I was somehow irritated with some of my seniors words and I kept replaying those words in my head to the point that it hurt my chest and exploded my head Whenever I recall that conversation I just slapped myself really hard multiple times and I got addicted to that I just stopped slapping because I knew I could not die and dealing with a dizzy head after torturing myself was not a good idea I dont want to blame anyone as it is my choice after all but having these unhealthy behaviors has taken a toll on my mental health and affects my job hunting Now I dream every night about people speaking ill of me As I am writing this I no longer understand why I was having that kind of thought during my rant most of the time after the burst out my mind just blacked out and proceeded with anything I was doing previously like nothing ever happened But thoughts like this keep coming randomly and Im afraid that I could eventually hurt myself or someone,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 07:58:36 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0
1j66syz,Honestly this is how I am learning to cope with being singlelonely for a long time,I hate to say that I am that guy who has been single for a really long time despite my best efforts but I am I 27M havent even been lucky enough to go on a date in like 5 or 6 years but I have not given up hope even though things do look a bit bleak for me at the moment I am a really busy graduate student I try to fit in workouts and other activities too but it is pretty hard I do not have a lot of extra energy left to put in substantial effort to find the right person for me on most weeks So the thing I kinda wanted to get off my chest is I have been working on conceptswriting for a fantasy novel for a while when I get some time alone With my life being romantically unfulfilled I have fit in a relationship between two characters the MC and another to fulfill all the things that I have dreamed about It was not really part of my original ideas for the story but it kinda just happened Its pretty much all wholesome relationship stuff that I have never really got to have the hand holding the closeness sharing feelings tender moments having each others back etc As lame as it sounds it has been decently fulfilling for me There are still days that I really could use a hug even from a friend but there is something about getting all the stuff I have always wanted on paper that has been pretty nice and comforting Even though adding this stuff in has been satisfying for me I am a little afraid it makes the writing worse lol and when its all finished it makes me that much more afraid to show it to anyone Some of my friends know I have been working on this but have no idea theres romance involved in it I just really wanted to get off my chest I have been vicariously living out my romantic dreams through my fictional characters because I do not really have a better outlet I think its been a healthy way to express what I am missing out on,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 02:14:59 UTC,3,0,0.81,,,0,0
1j6z9id,General depression post I suppose 28m,Hey Team Ive been feeling super duper down in the dumps lately and want to vent serious style without fear of personal societal repercussions This is a throw away account n such Not really curating this post just typing about whatever comes to mind Ive never really been the happiest of people Even in my youth I remember being melancholic more than not Didnt have the best upbringing not the worst by a long shot either My parents fought with each other all the time if I didnt have someone over I remember hiding in my room hearing them arguing downstairs hoping against hope it wouldnt lead into my room with them competing for my favoritism There were times either my mom or dad would try to drag me out of the house to stay at a hotel with them because the other parent was crazy and untrustworthy Events like this were common place once or twice a month in the house up until I was around 14 when it all kinda just died out My parents stopped fighting daily maybe once a month or so until not at all They never even acknowledge the horrors they would put me through They just tell me it wasnt as bad as I think but it totally fucking was It was hell not to mention how often they would remind me how abnormal of a human I am Ive been diagnosed either adhd and I highly suspect I have highfunctioning autism I never really managed to fit in around others as a kid often doing things my own way Friends were hard and socializing was harder My parents would try with all their might to assimilate me into normal behavior My mom didnt let me shop for my own clothes until I left the house I bought some shirts with some cats on them with one of my first paychecks maybe 16 yrs old She took and hid them from me because she was afraid people would think Im girly or gay which blew my mind My dad wasnt the most supportive of my interests either I recall a time when i was in grade school I really liked filming and doing stop motion Lego things I probably just caught him at a bad time wasnt very many good times forgot what I asked but I remember his reply was along the lines of it doesnt matter anyway it wont go anywhere in regards to my shortlived hobby I dont think I picked up that camera again after that I wish I did Cant blame myself there i guess I was young and impressionable I wonder often how things play out if he never said those words Probably not much different but maybe instead I just spent most of my time online hiding behind headphones blocking out the screaming Didnt have many friends growing up Id typically just pick one person I liked and puppy dog around them I was pretty shy and often to target of harassment from some of the meaner kids in school I got used to being the butt of jokes and such pretty early It didnt bother me much but it definitely scared me off from trying to form connections That said I managed enough I had a lunch table to sit at most of the time I wasnt usually the star attraction but the folks there didnt seem to mind my presence I recall once I didnt really feel comfortable sitting at any table so I sat at an empty one This prompted the principal to come over and with good intentions have me sit at a table with a bunch of strangers I didnt really know Horrifying experience That said I didnt really spend too much time hanging out with friends irl I unfortunely found connections on the world wide web Despite how strict my parents could be they let me have unfiltered internet access from the very get go when i got my first laptop at 12 or so They never monitored my activity or set restrictions on screen time or anything Longstory short I end up in some unsavory online spaces I met people who at the time I thought were nice friends parental figures people to talk to when I didnt have parents I could It wasnt until a bit later in my life I realized how groomed I got I never thought much about it at the time It seemed like people finally enjoyed my company wanted to invite me to chat and stuff I didnt see the harm at the time at all Just some textbased roleplays maybe a picture or two without my face Whags the harm Now in my adulthood I feel like Im able to see the effects more My libido is so high yet the thinking about sex makes me extremely uncomfortable in a way thats hard to describe I get jealous disgusted confused lustful etc etc etc whenever I see or am reminded of the mere concept of penetration Whats worse is I think its effected my love language too I feel I have a really difficult time feeling like Im showing I love someone if Im not having sex relatively often I doubt myself and if Im able to provide and be a good partner I know theres so much more to a relationship but my brain always defaults back to thoughts along these lines I hate it but the nature of the issue causes me to love it Its such a conflicting mess of sexual frustration I have no idea how to do a segway here so 3 Anxiety is a big thing in my life It wasnt so bad when I was younger mostly manifesting in social anxiety around new people or crowds Nowadays I sometimes feel anxious just leaving my apartment Going to the store is a massive panic attack and I have no reasons why I desperately want to put myself out there meet new people and enjoy this life I have but the exhaustion from the anxiety and depression just constantly kick my dick straight into the dirt Depression is the worst Its only gotten worse since I broke up with my seven year long partner we were engaged too at the time The break up is a long story with no heroes and only villains and victims I dont want to dive into it here Im a bastard theyre a bastard Point is Im a total bastard livid with regret over such minute details I miss my ex I care about them but I dont trust them anymore and I loathe the mere memory of them Its such a dissonance I cant think back to the early days and not wonder if any of it was real at all Im sure there was true love between us sometime I wonder when we lost it and I fear they mightve never felt love for me like I did for them We were young when we met Stupid too probably Grew up and got distant yadayada happens I still miss them their quirks and such The way they talked and the way they ate Even the things that annoyed me I miss its wild how much I miss the things that pissed me off Anyway this post is going a bit long Its bedtime for me Thanks for reading my cool epic post Might post more vents like this,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 04:05:50 UTC,7,0,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0

1j7ks9r,I knowingly manipulate my friends and feel ashamed,I dont really know how to start this or end it or what Im really trying to say so please excuse any ramblingunnecessary information Im a 22 year old female who had little to no experience having friends throughout high school In elementary school I had a fairly large circle of friends but around the time puberty hit and I became more self aware I realized that my peers found me weird I was pretty much exclusively friends with guys and I was basically a full head taller than anyone around me including my male friends I was pretty bad at actually holding a conversation I still am and my interests strayed from even my small group of friends Middle school came and that was fine I still had my group of friends But in classes where I wasnt sitting with them or we had differing lunch periods I was basically silent I was too nervous to make any attempt to talk to those around me or try out social skills High school was terrible At first I had the same lunch period as my friends but then my table slowly filled with other people until my seat was seized by other people and my friends made no attempt to save me a spot It felt like I was unable to speak anymore I had a surgery that took me out of school for 6 weeks and by the time I came back I was basically a stranger I unironically tried to live high school like a shadow keeping my mouth shut except to participate in classes that required it and to participate in group projects I didnt really consider myself as having friends until I joined this group on discord The people in it have changed and weve hopped servers a few times but the central people have stayed the same The most relevant are Fake names although Im not worried theyll find this Cas NB 22 Ian M 22 and James M 23 These people form the core of my friend group I dont really know when it started I think I was about 19 I had been feeling depressed for a few weeks and self harming was basically my exclusive way of relieving stress I was questioning my worth even as a human being fantasizing about ways to remove myself from this world I guess I started questioning if my larger friend group even wanted me around since I was so easily discarded by the one I had since childhood I didnt disclose my depression didnt mention self harm didnt share that I wanted to die I wanted them to feel bad for me so I accused them of not valuing me as a friend and then to them disappeared off the platform for two weeks The next time I checked discord I had paragraphs of apologies and worried messages basically begging me to come back It felt euphoric Even people outside the circle that I consider my closest friends were messaging me wondering when Id be back At the time I dont think I even realize I was being manipulative But I definitely got hooked on the euphoria of their reaction The feeling of being wanted Ive spent the last 3 years doing basically the same thing Not at the same level I would guilt trip them for hanging out with other friends If they said something mean to me I would sulk for days until they apologized even if it was my fault I give them the cold shoulder if they do something that displeases me even to a minor degree I push their buttons until they snap to see what they let me get away with If Im angry they get quiet and relent to anything I say or do Even then they always come back Recently Cas has been hanging out with two different groups of friends more than us They keep getting involved in new communities related to their interests and being an important part of other peoples groups The time they spend with me and the others has dwindled so significantly that Ive become a twisted amount of jealous Ive been thinking of ways to convince them to cut those people off Ways to convince them that the others arent worth their time or that theyre bad people I actively want to isolate them from the other groups so that their only choice is us I want to make them feel bad for thinking that they should devote attention to anything else I got on anti depressants a month ago and started attending therapy The combination is opening my eyes to the things that I do I am disgusted with myself I am afraid that Im going to go to far and theyre going to realize what I do and cut me off I deserve it I want to be better for them but as I am now Im probably more comparable to cancer on the group than a friend I think Im afraid that its too late I dont know I dont really want pity Im even disgusted that I feel pity for myself when I put myself in this situation Even now I dont know if I can be a better person but Im too deep into anti depressants to think that I should just remove myself from this world I just needed to tell someone,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 23:25:12 UTC,3,2,0.68,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0

1j3dijb,My dad that mlested me growing up isnt my dad,Forgive my formatting Im on mobile Do not share my story anywhere TW Death Incest Pdophilia I dont honestly know where to start so I guess the beginning is where Ill go When I was very young my dad began molesting me from what I can remember I was around 3 or 4 I have three younger sisters that I grew up with and he molested them too as they got older but it was mostly me that got the brunt of it Last year my mom passed away of a stroke It was a very complicated time for me because although my abuser was arrested for what he did my mom had convinced my sisters and I to drop the charges right before she had passed away She would say awful manipulative things like You dont want your dad to die in prison do you to guilt us into dropping the charges She then proceeded to invite this man back into our lives by moving him back into the house we all shared at the time and my discomfort was ignored and brushed under the rug When my mom passed my dad went crazy and forced me out of the house My mom was a buffer between everyone and with her gone I didnt feel comfortable at the house at all and I had my boyfriend stay in my room with me because I felt safer that way Cue raging dad cussing me out for inviting another man over and threatening to call the cops and having him trespassed all crazy erratic shit I didnt understand So I moved in with my boyfriend yay All that drama didnt even end up mattering though because dad remarried and moved to a new state just 3 months after my moms passing Currently all my sisters are still living in that house together Now heres the fun part Im the eldest Growing up I was always told that my parents got married at the courthouse and had me before they officially hosted the wedding I was born in 99 and the timeline I was told was Met online in 97 Courthouse wedding in 98 I was born in 99 Wedding I was pictured in took place in 2000 I always knew I was in their wedding pictures and I never questioned what they told me they said the ceremony was delayed until my grandma could get back from doing government work overseas It all made sense to me growing up I never questioned it but it was all a lie So this weekend was a the year anniversary of my mothers death and I decided to get dinner with my sisters Were having a good time and everything but I forgot my jacket and my boyfriend stopped by the restaurant to bring it to me I get back to the table and my sisters got all quiet and said Hey weve got some news for you and its really heavy Long story short this man that Ive thought was my dad my whole life is NOT my biological father My sisters have been going through all of our moms things over the last year and kept coming across weird pictures and documents relating to me that didnt line up with what wed been told I wouldve thought they were trolling me if it werent for the fact theyd confirmed everything with my aunt my moms younger sister Who I just found out yesterday didnt know that I didnt know because my mom was not only lying to my siblings and I about it but lying to my aunt and all of our extended family too saying my siblings and I already knew Im going to visit my aunt in a couple of days to sit down and talk all of this out get the real scoop on my life because my whole worldview has been shattered On one hand Im grateful I was finally told but I turn 26 this month and thats an insane age to learn your dad isnt even your dad Not to mention what a horrible dad he was I feel this information to be both heartbreaking and freeing Im not related to this monster If I have kids I wont be passing along his DNA and thats comforting to me I dont want to make my half sisters feel bad for being related to him but I cant help feeling like this Ive always told myself I wouldnt have kids because this guy doesnt deserve his DNA being passed on and now I find out I have none of it This information was a gift to me On the other hand Im angrier at my mom than Ive ever been I mourned her death so severely I suffered because I felt so guilty that our relationship was so tumultuous in life And yet we never could have had an honest relationship because I now know she was never honest with me About almost anything I feel so much better and at peace knowing that it really and truly was my mothers fault that our relationship was so rocky How can you have an honest relationship with anyone that could lie about something so big Not to mention the fact that she was so manipulative and greedy doing everything she did just to invite this evil man back into our lives just because its what she wanted for herself to retire on his dime None of this is on me anymore and I feel so much lighter And before anyone asks yes a DNA test is in my future and Im starting therapy again soon I have no idea if my dad is even alive or still out there but Im going to find out Im not sure how to end this but let me just say this has been the craziest year of my life by far and Im glad I dont have to interact with either of my parents anymore or feel guilty about how I handled things when my mom was

1j3bnhi,Realised my family dont respect me now Im heartbroken and dont know what to do,Hello Reddit long time reader but finally posting for the first time so please be kind also this is on mobile so Im sorry if my grammar and format arent very good Trigger Warning as this might be a hard read for some and contains talk of abuse My 29 life story isnt a happy one lots of loss abuse and loneliness Abit of background Im the middle of 3 kids an older sister and a younger brother were all close in age and didnt get along at all as kids but did become closer as we got older or so I thought My Dad died when I was young and this had a massive negative impact on my family but especially my mum who became a partially functional alcoholic with lots of mental health issues which she has never gone to or considered therapy for She also has dated alot of abusive and weird partners over the years so I grew up in a violent and toxic environment she has not had a successful long term relationship since my Dads death I am autistic and have afew mental health problems myself but I have been in and out of therapy for a long time and have done alot of work to try to better myself and work on my flaws I have chronic illnesses and chronic pain from degenerative issues which make day to day living hard I dont want to sound all woe is me but unfortunately this is just me being honest about whats happened and still happening to me I absolutely LOVE animals I have grown up around all sort of animalspets and honestly I love them more than people they love unconditionally and my soul pet was there throughout all Ive suffered in life always there to love and comfort me in my time of need Ive never felt more loved in my life than the love I felt from them and Ill always cherish my 10 years with them They unfortunately passed away 2 years ago and I still struggle with the loss today Ive lost a fair few animals over the years and grief is nothing new to me but its never any less painful each time I was bullied relentlessly through out my educational years and even in the workplace Im abit different and maybe a lil weird but I will never understand why Ive been bullied the way I have I always try to be kind and caring to people and will always have someones back but sadly its never reciprocated and I have faced my bullies alone All this and I still strive to be a good and kind person as for me kindness is my default and I never want to or intend to hurt anyone Thanks to all the bullying I have alot of selfesteem and self worth issues that I deal with but will always try and make others feel good about themselves Ive suffered through multiple physically and emotionally abusive relationships in my life Im not perfect but have never treated any of my partners the way I have been treated Ive been put down called names financially abused hit and raped by past partners and was sexually assaulted by a family friend Ive never received any justice for whats happened to me and sadly theyve all gotten away with it My mum has been abusive to me and my sister growing up shes the typical toxic narcissistic gaslighting and body shaming mother who hates all but one of her kids my EDs started primarily thanks to her and her fatphobia which has inflicted lasting damage on me and my siblings Shes hit me verbally abused me and been physically violent to me from ages 8 upwards she never acknowledges her actions and has literally never said sorry or apologized to me EVER Its almost like she is physically incapable of saying sorry to me specifically Shes thrown me out the house multiple times and gaslights herself into saying that I moved out which just isnt true the last straw was throwing me out with nowhere to go and I had to figure out everything on my own Ive lived independently ever since and even when Ive been homeless theres no way Id ever put myself through living with her ever again I am Queer and Trans she has not shown any respect for my identity or just me as a person Ive been out as trans for 4 years and it was pretty obvious in my teen years that I was not comfortable with my assigned birth gender Shes not homophobic but is not supportive of trans identities at all and has been very open about her lack of respect for it which has been devastating to my identity and my mental health Ive done so much to help her and financially support her over the years and thanks to therapy Ive realized how bad it is and have cut her out my life for good My sister has 2 kids I absolutely adore them and would do anything for them their dad has been in and out of their lives so I have helped alot with raising them and I love them like theyre my own I do NOT want children myself I thought I did growing up but as Ive gotten older Ive realised that I would not be a good parent and would not want to bring children into the world with a parent thats messed up no child deserves that I moved away from my home town about 4 years ago to get away from the small town racism and homophobia it was not possible for me to be who I am in that place and have been happier where I live now Unfortunately this has had a negative impact on my relationship with my siblings they make minimal to 0 effort to see me and its always me travelling to them and considering Im disabled and they arent seems abit unfair to me I am very different from them and have different beliefs than them too this has put a strain on our relationships our political beliefs are not the same and sadly theyre quite closed minded and disrespectful towards foreign womens and transqueer rights They say the apple doesnt fall far from the tree but I fell and rolled off a cliff away from them and their beliefs So now Im faced with a dilemma back away and barely or never see my sisters kids again allowing them to be raised in this environment or sit and allow my family to continue to disrespect me my identity and my beliefs Its heartbreaking cus I have just 1 friend who understands loves and respects me I have no one else and spending most of my life being and feeling alone is taking its toll I try so hard to make friends and find partners but I always end up alone Feeling alienated from my family is awful as family means so much to me but I clearly dont matter to them in the same way Sorry this was long but I just needed to scream something into the internet void about how I feel as I cant talk to my family about things as it just causes arguments Thank you for reading,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 14:12:26 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j49dv1,I think my perception of a healthy relationship is whats sabotaging them,Most of my perception comes from observing from my parents relationship They love each other a lot and spend pretty much all of their time together However there are times when my mom feels a bit smothered by my dad and this has led to arguments in the past but I would say that overall she enjoys spending most of her time with him Ive even tried inviting her to different events but she would often turn me down to spend time with my dad I feel like this has led me to create an unrealistic expectation that my partner and I should be spending a lot of our time together A few of my partners have told me that they felt smothered or that I was never satisfied with them Was it a matter of different needs or was I truly doingexpecting too much Or is it a little bit of both People say a relationship is supposed to feel easy or natural in the beginning but its never felt that way for me I have to be doing something wrongwhether its not communicating well enough expecting too much from my partner or not setting firm enough boundaries for myself or maybe all of the above,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 18:02:26 UTC,1,4,1.0,,,0,0

1j7n8o7,Im done with being religious,Hey everyone First time posting on Reddit thanks to The Click for giving me enough confidence to post I was baptized had my First Holy Communion and I am an Altar Server in the Catholic Church Now that Im old enough I have started Confirmation classes However I am not happy with this I am an altpunk kid that identifies as trans bi and greyasexual With my bright blue and red halfandhalf dyed hair and odd fashion sense I stick out like a sore thumb I feel like I was forced into this just to make my mom and grandmother happy I have expressed my discomfort in Catholic beliefs for over a year now but it feels like nobody is listening to me I dont feel anything when I attempt to pray It feels like God isnt listening I dont feel loved and I dont feel light from Him Ive walked out of Confirmation Class crying more times than I can count I feel out of place and uncomfortable at church events and retreats I dont feel a connection to anything that is said at masses Today was the final straw There was Confession instead of class My mom and I were sitting together listening to the process for Confession and we were given a few questions as food for thought I really didnt like the questions especially the ones about my relationship with God I started crying again as I hated the fact that I just didnt see it the way others did I managed to go up and get my confession over with but after I still felt nothing My mom sighed handed me some tissues and we stepped out and talked for a bit Instead the discussion being consoling it just felt like she was making up excuses to get me to stay in Catholicism I told her that I felt nothing connection and that this is making me unhappy We ended up leaving She didnt speak to me about it on the car ride home She only talked about other random things to try to lighten the tension I didnt want to hear it It feels like shes ignoring me I dont know what to do Sorry for the long ramble but I just needed to let this out Any advice or kind words are appreciated Note I am not targeting anyone who is religious Religion can be great and can bring people together If you have found comfort in religion stick with that comfort,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 01:26:32 UTC,6,3,0.76,,,0,0

1j7y6y5,My Ex got engaged Im upset about it and I feel horrible for being so,So I 25m had been close friends with my ex 25f about 10 years since early high school We just hit it off we were different people but we just understood each other and got along really well Not long after high school we realised we had feelings for each other and that we wanted more than friends and we decided to give it a try We dated for about 6 months and it just felt natural probably since we had been close for a long time She is a strongly religious individual as is her family and that was never an issue for me and she had assured me that although I wasnt as religious Im a raised Catholic but not to the extent this wasnt a dealbreaker It was part of our friendship to tease each other about our levels of faith That is until she broke up with me via phone call whilst I was visiting family saying that she needed someone who could share her religious beliefs with Naturally I was heartbroken and when I returned home we spoke and she reaffirmed this further We broke up and that was that Across the next 3 years I learned to move on initially my mental and emotional state was rough but I learned to improve myself I could say proudly that I wasnt the wreck I was afterwards I found out about 6 months ago that she was dating someone else and had been for about a year small town everyone knows everything At the time I was really happy for her despite everything she was still my friend for a big chunk of my life and I ended up messaging her and telling her that That is until earlier tonight while stalking on Facebook I saw that she had gotten engaged to this guy and all I felt was sadness and jealousy like someone had turned back the clock 3 years on my emotions feeling like rubbish that it wasnt me with her still Immediately after that I felt so guilty like a horrible human being for feeling this way I have no right to we both moved on with our lives I dont even want to message her again let alone want to be with her again Im just so disappointed in myself that all the hard work I had done across 3 years has gone down the drain,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 13:08:19 UTC,10,1,0.81,,,0,0
1j706wr,I was a sexual degenerate as a child and feel deeply ashamed and uncomfortable about it,Throwaway account because I dont want anyone I know to see this This is something Ive only ever told one person and I feel deeply uncomfortable to even tell a therapist For context I have never been a victim of sexual abuse physically was raised in a super healthy home life etc Nothing traumatic has ever happened to me due to another person I personally knew When I was younger I purposely would go on a site called KidzChat I knew that predators would be on that site and would advertise myself as someone to talk to F 12 I was around the ages of 1014 doing this Older men would then message me super sexually explicit things We would sext for a while and eventually trade Skypes to talk or videochat The biggest instance that I remember was skyping an older man who wanted to show me his jumping jacks He would jump for a while and then his pants would conveniently fall off For some reason that moment is engrained in my mind I know Im a victim fully but I feel weird because I went out looking for it I guess thats the cost of unlimited Internet access Another entirely separate thing that bothers me severely is that one day aged 11 I had my family dog perform oral on me The dog didnt need any coaxing it liked the smell and went up to it I remember it feeling awful and I felt so intensely guilty afterward I never did it again but I realize that this has deeply affected me as an adult I absolutely cannot receive oral from a man because it reminds me of what I did with my family dog This fact genuinely haunts me as I know it was completely wrong and animal I dont even know how to cope with both of these facts as I was a victim and perpetrator These things still affect me in my sexual life now manifesting as intense fear and guilt to commit certain normal sexual acts with people like being eaten out sexting my boyfriend etc I know I dont have the guts to tell a therapist either,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 05:01:10 UTC,157,23,0.89,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j4xbz7,My wifes family are a bunch of ungrateful aoles,TLDR Wifes family felt entitled to my money to help with their mothers retirement and none of them have ever expressed one word of gratitude Not looking for advice just venting Backstory Im 65M wife is 61F Married 36 years Wife has three siblings one older brother one older sister one younger sister We were very close with all of her siblings and their spouses for many years we went on dozens of vacations with all of them always had gatherings at holidays spent weekends at each others homes etc Her brother and I were as close as we could be always hanging out playing music and having a great time I loved him more than my own brothers He began to hate me in 2020 because I had the gall to disagree with his political views When he found out I voted for Biden he screamed at me WERE FUCKING DONE at a family gathering Hes barely said two words to me since then Her older sister and her husband have had a simmering illwill towards my wife and I for many years Back in the 80s and 90s I was earning great money and we used to take them and their kids on vacations that were 99 percent paid by me because they didnt have two nickels to rub together If we bought a new piece of furniture or TV or whatever we would offer them our barely used stuff for free which they seemingly gladly accepted We did these things because we loved them Evidently they took our generosity as treating them like a charity case Now that they are both in highearning careers and dont need anything from us they basically hate us for treating them that way and now simply look down their noses sneer and snub us Her younger sister and her husband have always been good Christians but have become more fervent Evangelical Southern Baptist over the years I made the mistake of having a discussion about religious beliefs I am an atheist with the husband several years ago I know a thousand times more about his Holy Bible than he does and the discussion did not go well for him Ever since then they have done their best to ostracize us from the family at every opportunity Fast forward My wifes 80yearold father passed away a couple of years ago leaving his wife my MIL also 80 widowed They relied almost exclusively on Social Security for their retirement income After his death there was a shortfall in the MILs monthly SS income My wifes three siblings had a meeting and decided that the shortfall would be made up by the four siblings split evenly Each share came to 2500 annually to make up the MILs shortfall All three of the other couples are fairly wealthy with annual incomes in the 250350K range and all have 401k accounts over 1 million which they brag about My wife does not work I own a small business which has slowed dramatically since covid I make around 75k in a good year I would like to retire at some point so I am trying to save every dollar that I can in order to do so I will rely heavily on Social Security for retirement income The long and short of it is that I had to funnel 2500 per year into MILs retirement needs that would have otherwise gone towards my own retirement savings The way the siblings view it is your money is your wifes money therefore she needs to chip in to help her mom Fortunately two years into that arrangement the MIL sold her house she moved in with one of the siblings and netted around 200k She told my wife that with that money plus her SS income AND the 50000 she already had in savings I would no longer need to contribute to her income especially since her expenses were now basically zero So thankfully I only had to donate 5000 of my retirement money to the MIL The shitty part is that not one of the siblings or the MIL have ever expressed one word of thanks or gratitude to me even though they are well aware that the money we contributed came 100 from my earnings We still have to see them every now and then at weddings or funerals or whatever and they have never even acknowledged my contribution and sacrifice Their sense of entitlement is appalling especially in light of the fact that they all have a great disdain for me and consider me to be their asshole brotherinlaw,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 14:59:10 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j3bpsl,My wife had an affair when my mum died and blames me for the relationship breakdown,Hi all I 30m started posting some of these incidents in AITAH but it soon became clear that in some of these cases she very clearly is TAH and theres no point in even asking So Ive come here just to list all the effed up things that have happened to me in the final months of 2024 I anticipate this will be very long have fun So for some context In late 2023 my wife and I bought a house and I was spending a lot of time for a couple of months working on the house almost every evening and weekend I could spare During this time my wife started going out with some new friends including this guy J Randomly one evening she looks a bit funny and says to me I dont trust myself around him I hear this my heart sinks a bit but I feel like we have a strong relationship and I tell her I trust you not to do anything stupid just be sensible about what time and how you spend time with him She liked this and we moved on but I decided to keep an eye on the situation She started spending more and more time with him and these new friends going out and getting drunk while I was working late on the house It was starting to make me uncomfortable and eventually I said so I didnt ask for anything I just expressed my feelings She said she understood but theyre just friends and theres nothing to be worried about They keep hanging out until one day his partner a woman married to another man forbade him from speaking to my wife because she was jealous So he ghosted my wife and she got really upset It hurt me to see how upset she was for two reasons 1 My wife is upset thats upsetting 2 Shes so upset it feels weird and shes acting like a breakup She asked me to proof read a message she wanted to send and I read a bit and had to put it down I said this is a breakup message I refuse to do this She remained adamant they were just friends and nothing more I accused her of having an emotional affair again she denied it and was adamant they were just friends and that I need to get over this Some weeks later J comes back on the scene having broken up with his previous gf My wife says shes going to talk to him but be very boundaried I tell her that Im uncomfortable with all of this if shes going to see him she should be careful A week or two later she comes stumbling in at 5am I ask where shes been and she explains that she has been out with J went back to his place at around 2am and they played guitar I was hurt and upset this was the antithesis of everything we discussed I said you cant do that to which my wife took great offense accusing me of controlling her and being misogynistic To be clear I never forbade her from seeing him I never tried to tell her what to do beyond please be careful and dont do anything silly and please respect me That time I said you cant do that was the first and only time I specifically said what she could and couldnt do And to me its obvious I wasnt controlling her I was just not saying the quiet part out loud which is you cant do that unless you want to ruin our relationship She is adamant nothing happened and weirdly I believe her The issue for me is that she did the opposite of what we both agreed she disrespected me and my feelings and she is putting our relationship in jeopardy To her the issue is that I tried to control her by being upset and that Im putting restrictions on her She pointed out shes a grown ass woman and she can spend time with her friends if she wants to My being upset about it is a mode of control and I need to stop In principle I have no problem with her seeing her friends but this guy makes me uncomfortable So that all happened we were on the rocks she is clearly having an emotional affair at the very least but adamantly refuses to acknowledge it Im trying desperately to find a way to move forward and recover our relationship if we can Then October 2024 My mum died suddenly I wont go too much into it but it happened very sudden shocking it sucks My dad died when I was young so a lonely time as well This is where my wifes behaviour started to seriously turn Im going to list the major events as I remember them in the order they happened I will also try to list areas where I was less than perfect but to be perfectly honest I dont think there are many Like really I have to keep checking myself surely it wasnt all so one sided surely I contributed meaningfully to this Just doesnt seem to be the case Anyway here goes The day after my mum died we are at the pub with a friend we are talking about it all My friend asks my wife how shes doing and she says Im worried everyone is going to forget that my mum died For context her mum passed away 34 years ago from a long contracted period of illness It spanned over COVID and lock down I lived in their house with them over all of lockdown and helped look after her mum watching her die and taking care of her for over a year My wife had been dealing with this tragic and difficult loss for some time so I had some sympathy to her reaction But bottom line its a shitty thing to say to your partner who lost their mum one day ago that youre concerned youre not going to get as much attention any more That my loss will overshadow hers It speaks volumes and sets up what is to come A day later she says shes going to go and see this J guy I mentioned above The one Im really uncomfortable with I made it very clear that I am uncomfortable with this and now is not the time to be testing me like this I know hes just your friend and theres nothing actually happening Im an idiot but this does upset me and I dont need to deal with this right now Id appreciate it if she didnt go She said she understood but not to worry this is the last time shes going to see him really Their relationship has petered out more or less so it will just be the occasional coffee which is all shes going for Oh and they had plans to go see a jazz band in a few weeks time but shell cancel that on account of the funeral Shes barely going to see him so dont worry I said it was fine I saw it as if shes being truthful then I can accept the cost of one more uncomfortable period if the payoff is they really do just leave each other alone for a while She went and came back a couple hours later no big deal So the following week we had a spa trip booked I bought it for her for Christmas We decided to still go in spite of everything because why not I need it It was great Had a lovely time reconnected I was able to relax and destress a bit But on the last day were in a hot tub together sharing a cocktail and shes on her phone Shes messaging J and arranging to meet the next day I took offense and said I thought you werent seeing eachother any more Its just to study Im falling behind on my thesis So the next day she gets up early and leaves we agree shell be back at lunch Im very unhappy about all of this and just basically sulk all morning I leave my phone upstairs and try to get on with my day as best I can waiting for her to come home and talk about it 3pm comes and goes I take a nap 5PM comes and goes I check my phone a couple messages and a couple missed calls Apparently she decided to stay out for lunch and asked if it was ok When I didnt reply she decided to stay out for dinner and drinks too She didnt get home until after I went to bed I spent the whole evening feeling miserable and hurt I dont need this She comes home and I confront her asking if she thought any of that was ok Turns out its all my fault because I didnt reply to her and my lack of immediate response was me emotionally blackmailing her to come home It really wasnt I just didnt want to have my phone on me and was expecting her to be home at the agreed time Maybe a little silly and selfish in my part Maybe But Im grieving and shes already pushed my boundaries I needed some alone time to deal with it I had no idea I was emotionally blackmailing her So anyway she stays out all day with the person that makes me uncomfortable days after my mum died days after she promised she wouldnt and Im the asshole for not keeping my phone on me in case she decided to change her mind Great A week goes by and its the day before were due to leave for my home town ready for the funeral in a few days She asks me if we can hold off going for one extra day so she can go to this jazz thing with J I say wtf you said that wasnt happening Thats why you saw him earlier because you werent doing this She says she knows but she really wants to go I confront her and say I really dont feel like Im your top priority No youre not my top priority Please elaborate Well I just dont see it as a hierarchy Everyones in a circle around me and youre all equal priority You J etc Right but Im your husband and my mum just died Does that not put me ahead of anyone else No Looking dead in my eyes No Fine Go to your jazz thing idgaf She says might as well the damage is already done by me even asking right Yeah The damage is already done I cant believe what she said to me so cold so heartless so unempathetic so selfish Btw this woman is a qualified therapist let that sink in Hope you dont get her as your therapist good lord So she fucks off the next day and I delay my departure for her social plans I contemplated going down without her but the ensuing drama and questions from family would not be worth it It was my mums funeral after all not my marriages The funeral goes fine the week is fine She doesnt say or do anything shitty I focus on the funeral and family and everything and mostly not think about the fireball train wreck that is now my marriage On the drive home my wife decides to tell me that she thinks her ex boyfriend from school days is the one that got away Im dumbfounded because 1 What a thing to fucking say as I drive us home from burying my mother 2 Its just patently untrue So completely ludicrous that Im not even bothered by the notion that she might be serious It is at this point that it dawns on me that she may be hurting me on purpose The next day we are having coffee and she says to me I never wanted this house I never wanted this dog and I dont want kids Lets be clear I did not push her to get the house or the dog If anything she pushed for both of them but it was pretty mutual She is now tearing up the entire foundation of our marriage She is lighting fire to the entire future plans we had The house and dog that I poured my heart and soul into for her for us She never wanted apparently Just brutal Savage She acted shocked when I started crying I didnt expect it to upset you this much Incredible The next day I go to my friends place and just cry on her for hours I am in a complete state Its all too much overwhelming awful and just confusing Why is she being so mean I wondered if she hated me then I thought maybe shes trying to get me to break up with her Shes clearly having an affair of some variety My mum just died Maybe she just doesnt want to be the person to break up with their partner when their mum died Especially a partner who cared for her dying mother And especially because she was having an affair Shed be seen as such an asshole so rather than just admitting everything and being an asshole she decided to torture me until I pulled the plug myself Not her fault then is it Anyway that thought occurred to me But Im in no state to decide the fate of my marriage Im grieving Im distraught Im reeling from the various harrowing incidents listed above Barely enough time to process one before another comes along It may seem obvious to you and me now but at the time I just couldnt see clearly what was happening or exactly why My friend gave me some advice that I didnt need to decide anything right now that settled me Took some pressure off At around this point my perception of time gets a bit funny Mixture of grief and brain fuckery So now Im pissed at her I dont trust her I feel badly hurt She says shes going out with J again I say I dont care Resigned to this shitty behaviour unable to reason with her unable to discuss it unable to make the call and leave She comes back at 4 in the morning high AF they had taken MDMA together The oxytocin drug Under the influence of this drug he confessed his feelings for her She was totally shocked by this and said it was all a little uncomfortable Ok I said Whatever The next day were driving somewhere and I really cant remember what she said but it just set me off I think it was something along the lines of I dont know why youre so upset with me I was furious I was worn down I was mistreated For the first time I raised my voice I was shouting at her Listing all of these shitty instances that were cutting me up whilst I grieved I raised my hand clenched my fist and brought it down on the steering wheel in anger It made a dull bang noise This was the start of a new narrative from my wife The scary aggressive husband narrative The perfect excuse in her eyes to leave me without raising questions about her betrayal and complete lack of empathy Youre scary she said I was cowering in the passenger seat she said Youre just like my aggressive father she said I tried defending myself but please remember I was in a complete mess mentally and emotionally I started to believe her Maybe I did lose control maybe I am one of those guys Maybe I threatened her I thought that yes it was an outburst but no it wasnt threatening Im not a big scary person Im just a human being that has been deeply hurt and wounded when theyre at their most vulnerable But maybe thats not a good enough excuse Maybe I crossed a line She sowed the seeds of doubt in my vulnerable mind I started doubting my memory of events did I black out for a moment and do something really scary She told me that I was potentially abusive To be clear shes not accusing me of being abusive shes accusing me of maybe becoming abusive in the future And she cant take that risk Im not safe to have children with you know the children she said she didnt want before I ever shouted I believed her What a monster I was How could I be so terrible I never thought I was like this No wonder she was having an affair for the last several weeks I shouted at her and hit my hand on the steering wheel in frustration She lent into it but not too far She was manipulating me telling me its ok You just need to go to therapy and sort yourself out As long as Im going along with her narrative shes all ok my side If I ever doubt her Im terrible and hurtful and potentially abusive She decided it was time to end things she had the get out of jail free card she wanted She didnt leave me for another man and emotionally abused me when my mum died she saved herself from an potentially abusive relationship My greatest crime was hitting a steering wheel One of the last things she said to me She spoke with a friend of hers who had broken up with her partner of 8 years had two wild years and then they got back together for several years I asked what she meant by wild years just connecting with lots of people So she turns to me and says I think were a lot like them you know I wanted to say I bet she didnt abuse her partner I bet she didnt hurt him when his mum died I bet she didnt manipulate him into believing he was abusive And the sheer audacity of sitting there and looking to me to approve of her fucking a bunch of people for two years before I take her back I said nothing she nudged me Desperate for me to implicitly condone her actions and behaviours by giving even the slightest inkling that I might take her back when shes done fucking around I turned away and left I was done Not two days after our official break up she declared herself in a relationship with J But to her family she accused me of being aggressive and scary and forcing her to leave She denies having had an affair pretending that her and J are not an item She goes to my friends and asks them to meet her new partner J Again implicitly asking them to condone her actions by meeting this J guy My friends all refuse and begin to cut contact with her Theyve seen what shes done They knew what she was doing to me before I did They wont tolerate her BS I love my friends My wifes sister knows everything she heard it all from my wifes point of view and STILL she took my side Then she heard what I had to say boy was she pissed She told her whole family the truth my wife tried to convince them that her sister was a liar That she didnt understand Shes pregnant btw My wife just tried to turn her family against her pregnant younger sister In her attempts to not be seen as a terrible heartless B that would abandon her husband when he needed her most she turned herself into an even worse monster An abuser according to some A liar a manipulated a nasty piece of work Sometimes you meet your destiny on the path to avoid it Im 2 months free I dont want to let another human being close to me like that again but maybe that will change with time My therapist and my wifes sister whos also a qualified therapist both said that she has been emotionally abusive to me Coercive controlling behaviour I dont know about that but I know Ive been treated unfairly Thanks for reading this far I hope it was entertaining X,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04

1j5y2vu,I accidentally killed someone as a kid and I regret it every day,I have decided to make a account to admit to this one thing so none of what I admitted ruins my life this happened around 20 Years ago in the early 2000s I was still a kid around 8 or 10 when I wanted to play in the forest with my friends who were around the same age it was a very hilly forest with even some mountains one of my friends maybe 12 I think the oldest one I had said he wanted to go to the highest point that looks over a river to see the view it was getting dark so my other friends were to scared to go with so they said they were gonna leave so I went with him because I never really went to that area and was curious to see what it looked like looking back I wished I just said we should go there tommorow and left it there but I diddent wanna look like a scaredy cat infront of my older friend so I went with him it took a bit of a while and I thought it would be funny to play a prank telling him I would go pee in the forest but scare him by that time we had already arrived so I jumped out from behind a tree and yelled as loud as I could he flinched and screamed in panic and I saw him trip down the edge I panicked and ran away back home as quick as possible I stayed inside for a few days but my friends asked me one day where was our older friend and I lied and said he decided to go home after we got there and looked and I havent seen him sense I havent told anyone about this yet,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 19:40:23 UTC,0,13,0.29,,,0,0

1j3d6a0,The first time I ever hugged my dad was to stop his suicide attempt,This happened just a few months ago but everyone around me hasnt mentioned it since the night it happened My dad was neglected physically and from what Ive gathered in conversations sexually abused as a child His mother started him on hard drugs before the age of 10 By age 14 he was dealing to her He hasnt had anything close to an easy life But he wanted nothing more than to turn his life around when he had me He and my mom had me at 18 and 19 and were married about 4 months after my birth As far back as I can remember their marriage always had issues It wasnt easy for my mom being married to an addict He stayed clean for the majority of my childhood but I know he had relapses along the way Despite the issues my parents have built a good life for me and my siblings Moneys tight sometimes but we never are in need of anything My dad is clean and works a good paying job my mom works at the elementary school in our small town But the last two years Ive seen a huge change in how my dad was acting He was irritable constantly arguing with my mom and threatening divorce This all came to a breaking point one night when my parents both considerably drunk were having some meaningless argument fueled by alcohol and resentment In the middle of the argument my dad just got up and left the house I watched him walk into the garage shutting to door behind himself I figured he was just taking some time to cool off so I didnt think much of it About 20 minutes later my mom came to me crying telling me to go check in on him I now know that he had been mentioning taking his life to her in private I went and opened the garage door and found my dad crying at a table with a ladder and rope in the middle of the garage I didnt even look at him I was staring at the ladder I didnt know what to say His first response to me walking in was being angry with me He told me if I thought that he was going to kill himself that way I was wrong He said he had much better methods of doing so I didnt leave and I didnt respond I sat down on the other side of the garage and we sat in silence Eventually he began crying profusely and telling me he didnt know how to deal with himself anymore and I started crying too He told me I didnt have to worry about him put the ladder and rope away and told me to go back in the house But it still didnt feel right to me Before I went inside I walked over to him without saying a word and hugged him We stayed that way for a few minutes both crying When we stepped back he grabbed a pistol from his waistband and handed it to me I took it inside without a word and made sure it was put back into the safe with the ammo separate We never mentioned this night again and its been eating me alive from the inside out,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 15:22:38 UTC,0,2,0.5,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0

1j63eh6,I feel stuck in this life of disappointment,damn i will definitely be embarassed about this in the future but anyways ive always been a sensitive person i always cared about others and made sure to make them feel good and happy My middle school years werent the best i had to move out of my old house and i completely changed life by moving to a town 50 minutes far from my previous residence You can imagine that I an introverted and nerdy kid wasnt able to make many friends and so i got lonely In fact i was known as the lonely kid no one ever wanted to talk to me and sometimes even made fun of me i discovered some years later that everyone talked behind my back during those years and that was the reason no one even wanted to approach me And so i spent three years of my life by myself i spent my days alone definitely years that i wouldnt want to live again Once middle school ended i was full of hope that same summer i made some friends and had a lot of fun with them and so i was positive about starting high school And so once my first year of school started i tried to me more extroverted and social the outcome was awkard im not good at being extroverted Even tho i tried the outcome wasnt positive This time no one talked behind my back but i had trouble making friends and so i became the lonely kid once again I was depressed spent my days listening to music and sleeping all day just to escape that feeling of void that was suffocating swallowing me whole I was ready to end it all but i wasnt brave enough to even try so i kept living my life and eventually things got better I made new friends i became more social and felt truly happy after years of suffering I am happy about how i lived the rest of my teenage years but that feeling never got away I am now left with an overthinking mindset idk if i can call it like that which leads me to anxiety about all the friendships that i currently live i cant be calm because i sometimes think that everyone will sooner or later go against me and make me live the hell i went through one more time I cant trust anyone and this thing is making me mad because come on why am i so defensive why cant i just live my life like the others and not worry about this i dont truly know why i wrote this probably to feel better or to relate to someone here who perhaps lived my same experience Anyways i feel costantly feel this overwhelming sense of entrapment in my own life i feel like my past will always follow me no matter what i do No matter how many new people i will meet i will always have this anxiety that they will disappoint me and life is so hard this way I dont even know if someone will read this i will probably only get some upvotes and my post will be forgotten in this sub,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:24:33 UTC,2,1,0.63,,,0,0
1j6wnuu,Teen Nightmare,Teen Nightmare This happened many years ago I dont want anyone to get in trouble or press charges I just need to finally be able to speak about what happened I was 17 at the time and I volunteered as a Sheriff explorer during this time I met a deputy who in the beginning was really nice to me I had just graduated highschool but my 18th birthday wasnt until a few months later I was scheduled to go on a ride along we were required to go on patrol at least once every three months or so and he volunteered to take me on this day This first time went fine I was super shy but he got me to open up he talked about himself and asked me about what my plans were after graduating It wasnt until the second time I went on patrol with him around a month later that things took a turn I knew he had a girlfriend she was only two years older me but this time around he started talking about how things were rocky between them I didnt think much of it I thought he was just venting and no harm done However he was being super touchy and was flirting and at that time I was too shy to say anything He ended up kissing me out of nowhere and he just smiled and said he needed to know if I was attracted to him Im not going to lie I was he was good looking but I asked him about his girlfriend he said she wouldnt care He offered to take me home after the shift and he did but not before he ended up taking me to an abandoned field and said he just wanted to talk We ended up making out in his car and i told him i didnt want to have sex that it was as far as i would go he said it was fine but kept pushing and pressuring for more He said if i really had feelings for him i would be willing to go all the way He took me home after about an hour and explicitedly told me that if i was asked by any other deputy to just say were friends I liked how special he made me feel and the red flags were there but i honestly thought he wouldnt force me to have sex with him since at that point he did stop when i told him to even if he continued to ask From this point on whenever I would patrol with him things would go further Until finally one day after my 18th birthday he said he would take me home but instead he hopped on the freeway towards his apartment I was scared but at that point I felt speaking up would get me abandoned somewhere unfamiliar or worse We made it to his place and he gave me a beer and led me to his bedroom I felt like I couldnt say no he told me to relax that I would like it that it was just my nerves We ended having sex but I finally was able to tell him he needed to stop that he was hurting me but all he would say was just let me finish its OK youll like it in a minute No amount of pleading worked until he finally rolled off me By then I was shaking and oddly felt numb about the whole thing He took me home and again told me to say we were just friends He would lose his job if anyone found out making me feel guilty I ended up quitting the program a few months later and foud out he was being investigated for misconduct on a whole different issue I regret keeping quiet but at the time I was confused and developed feelings for him Other deputies became suspicious since they noticed he would go out of his way to talk to me but no one ever asked me personally if anything happened I know this is long and confusing but it feels good to finally speak about it Ive held this in for 16 years I had posted and then deleted I freaked out a bit that it was shared but if it helps anyone else in a similar situation so they speak up then it is what it is Also for clarity he was nine years older than me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 01:41:28 UTC,1,0,0.99,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j82bj4,Ive been collecting teeth my whole life and I practice dentistry as a hobby,When I was younger I used to steal my siblings teeth that they placed under their pillow for the tooth fairy idk why I did it but once I had a few teeth in my collection I found it very exhilarating In 5th grade my parents got called into the school because they found out that I was using my lunch money to pay kids to remove their loose teeth I successfully extracted 4 teeth before being caught I was in trouble but it was also a moment of oh a silly entrepreneur boy thing I kinda got a pass The teacher even joked that perhaps I have career in dentistry In middle school I got caught again the elementary school was attached to our middle school and I was convincing the much younger kids to give up their loose teeth Id give them snacks or candy as a trade and they were happy to oblige I was in much more trouble this time and my parents made me attend therapy I played it off as an interest into wanting to become a dentist but really there was something about taking a tooth and keeping it that was so exciting By this time I was building quite the collection My parents never learned that I actually kept the collection of teeth And now theyre both dead anyways In highschool I slowed down quite a bit I focused mostly on my studies Freshman year was rough I witnessed a fistfight that left another student with a tooth that was almost knocked down a lateral incisor 23 on the bottom it was kinda just hanging there The guy was in my class and we were acquainted so I went to help him When I saw how loose it was I just reached in and grabbed it It just came right out Everyone was shocked and I ran pretty cringe moment and everyone treated me like a weirdo after that By junior year they seemed to forget I even had some dates I subconsciously would target women in sports or heavy party girls because they tended to either lose teeth quicker or have dental issues It worked in my favor on more than one occasion After highschool I worked on going towards dental school but quickly realized it wasnt for me The science behind it just didnt interest me I really just wanted to perform extractions I had no care about restoration So I kinda just floated around working odd jobs I collected a lot of dental tools that I would use on friends and family and women I would date Today I have 97 teeth total About 49 of them are baby teeth Most of which I have taken when I was younger Some were from the children of the women Ive dated When they have a sore tooth it saves a lot to just do the extraction ourselves and we turn it into an adventure game with the kids The rest are adult teeth Ive collected over the last decade The majority of these I obtained consensually I plan to continue dentistry as a hobby My dream would be to open up a clinic in maybe Africa or India or something where I do extractions for free That way Im helping out but also enjoying myself at the same time,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 16:12:48 UTC,1,8,0.57,,,0,0

1j7b4sy,I spent years in love with my grandma,Three years ago I met a girl online and we hit it off instantly We texted every single day flirted shamelessly and honestly It was one of the best connections Ive ever had We never did video calls though so neither of us knew what the other looked like Were both introverts so it never crossed our minds to FaceTime weird I know but thats introvert life for you Despite that we developed a crush on each other but we decided to remain flirty friends who sometimes roleplay sexy things because were both not relationship people and and longdistance relationships are a hard pass for us So we just kept texting and gaming together Since I didnt know how she looks like my brain started creating an idealized version of her and I imagined her like this alluring confident intense and mysterious femme fatale One day this girl disappeared without saying anything Poof gone she deactivated all her gaming socials She was always quite depressive so my mind started to jump to the worst conclusions I was very worried And I endlessly tried looking for her everywhere but I only knew her name and country so I got nowhere I eventually gave up looking for her but she always remained haunting me in the back of my mind because of the way she had disappeared and the fact that I didnt know what happened to her So I kept thinking about her throughout the 2 remaining years replaying our last conversations to look for cues and all of that led me to dead ends It was frustrating And it was like a mystery that I needed to solve Alexa play oh whooo is sheee So one day I decided that enough is enough I was going to find her and I was going to get my answers even if I have to become the FBI myself I believe in manifestation and law of attraction so I spent a whole night visualizing me finding her personal socials the socials we had each other added were not personal socials it was gaming socials so I wanted to find either her Instagram or Facebook And it worked Next day I went full FBI detective mode I said the only information I had about her was her name and country so I used those leads and somehow I managed to stumble upon her real full name I think this was the manifestation and law of attraction at play or some kind of witchcraft I dunno It turned out that the name she had given me was a fake one but thats understandable so I dont hold it against her Whatever With her real name in hand I found out where she went to school where she went to college and of course her personal socials So I opened up her Facebook and Instagram filled with anticipation because finally I would be able to put a face to the ghost whod haunted me for 2 whole years And when I laid my eyes on her there she was THE SHEER REFLECTION OF MY GRANDMA WHEN YOUNG No really Like not kind of not a little resemblance I mean copypaste CtrlC CtrlV a perfect genetic duplicate of my grandma in her youth I had spent years chasing this mystery woman only for my brain to go Wait a minute is that grandma I WAS FUCKING IN LOVE WITH MY GRANDMA FOR YEARS Years of mystery longing idealization GONE IN A SECOND My attraction to her Instantly killed Biggest turn off of my life All the sexy things she had ever told me were no longer sexy and I just couldnt picture us physically together anymore We used to roleplay fear play scenarios AND NOW THE FEAR PLAY TURNED INTO FEAR FOR A DIFFERENT REASON Like instead of Im going to hunt you down and devour you being hot now its giving Eat your vegetables sweetheart and Im just sitting there like NOOOOOO THE MAGIC IS GONE This is the kind of thing that would send Freud into overdrive Tell me how does this make you feel LIKE SCREAMING FREUD IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE SCREAMING My brain had built up this intense mysterious alluring figure and then boom grandma vibes And I ended up in some kind of weird family reunion yay This is for real one of the biggest plot twists of my life I basically turned 3 years of longing into a detective saga with a twist ending and instead of crying Im laughing about it At this point Im just happy because I can finally close this chapter but at the same time I feel shallow for losing attraction towards her immediately after seeing her Oh well not everyone can be attracted to their grandma,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 16:21:03 UTC,0,1,0.5,,,0,0

1j5u6ov,Why I dont support or celebrate Specific Group Celebration Holidays MenWomenMotherFatherPrideBlack Historyetc,I want to start by saying that this is a personal opinion and I understand and also support personal opposing views on this topic regarding individuals who believe the days to be an exemplification of feelings rather than the notes listed below In the past few weeks Ive been hounded on a LOT about not celebrating valentines day mothers day or International Womens Day by people other than the ones Id celebrate them for Ranging from people telling me Im an awful human being for not appreciating my mom or women in generaldespite this being wholly inaccurate to people threatening to assault me because i didnt do something special for my mom on mothers day I wanted to hear from random strangers online if my reasoning is sound and makes sense as toward why I dont celebrate them specifically as when I explain it in person people seem to get quite upset with me regardless I would like to note that around the holiday not on the holiday itself all the time just around that time period I still put more effort and care into the relevant individuals but I just dont like to celebrate the days themselves for the reasons listed below My reluctance to celebrate holidays like Fathers Day Mothers Day International Womens or Mens Day and others that specifically celebrate a group of individuals stems from a few key personal beliefs and feelings 1 Forced Social Expectations I often feel that these holidays create an obligation rather than a genuine expression of appreciation Society dictates that on this specific day I must express gratitude or admiration even if I already do so in my own way throughout the year It feels performativelike Im expected to participate just because its a designated date rather than acting on my feelings when they naturally arise 2 Commercialization Over Meaning These holidays have been heavily commercialized turning what should be a meaningful moment into an opportunity for businesses to sell cards flowers gifts and expensive dinners It feels less about genuine appreciation and more about fulfilling a marketingdriven expectation I dont like the idea of my relationships being tied to consumerism where love and respect are measured by the money or effort spent on a particular day 3 Personal Connection to the Honored Group Sometimes I dont have a personal connection that makes celebrating these holidays meaningful For instance if someone has a complicated relationship with their parents or lacks a strong figure that fits into the holidays framework these days can feel alienating rather than celebratory Its a reminder of what someone might not have rather than an opportunity to appreciate what I do 4 Selective Recognition Feels Arbitrary Why do we elevate specific groups on designated days while overlooking the everyday contributions of others It feels arbitrarywhy celebrate fathers on one day and mothers on another when both play roles throughout the year Why single out women for one day rather than advocating for equal treatment and appreciation daily It seems more symbolic than substantive and I prefer actions that carry meaning every day rather than confining appreciation to a calendar date 5 Pressure to Conform Theres an implicit pressure to participate in these celebrations whether its through social media posts attending gatherings or giving gifts If I choose not to theres often an assumption that I dont care or that Im being inconsiderate But in reality I simply prefer to show my appreciation in my own way at my own time without feeling compelled by external expectations 6 Not Everyone Experiences These Days Positively For many people these holidays can be painful rather than joyous Someone who has lost a parent might struggle on Mothers or Fathers Day Someone who has faced discrimination or hardship might not feel comfortable with the broad generalizations made on International Womens Day Mothers Day Fathers Day or International Mens Day These celebrations assume a universal experience that doesnt exist and Id rather avoid engaging in something that might inadvertently bring discomfort to others 7 Personal Values and Approach Ultimately I value sincerity over tradition If I appreciate someone I want to show it naturally in a way that feels right to me not because a calendar tells me to I dont need a designated day to tell my parents I appreciate them nor do I need a specific date to recognize the struggles and achievements of any group Id rather express my respect gratitude and admiration in everyday moments through my actions and words rather than as part of a structured societal ritual For these reasons I tend to avoid participating in these kinds of holidays Its not out of defiance or lack of appreciation but rather a personal preference for authenticity over obligation,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 17:22:18 UTC,0,3,0.45,,,0,0
1j7mlwa,I secretly spent 80 to replace my wifes favorite mug because I couldnt bear to tell her the truth,My wife and I bought matching ceramic mugs at a local craft fair last month They had these cute handpainted owls and shes used hers every morning since This weekend I accidentally knocked hers off the counter The handle snapped clean off She was at work so I panicked and emailed the vendor asking if they sold replacements They said no it was a limited batch but suggested checking Etsy I found the same mug from a seller in Poland With shipping it cost 80 the original was 25 When it arrived I glued the broken handle back on the old one and hid it in the garage Told her I fixed it with superglue and acted surprised when she noticed the new mug looked nicer She joked Guess your glue magic even cleaned the coffee stains Now Im stuck drinking from my cracked mug forever but her smile was worth the lie,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 00:54:29 UTC,0,36,0.46,,,0,0

1j41czf,My boyfriend 26 M was cheating on me 19 F I feel Im actually losing my grip on reality,For the context our love felt more beautiful than anything Id read in books or seen in movies deeper and more real in a way thats hard to explain Part of it was because we both had real trauma growing up which made us so similar We bonded so purely and beautifully expressing our truest selves to each other It was more than I ever couldve dreamed of Even our first kiss after nearly a year of waiting was unlike anything else the world didnt just feel like it stopped it did We trembled overwhelmed and he cried like babies as he kissed me tears streaming down his face Thats how strong our connection was I never wanted long distance so he promised hed move to my city but he never did mentioning financial reasons Still he visited every few months and we always looked forward to those moments He even deactivated his socials on his own though I never had any problem or concern with them Of course not everything was perfect His one toxic trait whenever things didnt go his way or we argued hed start disrespecting and insulting me It was a dealbreaker but I still tried to be understanding He had no real human connections all his life He never even got to talk much to his family because of it being dysfunctional no close friends zero experience in relationships I told myself he just cant do any better or could be because BPD runs in his family or maybe because of the traumatic environment he grew up in But now for the last four months things were rough We even broke up for a few days ironically after our first intimate experience I felt insecure or anxious afterward he was my first boyfriend and I have a bit of sexual trauma too but he misunderstood it assuming I didnt like it or didnt want it again After that he changed became indifferent stopped reassuring me and didnt seem to care about the relationship at all or even if we break up It reinforced my fear that he didnt feel the same anymore trapping us in a cycle of blame and misunderstandings I had spent so many nights crying during that time He eventually felt sorry and we fixed things but I had already noticed a red flag he seemed to care about physical intimacy more than anything and shut down when he thought he wouldnt get it So then I started noticing more During this rough phase he reactivated his accounts made new ones and never mentioned even after we patched up and tried to hide them when asked It also started needling me for the first time that why had he never added me on his instagram and its been so long were together and I once saw a text from a coworker that felt off I couldnt ignore it all anymore So I decided to have a sudden intense conversation with him hoping his reactions would reveal the truth Then his reactions did reveal A lot Not just cheating or anything but about his whole identity I started asking he was so confident with his grand words and said that I can have his passwords and his phone because he knew Id never do that I dont believe in invading privacy in a relationship He kept manipulating me into believing there was nothing and I almost fell for it he was that good But then we stumbled upon the conversation with his coworker He initially refused to let me see it then tried to manipulate the situation When I finally read it I noticed he had tampered with it The last text had originally been 12 weeks ago but now it showed 17 weeks ago And then the part that made my heart sink them talking about how fun it would be when he will move to Germany and how she would be waiting for him That explains why he was so obsessed with moving to Germany for his remote job just to connect and work together with all his coworkers there Those texts were from months ago right after he started that job Now five months in i believe they must have something concrete going on Its pretty clear from the way he provided no further clarifications when I saw that and refused to show anything else they converse usually on discord which he didnt even show But what struck me even more than the cheating was seeing in real time how good he is at manipulation My friends warned me but I never believed it He seemed too purehearted But that day I saw it how effortlessly he lies Ive never seen anyone lie that efficiently Even when I was trying to ask he turned down all of my questions with so great replies that I started feeling like What am I even thinking He was even at that time making a grand gift for my birthday It included multiple handmade beautiful gifts including a giant scrapbook different boxes each with 50 different kinds of letters and tapes in it for different situations and a painting which he painted himself He was even better with words the things he said and the way he made me feel Its driving me insane How can someone be that person and be cheating at the same time For an example he kept repeating that he wanted to move here to strengthen our relationship that I was his life dream that after being with me he needed nothing else from life But now hes moving for her instead Its giving me a complete identity crisis If hes really this good at manipulation like I saw yesterday then none of his words were real His entire personality was fake He was standing there so willing so confident about giving me passwords or proving his loyalty But the moment I actually asked he changed completely He stalled started arguing and gaslighting clearly anything to buy time He tried deleting chats right in front of me thinking I wouldnt notice thinking he could gaslight me again Maybe he was too frantic to cover his tracks this time but it was so obvious This time he was maybe too much in a panic to realise how evident his manipulation is or to control what Im thinking And I know the coworker thing is just the one thing I happened to catch The way he deleted other chats before giving me a bit of an access it all proves there was so much more happening in those months Until now This has traumatized me to the point where I feel like nothing is real Like Ill wake up and everything around me will be gone like everything is in my head I know this is just the trauma speaking and hopefully Ill be okay soon But it has shaken me to my core If this is true then everythinghewas a lie How can someone be so convincing so manipulative For the first time in my life Ive seen deception on this scale and its terrifying In a nutshell I observed so big of a contradiction between what he is portraying so confidently and the real truth And now I dont know who he is,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 11:54:22 UTC,0,48,0.49,,,0,0

1j7ybiz,Living with my abusive sister,My whole childhood was a blur due to all of the abuse I had to endure from my sister It all started around when I was in kindergarten and she was in 6th grade I remember her holding me down in my mothers closet punching me in the face repeatedly She would hold my head underwater when we went to the pool until I almost went unconscious She would chase me and my mom around the house with any weapon she could find and she ended up stabbing me with a knife in the stomach at some point This and more all went on for years until she moved out after she graduated high school in 2020 At some time between 1st3rd grade I was SAd by her She would make me watch pay gorn with her then she would make me kiss her also lick her chest and her downstairs She would make me and my disabled little sister shower with her and one time she also made my little sister lick her I spoke to my cousin about this and similar happened to them They also witnessed my sisters abuse on many occasions Fast forward to today I am 17 my sister is 23 and she moved in with me my mom and my little sister after the hurricanes along with her fiancéeF22 and their son2 They originally were just evacuating but they decided that they werent going back They were supposed to move out within a month but it has now been 6 months They reside in my little sisters room so she now shares a room with my mom The whole house is being taken over and Im tired of biting my tongue Last week I was about to take a shower and I noticed a pretty big mess my nephew made There were crushed eggshells spread all over the carpet along with stickers and price tags my mom runs an antique business I asked my sister to clean it up and I go take a shower I had just gotten out and there were even more messes that were made There were crushed eggshells are still there I go to the kitchen and there were magnets covering the floor which were also in the dining room The cats water had been dumped out and there were three towels in the garbage I asked my sister what had happened shes sitting on the couch on her phone She says something along the lines of my son was just playing I asked her to clean it up and she said Ill do it later The thing is she either never cleans or she does it half assed So I texted my mom pictures and basically told her that these messes were made my sister isnt cleaning it and Im not gonna be the one responsible for it My mom calls my sister and she immediately starts yelling at me saying WHY WOULD YOU TELL MOM MY SONS MAKING A MESS DONT TALK ABOUT MY SON LIKE THAT I tell her that its not her son I understand hes a toddler but she has to be responsible for that My mom calls me and I go to leave to my room I noticed my sister following me and out of the corner of my eye I see her threaten to punch me I turn around and say girl dont even then she punches me in the face and we tackle each other to the ground My mom was on the phone the whole time and was telling her to get out of the house She wouldnt leave and kept arguing with me saying stuff about how nobody helps her and she will never talk to us again but the thing is she has lived in three peoples houses rent free including ours She asks everybody for money and they send her money Our family has helped her so much and she is so ungrateful and entitled My mom gets home from work and tells her that she needs to get a hotel for a few days before they can come back and have a conversation about this all Three days pass and it was the most relaxing three days of my life I deep cleaned the house and discovered how much damage she has caused to our house holes in the wall paint splattered on everything just everything being nasty The day has come that they come back My sister has to work so she drops off her fiancé and their son first I talk to her about everything and we seem to be on the same page she witnessed my sister hit me and argue with me Time passes and everyone is home now We tried to talk but my sister wasnt engaging and was just staring off into space At this point no one is mad anymore we just want to work through this bump in the road but my sister oh no she was pissed She denied everything and acted like she didnt do anything wrong and kept asking for proof of everything that we talked to her about even though everyone knows what happened She leaves and goes to their room I leave and go to my room but I can hear my sister talking to her fiancé about everything through the wall and she acted like she had no clue about anything She said she didnt see my sister punch me and was just telling my sister what she wanted to hear This pisses me off so I tell my mom whats going on and we go to their room to stop the twisting of the story My sister had nothing but hateful things to say to me but what really got me was that she said I never have her back when I say I do I really have had her back so many times there are so many things that I have never told another soul because she asked me to I tell her that and shes still denying and lying I figured that the only way I can prove to her that I in fact did have her back and to get it through to her that she needs to stop lying and be accountable for her actions was to tell her darkest secrets I started tame and told my mom the reasoning why my sister got jumped a few years back My sister acts oblivious I as her if she wants me to keep going She says she doesnt care so I tell her fiancé about how she cheated on her with a man less that a year ago Of course she denies it but I had proof I pull up text messages of her describing everything when it happened and she still tried to deny it She and her fiancé start arguing which causes my sister to run away She would do this all the time growing up if she got caught doing something bad she would run away but she would come back an hour later but keep in mind this is a 23 year old adult were talking about We found her sitting on the street talking to a random man and we bring her back home She keeps threatening to off herself which is another tactic she used as kids At home she starts arguing with my mom and I saying that everyone hates her and that I ruined her life and I only said that out of spite I told her exactly why I did it but shes not having it because when she makes up a story in her head she will stick to it Me and her fiancé go to the gas station to blow off some steam and we talked the whole time She talked about how my sister would try to do nasty stuff to her but she didnt want to because she had a gut feeling that she was cheating and she was right She also said that when she didnt want to do anything my sister would try to force herself into her Her saying this triggered my memory of the SA that happened when I was a kid I told her about it and she said she believed me We get home and I figured I should probably tell my mom about the SA I had hidden this from everyone because my sister always threatened me and by the time she was no longer a threat to me I had blocked out that memory This whole situation just resurfaced everything My mom was horrified and at this point no one knows what to do but my sister needs to get out of the house She has no one to go to because she ruined everyones trust She has no money because she cant save for shit We decide to sleep on it because at this point its like 1 am I couldnt sleep for the life of me but the next day this all continues The fiancé repeated everything I told her to my sister and of course she is denying everything and calling me a liar who is just out to get her Not only that but her fiancé is denying everything that she told me such as my sister forcing herself onto her Their stories for everything keep changing but mine has stayed the same for everyone All day my sister was talking shit about me Its so bad that I cant even be in my own room because I can hear them talking through the wall As of now Im sleeping on the floor in my moms room If Im not in the same room as my mom they will talk shit to her Despite all of this my mom believes me and my one story along with all of the proof I have I havent been this enraged since I lived with my sister as a kid It feels like Im living with squatters from the worst roommate show I have zero privacy and I cant breathe without someone making something up about me I dont know what to do this is still going on as of right now Im currently on spring break so we have time to deal with this but we dont know how and if theyre still here by the

1j6pyo0,I witnessed domestic violence and didnt do anything about it,I was walking home from school this was the 90s so we were all just walking around freely for miles and passed by the same neighborhoods I always passed There was this one small house on the left side of the road and coming up on it I could hear splitting noises like someone was being hit but I think I couldnt believe it until I actually got close enough There was this guy 20s maybe both of them standing over his wife or girlfriend on the front lawn she was lying down on her side and had her arm stretched out Then as I walked by slowly unable to stop for some reason he started beating and slapping her and grabbing her by the hair and yanking her towards the house He also kicked her multiple times I think he might have called her Alicia But the eerie thing was that she was surprisingly quiet about it not like crazy screaming but just like please stop You would think shed be screaming and crying out for help or something I remember that I was just walking in horror the guy didnt seem to notice me or if he did he didnt care I couldnt stop and I couldnt stop looking at them I think I was trying to figure out what street I was on but I had never thought to memorize the alley way streets so I didnt know The whole scene moved in slow motion but I still remember the entire beating the sounds the sounds of grass scraping the shape of his hands Just broad daylight at 3pm on a weekday front lawn no one else on the street but them and me springtime I ran home in tears and told my mom who just told me not to get involved When I tried to tell her that I think he was going to kill her she asked me what street and address this happened because if we report it Ill have to know all these things I had no idea so again she told me to mind my own business I was 10 or so when this happened and Im in my 30s now I still have the exact same fantasy memory of having gone back in time and instead of walking away and running away from the scene I get in between them and save her somehow If not save but at least make such a fuss that someone calls the cops Its always the same thing that I dont care if I get hurt in the process I would have done the brave thing Instead of what I actually did just run away in literal horror I feel so haunted by this scene I dont think Ill ever forget it for the rest of my life honestly,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 20:19:25 UTC,10,10,0.92,,CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCEDEATH,0,0

1j6yrtb,I feel stuck and I dont know what to do,Using a new account as I have people on my original account who know me irl and I dont want them to even come across this As the title says I really feel stuck at this point in my lifeIm currently 27 and turning 28 next week All of it started two years back when me and my then girlfriendlets call her M of 5 years started having a ton of arguments It was mainly regarding my admission process and my promise of hitting the gym I had quit my cushy job towards the end of 2022 to focus on my exams and my application process It was a frustrating time for me as I had a pretty good profileor so I was told and expected to get an admit from almost all the universities that I had applied to As it later turned out all my hopes got dashed as I only rejection after rejection In the middle of it there was a family function for which I had to travel to a different citythis is also the city where I did my undergrad from and M also lived To give a backstory we had been together since my sophomore year of undergrad and our relationship was a long distance oneWe only saw each other during classes when we were studying After graduation I had moved to a different city for work and went to my hometown when COVID hit us So during the time of this family event I planned to take out some time and planned a dinner with Mduring which I specifically told her that I didnt want to discuss my application process and that I was taking this trip as sort of a break Unfortunately our conversation ultimately went into that direction and what I thought would be a warm evening ended up with me feeling helpless and ultimately crying in the restaurant After the family event ended I travelled back to my city and then had a talk with her and we both decided well take a break and introspect why we were arguing almost on a daily basiswe specifically decided that we will not be seeing or planning to see anybody in that period but work on this and figure things out Almost a month later a mutual friend of ourslets call her C tells me that M actually went on a couple of dates to see peopleC and M were very close friends which broke the trust I had in the whole relationship and I told that my trust in us was broken and that we were done I developed this feeling of being inadequate and ended up getting addicted to porn to numb myself instead of studying and working on projectsMy whole routine was to hit the gym and work out till I felt pain in my body return back to home and sleep About a couple months later I learnt that it was C who had actually convinced M to go on dates and meet other people Furiously I cut contact with C and stopped any form of communication As far as things with M were concerned I was still too attached to her so we decided we can try to work on things Things changed a bit and I got an admission in a good university and started my postgrad journey here But during the winter of 2023 me and M again had some serious arguments and I decided to cut ties with her We still chatted on and off and she still told me she loved me Around 2 months from that time we tried to get back together again but ultimately I couldnt sustain it this timethe distance had become a pain turns out in a different country loneliness hits you like a truck And this time we broke up once and for all I felt and I still feel immense guilt for breaking up and putting her through a lot of pain I sank into a pretty low state got hooked to porn but studied enough to keep my grades up ultimately leaving any opportunity of upskilling myself or studying but kept sinking lower and lower Around a month back I talked to a therapist and told her about my guilt and that I had been in a state of feeling like I do not deserve anything nice because I hurt M and that I self sabotaged whenever anything good came in my life She heard all of my story and did tell me a lot of times when I was emotinally scarred and somewhat even manipulated by her as well Now that I see this I feel helpless I inflicted a lot of pain and self sabotage on myself and my addiction to porn has turned me into a very lazy person I know that deep down I have the potential to excel if I figure my shit out The thing is I am not able to I feel burnt outrecently even failed an interview at a reputed big tech company I hardly have energy to study reversed all the progress I made in the gym and somehow not able to shake off this addiction Its tough to put on a brave face and fake a smile telling my family that Im alright while Im numb deep down I want to cry and take some of the pent up emotions out but I simply cannot cry and give anyone a hint that Im not alright My family is very supportive and I dont want them to feel helpless knowing that Im not as good as I tell them Just wanted to take this feeling out Thank you so much for reading,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 03:37:44 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j786on,I 21 F got addicted to porn and read disgusting stuff when I was a minor and now I feel gross and disgusting,Throwaway account because I feel terrible about this When I was young 10 maybe and I got an Ipod I would love doing stuff on it But then I got into fanfiction and thus I got into porn I still love fanfiction to this day I also was able to gain access to porn sites Pornhub Xvideoes Spankbang etc My mom had to work long hours and my uncle mostly left me alone were both quiet it got more convinent when I got old enough to become a lackey kid 14 But that day I was in the mood for porn every chapter what I now know as PWP So I would type chapter large number and then put tits or ass and then search I was already seeing gross things I wasnt supposed to but then I found a website and it had adults engaging with minors I was aware that sort of thing was bad but this was written not visual I knew the visual stuff was terrible and never looked for that sort of thing But the written stuff I just kept reading it I justified it as its only weird if Im an adult I never visualized ACTUAL real life children I would think about other fictional characters not sure if thats better but I did But now Im an adult and I feel disgusting I NEVER want to hurt a child in that way I despise child molestors And yet I still read this stuff I stopped when I was about 1819 not sure spefically but I know I havent read that stuff in the past three years and I remember not being able to find the sites anymore which was good in the long run Lately Ive been feeling really gross Like Im disgusting and I should feel awful what I did Which I should Its gotten worse this past year I didnt really think about it I still read stuff where characters were underage but limited to just being in their teens someone on AO3 who does a bunch of Harry Pottercrossover girls stuff and another one who had his own website and was registered on Literotica I want to cut those people out of my reading too I feel horrible for what Ive done and read More context I live with my mother she knows about the video porn thing but not the written stuff Im a college student I cant drive I rideshare everywhere I WANT to get therapy but I dont want to spend money My mom has actually taken me to therapy a few times this problem hadnt affected me mentally yet for me to bring it up plus most of the time my mother was in room so I wouldnt have done so regardless I actually got diagnosed with anxiety But I assume the reason we dont make it a regular thing is because its expensive The best thing I feel I can do is go to hotlines Sometimes they do make me feel better Once I watched some YT video about someone who hurt animals and I thought I could handle it but the woman said this man also read stuff from one of the sites I found I never liked that I would avoid that if I saw it and I FELT DESPECIBLE The hotline got me a nice lady that told me some gentle things that made me calm down But then I read one of the guys I mentioned work on Literotica the characters were ACTUALLY OF LEGAL AGE and it felt like I relapsed Then I watched porn on a specific website for specific kink of me but when I was looking for something one of the videoes said teenage and I began to spiral Because of one hand not all pornsites are trustworthy but on the other 18 and 19 legal adult age could still be referred to as teenage so I was confused so I called them and the lady didnt want to help me and she transferred me to a warmline they were nice but they asked for my insurance which I wasnt expecting so I ended up feeling emotionally drained It came to a head when I woke up this morning and I was on my period and then I started feeling those thoughts that was disgusting while my body was in pain I couldnt call because my mother was still asleep So I texted my hotline and the woman said my problem wasnt something a hotline could fix so she sent me all these links to porn addiction stuff They either cost money or I felt they couldnt help me because they talked about this happening to men Alternatively they could help but my mother was still in the house so I still felt I couldnt do anything immediately And it really felt like no one could help me I even signed up for Betterhelp though I remembered they had controversy and signed out before telling my problem So I decided to post this on here I really dont want to hurt anyone I want to put that terrible part of my past behind me But sometimes I cant help but think about it and feel disgusting,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 13:58:23 UTC,0,7,0.5,,,0,0

1j7ce4s,Grieving biking season,For the past 2 years Ive been smoking weed almost daily I recently went through a lot of changes and in that I quit smoking and started taking supervised urine tests Among other things I knew that taking these tests meant I couldnt take my drivers license for at least a few months and that was okay with me What I didnt know is that it meant I couldnt drive at all until these tests were finished which is 6 months even tho I am clean My doctor failed to tell me or I failed to remember that I cant use the license for my motorcycle that i already have I recently met a guy who made my passion for driving motorcycles light up again I was so ready to get back on the bike bring it out of the garage change out the oil and have it in pristine condition I was so excited to spent a summer on two wheels while getting my life back on track and this time with someone to share the joy with In some ways it was part of my motivation for staying clean and having it ripped away in the span of a few google searches made it that much harder I feel so angry and stupid I feel like I should have known and I feel like it was obvious Yet I thought in some magical way that I could keep my excisting licence just not take another drivers test I was so ready for the freedom of driving to work and going on road trips Or just driving to the store without relying on commute or friends or having to walk for 15 minutes I know it really isnt the end of the world but the next 5 months is gonna be that much more challenging knowing I could have been on a bike if I hadnt admitted to my doctor that I smoked weed Im gonna call the doctors office tomorrow to see if Im correct in thinking I cant drive my motorcycle but Im scared of getting my hopes up Id rather sit with knowing Ill get told I cant drive than be let down again tomorrow But on the other side of things I probably wouldnt have quit if it wasnt for having to do this at some point either way It just sucks that Ill be done with these tests in September at the very end of the season,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 17:15:58 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j54haw,waited 6 hours for a 5 min with human services,Last year I think I was sent an email in December saying that I needed to send proof of income effectively tomorrow It was also a 2nd notice assuming the 1st one was lost in the mail I was already gathering that for a different service so I just made copies of the pay stubs waited an hour and turned in everything asked That is when I was told that I had been Flagged for something involving income and needed to see a medicare insurance adjuster I wondered if any were available and was told no and that I needed to come back tomorrow or call in I asked if I could make an appointment but was told none were available as due to holiday training and staff shortages we are unable to fill requests for appointments at the moment However I would put a note in my file that it was a late notice I asked if I could get an extraction as I never received proper notice I was then told Also due to staffing shortages and holiday training we cannot do extractions nor can we as we are not responsible for lost or delayed mail She then told me that the best option was to come in at 7 in the morning to be the first in line I told them that I work tomorrow and cant come in I was told I didnt have to but it would be at the small penalty of losing my medical and dental through California So I did that and was one of the first 15 people waiting in line for the doors to open in cold rainy weather I got a ticket and waited for about an hour thinking I could make it to work on time at 1030am I sat and told them I was there for a medical adjustment with a medicare insurance adjuster I was told they were not one and that the hours wait was to set an appointment I was told I could have called or come in earlier to have a specialist set it up I told them I tried yesterday and there were none available I was hit with Well its not my fault you poorly planned this Seeing as you had 2 weeks I told them about the late notice and a note in the file The man eyerolled me and just scribed out the latter on my ticket Telling me to expect my number to be called again in 2 hours and that in the future to be more mindful of prep and time management I called my boss he was surprised but was cool with me coming in later as long as I kept him updated And so I waited as eight became 9 and 9 became 10 I checked in as it should be around time for the meeting and was told due to a lack of adjusters today there will likely be unseen delays So I had just to wait and I skipped breakfast to get there messing with my phone and eating some of the fruit offered there I messaged my boss every half hour as he was skeptical that any department could wait this long by the 11 or 12th hour of the day they started giving out parking passes as the parking lot had a twohour limit and needed one There was a small argument between one of the managers and staff members about whether they should ask the ones here over the limit just to move their cars as they technically violate the parking code and we shouldnt be encouraging that behavior a 3rd staff member had to step in just to hand out the passes So by the 13th hour and a half when I was falling asleep and wondering how much of my shift I would have left someone poked me in the face and told me to look up A new number had popped up It was mine I go through the door with paperwork in hand to see the Ajestor about what the problem was It turns out they wanted to know if I had SSI payments and asked why I didnt have any from SSI I told her that I wasnt on SSI and she told me that was the problem When applying for Calcover I marked down that I had a federally recognized disability autism So they wanted to see if I was making too much for the program when I didnt show any SSI payouts i was flagged for possible fraud and they tried to ask me in person if I had any other forms of assisted living payouts or financial aid I told them i was disqualified due to being able to work So the adjustor told me that next time I needed to uncheck that box as legally for health care I didnt have a federally recognized disability as it implies Im getting federal aid So I waited nearly 6 hours for a 15minute meeting asking me not to say I have autism on a federal level My god why do we put people through this,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 19:57:51 UTC,2,2,1.0,,,0,0

1j847qz,Is it considered sexual assault,I was on a second date with a guy who I liked We had met before once it was fun and we had hooked up but didnt have sex because I am a virgin and I had clearly told him I am not ready for sex This time he didnt give me the same fun vibe but I wanted to hookup with him again because it was fun the previous time and honestly I was trying to let loose a little since I have usually been very uptight when it comes to dating I went to his house after and ofc things escalated I accept that I showed equal interest unlike last time and I was teasing him and flirting with him and kissing him But this time it was more about him and he didnt seem that interested in kissing me again and again like the first time He slightly persuaded me to give him a blow job which I really didnt want to but after one point I couldnt say no But I wasnt able to and I kept gagging and i remember telling him i cant He then got in between my legs and I told him that I wasnt ready for sex He reassured me that he wasnt going to do anything and he was just teasing me I remember telling him multiple times that I didnt want to have sex and I wasnt ready I trusted him and let him slightly penetrate me without going in But then he kept pushing in further It was hurting and again i tried stopping him but not very firmly He asked me if he could just feel me from the inside but would not thrust I dont think I said anything to that But eventually we did end up having sex And in fact he kept asking me to help guide him which I did as well So now its a very blurry line for me because I said no and I told him that I wasnt ready but then I also gave him a helping hand and also didnt say no while we were actually having sex The next morning also I didnt say anything and I in fact kept kissing him But later after coming home and finally processing i confronted him on text and called his upbringing into question He lashed out at me and said that I could have stopped it at any time and he just wasnt the one who was into it Another thing to note with be that he didnt show me any comfort or affection or asked me how I was feeling after sex In fact he didnt communicate with me at all He tried to cuddle me once but I got up and went outside to process things after which he didnt hug me properly even once or tried to cuddle me We slept separately the entire night and i felt so vulnerable and sad I never expected my first time to be like this Now I am just confused and sad and regretful at this point Also he did not use a condom and it was much later that I realised and when I told him he said he will pull out which he did I asked him in the morning if I needed to take the morning after pill and he said no But I ended up taking one anyway after reaching home,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 17:30:18 UTC,0,12,0.5,,,0,0

1j3day5,I have to watch my grandma die because she wont get a blood transfusion,Last Monday I watched my grandma from my dads side pass away early in the morning Now yesterday my grandma from my moms side landed in the hospital due to passing cysts and having a mass in her bladder She keeps passing a lot of blood and her option is basically surgery but since she is too weak for anesthesia she has to have a blood transfusion She is a JW Jehovah Witness and their big thing is they can accept any medical procedure or help besides blood transfusions We are in a small town and we have limited alternatives My grandma gave partial power of attorney to a couple people in her congregation including her brother which he is also part of that but more level headed We have a random guy from the Kingdom Hall that keeps coming to check on her but in reality he is making sure she doesnt accept the transfusion My mom and aunt are tired of him I talked to my grandma yesterday before leaving her and basically reassuring her even though she is 84 she still has an outstanding quality of life she drives lives on her own sees friends etc amp it would be okay to look the other way if it could save your life My grandma said maybe if I was younger After some thought I get it The KH is her community if she accepted the transfusion it wouldnt be a secret and I am sure they would disfellowship her and that would cause more harm I am sure I am just angry I am angry that I am losing another grandma in a 2 week span I am angry at her faith and the people in it I am just mad I havent dealt with a lot of death and now it feels like I am getting the ringer I learned a lot about these medicalethical dilemmas in school but I never thought itd happen in my family I always knew about the blood thing but id never thought my grandma would be in this situation TLDR I lost one grandma last week now my other grandma is in the hospital for a life threatening thing and she wont accept a blood transfusion because of her religion and her congregation put eyes on her and us to ensure we dont persuade her to do it Thank you for reading I just had to get this off my chest Everything will be ok in the end I know Death is apart of life Edit thank you everyone for your condolences and sharing your lived experiences around this A couple of things I know this religion was my grandmas whole life If she wants to go this way then in the end Ill support her I just cant fathom the influence of religion but I know that its not me I know she is at an old age and she will just get worse as years go on I guess it just kind of sucks that a religion is dictating on her medical problems But if she is happy then thats all that matters and I need to find a way to not be angry at her for it,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 15:28:15 UTC,116,51,0.91,,,0,0

1j3sl04,Thought I had i could win back my happiness but now I have such a gut wrenching wave of loneliness and shame,Since I was grade 3 there was almost been problems all my life Since growing up in a shitty environment I used to pray to get out of my living situation I had crazy family members causing scenes where the police would be called for noise complaints and question if i was getting abused From beg bugs to cockroaches filling the microwave I was so tired of it but knew I just had to thug it out Since gr38 teachers would have to question if everything was ok and i truly wondered if they were ever gonna call cps but i always hid it Then high school came around and had upgraded to a better living situation yet i felt so lonely I wasnt living with my parents and sometimes I just wanted their company despite the ruckus environment they have always caused However although i had a better living situation that was only thing that kept me happy and somewhat ok with my circumstances But high school ended and that was one of the darkest and traumatic moments of my life happened I realize I had large sums of money stolen from family members as well a spiral of physical trauma from that year From then I knew I had to add meaning to my life so I started working community based jobs and eventually researched getting into health care specifically med school ik a common dream many teens have in education but rarely achieve However I believed i could do it Now enrolled in post secondary i had big goals and was so fixated on getting one thing the typical rags to riches shitty environment to respectable status However one club i went to fucked me up story is in my profile Although it may seem like an overreaction and a story nothing to worry about it really fucked with my mental I overthink so much and made me feel like garbage worthless and scum Now after all these years I decided to call my mental health services at the uni i am enrolled in since I literally had a panic attack before class and started throwing up in the washroom Tomorrow is my first appointment and idk if this is gonna help my mental Idk if i ever had clinical depression plus i never went to see a psychiatrist to diagnose me I am writing all of this because i truly dont where to go online to vent I feel like a failure and wondered if i am ever gonna achieve the american dream or be stuck at the bottom of the totem pole I am trying my best to seem like a good human being but everything going really affects my perception of myself I hope I can show my parents I am worth something,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 02:24:42 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j7fdqt,My exgirlfriend gaslit me while relationship while cheating on me found out on my birthday,My m24 now exf26 girlfriend started dating in March last year I had just come out of a toxic situationship where I take part blame I was a bad communicator Im sure I still am but I gained some communication skills I really liked her found my now ex 3 weeks later I knew it would be a rebound but it helped so much Especially considering this girl had been my crush since 8 years ago when I had first started working with her We had so much fun early on trips going out eating out It started to feel less like a rebound and something of a real relationship Unfortunately it came to her moving out of her moms house She needed a place to go and me with my somewhat trust issues was scared to let her move in with her friends which were one girl and two guys She had been known to get around but I trusted her more than most people did and had hope She was very kind had many mental issues but nothing I couldnt stand I had grown up with childhood trauma and this seemed like nothing So me with my trust issues and wanting to move out of my moms house as well took her offer of renting a place together It seemed fun and I had just started a career job so it seemed like a good time Found out very quickly it would not be See my ex well call Fiona had severe insecurities and drinking issues not to mention drug addiction I had known to some extent but not to this severity The first week we moved in I wanted to have a get together party for our first place together Turns out Fiona hates having people in her space She was very quiet the whole night and near the end she stormed off to the room where Id get yelled at when I head to bed She scream at me in bed as I had work the next morning I told her sorry and wed talk about it tomorrow She got up and stormed out the room I was just happy for the quiet until I hear her screaming my name and yelling help Help I storm out seeing her wrist covered in blood with it spilling all over the floors I help her best I can she didnt hit an artery so it soon stopped but left a nasty scar After this night most nights especially when we went out I would get no rest being accused of cheating or just not giving her enough love Over the next few months one of our mutual friends decided a surprise birthday party for her I honestly wasnt thinking to hard about it I just thought maybe itd make her happy forgetting she didnt like people in her space Same thing happened She was upset the whole night stayed in the bedrooms and never came out Through out the night you could hear her screams saying get out of my house In the most embarrassing way possible Her sister was there and tried to calm her down the whole night which did not work I eventually got everyone out because the music was barely covering it up I went to bed again Same thing yelling at me She got up stormed out I was worried but thought that it was a one time thing Nope I instantly hear my name being screamed This time much worse I come out to see the cut is even deeper attempt to stop the bleeding but it just wont I call 911 while making a makeshift tourniquet to try and stop it The paramedics get her after the police which was someone I knew I told them about how she was saying before that she wanted to die I didnt think this was an attempt but a callout I took her to the hospital after the medics said she didnt need the ambulance after patching her up Stayed up all night at the hospital dropped her off at home then went to work I was miserable I couldnt stand this anymore I didnt want to break the lease but at the same time I also still cared for this girl I felt bad I needed a way out that night was my chance but you just couldnt leave her alone she cried and begged me So we continued our relationship A few months later same thing yelling at me and saying I dont give her enough affirmations and accusing me of deleting snapchats and sneaking people in when shes off at work Which led to a night that she destroyed my tv in the living room put holes in the walls and screamed at me in my face I was done I left to stay at my friends house Told her to leave wed figure out the situation after The day after she said she needed time to move and wanted to talk I went over and we talked the whole night She promised shed get therapy and help And I felt so terrible I truly loved this girl but it was such a toxic relationship I gave her one last chance We decided to stick together agreeing to talk things out more See I still have my trust issues and being accused of things makes me curious why its that in particular I memorized her password months ago but never really felt the need to look through her phone I had it just in case But I was working one night straight shift She went out with her friends Acted very strange to me and I just felt something was off I come home at 7am find her dead asleep Couldnt even wake her up to give her a kiss She had left her phone on my side of the bed I felt the urge to look through it Went through it for hours Finding hidden messages in messenger of her taking to her ex saying how she thinks about him everyday and that she needs him Other messages to her OTHER ex on Snapchat came across it by chance because it had been cleared and muted It was of last night being very flirty and him leaving hearts and her pictures with her hearting back Her saying I miss you and then a phone call about 6 minutes lasting I called this number I asked him to be straight up if shes cheating He sounded dumbfounded but said she wasnt and that they were just friends that use to date But I found pictures dating only right before we started dating that they were kissing and all over eachother I woke her up absolutely heated Ngl this was probably the angriest Ive ever been I told her what I had seen She of course denied it Eventually admitting that it was cheating but they never had sex Which I absolutely think is a lie But I said it was over and she took it so easily She nodded and called her mom got her stuff in the car then laughing about a joke she made saying shes tired of constantly moving All while I sit and wait for her to leave Also if I didnt mention this happened ALL ON MY BIRTHDAY She leaves not answering any of my questions like why how could you do this Since then Ive been sitting here she still left a few things and needs a truck to come pick them up She just texted me that shes coming today to pick them up I still feel like shit but can hold my emotions

1j789eo,I think Im falling out of love,Im so lost I know relationships are never easy but Im just starting to think that maybe we didnt meet at the right time in each others lives I have so many insecurities in regards to being included in outings Her communication is really lacking and forgoes telling me how she feels about things Our most recent disagreement has been in regards to travel we cant come to a compromise and find a balance between her travelling with her and also my friends with time for us to spend together We promised wed travel with each other after this year fell through for similar reasons Instead I had to leave it at she will go with her friends instead of me Im hurt because it feels like she doesnt want to go away with me but shes hurt because I think that Shes promised to do better and apologised so many times for not communicating I feel like our bad times are more frequent than the good I want to push through because she is so loving caring and sweet but Ive got a massive piece missing rn and if I explain this to her she breaks down and stops talking entirely Im stuck I know I am so far from a bastion of perfection in this relationship but I just cant help but be frustrated and saddened by this Today I was sick and quite feverish so I spent a while thinking back to a past relationship While Im absolutely over that girl I just couldnt help but reminisce about how that short relationship three years ago made me feel I do hold it in very high regard because I was in the wilderness prior to it alone and totally confused about my place in the world before she showed me so Im now quite nostalgic about what she was for me especially now my needs just arent being met That girl and I met in the wrong time and the wrong circumstances to last but we ended very amicably I know its horrible and so unfair for my gf as well as the previous girl to keep thinking like this I love spontaneity and random intimate things and I have told her this but never does she ask me to come over for a karaoke drive at midnight with the windows down Never does she say she wants to spend the night with me somewhere random I sometimes ask but its usually a no I feel like Im right back to where I was preprevious relationship and Im lost and so sad I want to make things better and I know constantly comparing my last relationship to my current is really poor I know Im focusing on the negative things she does I know I could be better but Im so fucking demotivated bc she just doesnt talk and we just dont go out to do things Then a rift forms and I have to be the one to try and pull it back and then shes extremely upset and scared that I might leave her or she thinks shes a bad person I cant say how I really feel because of that It takes days for our usual fun side to return and then theres a couple weeks of good Rinse and repeat Longterm relationships are loads of battles to stay in love Some are so much harder but I do love her Though is it worth losing parts of who you are when Im this age Im emotionally exhausted by the constant confusion and stress of slow and lacking communication as well as my physical needs just not being met Im 23 so Im not looking to waste her or my time any longer if this just wont work I like solving things but this feels like its becoming bigger than me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 14:02:11 UTC,2,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j6pwmy,My sister invited our brother to her wedding even though she knows how I feel about him,Recently my sister got engaged and she asked me to be a part of her bridal party Initially I was very excited to have a role in her wedding kind of still am but now Im feeling iffy because she invited our brother who I dont have a positive relationship with For context Im the youngest out of the three of us and we were raised by a single mother who worked a lot Because of this my sister took a lot of responsibility over us when our mother couldnt Shes like a second mother to me and my brother even though she shouldnt have been My brother on the other hand was kind of a weirdo growing up He dressed alternatively and had nerdy interests something that youngerme at the time thought was really cool and was all around awkward I was maybe 8 and he was 14 when he started getting curious with his body and that eventually led to him sexually assaulting me It didnt happen for long thank god but the experience left a disgusting stain on me Eventually I realized that what had happened to me was wrong and it wasnt until I was 13 that I finally had the chance and courage to talk to someone I was removed from my home and placed in a childrens psych unit and my case was being handled by a social worker Of course they informed my mother who then told a few others my sister included I didnt know this at the time but some of the adults around her pressured her into convincing me to recant my statement So when she visited me she asked me to do just that I was obviously so betrayed and angry she was my role model and the one person I relied on the most at the time I cant recall the rest of our conversation I just remember leaving the visitation area and completely losing it in my room But I was young impressional and ruminating a lot at this time so I did end up recanting my statement My case worker didnt agree with my decision but respected it anyway For the sake of procedure my case was still investigated but without the victims statement it fell through It didnt erase anything that happened to me but it felt like it did with how everyone else around me went about their lives like nothing happened It was jarring and fucked with my head and I slowly started believing that I made the whole thing up for attention My memory wasnt the best and it couldve just been a messed up dream I had I started feeling disgusted and I couldnt trust myself anymore and I began spiraling Fastward to when I was 17 I was hospitalized for almost taking my life For some reason this was much more serious than before I was finally put on medication and was put into a program for other atrisk teens It was through group therapy I started thinking about getting closure for myself so after a lot of mental and emotional preparation I confronted my brother At the last minute I decided to record the conversation without him knowing and I actually got a confession I went to my social worker and after a few days he was removed from the house After that I was both relieved and stressed by the events that came next To be honest I didnt follow too closely with the court proceedings I couldnt bring myself to care what happened to him all I remember was being interviewed by SVU and getting monthly check ups by social services But the whole ordeal was mentally and emotionally draining for me and my family My mom couldnt believe it at first and briefly experienced religious psychosis but no one took it harder than my sister I guess she felt guilty because 1 such a serious thing happened between two of her siblings right under her nose and 2 she didnt have my back when I first came forward about it I dont blame her or anyone really for not noticing what was happening I cant bring myself to blame anyone no one wants to believe that someone you love is capable of something as horrible as sexual assault A few years have passed since then and Ive been working on improving my mental health My sister was my rock throughout the process the most understanding of me and my circumstances and after a while I thought I had made peace with the whole situation until her wedding My sisters decision to invite our brother after years of nocontact between the two of us kind of blindsided me Not because I didnt expect her to but because she didnt tell me Now heres the thing I would never ask my sister to choose between me or our brother I understand that she loves the both of us despite what had happened so to ask her to do that wouldnt be fair But I wouldve liked a headsup I had to ask her myself if he was coming and Im glad I did The thought of walking into the venue and seeing him in the crowd without warning wouldve sent me into a panic And because of this I started to rethink my relationship with her Shes done a lot for me and Ill go as far as to say that she has a bigger impact on me than our mother does I want to give her some grace for this but I still feel so uncomfortable with his presence Hes also still in good standing with our extended family who dont know of the situation so the possibility of them joking around and having fun with him without knowing what hes done doesnt sit right with me I most likely wont do anything regarding my sisters wedding because I dont want to ruin her big day but itll probably change the way I see her Like I said I wont ask her to choose between me or him but that doesnt mean I cant Its a scary realization that my relationship with my sister can change I really dont want it to but I cant ignore how shes willing to look past what our brother has done to me when I havent I want to start by having a proper conversation with her about this first though after the wedding I want to fully understand her side of the story and her perspective before making this big decision I honestly dont know what to expect or hope for but I feel like if I dont do something then all the improvement Ive made will come undone and I dont think Ill recover this time,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 20:16:48 UTC,281,94,0.97,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j4nzfg,Spent the weekend with someone special and I regret it,I 36f went on a weekend trip with this guy 43m He lived abroad most of his life so he doesnt know our tourist destinations that well We went to this tiny town that everyone who lives here has been to multiple times and because it was a long weekend everything was fully booked so our hotel was far away from the towns center I liked him for almost half a year but Ive known him for years he is one of my favorite artists and he has a very niche IG account We met in person last year and we were both awe struck about each other when we met like I couldnt believe how handsome he was in person and he kept asking me to hug him I could feel him smelling my hair I went to visit him while I was abroad in his city back in January and when I saw him he totally tricked me into getting to his apartment and well We ended up doing it But I didnt want to catch feelings for him so I decided not to visit him again while I was in his city He then decided to come visit here for the long weekend Hes pretty handsome and definitely draws female attention to him and he always tells me about all the girls that approach him in public I guess he wants to make me jealous Anyway I punch back and I tell him about the guys I date Dumb little game I know So this weekend we went on this trip together since he doesnt know his way around I had to be on top of the booking I booked two separate bedrooms My plan was to have a nice weekend with him and NOT GET ATTACHED because tbh hes way too handsome and I dont think I could manage all the jealousy that comes with having someone like him as a partner The getaway went ok We couldnt get our hands of each other but my poor planning skills ruined some parts of the trip and he was noticably irritated but didnt blame it on me I ended up knowing him better we had long talks he was very sweet to me He showed me some of his work unedited We talked about our childhoods and all At some point he said something like I know that for you this is something superficial and when I asked him what he meant he said that he knew I was there for the sex and that I only used guys for pleasure I told him that I actually had admired him for years and that I wasnt at all interested in sleeping with him when we first met I was just so glad to meet one of my favorite artists And I did tell him I cared deeply about him but I knew that I wasnt special for him at all either and I had no reason to believe he wanted anything else than just having a good time with me as he is surrounded by beautiful woman all the time I was just the flavor of the week He seemed a bit offended by that comment he said he doesnt see girls that way and that he only opens up to someone special We agreed that we both like each other and we both café for each other so that the best thing would be to take advantage of the time together and maybe do physical stuff while we still can when we have the chance but remain good friends until were old I dont know it was a weird conversation and i cant shake the feeling that he was just trying to make me say that I was in love with him or something because of his narcissistic nature I have shielded my heart from guys like him years ago because I know falling for them doesnt ever end well Anyway at the end of the trip we couldnt get a bus back to our city and he got pretty mad I felt awful and I wasnt looking forward to spend the next 3 hours next to him being mad But he explained to me that it was just his survival skills nothing personal He went back to being all touchy feely and even told me he had referred to me as his wife to some lady who asked him who I was to him I told him he was full of it I knew he was just trying to manipulate me He fell asleep on my lap for most of the trip holding my hand while I caressed his hair He drooled on my pants and he was so embarrassed haha so sweet And then Once we arrived and left the bus he just asked me if I could get a bus to my place from where we were Plain and cold I said yeah so he just turned around and said see ya then No kiss no hug nothing I called him out on it he turned around gave me a small peck kiss and then went away I was just in awe about how he could just shift from being so sweet to basically abandoning me there like as I was some stranger I think thats what really bothers me We shared some good moments and I opened up about my feelings for him I told him that maybe we couldnt be good as a couple because neither one of us is willing to settle down but that I did want him in my life as a friend as I admired him too much And he agreed But the way he left me there just made me feel like he never really cared And I am here now as a 36 yo woman crying like a teenager because I feel I lost someone I was really starting to care about I know I cant get his heart Im not special Im not as pretty and I am old so I dont even entertain the idea of him ever falling for me and I know I knew since we started this whole thing to prevent myself from getting hurt but I did want to be able to maybe go out with him for coffee and talk about art for years I wanted a friendship Im so confused I guess I just wanted to write about it and get it off my chest so that it doesnt eat me anymore I dont want to and I also cant tell my friends because he is kind of famous in our circles and one of my best friends told me he was a major player so I should stay away from him and Im kind of embarrassed of how it played out I miss him I messaged him a few hours after I got home back from our trip he just put a heart react on my message and that was it I dont think I can push it anymore I should wait for him to write me and Im dying thinking he might never write again Ah well I ended up being hurt

1j6vs1y,I 26f cant feel sexual pleasure anymore and its killing my relationship,basically what the title says Ive slowly lost sensitivity since we got married 4 years ago I thought at first it was due to my depression so I got therapy Then after overcoming depression I was still experiencing very lownonexistent libido no sensitivity nothing It didnt matter if I was on my antidepressants or not before during and after it was about the same I used to be able to enjoy sex and finish but now I cant even remember the last time I finished at all No Im not interested in masturbation nor has that ever done anything to me My husband has gotten mad at me over the years and accused me of being asexual or lesbian which I dont think is the case because I KNOW I am sexually attracted to men and not women and Ive experienced normal sexual response cycles many times before especially as a teen I did save myself for marriage if that makes any difference I then thought well maybe its not my depression maybe its sexual trauma from seeing and hearing my parents doing it a lot after they always told me sex was bad religious upbringing and so I went to a sex therapist and she said she couldnt help me I had another therapist after that who I really liked and helped with everything else in my life except my ability to enjoy sex have a sex repsonse cycle despite thoroughly discussing that topic and my traumatizing experiences as a child with my parents I went to my primary care doctor and he basically told me there were no meds except one that costs 1000 a dose and only has a 10 chance of working He did blood work on my hormone levels and those were all normal so basically no one can help me and it leads to dissatisfaction on both sides of this relationship and makes me so sad I feel like I should just divorce my husband so he can find a functional woman who can have and enjoy sex with him,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 00:54:53 UTC,1,7,1.0,,,0,0
1j6sqzk,Years ago I had a close call with a motorcyclist Now I cant stop worrying about it Am I overthinking,I recently remembered an event from the past and I havent been able to stop thinking about it It happened a long time ago so its possible that what I remember is not exactly what actually happened A few years ago in 2022 when I was 14 I was coming home from school with some friends when an idiot thought it would be funny to open my backpack and ring a doorbell without telling me Immediately afterward everyone started running I quickly zipped up my backpack and for some reason I dont remember I decided to cross the road to the other sidewalk instead of running forward Maybe it was because there were too many people in front of me making it difficult to run quicklyI dont know I really dont remember The thing is as soon as I stepped onto the road an older man on a motorcycle appeared right in front of me just a few meters away I moved away as fast as I could and got back onto the sidewalk where I had been before I think I remember the driver swerving a little when he got scared after seeing me though Im not entirely sure about this I didnt hear any noise that would suggest the man had fallen nor did I hear a scream of painjust a Me cago en la madre which roughly means For fs sake in Spanish which I believe means he kept driving I think The problem is that I dont know if I started running once I stepped back onto the sidewalk which could have prevented me from noticing an accident if it happened But its more likely that I stayed still after stepping away from the roadat least long enough that I would have noticed if anything had happened Im not sure what exactly happened in that moment It all happened so fast and its been a few years since then When I saw the idiot who opened my backpack again all he did was laugh I guess he saw what happened in some way and thats why he made fun of me when we met again Or maybe I told him about it and then he started laughingI dont remember I also seem to recall that I had two other friends behind me on the other side of the road and when they caught up with us they were laughing too If what I remember is correct that would mean nothing actually happened I got home feeling like an idiot but at no point did I think I might have caused an accident Ive walked through that area dozens of times since then and while I wasnt specifically looking I never noticed any signs that an accident had happened I also searched online for news from that year in my city and I didnt find anything similar to what I experienced I never heard anyone mention that day again which reinforces my belief that nothing actually happened I recently remembered this incident and I think Im becoming paranoid Im scared by the possibility that the man could have had a serious accident or that someone nearby might have been hurt since it was a very busy area at that time with lots of cars and many kids coming back from school Ive been really worried for the past few days and I honestly feel bad about it Do you think Im just being paranoid I need someone to reassure meIm a bit scared,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 22:27:28 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j657gu,Am I being used,Am I being used Do I 26F need a reality check Ive been friends with my friend Blake 26M for over a year now We have been pretty close since the beginning When we first met we bonded over our shared love for playing soccer together and music I would say we have many similarities We both enjoy adult animation like Studio Ghibli raves and playing board games Since we shared many similarities we kept in touch daily through text messages phone calls and FaceTime We had a mutual friend named Jennifer Jennifer and I were very close until I noticed that whenever we spent time together she spoke negatively about everyone around her As a result I gradually distanced myself from her Around the same time Jennifer and Blake started dating Although I wasnt close to Jennifer and didnt personally like her I wanted Blake to be happy Blake and I maintained a consistent relationship and communication We talked every day even during our lunch breaks via FaceTime However things took a turn when Jennifer informed Blake that I had feelings for him and wanted to pursue a romantic relationship with him That was not the case and I was even in a relationship at the time As a result Blake ended our communication to preserve his relationship with Jennifer We did not talk for eight months However in January he reached out to me He told me that Jennifer suddenly broke up with him in December Since then weve been hanging out again In February we attended a rave and ended up having sex that night A week later we confessed to each other that we had both harbored feelings for one another since weve first met At this point I informed him that I didnt want to be a rebound and he responded by stating that he wasnt ready for a relationship and wanted to focus on healing I accepted his decision We continued spending time together and continued having sex However I later told him that I no longer wanted to have sex with him because I was struggling to separate our friendship and romantic feelings Around the same time his exgirlfriend Jennifer filed a protective order against Blake Sidebar Personally I have had past experiences with abusive men which may have influenced my perspective However I must admit that I am not entirely aware of the details of Jennifer and Blakes relationship Given Jennifers personality I cant help but wonder if this situation is a attentionseeking ploy On the other hand I have only heard Blakes side of the story However I suggested that we establish boundaries We agreed to refrain from having sex and I told him I need a break from constant communication I also told him to fine another trusted friend to confide in about the Jennifer situation because I havent healed from my own trauma from the abusive I had endured Blake expressed his agreement to the physical boundaries and expressed he didnt want to lose me again and our friendship Since implementing these boundaries our relationship has undergone a significant change We dont talk that much anymore and when we do the protective order case seems to be the main topic of discussion Although last night I visited Blakes place to watch Star Wars During the movie he asked me to engage in a platonic cuddle We did and he said Thank you I inquired about the reason behind his gratitude He mentioned that my presence was naturing and made him feel less lonely Am I only in his life because he feels lonely,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:52:22 UTC,2,4,1.0,,,0,0
1j5q831,Parents called me a communist for wanting more hours on my job,I 17M am a Filipino and have been living in Canada for about 6 months now Just last month did I finally land a job at the deli in a supermarket after months of seemingly endless jobhunting However my manager at the deli is lets just say a not very nice person Shes very condescending and pretty much just has something against the students that work in the deli me included Her very obvious and not well hidden hatred towards the students finally came to a full fruition when she scheduled ALL the students for the rest of the month just less than 10 hour shifts a week In fact one of us was even getting just 4 HOURS in a week Its not like we were being greedy or anything All of us need the money One of us needs it to buy insurance for his new car and another one of us needs it to buy a new car I need it to pay the internet bills in my house help my parents with their payments and maybe soon buy a PC for myself When I saw my schedule for the rest of the month as expected I was pissed I mean seriously We havent really been slacking off either all of us even do our jobs arguably well When we went to ask our manager about it she was supposed to STILL be at work another one of the employees at the deli said she already TOOK OFF Of course we are planning to ask her about the schedules tomorrow But when I told my parents about it they were not happy They thought I was asking for too much Of course I was once again pissed For someone who works as a STUDENT and earning MINIMUM WAGE helping his OWN PARENTS PAY THEIR BILLS I think I should atleast have SOME right to extend my hours no But no of course not When I told them it should be MY RIGHT to ask my manager for those few extra hours they then went to comparing me to protesters No joke heres how the conversation went Dad What if the next time I start seeing you on the streets holding a placard What if you end up like those pink protesters back home Referring to what happened back in the Philippine presidential elections Me I dont think it will go THAT far Besides even if it does I think protesting about our hours should also be a part of our rights no Mom What are you thinking The way youre thinking now youre gonna end up a member of the NPA A Philippine communist terrorist organization Now this made me even more pissed But to my parents credit they DID try to diffuse the situation How did they do that Why by insulting the way I do my chores at home of course They said I needed to Prove myself at home first Do the chores well first Like huh I already do my jobs to the best of my ability as far as I know I dont really know what else I need to prove at home I mean I guess fair enough I suppose theres still a few things to work on I guess Just so yall know I DID consider telling them that my manager was a notsonice person But considering they already called me a communist for wanting more hours I dont even wanna KNOW what they would wanna call me if I complained about my manager Just do your job and bow down to your bosses thats their motto after all Not even joking Honestly my brainrotted side thinks this is pretty funny but it kinda made me feel bad at the time My parents would literally rather compare their own child to a bunch of terrorists rather than siding with them Amazing TLDR Manager is an asshole gave me bad hours and when I told my parents I was gonna ask for more hours they compared me to communist terrorists,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 15:03:46 UTC,20,10,1.0,,,0,0
1j7knoh,Reconnecting with someone but Im so sensitive to their teasing comments,Not really looking for any advice on this I just need to vent as I dont feel its a big enough deal to bring it up to them grinning_face_with_sweat Ive recently been talking to someone I lost touch with ages ago We used to be extremely close and always teased each other jokingly But since reconnecting with them Ive just been feeling a lot more sensitive to their comments It feels silly as I know they dont mean anything bad by their words but I just find myself wondering if they even really like me as a person or if theyre judging me Couple of examples I have pet cats and this friend knows I love them Theyve never liked cats which is fine They sent over a funny video of a cat but that somehow devolved into them telling me how much they hate cats and talking about how they also thought cats made their owners bitches etc I just tried to brush it off and joke back defending my stance on cats a little bit This isnt the first time Ive had to hear about someones grievances with cats but its just such a conversation killer for me Like cool you hate the animals I happen to really like I am so glad you have given me this reminder lol The other thing that bothered me a bit was just a comment that made me feel like they thought I was immature I said something like Oh this slaps and they immediately said Dont say that youre 31 Its such a small thing but I guess Ive always been a bit anxious about seeming mature enough to people so it did sting a bit I imagine a lot of this is just my own anxieties getting the best of me as well as the fact that its been so long that were almost strangers in a lot of ways I guess I dont really know what they think do me anymore If you made it this far thanks for reading grinning_face_with_sweat,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 23:19:06 UTC,1,0,0.67,,,0,0

1j3l2lo,I went on web cam sites and I still wonder if I did something wrong,Sorry for the vague language but I had to comply with the rules I have also posted this in a other subreddit I started going on webcam site similar to Omegle to help with my social anxiety and practice interacting with people I hoped this would help me become more comfortable in social situations Over time I began to encounter people who were engaging in intimate or suggestive content This caught me off guard and I wasnt sure how to react I became curious about the behavior and started interacting with others who seemed to be open to these types of discussions One day I was matched with a person who mentioned that they were looking for an intimate conversation I felt curious Later I was matched with someone who was revealing more of their body on camera I asked Is this real and she replied Yes this is real I asked Can you show me more She said No what the heck Im not going to do that and skipped Soon after I discovered an adult website with private oneonone chats and began talking to women with intimate intent I started asking them to reveal more and some did without hesitation Afterward I went and did the deed to the imagination of what I saw Shortly after I suddenly worried What if they were underage I got extremely concerned and wanted to find them again but I had no way of doing so I initially thought that if people were engaging in these kinds of interactions they must be adults I investigated the website and found out that they verify users ages with ID I returned to the platform and began asking women how old they were They all told me they were over 18 I reported the site to local authorities expressing concerns about potential illegal activity although I didnt have solid proof The authorities investigated the site and found no evidence of any wrongdoing Interpol did an investigation on the site and found no evidence of wrongdoing either The anxiety grew worse and I seriously considered reporting myself to the police in hopes that they could investigate and determine whether I had interacted with anyone underage I also began questioning whether I had at any point unknowingly gotten exposed to minors in that way I began taking SSRIs and anti anxiety meds to manage my anxiety and started therapy When I felt better I returned to the site the one that is similar to Omegle again to engage with people Shorty after I was again matched with people who were wanting to have suggestive conversation and revealing more of their body both men and women I initially skipped but got curious and felt excited againI promised myself that I would never ask anyone to do anything and if I had any suspicion that someone might be lying about their age I would immediately skip them Eventually I was matched with someone whose video was black but they seemed to be suggesting that kind of behavior with emojis I asked them how old they were and they responded 15 I immediately skipped I got matched with someone after She had her torso visible and then she lifted her shirt exposing part of her body I asked How old are you but she skipped me immediately I was left feeling distressed I was using the site without clear age verification hoping to meet people who were showing intimate content while also being aware of the risk that there could be someone underage experimenting The next day I reached out to a sex counselor and confided in her about my concerns I started crying on the phone realizing that I had crossed personal boundaries in my behavior just because I was curious Despite this I still find myself wondering whether any of the women I interacted with on the webcam site were underage My anxiety continues to distort my memory and I wonder What if they were 17 Or 16 Or even younger Sometimes these thoughts become overwhelming and I question whether I might have missed signs that would have indicated their true age Someone might say You would have noticed if they were much younger but what if I didnt I think what is the hardest is while struggling with this I dont know how to reach out for help Dont get me wrong I brought this upon myself How would others react to this,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 20:45:28 UTC,1,1,0.99,,,0,0
1j7qf3k,I caught my boyfriend masturbating to other women,I know this doesnt seem like a big deal but my heart hurts This weekend I was using his phone to look up a restaurant and I saw in his search historybar that he looked up at least 2 specific womens only fans leaked And he clicked on multiple websites just to find these womens leaked images I also thought to look at his twitter after finding this out and saw he looked them up there too Between these 2 women he clicked on at least 10 different websites to find these womens leaked photos the funniest part is that me and these women look nothing alike These women are beautiful dark hair dark eyes While Im a redhead with blue eyes Our bodies are completely different as well I just feel ugly He was saying all men do it but I dont believe that It just hurts that he sought these women out hard to find pictures of them to pleasure himself to when weve been in a committed relationship I know this is a controversial thing among people but Ive always thought why do you feel the need to pleasure yourself to other women when you have me And finding out these women look nothing like me just makes me feel not good enough and it makes me feel so ugly He knows Ive battled with weight and eating disorders and I feel like this is making it worse and it is torturing me The worst part to me is he sought so hard for pictures of them when he went across multiple social media platforms to find them and pleasure himself and knowing they dont look like me and knowing hes in a committed relationship How can I believe when he calls me beautiful yet pleasures himself to women that look nothing like me EDIT his needs are being met someone told me I should mention this as well but I can assure you his needs are met with how much we go at it Also he doesnt like me masturbating to other men So I dont masturbate to other men but he is masturbating to other women even though I dont like it So Im also upset about that because I followed his wishes but he doesnt follow mine,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 04:18:16 UTC,17,238,0.53,,,0,0
1j7kg52,The saddest part of not getting unconditional love from your parents is that youre not getting it anywhere else,I have a few friends who are very close to their parents and they know their parents love them and are their 1 biggest fan no matter what they do Its very fascinating to witness and simultaneously upsetting because I cant help but compare it to my own situation My parents have never been the affectionate loving type but I didnt realize just how little they cared for me until I moved out of the family home before marriage Coming from a very conservative Muslim culture this is looked down on because people assume you are living away from your family as a single woman to do haram forbidden activities in the religion However I just wanted to have my own space and be independent thats all My parents did not take it well my mother told me I was selfish and deserve everything bad in life for abandoning them This was over a year ago and the relationship is still quite strained Ive called a few times since and my mother was super rude and irritated like I was bothering her for calling her So I stopped and I havent spoken to my family in a few months Im not sure how you can claim to love your child and practically disown them for wanting to live their own lives So I know now I am not loved by them Its really sad to not receive unconditional love from your parents because you will never get unconditional love anywhere else Not from friends not even from your spouse You will forever feel unloved and worthless Most relationships are fickle and very conditional You family is meant to be your rock But I have none Sometimes I wonder why I am even in this world,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 23:09:14 UTC,185,23,1.0,,,0,0

1j42ewg,It feels like I was SAd even though it probably wasnt sa,The whole thing happened over 10 years ago and I had actually repressed the situation pretty well until my ex messaged me again recently Now I think about it every day and have panic attacks because of it Back then we werent together yet but he knew that I was in love with him One evening we were at his best friends place and the two of them were smoking a bong They wanted me to smoke as well I asked what it was and they said weed Being stupid I took a hit but whatever it was it definitely wasnt weed At first I got extremely dizzy then I couldnt move anymore and I started panicking inside because I couldnt speak or even breathe After about 10 minutes his best friend told him to check if I was still breathing which he did When he confirmed that I was still breathing the other guy left the room to go to sleep Thats when my ex started undressing me and then had sex with me It must have lasted for several hours and towards the end I was somewhat conscious again and could have said something But I didntI just couldnt At some point he stopped and I went home I had never felt as horrible lying in my own bed as I did after that night Afterward I desperately wanted to be with himprobably because I thought it would somehow undo what had happened About a year later we actually got together But maybe Im overinterpreting the situation After all he knew I loved him so maybe he thought I wanted it too Ill probably talk to my therapist about it but Im afraid Im making it into something bigger than it actually was Besides it was my fault too I dont know I just wanted to get it off my chest,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 12:55:19 UTC,0,4,0.25,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j6yegx,i think i ruined the friendship between my sister and her best friend,another long post for context myf18 sister17 and her best friendf15 almost 16 lets call her Dana have been friends for almost a decade theyve always spent a lot of time together because our moms were friends the last few years have been very very rough for Dana and weve always been here for her especially my sister and that made them even closer so today during lunch my sister came to my mom and asked her if she could go out for a party night with Dana and her friend group BUT here in italy there are two stages of the party the first one is open to everyone the second one is only 18 and she wanted to go right to the second one that begins around midnight my mom immediately said no and my sister started whining saying that Dana went there too a few weeks ago and guess how she did that fake ID and some connections and that surely didnt help to have a yes as an answer a few hours ago i was with my sister and Dana just talking until my sister asked my thought about going to that party at that hour and i said honestly i dont approve that not because youre going there but because youre gonna do it illegally and she got angry saying that she wanted to do that experience because shes a teenager and blah blah blah to which i replied yeah youre a teenager and have to do your experiences but you can make them on the first half of the night where you can go without any problem and i think she expected me to be the cool older sister because she got angry and it only got worse when my brother21 also said he agreed with me so she went upstairs and i stayed with Dana so i started talking with her about all this the conversation then went to my sisters general behaviour and we went to my room to talk more liberally after a while we were talking about how she my sister almost never wants to go out unless one of us has weed or cigarettes and stuff like that and thats when i told her something i had forgot last august they both were at home my best friend was there as well and we were all chilling in the backyard when Dana told my sister that she had to go to herDanas place that she promised that but my sister was whining about it saying she didnt feel like it but not giving a reason to break the promise so they came up with a deal Dana would have gone home and my sister would go there about a half hour later so Dana left i stayed with my best friend and my sister who started saying things like i dont wanna go i dont feel like it and i replied other things like why dont you tell her if you stand her up without saying anything ill tell her and she freaked out saying that if i did i would be a bitch and i just rolled my eyes after a while she left and went to her room and i immediately gave my best friend a i know how this will end up look but didnt say anything almost a hour later Dana calls me and says your sister isnt answering my texts and calls where is she i took a deep breath and face palmed mentally before answering shes in her room ill go check on her and so i did i muted myself and went to my sister who was awake and told her Danas on the phone what do i tell her and she replies tell her that im asleep my heart dropped and i didnt know what to do so i just played along unmuted myself and said shes sleeping Dana was so disappointed and told me to wake her up so i started shaking my sister trying to wake her up but she just pretended to fall asleep again and again and i heard Dana say look never mind let her sleep i asked her if she was sure and she said yes and i just said okay then bye love im sorry and hung up i looked at my sister and said a few things like youre an asshole youre a shitty friend so returning to two hours ago i told Dana about it even though i probably shouldnt have but i just thought it was the right thing to do her face dropped and she became visibly sad and disappointed said something like i dont even know what to say i cant think or look at her the same and i felt kind of guilty but still thought that she had the right to know we smoked two cigarettes and she went to sleep saying that she would figure out what to do about all this again shes clearly disappointed and tired of my sister being disrespectful its currently 4am and im sorry for ruining her mood but also scared of my sisters reaction in case she finds out that Dana knows ive already made a post about my sister and her behaviour english is not my first language so sorry for any mistakes andor things like that i just didnt want all this to eat me up,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 03:16:28 UTC,0,3,0.5,,,0,0

1j847qz,Is it considered sexual assault,I was on a second date with a guy who I liked We had met before once it was fun and we had hooked up but didnt have sex because I am a virgin and I had clearly told him I am not ready for sex This time he didnt give me the same fun vibe but I wanted to hookup with him again because it was fun the previous time and honestly I was trying to let loose a little since I have usually been very uptight when it comes to dating I went to his house after and ofc things escalated I accept that I showed equal interest unlike last time and I was teasing him and flirting with him and kissing him But this time it was more about him and he didnt seem that interested in kissing me again and again like the first time He slightly persuaded me to give him a blow job which I really didnt want to but after one point I couldnt say no But I wasnt able to and I kept gagging and i remember telling him i cant He then got in between my legs and I told him that I wasnt ready for sex He reassured me that he wasnt going to do anything and he was just teasing me I remember telling him multiple times that I didnt want to have sex and I wasnt ready I trusted him and let him slightly penetrate me without going in But then he kept pushing in further It was hurting and again i tried stopping him but not very firmly He asked me if he could just feel me from the inside but would not thrust I dont think I said anything to that But eventually we did end up having sex And in fact he kept asking me to help guide him which I did as well So now its a very blurry line for me because I said no and I told him that I wasnt ready but then I also gave him a helping hand and also didnt say no while we were actually having sex The next morning also I didnt say anything and I in fact kept kissing him But later after coming home and finally processing i confronted him on text and called his upbringing into question He lashed out at me and said that I could have stopped it at any time and he just wasnt the one who was into it Another thing to note with be that he didnt show me any comfort or affection or asked me how I was feeling after sex In fact he didnt communicate with me at all He tried to cuddle me once but I got up and went outside to process things after which he didnt hug me properly even once or tried to cuddle me We slept separately the entire night and i felt so vulnerable and sad I never expected my first time to be like this Now I am just confused and sad and regretful at this point Also he did not use a condom and it was much later that I realised and when I told him he said he will pull out which he did I asked him in the morning if I needed to take the morning after pill and he said no But I ended up taking one anyway after reaching home,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 17:30:18 UTC,0,12,0.44,,,0,0

1j4b2z1,Im Leaving for College Soon But Its breaking me apart,This also gon be long i cant help it i am literally crying as i typed this TLDR Im leaving for college soon and while Im excited Im struggling with the thought of leaving my mom behind Weve always been close since my dad works overseas but lately Ive been unintentionally pulling away getting irritable and saying things I regret I thought distancing myself would make leaving easier but it only hurts more Seeing how much my mom will miss memade me realize I dont want to leave things on a sour note I keep having vivid dreams about my departure and the guilt of how Ive treated her is overwhelming I want to fix things before I go but I dont know how Im moving away for college in a few months and as excited as I am for this new chapter I cant stop thinking about how much Im going to miss my mom Shes been my biggest source of comfort my whole life and since my dad works overseas weve always had a strong bond But now that Im getting closer to leaving I feel this huge mix of emotions that I dont know how to deal with Lately Ive noticed myself pulling away a littlenot intentionally but I think its my way of trying to make leaving easier Instead its just making me feel worse Ive been more irritable and I hate that Ive raised my voice at times when I never used to I always used to listen to her life stories even if I had heard them countless times her rants too whenever she shouted for reasons I wasnt even wrong But now I am talking back to her get angry on her and say awful things when she tells her stories I say they are boring and please shut up I dont know why I am doing this I still want to listen to her rants and yapping but I am not able to I am going into that angry zone and I have done many mistakes I havent even apologized properly and that weighs on me Its like Im watching myself act this way but cant stop I know this is all part of growing up but the thought of leaving her behind even temporarily is really hard I dont have many close friends so my mom has always been the one I could talk to But over time I started keeping things to myself thinking I shouldnt burden her with my problems I used to be able to just rest my head in her lap and cry when things got hardwhen I got bullied when I felt alonebut I havent done that in years It makes me sad because I feel like Ive lost that connection a bit and I dont want to leave things this way And now when I probably need it the most I feel like I cant show her the weak side of me that I have long pretended to have erased The other day something happened that really got to me My mom was taking a nap and before sleeping she had asked me to grab some groceries While she was resting my little sister was joking around and said He left for college and my mom suddenly started crying in sleep She thought I had already gone I was still at home but seeing that broke me I rushed to get the groceries but I was tearing up the whole time It made me realize just how hard this is going to befor both of us and precisely the reason I was trying to distance myself from her that she doesnt grieve much but no now I feel that she will cry more that I left and our relation were sour and not mended I genuinely want to say sorry right now but I am stuck and I am going crazy At night I keep having vivid dreams about the day I leave and they feel so real I do have genetic hyperphantasia from my mom that too that I wake up feeling broken Every time its like Im reliving the moment before it even happens I know mom must be having those dreams too It makes me feel so helpless because no matter what I do that day is still coming I was going to leave this January but postponed it to August because in January we were close to ripping each other off that level of arguments But now things are settling down but still it isnt back to what it was last year I know I have to go and I know my mom wants the best for me She always encourages me and Im so grateful for everything shes doneraising me taking care of me making sure I dont feel alone I do feel but I pretend I dont to not hurt her I do have suicidal thoughts sometimes but I hold back that it will all fall into place soon however indefinite the soon is I just want to spend these last few months showing her how much she means to me and making good memories before I leave I just want to do the right thing but I feel so lost I thought distancing myself would help but it only hurts more Idk how to leave without hurting my mom How do I say goodbye without breaking her heart All of these are constantly revolving in my mind and Im going crazy I still have a few months but I dont know how Ill manage I want to mend things But I am thrown into my guilt For those whove gone through something similar how did you make the transition easier How did you make sure your mom knew how much you appreciated her before you left I dont want to take this time for granted and Id love to hear any advice on how to make these last few months meaningful for both of us I know now that pushing my mom away wont make leaving any easierif anything itll only make it worse I tried to make her love me less so she wouldnt hurt when I leave but all I did was create more pain for both of us I dont want her to remember our last months together with regret I just want to fix things before its too late And lastly Just to clarify this is about my bond with my mom as a parent nothing else Were Asianif I ever even thought otherwise shed personally set me straight with a slipper and more ultimate weapons My dad works overseas but is always present calling daily morning and night and supporting her even more than I do listening to her rants and all I love my mom because shes always been there for me and Ive supported her in return She doesnt rely on me for happinessI rely on her I know I have to leave one day but I just want to make things right before I go,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 19:09:23 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j5ati4,exposing a narcissist,So I recently exposed a narcissist but my situation is very different and I cant find anything online about this situation So I came here for potential outcomes So back in 2023 of March I started talking to this guy and he knew me from my childhood we were not best friends we just saw each other in passing during our middle school years and it went well at first It only lasted two weeks While we were getting to know each other I got on his IG and saw this girl constantly posting on his page but he never paid her any mind and of course I asked and he denies it But he must have sensed that I was hot on his tail so he decided to end things but still wanted to be friends even though we were never friends but I just said ok What he didnt know is that I knew I was blocked after I questioned him about the girl on IG so I made a fake page to see what was up And even though he said he wanted to end things he was still keeping in touch with me Even though Im blocked on his IG so in April 2023 I saw him with that girl and he she got him to move down there with her He is originally from my city and this girl lives in the DMV area And with me investigating I realized that its a money thing so basically this guy is a prostitute she buys him stuff and he agrees to be her bf So of course I wanted revenge but I wanted to wait until it was unexpected so for a whole year I gathered information on this girl and realized she may be a narcissist With my digging on this girl I got her phone number driver license address email you name it I got it And I tucked it away So in March of 2024 I made a fake number and pretended that I knew her from one of the colleges she went to but I told her that I wanted to stay anonymous And she went for it and all I did was expose her bf for being with me I also wanted to add that had I not been hot on his tail he would have continued to date me And when I found out about the girl I cut all communication with him and he found a way to contact me and wanted me back and I told him no He even told me he never wanted us to stop talking but he needed help from this girl and I had all that in the screenshots And you best believe I sent them screenshots to her when I was hiding behind the fake number This girl really wanted to know who I was so I decided to give her a call and actually reveal myself and we were on the phone for 27 mins Mind you I recorded our conversation as well because I dont trust this bitch But while we were on the phone she talked bad about her bf and her bf family and I did defend the family because I actually know them Because the city we are from is small And at one point in time I was close with the guys cousin She said really bad things about the bf mom too And I didnt like that so I spoke up and I think she could tell I wasnt going for any of her lies because I knew she was lying And Im sure she didnt like that I actually got off the phone with her because she wouldnt let me go So the day after I spoke to the girl her bf called me screaming at me and accusing me of all these things I didnt even say I couldnt even get a word in but I knew she was going to lie so I wasnt tripping because in my head I was going to get my lick back Fuck this hoe The guy wasnt even mad that I hurt gf feelings he was mad that I lied on his family and said bad things about him Which I didnt say anything bad about him or his family So after I took a verbal beating from this guy I just said cool But I wasnt done yet So I waited for about six months so now we are in September 2024 and from March of 2024 to September 2024 I kept my eye on them and I watched her crumble because she is very transparent on the internet and the bf broke up with her while she begged for him back because he realized that she lied on me and she must have found me on social media because she changed everything about herself to mimic me Mind you when I spoke to her in March of 2024 she claims that he begs her but social media says otherwise And between March of 2024 to September of 2024 this girl and her friends and her momma started to bother me because apparently Im the reason why her bf wont speak to her and I still keep calling her bf and pulling him away from her but I havent seen that man since March of 2023 nor have I spoke to him the only time I spoke to him was in March of 2024 and thats because he yelled at me So in September of 2024 I reached out to him I unblocked him on IG in case you are wondering he did block me first on IG but unblocked me on IG to get in contact with me because I had him block on everything else then when he asked for a second chance and I told him no I blocked him on IG and he been on that list since September of 2024 and then I blocked him again because he is a dick and sent him all the details of the conversation I had with the gf I even revealed to him that I was behind the fake number but he told me to leave him alone so I said ok bet and changed my number and reblocked him on IG But what I banked on was how much he liked me so I knew he was going to read and listen to all the things I sent and within three days he started calling my fake number because he couldnt get in contact with me because I changed my real number so I deleted my fake number and got rid of my social media account because he had his family look for me too He also offered to send me money to talk to him but I declined And of course Im still watching this all play out on my fake pages and again because she is so transparent on social media she is having a breakdown because he now knows the truth and she can no longer lie on me to him at least But he is stupid anyway because why would you believe a liar with no proof but I guess because she is a narcissist and the guy isnt good at setting boundaries I never been involved with a narcissist well I dont think I have been and I think its because Im too outspoken and I have no problem getting into a fights I promise you this is not what the fuck you want but overall Im a pretty peaceful young lady if I do say so myself Anywho this girl is upset that not only is he furious with her but also his family is happy that someone was able to finally expose her for the liar and manipulator that she is I didnt know that his family didnt like her but apparently she plays victim and uses this guys insecurities and her money so she can get her way and this relationship was going on for years Im basically the hero But I wasnt done with this bitch yet so I got my black ass on Twitter and put her on blast so much so she lost a lot of followers on social media and her momma is off of social media completely because her momma was bothering me too And I did this a few weeks ago me exposing this girl on Twitter So now Im satisfied But I wanted to know what happens when you expose a narcissist I wasnt the one being manipulated but it was like I was the defender of someone who was being manipulated And I came here to see if I could get any info because I couldnt find anything,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 00:35:30 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j7xb3h,I went to school with a little girl who was abused and I think about her every day,TW Abuse and SA content When I 20f was around 7 years old a new girl moved to my school We ended up being in the same grade and class together She wasnt overly talkative or outgoing but she was super sweet and friendly We ended up getting closer and I found out she had two siblings one younger and one older and that she just lived with her mom and her moms boyfriend She stopped coming to school often after the first year and when she did show up she would hide herself in sweaters even if it was super hot outside I didnt really notice anything out of the different because I was a kid but I think the teachers started noticing because they had mentioned it to higher staff and her mom ended up withdrawing them from school When I was around 10 news came out that the three kids were getting physically and mentally abused by their mother and her boyfriend there was even accusations of SA towards the one girl I knew from the mothers boyfriend I remember reading that he had committed murder and was on the run and that he was two provinces away from where he committed the crime They ended up catching on the where he was when he was with my friends mom and him and the mom decided to bail and move somewhere far They left the kids behind and luckily their father caught on and came and got them after years of not seeing them The poor kids were alone in the house for 2 months before being able to reach out the kids said they were too scared to leave home even though their mom and her boyfriend were gone This is the shorter end of the story but this happened just over 10 years ago and I think about it every day I hope she and her siblings are doing well,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 12:20:44 UTC,12,0,0.94,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j4q5vg,54 and struggling,Hi I when I was 12 I was playing in an arcade on the slot machines and a guy came up to me and started feeding my machine with cash I went back every week and he paid whilst I played This happended over a period which I cannot remember and then one day he started to stroke my penis Nobody had ever touched me here before so naturally my body reacted and I got erect even though i was scared as hell I continued to go back for six months then one day he took me to a cafe on the pier and bought me dinner Burger chips etc He undid my zip on my trousers and got my cock out and jerked me off and I came my first ever ejaculation I keep blaming myself because I kept going back to get jerked off and fed My mom was single parent and dad moved away I was left alone for hours when she was working I now realise I was groomed and sexually assaulted I still have these feelings of excitement when I remember this first time which then turn immediately to disgust at myself for saying nothing and letting it continue I have had therapy when i was 16 Long story but I was addicted to the machines by now and another guy started doing the same and pay me 40 for the privilege The money just went back on the machines This second guy groomed me so much I ended up going to his flat to see his spectrum computer and he continued there which turned to blowing me and paying me 40 The last time i went he raped me I ran away after and stayed out late and the police were out looking for me I was scared to go home as much bottom was so painful The police found me hiding under the pier and took me home I told them and mum that I had realised I was late home and rather than face the music stayed out as I was scared of getting into trouble So naturally I was in a vicious circle the later it became The accepted it and nothing was said about the assault I dont remember how I dealt with the pain but my brain has blocked some stuff out FF three years and the police turned up at myself home and said I had been exposing my penis to the public I seriously honestly have no recollection of this at all They cautioned me and my mum shouted and screamed when they went asking why until I broke down after she said has someone hurt you She got the police back and I made a statement To this day Ive never been told what happened the guy Whethery they caught him or not but I never had to go to court For years I thought they filed it nfa as I was just a dirty rent boy who deserved what he got I feel let down by the police as I know now that I was a child and it was grooming secual assault and rape I am a gay man and have never been able to take it sorry for the crudeness due to the memory I know its not everything but I know Im a disappointment for not being a real gay man When I have these feelings of not being good enough for anyone or deserving of anything I struggle and want to run away As i am a let down to others for not getting over it Ive been in a relationship for 28nyesrs and my partner he knows everything but I still regularly have these days of being not enoug people pleasing and feeling like everyone would be better without me For some reason I just had my first nightmare in over 35 years and it started with the first day of being touched at 12 and ended with the rape and police I woke up to my disgust with an erection which soon went down when i was awake I feel sick and cant believer my body reacted in this way to a traumatic memory I have felt guilty all these years that the guys who assaulted me made me erect and ejaculate but the therapist said it was just a natural reaction to being touched down there And Ive accepted it wasnt my fault Until now That dream has taken me back over 40 years and to wake up erect makes me wanna kill myself What sick fuck am i Or was it my 12 year old inner person that made meerect I am due at work in a cople of hours and cant face the world I am disgusted with myself again after all the years of counselling and accepting i was a child and they were adults and as such I took no blame whatsoever But this fucking nightmare has moved the goalposts Why the fuck would I wake up sexually excited over something so traumatic The only thing I can think of is yesterday my partner and I and his sister found out their dad my dad in law has secondary cancer and metastatic cancer which is obious a traumatic Could this trigger earlier trauma But the sick feeling of waking up with an erection makes me feel so low i cant tell anyone I wont kill myself dw I am a people pleaser and would never put my friends and family through that I have cptsd as 8 years ago my best mate took his life and I found him So I could never put others through what I have So in not killing myself I am a failure to me twice As I am pleasing others instead of me I just wanna go back to the day before yesterday when I felt a normal person Instead a funked up freak of nature,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06

1j4fr1m,Update I started washing and putting away my roommates favorite mug whenever she uses it When she caught me I lied about why,Good morning yall A couple days ago I made a post at 3 in the morning to confess to doing my roommates dishes because I secretly love to watch her do a happy dance when she sees her favorite mug is clean for her to use again That post changed our lives and Im only being a little dramatic by saying that I gotta say thanks to everyone who upvoted and commented on my original post Im still shook at just how many people read about me and my mug happy best friend The amount of people saying my post made them smile or reminded them of their own friendships or significant others has kept me smiling for days Im kind of into making people happy if that wasnt already obvious so the fact that so many people had even a moment of positivity because of me has been awesome When I made that original post it was because I just wanted to tell someone about the mug dancing but I knew Gwen wouldnt like it if I told anyone we knew so I came to reddit to shout to the void and oh boy did the void shout back There were so many comments asking if I really thought we were just friends and Ill be honest when I made that post we absolutely were just friends We had never talked about being more than friends and I was happy being friends because we have an amazing friendship I hadnt really thought about there being a possibility for more because dating was always something I planned to do when I had my life together or when I had more money I never let myself consider what I was missing out on by waiting for the right time Her finding my post opened up the chance for Gwen and I to talk about things that we hadnt before and over breakfast that morning we found where we stood with each other and what we thought things could look like moving forward depending on what we both agreed was the best course We didnt make any solid plans or decisions and didnt want to rush into something that would ruin the good we already had going for us but Ill admit I was hoping for a specific outcome There was one comment on that first post that had really caught my attention To paraphrase they told me to think about how I would feel if someone else got to see Gwen do her happy mug dance instead of me and it hit me so hard I didnt mind the idea of someone else seeing her so happy I just dont know if anyone she dates would notice what I did and decide to do what I did What if they didnt care or didnt think it was that important or any of the other things I do to make her laugh or smile I really didnt like the thought of not being there to make sure she has that extra reason to smile in the morning Gwen wants me to admit that Im a sappy moron because I teared up writing this Im a sensitive man in touch with my emotions and you know you love it so shut it you squinting_face_with_tongue To all the people saying its possible for platonic relationships to be like ours you are absolutely correct Our friend group is very open with physical and verbal affection and we help each other all time with big and small things We all say I love you to each other its just normal communication for us as a group not just between Gwen and I Honestly if I hadnt made my original post Im not sure when or if we would have gotten to the point we are now Maybe we would have continued as we were and that would have been just as happy of an outcome just a different one like a choose your own adventure with multiple options for a good resolution Which brings me to the actual update Gwen and I agreed we want to try dating We arent putting a new label on our relationship yet but our first date is next week Im making it all a surprise Gwen helped write this post and will be reading the comments so I cant give any details but its going to be the best first date she has ever been on or Ill eat my candy corn patterned socks I think she might be the one for me and Im going to take every chance I can to make sure she thinks the same about me Yall are the best and we love you Do something kind for your loved ones for us and everyone can and should find something to happy dance about it makes life more fun Love Gwen and Peter pink_heartspider_web,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 22:17:28 UTC,5952,370,0.98,,Positive,0,0

1j48nfz,My boss keeps a camera feed of me going for a week,My f29 boss m late 40s kept the camera feed of me on his computer screen at all times Obligatory throw away account cause the details in this might be easy for some of my coworkers to find this and I dont want to give up my main account Also I was posting this on am I over reacting but my update actually came as I was typing this on that sub so now Im switching it to here that everything seems to be wrapped up So I work in a mostly male dominated field in a CNC machine shop as a brake operator I am the only woman at my company that works on the shop floor About a year ago there was a fist fight between 2 other operators and there were no cameras inside to show who started the fight so both operators had to be let go To prevent this from happening again the cameras went up all over the shop Absolutely no blind spots crystal clear HD camers we know this because our boss has a TV screen above his desk now where he can watch all the cameras He can have up to 8 of the camera feeds on his screen at one time and it has the ability to cycle though all of the feeds switching feeds every few minutes The problem came about a week ago when a coworker of mine came up to me and told me there was only one feed on the screen Me at my machine I have never been written up or even talked to about problems with my work so I was very thrown off by this When I had the opportunity where I could think of a reason to go into his office to see for myself when I walked in his office sure enough I saw my empty station on the screen I pretended not to notice and just asked a question about a part I was working on that could be a reasonable question and went back to my work like nothing was wrong Over the next week or so I tried to put it out of my mind but I couldnt get past it and more coworkers approached me and said they saw me on the screen So late last week I went to HR and asked if I was in trouble for anything The HR guy looked surprised and asked me what I was referring to and I told him how closely Im being watched and it seems to be just me singled out He said he would look into it and get back to me but as far as he knew there was nothing wrong About an hour later I get called into the managers office with HR screens are back to normal showing 8 different work areas Im happy for a second until I am asked why Im spreading misinformation I ask what theyre talking about and I proceed to be gaslighted for the next 5 or so minutes about how the cameras have always been this way and Im seeking attention I say multiple coworkers have mentioned to me about seeing it and we can bring them in to ask They threaten to write me up if I keep bringing up this blatant lie and that Im slandering the manager to my fellow coworkers I contact a lawyer cause at this point Im like fuck it Im going to quit this job anyway might as well raise a little hell but then part of me decides its just not worth it and with everything Ive been through lately its just not worth it I decided to contact my ex who Ive been broken up with for a year and fill him in We were together for 5 years and hes the love of my life about a year ago he was offered his dream job across the country and asked me to go with him My mother was dying of cancer at the time and I was the only one she had left to take care of her He planned on turning down the job to stay with ne but I told him Id never forgive myself if he passed on his dream job for me About 6 months ago my mother passed and idk why I didnt contact him but it kinda felt like my whole world fell apart so I just accepted this was my life now When I told him what was going on he said why dont you come move in with me I didnt know it but he hadnt dated anyone since we broke up and neither had i because he had always planned on us reuniting after my mother passed and when she did he didnt want to rush me cause he wanted to wait until I was ready I wasnt ready at all until he asked me that question but without hesitation I said yes I put in an application that day at a CNC shop near where he lives and that was yesterday So thats where this post was going to end on am I over reacting for picking up and moving across the country And then the phone rang Apparently the place I was hiring was impressed with my years of experience and theyre a newer shop so I actually have more experience running a brake then most of their employees They offered my about a 25 raise of what Im currently making and I accepted on the spot They asked when I could start and I said next week Immediately called my boss and told him hes a fucking creep and that I quit HR has been calling me nonstop begging for me to reconsider but that ship has sailed Ex bf or possibly just bf again said hes excited for me to move in but will be setting me up in a separate bedroom at first just so we can take things slow and figure things out which I think is very smart of him and Im glad cause I think we need that time too My current landlady is an absolute sweetheart and knows how rough this year has been for me so shes letting me break my lease with no penalties and she already has someone lined up to take my apartment I asked if they wanted to buy some of my furniture since Im only taking what I can fit in my truck and they offered me a thousand buck for my living room set and all my drawers and dressers Not having to worry about all that I can fir the rest of my stuff in my truck easily and Im starting my cross country trek tonight Fuck creeps and if

1j5tjlt,My boyfriend is watching his ex and has the urge to jerk off,For some context my boyfriend 23m and I 24f have been in a relationship He was after me for 1 year dated for 1 year broke up and have been dating for 6 months now I have an autoimmune disease that is mostly affected by my mental health and can create severe illnesses and damages to my body Since Ive been dating him Ive been noticing my health getting worse and worse To add more to the story I found out he was attracted to his workcolleague and made some sort of move check my other post to figure out some more about this if interested but it will add more to the story and will help you gain a better understanding Plus my boyfriend since the start of our relationship has told me how hes a man who doesnt watch corn and has been flexing it to his guy friends and all So my boyfriend has been recently saying nonstop how hes open for me to check his phone he has actually said it so much it was beginning to be suspicious I had been noticing him becoming more irritated with me by the second without me doing nothing and I asked him I told him that I knew there was something he was hiding that was making him so anxious with me all the time thats when I began suspecting and he denied all of my comments saying it was because hes been so busy with work After some days he started saying it again telling me that I could check his phone whenever I didnt trust him He was always used to me saying no since I was keen on not doing so since I felt like doing that There must be a lack of trust in a relationship and thats how they fall apart So he didnt expect me to say yes this time I did due to all my suspicions at the moment He watched me and didnt dare say a word I gave him some time to be honest with me before looking through his phone and he reassured me there was nothing I went to his recently watched in tiktok and I found gems there He watched these typical girls with boobs bigger than their heads move their butts and boobs sensually Then there were many replays of this girl we both knew he talked to before ever getting with me He didnt say anything and denied ever doing anything with her videos only getting hard and then looking for other stuff to jerk off which I think is a complete lie but still Not only did he break promises by telling and promising me that he didnt watch corn or other girls but also lied to me about it until I figured it out He was never honest and I believe that he still is hiding things from me just because I didnt figure them out yet It was already bad that he did this but worse when it was his ex situationship I need some help and opinions to clear my mind I dont know if Im crazy or being rational I would appreciate other peoples experiences dealing with wrong people and then finding a good person for you I need to believe that this is not the love I deserve and that theres many guys out there that wont do this to me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 17:00:28 UTC,0,31,0.44,,,0,0

1j7onmz,NSFW Friend Told Me He Is Cheating Due to Appearance Of His Fiances Genitalia,So the other day a close male friend of mine told me he is sending his fiance on an expensive solo paid vacation I inquired why he wasnt going with her and he informed me in so many words because he has needs and that he has his own hotel booked with the sole intention of cheatingunfaithfulness Why Because apparently her genitalia is offensive and disgusting to him and he cant perform oral sex on her He told me he must perform oral sex to be fulfilled in life and he just has to I asked him why he wasnt just being honest with her and he said it was because it would crush her I said If oral sex is THAT important to you then you guys need to break up He refused to break up saying he loved her and they had built a life together and then he wouldnt have anyone to help him with his special needs daughter And he is ADAMANT he will not get caught unless I say something to his fiance I inquired about lights out blindfolds etc He absolutely refused and says her stuff is beyond disgusting Let me be clear He is not a prize in any way Without him paying for the privilege I dont see any random woman near him just randomly accepting oral sex from him So Im not sure if this will happen But its definitely put me in a weird situation because I am friends with both of them I dont want to get involved but I feel this is really awful for him to do Its changed how I look at him completely I never would have thought him capable of something like this Just needed to get this out of my brain I feel so bad for her EDIT Wow I did not expect this to blow up like that I will try to clarify some of the questions Ive received 1 yes I also wish this was fake It isnt 2 they are not married They are engaged The special needs child is not theirs The biological mother of the child lives in another state 3 for those asking why Im friends with someone Why does anyone have friends Nobody is perfect and everyone makes mistakes But Ive been friends with him for a decade Longer than Ive known his fiance who I met through him Hes been a really wonderful friend And Hes never mentioned or thought or indicated any kind of behavior like this to me until this JUST HAPPENED YESTERDAY and I was completely shocked and struggling to process it That is why I said what I said in the original post My vision of him has shattered I am not sure yet how I am going to proceed 4 those asking for information about her genitalia I really do not have the answers you are seeking I asked about smell or scent or taste and he was adamant it was strictly because of appearance The only description I got which left me very confused was that it looks like a pokemon He also did mention that she has a disorder I forgot the name of where the hair follicles of your pubic hair turns slightly ulcerous and the hair follicles become infected He said this also disgusts him because apparently its open wounds I asked all the questions you guys are asking Why isnt she on medication or treatment for the condition Labiaplasty Etc The short and unfortunate answer is lack of funds and lack of health insurance for both parties We live in a VERY poor area of a VERY red state And yes I told him he should have paid for her healthcare instead of a vacation 5 I am certain he is not gay 6 for those of you that have reached out privately to confirm if I am someone you know and if this story is about your partner I want to say how sorry I am and how sad I am that this is happening to other people I cant even imagine,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 02:39:55 UTC,3943,402,0.96,,,0,0

1j5ati4,exposing a narcissist,So I recently exposed a narcissist but my situation is very different and I cant find anything online about this situation So I came here for potential outcomes So back in 2023 of March I started talking to this guy and he knew me from my childhood we were not best friends we just saw each other in passing during our middle school years and it went well at first It only lasted two weeks While we were getting to know each other I got on his IG and saw this girl constantly posting on his page but he never paid her any mind and of course I asked and he denies it But he must have sensed that I was hot on his tail so he decided to end things but still wanted to be friends even though we were never friends but I just said ok What he didnt know is that I knew I was blocked after I questioned him about the girl on IG so I made a fake page to see what was up And even though he said he wanted to end things he was still keeping in touch with me Even though Im blocked on his IG so in April 2023 I saw him with that girl and he she got him to move down there with her He is originally from my city and this girl lives in the DMV area And with me investigating I realized that its a money thing so basically this guy is a prostitute she buys him stuff and he agrees to be her bf So of course I wanted revenge but I wanted to wait until it was unexpected so for a whole year I gathered information on this girl and realized she may be a narcissist With my digging on this girl I got her phone number driver license address email you name it I got it And I tucked it away So in March of 2024 I made a fake number and pretended that I knew her from one of the colleges she went to but I told her that I wanted to stay anonymous And she went for it and all I did was expose her bf for being with me I also wanted to add that had I not been hot on his tail he would have continued to date me And when I found out about the girl I cut all communication with him and he found a way to contact me and wanted me back and I told him no He even told me he never wanted us to stop talking but he needed help from this girl and I had all that in the screenshots And you best believe I sent them screenshots to her when I was hiding behind the fake number This girl really wanted to know who I was so I decided to give her a call and actually reveal myself and we were on the phone for 27 mins Mind you I recorded our conversation as well because I dont trust this bitch But while we were on the phone she talked bad about her bf and her bf family and I did defend the family because I actually know them Because the city we are from is small And at one point in time I was close with the guys cousin She said really bad things about the bf mom too And I didnt like that so I spoke up and I think she could tell I wasnt going for any of her lies because I knew she was lying And Im sure she didnt like that I actually got off the phone with her because she wouldnt let me go So the day after I spoke to the girl her bf called me screaming at me and accusing me of all these things I didnt even say I couldnt even get a word in but I knew she was going to lie so I wasnt tripping because in my head I was going to get my lick back Fuck this hoe The guy wasnt even mad that I hurt gf feelings he was mad that I lied on his family and said bad things about him Which I didnt say anything bad about him or his family So after I took a verbal beating from this guy I just said cool But I wasnt done yet So I waited for about six months so now we are in September 2024 and from March of 2024 to September 2024 I kept my eye on them and I watched her crumble because she is very transparent on the internet and the bf broke up with her while she begged for him back because he realized that she lied on me and she must have found me on social media because she changed everything about herself to mimic me Mind you when I spoke to her in March of 2024 she claims that he begs her but social media says otherwise And between March of 2024 to September of 2024 this girl and her friends and her momma started to bother me because apparently Im the reason why her bf wont speak to her and I still keep calling her bf and pulling him away from her but I havent seen that man since March of 2023 nor have I spoke to him the only time I spoke to him was in March of 2024 and thats because he yelled at me So in September of 2024 I reached out to him I unblocked him on IG in case you are wondering he did block me first on IG but unblocked me on IG to get in contact with me because I had him block on everything else then when he asked for a second chance and I told him no I blocked him on IG and he been on that list since September of 2024 and then I blocked him again because he is a dick and sent him all the details of the conversation I had with the gf I even revealed to him that I was behind the fake number but he told me to leave him alone so I said ok bet and changed my number and reblocked him on IG But what I banked on was how much he liked me so I knew he was going to read and listen to all the things I sent and within three days he started calling my fake number because he couldnt get in contact with me because I changed my real number so I deleted my fake number and got rid of my social media account because he had his family look for me too He also offered to send me money to talk to him but I declined And of course Im still watching this all play out on my fake pages and again because she is so transparent on social media she is having a breakdown because he now knows the truth and she can no longer lie on me to him at least But he is stupid anyway because why would you believe a liar with no proof but I guess because she is a narcissist and the guy isnt good at setting boundaries I never been involved with a narcissist well I dont think I have been and I think its because Im too outspoken and I have no problem getting into a fights I promise you this is not what the fuck you want but overall Im a pretty peaceful young lady if I do say so myself Anywho this girl is upset that not only is he furious with her but also his family is happy that someone was able to finally expose her for the liar and manipulator that she is I didnt know that his family didnt like her but apparently she plays victim and uses this guys insecurities and her money so she can get her way and this relationship was going on for years Im basically the hero But I wasnt done with this bitch yet so I got my black ass on Twitter and put her on blast so much so she lost a lot of followers on social media and her momma is off of social media completely because her momma was bothering me too And I did this a few weeks ago me exposing this girl on Twitter So now Im satisfied But I wanted to know what happens when you expose a narcissist I wasnt the one being manipulated but it was like I was the defender of someone who was being manipulated And I came here to see if I could get any info because I couldnt find anything,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 00:35:30 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

2 relationships before this current one I find myself in one 8 months with it ending with me getting cheated on and the other 15 years with me proposing and then getting cheated on Both inperson and then transitioning to longdistance youd think Id learned my lesson the first time Anyways I go about a year of being single and searching for love as all young people do and nothing worked for me dating apps social events or just finding people in places that youd want to be able to share interest with Until one day I posted a nice thirst trap online to get the selfseeking validation that I felt I needed at the time and someone slid into my DMs someone that I had known from HS but never truly talked to I began talking with this person and then we grew closer every day despite being long distance with a 3hour time difference We Facetimed each other every once in a while and then twice a week and then every day The problem at the time in that relationship was two things I was not emotionally intelligent and I had a group of guy friends that were semitoxic My significant other was not fond of my friends as they wanted to go out and party all the time which I didnt mind doing but it wasnt my cup of tea So I spent more time talking with her and then one day I tried to introduce her to my group of friends on Facetime and she talked to everyone a little bit and just found them all disgusting and asked to talk to me again She said something along the lines of Wow cant believe you did that and hung up on me Now for me I was confused because my buddies did the same thing with their signifcant others and no one was upset and it was nice getting to know the person they loved back homefor a little context me and my SO had not met up yet we were still having facetime and what not It was also a surprise for her because when she called I was hanging out with my buddies and one of them picked up So after she hung up I called her back in private and I asked her what was wrong and she told me that she felt disrespected by what happened and that was our first big fight with each other and it ended with me texting her updates of when and where I am so she knows if she can call with me I agreed with it all not thinking that it was a big deal We continued the relationship with one another with basically a gradual turn of all my free time being spent with her I neglected friends and became somewhat isolated from my world As an inexperienced youngling I didnt see that issue I kept the good friends and started distancing myself from my friends wed hang out with but it started to be less and less as the month went by I would say that we are about 8 months into this relationship with each other when we first decided to meet up with each other and have about a week together Now before we met with each other she alluded that there were things that she wasnt going to give me or ask of me unless we were dating because I hadnt asked her to be my girlfriend and I dont know why but that enticed me to figure out what she was alluding to and that brought me to the point of when meeting up with her I asked her to be my gf and she said yes but I was so nervous asking her it felt like she was a bit hesistant on that matter when replying yes That happened the first day and then we started dating with our first week in a relationship of hanging out with each other I stayed at her place the whole week and we did various things and hung out with each other It felt like things went well for the week that we spent together it felt like we connected and everyone had a good time before we had to say goodbye and continue our longdistance relationship After I got back to my home things started to change with our relationship she wanted more from me in ways of being more emotionally aware of my day and tell her my feelings and how things made me feel and as the emotinally unintellegnet person I was it was hard for me to change that in my everyday life I was just going with the flow of life and never realy discussed my emotions with others becasue it never really came up in conversation We argued about how I was still just discussing my day with her and not sharing my emotions with her so I worked on it and slowly got better with being in touch with my emotions yet I feel like it was never really enough for the relationship As the months went by she continuously felt like I wasnt telling her enough about my life and felt left out the more I told her about my day so I committed to telling her everything that happened in my day as she was doing to me Now my struggle was that there was a lot that happened in my day so I would sometimes do it when it happened in my day Still I would eventually tell her about it when we called each other every day Still she would then get upset that she missed out on knowing when it happened and what I felt in that period Once again being the emotionally unavailable guy I was I tried my best to do what I could to satisfy that need for her At this point youre probably wondering why we just didnt break up I have no clue its probably just me being weakwilled At this point I spent just about every waking moment texting and talking to this girl and we got into arguments just about every single day either about me missing information I was telling her or me not being emotional Being young I thought this was healthy because the arguments led to deeper conversations with each other and figuring out what made us who we are I would say about 4 or 5 months after our initial meetup I had pretty much completely distanced myself from my friedns with rarely ever hanging out with them but maybe once in a blue moon but it made it harder in my relationship to hangout with them becausea of her wanting to know everything and me jsut wanting to spend time with friedns so there was communication delay from waht was happening in the conversation and what I was doing vs what was acutally happening in my life This all led to arguments down the line and then our next meet up this time I was meeting her parents and she was coming to me I set things up so that I could stay with her and got a friend that I was closer with that she seemed to like because he was married and approved more of our relationship We spent the time together for about 2 weeks this time one week just me and her at my place and then a week with her parents It seemed like another good meet up with both of enjoying ourselves but a little bit of tension between us from the arguments and the fact I was moving from a 3 hour time difference to a 13 hour time difference which we both imagined would put more of a strain on our relationship her parents liked me on a side note We parted ways and I began my new path in life with her being in college and me being abroad for work We had both been right tensions did increase with each other as I was abroad it became even hadrder for me to comunicate with her with everything that was going on in my day to day life as it was for the most part always unpredictable and hard to keep up with myself and she would sleep half way through my day as the time differnece so if she didnt wake up to a butt load of text about my day she felt upset and always had this feeling of misisng out on my life so I continued to distance myself from others and not participating in group events and when I did I tried to keep to myself to minimize the updating I had to do At this point she just felt like I didnt love her because I wasnt involving her in my life the same way she was involving me in her life She told me everything about her day so this wasnt a double standard and she was also busy but I would say that I was definitely busier than she was I continued to apoligize about the communication issues with keeping in mind I still was telling her about everything that happened in my day whenever we talked on the phone especially all the things I forgot to tell her and she felt that I conviently kept forgetting to tell her about the interations that I had with Females throughout my day beacuse as you can imagine she was jealous that other females got to interact with me throught out the day more and she didnt I was better about telling her about female interaction through my day but I still missed a few here and there Sometimes I got rides from females and shed get upset that I didnt tell them when it happened She always felt she never got the full story the first time and she had to ask multiple questions to get the whole story and that was tiring for her and it got to the point where I thought I was doing a good job but was not and I just gave up on updating her one day because life just got overwhelmed and I couldnt handle life and my relationship at the same time and she ended it after that day I was devastated as we had been going through this struggle for almost 3 years and it just felt like it was all for nothing We met a third time before breaking up and were going to meet up a 4th before COVID19 occurred and travel bans happened which didnt improve our relationship We broke up I got friends and started to move on with my life slowly finding myself and what makes me happy For about a year I was single I decided to move back to the same timezone as her and go to the college that she went to Not expecting her to be in the area not ever really knowing why I did it either I wanted to complete college not being in a relationship but that was not what occured As you can expect we ran into each other again and started dating because she felt like I was a changed man and was able to prioritize things in my life a little better I can say that I did grow in the time after we broke up and explored my inner workings a little more The thing is she thought I started dating her again because she was a different person but she hasnt really changed all that much still wanting the same things and I was more able to provide those things she wanted and it felt like things were going in the right direction We moved in with each other and where dating for a year until she said that she wanted more and didnt feel we were growing and she said it was because I had not asked her to be my gf so about 3 months of me trying to find the right time to ask and it not working out we get into an argument about it and I asak her and she says no ask another time So I dont plan for it and just start asking her once a week until she just says yes about 2 months later while we are living and sleeping in the same bed with each other Anyway things started getting a little tenser between us I dont have many friends as I learned not to make friends in this relationship and I dont talk to my old friends much because it just causes conflict and Id rather avoid than lie We continued dating and for about 2 years we lived in the same place We have had our ups and downs through the two years I changed my job twice and have a female supervisor as you know she is upset about that but she ignores it better She says she just at this point in the relationship buries her emotions and hides her concerns because she doesnt want conflict in the relationship and she only ever feels that she has problems with what is going on in the relationship We still argue a lot and have those arguments turn into deep conversations and I become more and more emotionally drained as these arguments happen and I can barely keep up with my studies work and relationship yet I push on We are starting to get to the real point of this story and why I am just done is that we were initially very active sexually in the beginning of our relationship like once a week and then it moved to once a month which you know I didnt think to much of it because I figure sex drive just went down as the relationship got more secured but we just moved to a new place and signed a 15 month lease that niether of us can afford to break and I tried to be sexual with her this morning and she told me that it felt nice but shed been thinking of her ex when weve been doing stuff and that its kinda always been that way becasue she used to be very sexually active with her ex but he was fine with not having sex and she puts herself in his position and wouldnt want that pushed uponed her and makes her feel sad and turns her off from anything that we are doing and I tried to help her get to the root of it this morning before leaving to work and I just felt that I disrepected myself by doing that and not being more upset about her thinking of her ex and it just hurts because it means just about everytime we do sexual stuff its about how she feels about her ex and makes sense why she has to sometime watch things when I go down on her Honestly I know that this is a super toxic relationship but I love her so much and have tried so hard in this relationship with the time and effort I put in everyday it just sucks all of it TLDR GF thinks of ex during intimate time after 7 years of relationship and gets turned off just about every time because she pushed herself on her ex and her ex didnt care about having sex and she didnt like the idea of being in his position So it has tanked our relationship and everything feels distant and We moved to new place with 15 month lease no one can afford to break I feel stuck,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 22:32:58 UTC,2,1,0.75,,,0,0
1j7xplq,When Life Gives You Lemons You Get a Mountain of Debt and a Late Diagnosis,I grew up with my mother who was a single parent She had chosen to leave my father due to his alcohol and pill addiction Shortly before I was born she was granted disability pension because she was born with a spinal defect that made her physically disabled In addition she had repeatedly been to the psychiatric emergency room in the 1970s likely due to being placed in foster care as she was born out of wedlock Today I know that I had undiagnosed ADHD that hindered my schooling but this was not noticed by either the school or child and adolescent psychiatry Despite having countless interactions with the school child psychiatry and social services to find a sustainable way for my mother and me to live together without harming each other Today I have met social workers who are surprised that I placed myself in foster care when they hear what I went through as a child and they say that things would have been handled differently today After struggling hard in elementary school to get into the high school program I wanted my life was turned upside down when I found out that my father was sober and had been for a few years and that he hoped word would reach me that he wanted to contact me So just as I was about to start high school I suddenly had a father again and we were to try to establish a relationship despite barely having seen each other since I was two years old At the same time as I was getting to know my father it became untenable for me to continue living at home with my mother and together with social services my move away from home with the help of social services was being prepared at the age of 17 Shortly after the decision had been made and I had moved in with my girlfriend and her family in a state of panic my first major setback arrived My father passed away in his home and I had to take care of going through and packing up his home as well as his workplace while also having my room at my mothers and the half of the household goods she had saved for me during my upbringing so that I would have something resembling a home when I moved out My uncle took care of my fathers hunting weapons and his car but the rest was left for 17yearold me to handle contacting private individuals and authorities and announcing his passing Not to mention the feat of improvising a funeral without any idea of what my fathers taste or preferences were and any wishes he might have had for the ceremony I still remember that I actually had a fever at his funeral We fast forward a few years to when I surprised my mother our relationship improved immediately once I moved out by taking her to be in the audience of her favorite TV show Thats when an idea was born in my head TVfilm thats what I want to do I came home and started researching how to get into the industry and saw that there were some educational programs I could apply for But to get into these I first needed to complete my high school studies So I did and then I applied to various programs until after 23 years I finally got into one The problem with the program was that it was over 200 km roughly 125 miles from my hometown and I prepared to move to the location by myself to start my studies But it turned out that my partner chose to join me in the move Meanwhile my mother had gradually worsened and at that time it was nice to get away from her gradual decline Her memory was getting worse and worse The program I had been accepted into was a twoyear program with the first year focusing on theory and most of the second year dedicated to practical training But before we were to go out on internships we had a short film to complete first On the second to last day of filming our short film my second major setback arrived and at that time I didnt know it would last for a long time During filming one of our actors collapsed and passed away during the ambulance ride to the hospital I was responsible for the sound during filming and had four different microphones running which captured the sounds the person made before they fell to the floor and we rushed to begin CPR while waiting for the ambulance By some miracle and some trick filming we managed to finish filming and could focus on the internship period The problem was that 90 of media production takes place in the capital so a move to an already overcrowded city was the next step After much searching I found a place to live or so I thought It turned out to be a scam and when I confronted the person and said I didnt want a lot of things ordered in my name I was threatened with murder the continuation of earlier mentioned setback I managed to shake it off and made it to the capital and started my internships But when things were running smoothly and the engine was at its hottest the setbacks decided to hit hard As an unpaid intern trying to break into the industry it was natural to say yes to everything to be the one who fixed everything Especially if you had gotten an internship at the same production where I had previously taken my mother After a few weeks the situation saying yes to all and everything and at the same time having an undiagnosed NDdisorder became untenable and the supervisors chose to terminate my internship I became so unwell that I sought help at the psychiatric emergency room where they determined that I was burned out from what had happened I then chose to move back to my partner to lick my wounds and recover But barely a week passed before my sister called and informed me that my mother had collapsed and been taken by ambulance to the intensive care unit Because her medication including blood thinners had been discontinued she suffered multiple blood clots which ultimately led to her death While we were at the hospital and watching over her knowing that she didnt have much time left my partner chose to declare that 11 years together was enough and that she didnt think she could or wanted to continue This was said when we were only a few meters from my dying mother Once my mother passed away it was almost Christmas and we rushed to arrange a funeral to get it done before the year ended At the same time a process began to divide our 11year life together I started looking for a new place to live and six months after my mother passed away I moved and a year of rehabilitation and sick leave to recover began When I slowly started to feel ready again I got a media job in the new location and began to feel that I could spread my wings again and actually aim for the capital again So I did I got a longterm temporary position and there I was informed that even though it was a temporary position it was for a function that was needed Monday to Friday day in and day out as long as the channel was broadcasting This temporary position and this promise came five months before reports started coming in about people getting sick in China with symptoms like persistent cough and high fever Eight months after I had started the temporary position my service was terminated in favor of the permanent employees in the company After arguing with the authorities to get my unemployment benefits which felt like half the country was doing at the same time I found an ad for a position 220 km ca 137 miles north of the capital and I packed up my belongings and left I took a chance and hoped it would work out this time I arrived and managed to work through the probationary period before COVID19 hit with a new wave of illnesses and people were afraid to hire permanently which resulted in me being unemployed again now in a much smaller location Now misfortune also began to take a toll on my finances and I needed to take my first loan A few more months passed and a new opportunity opened up at the company I had worked for before the pandemic but this time 490 km ca 305 miles south Again I packed up my life and moved south This time everything felt good I felt satisfied and my new boss and team were happy with me But then came the date when my probationary period was to turn into permanent employment My boss checked with my colleagues and found that they were happy with me but that I sometimes disappeared when I finished my tasks and that I sometimes had difficulty reading social situations This became the basis for their decision not to continue my employment and the same thing happened again Later it was determined that I have ADHDI and that the bosss decision was therefore discrimination based on disability Life repeat it self and I moved again and this time it was a move of 200 km ca 125 miles and to make that move even possible and to cover previous expenses I had to take a loan of approximately 20000 USD or about 18000 EUR Once there I got a job where I stayed for two years before I realized there was no room for me evolving and I had to make the choice to go back to school this time focusing on ITnetworksservers This time I had just turned 36 when I started studying again and I was the second oldest in the class and felt like a fossil compared to my classmates However this time I had worked and pushed through an NPF Neuropsychiatric Disability assessment and now have a diagnosis of ADHD inattentive version and I know that with that I have the right to help in my daily life both in schoolwork and privately Today the debt is down to about 15000 USD or about 13500 EUR and I see a glimmer of light on the horizon But at the same time I know what it has cost me to get here and that it will take time to reach the metaphorical tunnel But I also feel an immense frustration that no one has taken the responsibility they should have I know very well that I cant do anything about the situation today but despite that I cant help but retrospectively grieve that my ADHD was not discovered and diagnosed earlier Who knows Then I might have completed my high school studies and gotten into higher education earlier and actually had a few years in the job market and stayed in the boat when the metaphorical waves came Sure I would have certainly gotten soaked and at times felt close to going overboard but I wouldnt have fallen into the water like a mitten at the slightest ripple of waves as I did in reality So besides feeling deprived of everything that people usually do in their twenties like traveling working as an au pair and partying I havent had the opportunity to experience all of that And now Ive met a partner who has already done everything they want to do as a young adult and who is well established in the job market and who shortly after we met was able to buy their first apartment And here I stand feeling stupid unfinished and late to the game in general when it comes to life Add to that that my partner wants to start a family soon and I who had hoped that after my education I would hopefully get a job and then do a fortyyearolds version of what I missed in my twenties no then Ill instead have to start a family and instead of spending money on vinyl records I now may have to focus on buy teething toys and baby bottles and instead of planning and comparing trips Ill instead sit and compare preschools and then when one is found start planning for the enrollment of the child It feels like Im being deprived of life and part of me feels incredibly selfish while the other sees it more evolutionary and I realize that I have it better than for example a praying mantis male who if hes not in the game dies after reproduction is completed The question is just exactly how big the difference is,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 12:43:04 UTC,2,1,0.67,,,0,0
