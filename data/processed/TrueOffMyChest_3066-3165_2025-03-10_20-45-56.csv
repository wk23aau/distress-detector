1j7b4sy,I spent years in love with my grandma,Three years ago I met a girl online and we hit it off instantly We texted every single day flirted shamelessly and honestly It was one of the best connections Ive ever had We never did video calls though so neither of us knew what the other looked like Were both introverts so it never crossed our minds to FaceTime weird I know but thats introvert life for you Despite that we developed a crush on each other but we decided to remain flirty friends who sometimes roleplay sexy things because were both not relationship people and and longdistance relationships are a hard pass for us So we just kept texting and gaming together Since I didnt know how she looks like my brain started creating an idealized version of her and I imagined her like this alluring confident intense and mysterious femme fatale One day this girl disappeared without saying anything Poof gone she deactivated all her gaming socials She was always quite depressive so my mind started to jump to the worst conclusions I was very worried And I endlessly tried looking for her everywhere but I only knew her name and country so I got nowhere I eventually gave up looking for her but she always remained haunting me in the back of my mind because of the way she had disappeared and the fact that I didnt know what happened to her So I kept thinking about her throughout the 2 remaining years replaying our last conversations to look for cues and all of that led me to dead ends It was frustrating And it was like a mystery that I needed to solve Alexa play oh whooo is sheee So one day I decided that enough is enough I was going to find her and I was going to get my answers even if I have to become the FBI myself I believe in manifestation and law of attraction so I spent a whole night visualizing me finding her personal socials the socials we had each other added were not personal socials it was gaming socials so I wanted to find either her Instagram or Facebook And it worked Next day I went full FBI detective mode I said the only information I had about her was her name and country so I used those leads and somehow I managed to stumble upon her real full name I think this was the manifestation and law of attraction at play or some kind of witchcraft I dunno It turned out that the name she had given me was a fake one but thats understandable so I dont hold it against her Whatever With her real name in hand I found out where she went to school where she went to college and of course her personal socials So I opened up her Facebook and Instagram filled with anticipation because finally I would be able to put a face to the ghost whod haunted me for 2 whole years And when I laid my eyes on her there she was THE SHEER REFLECTION OF MY GRANDMA WHEN YOUNG No really Like not kind of not a little resemblance I mean copypaste CtrlC CtrlV a perfect genetic duplicate of my grandma in her youth I had spent years chasing this mystery woman only for my brain to go Wait a minute is that grandma I WAS FUCKING IN LOVE WITH MY GRANDMA FOR YEARS Years of mystery longing idealization GONE IN A SECOND My attraction to her Instantly killed Biggest turn off of my life All the sexy things she had ever told me were no longer sexy and I just couldnt picture us physically together anymore We used to roleplay fear play scenarios AND NOW THE FEAR PLAY TURNED INTO FEAR FOR A DIFFERENT REASON Like instead of Im going to hunt you down and devour you being hot now its giving Eat your vegetables sweetheart and Im just sitting there like NOOOOOO THE MAGIC IS GONE This is the kind of thing that would send Freud into overdrive Tell me how does this make you feel LIKE SCREAMING FREUD IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE SCREAMING My brain had built up this intense mysterious alluring figure and then boom grandma vibes And I ended up in some kind of weird family reunion yay This is for real one of the biggest plot twists of my life I basically turned 3 years of longing into a detective saga with a twist ending and instead of crying Im laughing about it At this point Im just happy because I can finally close this chapter but at the same time I feel shallow for losing attraction towards her immediately after seeing her Oh well not everyone can be attracted to their grandma,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 16:21:03 UTC,0,1,0.5,,,0,0

1j7abdn,Im unbearable to work with because of my mental illness,Im extremely anal about following rules to a tee at work Ive even gone to one of my bosses before to report the fact coworkers wont stop forcing me into their rulebreaking In all fairness I tell coworkers I want no part of their rulebreaking anticsyet they force me in anyway They really have no one to blame but themselves if they get in trouble or fired as a result of me informing my boss Heres what my coworkers dont realize though Id love nothing more than to let my hair down like they do Mental illness is the only reason Im such a stickler about rules I can explain As a result of my severe mental illness the mere thought of having to work at any other company makes me want to kill myself I have a hard time adjusting to new workplaces Plus Im extremely picky about which jobs Im willing to do Thats why I cling to this job like its gold You see Im rigid about rules not because I want to be but because this job is a matter of literal life or death for me I feel like I cant afford any sort of blemish on my workplace reputation Its pretty ironic my fixation on having a flawless workplace reputation ends up making me not very likeable to work with Is it my coworkers fault I have such a severe mental illness Id rather die than get a job elsewhere Absolutely not It is however 100 my coworkers fault that they pull me into their rulebreaking antics after Ive already said no,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 15:44:10 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j7a7x6,I need therapy Im so tired,Im so tiredof the debts these emotions the fights with my boyfriend and being so afraid for my 10 month old baby daughters future Were so behind on our bills were in so much debtwe owe so many people money Our friends our familiesIm so ashamed to face them I dont even talk to some of them anymore because Im so ashamed I feel so guiltyI want to pay them back but I dont have the means towhatever little money we get we use to pay for food and our utilities Theres never any extra left Were stuck in a constant loop of borrowing money to pay for all our debts and weve been stuck for yearsnearly as long as weve been together We know it has to stop but then how will we pay for things Were constantly looking through job postings and sending out applications I actually got a response from 1 of them but it doesnt start until April if I can submit all the requirements which is proving hard to do because we have no funds for itit sucks that you need money to make money my boyfriend hasnt found anything yet though he reassured me after one of our fights that he is looking at every job posting out there and stepping out of his comfort zone like I finally did last year Our fights have mainly been about our relationship were like roommates raising a baby and money troubles that usually leads to fighting about his difficulty finding a job Some days I understand that its just really hard to find one also we stayed in one industry for so many years that branching out now ishard And some days I doubt that hes actually expanded his options because I expanded mine and I found one so why cant he Our relationship is suffering almost just as much as our finances its dying Im barely interested in sex meanwhile being intimate physically is his love language Hes barely interested in other forms of intimacy which is my love language Weve had so many discussions to try and find a compromise but to no avail Most days I think our relationship is actually over Ive actually tried to break up with him in the past A few times before I even got pregnant a lot while I was pregnant and a few times after our baby was born All those times tho hes refused says he wants to keep fighting for our relationship I hador maybe have really bad postpartum depression it took me 3 months to even like my baby I was depressed and anxious the entire pregnancy but he was just sounreliable Like yeah he did what he could to make sure I got my checkups and other needs but he wasnt a good emotional support system he did the bare minimum is what I would call it He was feeling a lot of pressure and stress you could just tell I know how this makes him sound but hes not so terrible justdense I guess and pessimistic I also know how this makes me sound but I was working during my pregnancy because we couldnt afford for me to not be working too We both know that we both definitely should have stepped up when I got pregnant and looked for a better job than the ones we had but we didnt We were both scared and weve regretted it ever since Because even now that decision is bleeding into our current issues Ive considered just taking my baby and leaving so my boyfriend and I can get some much needed time apart to think But theres nowhere I can go I also have like a lot of cats that I dont want to leave him with because that would be an AH move theyre mainly my responsibility not his And yes I know they add to the expenses but they barely eat anymore because we cant afford to feed them regularly Weve tried to get them adopted but no one here wants rescued stray cats Most people in our country think theyre a waste of time and money I know we need therapy together and separatelybut that costs moneyandmoney is the one thing we just dont have These issues have been weighing so heavily on me for a long time but as Im typing it I just feel sillylike these arent really problemsother people have bigger problems is what my brain is saying Insecurities I guess TLDR My bf and I are broke in debt still looking for jobs have a baby together dying relationship exhausted fighting all the time and DEFINITELY need some form of therapy,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 15:39:41 UTC,1,2,1.0,,,0,0

1j79hp6,I cant really take it anymore,Sorry for the long ass post I would have made it longer but wanted to spare you the novel Im honestly just really lost and struggling so much right now Im 25 and suffer from a long list of mental and physical disabilities Im not really able to work right now due to my disabilities but am in the middle of a long process of trying to get on disability payments I still live at home with my mum and brother dad is deceased and I just found out last week my mum has stage 4 bone cancer My partner of 3 years doesnt live with me but is soon having to move out of his family home so has been putting pressure on me to move out with him as weve been together for a significant amount of time and we should be moving onto the next stage of our relationship Ive tried to explain that its difficult for me to move out as I dont have a job and the income I do get from the government isnt going to be enough to pay for rent let alone my food medications my dogs food and be expected to save for my doctor and specialist appointments but also to save to eventually buy a house like how he wants us to be able to do before turning 30 He just keeps telling me to apply for work and I only have experience in retail but due to one of my medical conditions I cant even stand for more than 5 hours on a good day without being in debilitating pain where I literally struggle to walk I have no experience in being a receptionist and no matter how many jobs I apply for no luck He wants me to move out as well as Im being treated as a stay at home mother looking after my mum and brother this is well before the cancer diagnosis I dont think as well that its sitting in for him that I very badly need and rely on being on my mums health insurance considering Im chronically ill and it can turn at anytime for me and sadly Im having a different surgery at least once a year sometimes twice a year so idk how Id be expected to afford that if I wasnt living at home with no job He refuses to live with my family until we can save enough to buy a house because he hates my family and well understandably is struggling to even see a future with me like this but I feel like hes in between a rock and a hard place with the fact that he does love me and how he doesnt want to leave me cause Im sick cause itd be like leaving someone whos got cancer which is an asshole thing to do And it doesnt help that Im struggling with my mums new diagnosis On top of everything else I personally am just really struggling with how beyond god damn emotional I am Late last year I fell down some stairs causing me to be bed ridden for 2 and a half weeks and in turn has caused me to develop or severely worsen potential already undiagnosed OCD Ive never been diagnosed before with OCD because truly I dont say out loud my thoughts and whatever I have disclosed or displayed gets pinned to my autism but since the fall Ive been consumed with anxiety depression anger guilt agitation and panic with mess things not being in a particular order mainly MY way of order I feel like a shell of who I once was I struggle to hide anything well I cry almost daily and have just started to learn either cry to myself when no one is around or wait for my therapist I dont ever want to leave my house cause if I stay at my partners house guarantee Ill be a sobbing mess when I get back cause my mum and brother always make a mess and they never clean up after themselves which in turn triggers me more I already am a pretty reserved person when it comes to my feelings cause I think itll come off over dramatic to others even though I know theyre valid but today I got proven why I think that because my partner asked me what was wrong when I got home and I spilt 14 of my thoughts and feelings and I got stopped with being told that maybe you just like to make things more difficult for yourself than it has to be Potentially thats true but also I dont mean to my brain just never shuts up which Im realising with typing this that yes it most definitely doesnt shut up The sadder thing is theres a lot more to my anxieties and why I cant take it anymore and maybe Ill just get a diary and deep clean till I cant walk I just want to be alone and lowkey sedated but I got an appointment in a couple days on an update to some scans and if Ill need surgery or not which is obviously another anxiety I frankly just feel a lot of pressure from my boyfriend and I feel pressure to look after and help my mum and if I dont well no one will cause my brother and her partner are useless I feel pressure on myself with my own mental and physical health getting a job and what kind of job realistically would even be good for me I feel temptation to go back into eating disorder tendencies or back into my addiction to smoking weed I feel beyond insecure about my appearance which I know is a vanity and self esteem issues I truly dont know what to do because try and take it day by day but I clearly have some control issues Im frustrated cause I dont want to die but I also dont want to be alive or at least conscious,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 15:04:42 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j796vy,I fear any possible future relationships for 1 particular reason,Im in my early 20s and Ive technically only had 2 relationships I say technically because the first was so onoff that it didnt even count as one plus she ended up cheating But what Ive noticed since the that one is that I tend to be overcaring sometimes clingy and think about whoever I have feelings for constantly as if an image of her is burned into my mind no matter where I look or even if my eyes are closed Ive been through some brutal ones where a girl I met at university a mates mate but single was so unbelievably beautiful funny wellmannered and smart that it was painful to keep thinking about her until I asked her out but she polited declined The other relationship was when I met an American girl studying here who actually liked me for who I am which was a surprise considering I believe myself to be the equivalent of Rocky Dennis in terms of looks but with the way I was around and to her I realise now I was too overcaring right at the start treating her as an already long term girlfriend when we just started dating for 2 days And then after a while of dating she tells me something resulting in a glorious stab in the heart where she quite literally said over these past few weeks dating you has made me realise I miss my ex and proceeded to fly back to Murica reddit wont let me say it properly for some reason THE NEXT DAMN WEEK FFS so naturally I crashed out and drank a lot So referring to the title of this the one main thing as to why I dont want a relationship is that I dont want to lose her ruin her life or make her detest me because of how I am with overcaring I hate it but better to stay alone than to ruin someones life And for those of you who say work on changing yourself trust me Ive tried but its pretty hard when you have little experience in the dating scene because you look like a damn goblin from clash of clans,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 14:50:04 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0

1j789eo,I think Im falling out of love,Im so lost I know relationships are never easy but Im just starting to think that maybe we didnt meet at the right time in each others lives I have so many insecurities in regards to being included in outings Her communication is really lacking and forgoes telling me how she feels about things Our most recent disagreement has been in regards to travel we cant come to a compromise and find a balance between her travelling with her and also my friends with time for us to spend together We promised wed travel with each other after this year fell through for similar reasons Instead I had to leave it at she will go with her friends instead of me Im hurt because it feels like she doesnt want to go away with me but shes hurt because I think that Shes promised to do better and apologised so many times for not communicating I feel like our bad times are more frequent than the good I want to push through because she is so loving caring and sweet but Ive got a massive piece missing rn and if I explain this to her she breaks down and stops talking entirely Im stuck I know I am so far from a bastion of perfection in this relationship but I just cant help but be frustrated and saddened by this Today I was sick and quite feverish so I spent a while thinking back to a past relationship While Im absolutely over that girl I just couldnt help but reminisce about how that short relationship three years ago made me feel I do hold it in very high regard because I was in the wilderness prior to it alone and totally confused about my place in the world before she showed me so Im now quite nostalgic about what she was for me especially now my needs just arent being met That girl and I met in the wrong time and the wrong circumstances to last but we ended very amicably I know its horrible and so unfair for my gf as well as the previous girl to keep thinking like this I love spontaneity and random intimate things and I have told her this but never does she ask me to come over for a karaoke drive at midnight with the windows down Never does she say she wants to spend the night with me somewhere random I sometimes ask but its usually a no I feel like Im right back to where I was preprevious relationship and Im lost and so sad I want to make things better and I know constantly comparing my last relationship to my current is really poor I know Im focusing on the negative things she does I know I could be better but Im so fucking demotivated bc she just doesnt talk and we just dont go out to do things Then a rift forms and I have to be the one to try and pull it back and then shes extremely upset and scared that I might leave her or she thinks shes a bad person I cant say how I really feel because of that It takes days for our usual fun side to return and then theres a couple weeks of good Rinse and repeat Longterm relationships are loads of battles to stay in love Some are so much harder but I do love her Though is it worth losing parts of who you are when Im this age Im emotionally exhausted by the constant confusion and stress of slow and lacking communication as well as my physical needs just not being met Im 23 so Im not looking to waste her or my time any longer if this just wont work I like solving things but this feels like its becoming bigger than me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 14:02:11 UTC,2,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j786on,I 21 F got addicted to porn and read disgusting stuff when I was a minor and now I feel gross and disgusting,Throwaway account because I feel terrible about this When I was young 10 maybe and I got an Ipod I would love doing stuff on it But then I got into fanfiction and thus I got into porn I still love fanfiction to this day I also was able to gain access to porn sites Pornhub Xvideoes Spankbang etc My mom had to work long hours and my uncle mostly left me alone were both quiet it got more convinent when I got old enough to become a lackey kid 14 But that day I was in the mood for porn every chapter what I now know as PWP So I would type chapter large number and then put tits or ass and then search I was already seeing gross things I wasnt supposed to but then I found a website and it had adults engaging with minors I was aware that sort of thing was bad but this was written not visual I knew the visual stuff was terrible and never looked for that sort of thing But the written stuff I just kept reading it I justified it as its only weird if Im an adult I never visualized ACTUAL real life children I would think about other fictional characters not sure if thats better but I did But now Im an adult and I feel disgusting I NEVER want to hurt a child in that way I despise child molestors And yet I still read this stuff I stopped when I was about 1819 not sure spefically but I know I havent read that stuff in the past three years and I remember not being able to find the sites anymore which was good in the long run Lately Ive been feeling really gross Like Im disgusting and I should feel awful what I did Which I should Its gotten worse this past year I didnt really think about it I still read stuff where characters were underage but limited to just being in their teens someone on AO3 who does a bunch of Harry Pottercrossover girls stuff and another one who had his own website and was registered on Literotica I want to cut those people out of my reading too I feel horrible for what Ive done and read More context I live with my mother she knows about the video porn thing but not the written stuff Im a college student I cant drive I rideshare everywhere I WANT to get therapy but I dont want to spend money My mom has actually taken me to therapy a few times this problem hadnt affected me mentally yet for me to bring it up plus most of the time my mother was in room so I wouldnt have done so regardless I actually got diagnosed with anxiety But I assume the reason we dont make it a regular thing is because its expensive The best thing I feel I can do is go to hotlines Sometimes they do make me feel better Once I watched some YT video about someone who hurt animals and I thought I could handle it but the woman said this man also read stuff from one of the sites I found I never liked that I would avoid that if I saw it and I FELT DESPECIBLE The hotline got me a nice lady that told me some gentle things that made me calm down But then I read one of the guys I mentioned work on Literotica the characters were ACTUALLY OF LEGAL AGE and it felt like I relapsed Then I watched porn on a specific website for specific kink of me but when I was looking for something one of the videoes said teenage and I began to spiral Because of one hand not all pornsites are trustworthy but on the other 18 and 19 legal adult age could still be referred to as teenage so I was confused so I called them and the lady didnt want to help me and she transferred me to a warmline they were nice but they asked for my insurance which I wasnt expecting so I ended up feeling emotionally drained It came to a head when I woke up this morning and I was on my period and then I started feeling those thoughts that was disgusting while my body was in pain I couldnt call because my mother was still asleep So I texted my hotline and the woman said my problem wasnt something a hotline could fix so she sent me all these links to porn addiction stuff They either cost money or I felt they couldnt help me because they talked about this happening to men Alternatively they could help but my mother was still in the house so I still felt I couldnt do anything immediately And it really felt like no one could help me I even signed up for Betterhelp though I remembered they had controversy and signed out before telling my problem So I decided to post this on here I really dont want to hurt anyone I want to put that terrible part of my past behind me But sometimes I cant help but think about it and feel disgusting,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 13:58:23 UTC,1,7,0.53,,,0,0
1j77ugw,Despite believing I am worthy I dont see any reason why anyone would care about me,Okay so this might come across as a little sad and bleak and I doubt that I will get any gentle responses Might as well be ranting because I have found a haven in Reddit lately I often wonder why anyone would like to be friends with me I struggle a lot with anxiety and maintaining attention and usually when I offer advice it is not that helpful usually overly philosophical and impractical Some people may like to engage in that kind of discussion I guess I dont have any interesting hobbies besides going to a cafe by myself and having a cigarette browsing and looking for jobs to advance my career I have a very niche sense of humour that can be overly sarcastic and easily offend I try to pick up hobbies but I end up wanting to escape my reality via watching too much TV cleaningdecluttering and spending time with my partner which I also dont see why he would stay with me after the initial attraction wears off I am probably extremely depressed as I grew up with a childhood trauma that I tried to address via therapy but it felt like the benefit wasnt outweighing the expense and somehow it felt even more depressing as my only only hope for getting better didnt look that hopeful A few therapists seemed to make me feel like my system was in a kind of a deadlock I find myself lately thinking often about why anyone would like to be friends with me even though I dont think less of myself I am young 32F attractive fit and financially independent I am welleducated and have a decentpaying job I rarely lie gossip and I like to support people by understanding their goals I like to treat my friends every now and again but I dont like transactional relationships I used to have creative ambitions but quit them and settled into a boring life when I saw nothing was really materializing How can I improve this sense of isolation helplessness with years of therapy as a last resort,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 13:40:00 UTC,3,7,1.0,,,0,0

1j777at,I feel so stupid for how bad my finances have gotten,As title says I 25m feel dumb for how bad me and my partner have handled our money Weve been living in the same place for about 3 years and we were pretty fine for the first 2 but this last year we have just made every dumb decision possible with our money and now we are majorly behind on rent for the second time and I have no idea what to do I used to work long hours with decent pay but quit for mental health When I did have money i burned through it When I started making less I didnt adjust and kept burning through it First time we were behind it was by about 3k and eventually we paid it Now were about 1500 behind and as Im working still for very little I dont really have a way to catch up quick and since its the second time our landlord whose kind of just a buddy wants us to pay by a certain date or leave fair Definitely dont have money to move definitely cant catch up just by working the way i am Deeply scared to try and go back to working long hours I have no formal training or schooling Definitely have analyzed the past few years and have realized Im mentally ill and unmedicated Its also so hard for me to get my head together because I feel like the country is going to shit and it feels so useless to try to do anything I also recently stopped talking to my parents which was a good decision but I didnt realize how much of a toll that would take on me I just feel so stupid about everything,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 13:04:29 UTC,1,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j773xl,I wouldnt marry my husband of 17 years if given a doover,Four years ago I felt like I had achieved all goals happiness and was married to my best friend For context I 35f and my husband 38m have been married for 17 years I met him as a teenager we dated and married promptly after my 18th birthday I felt like we had really worked through a lot of issues to build a good marriage and life together I dont have a strong support system of people in my life so it was just him and me against the world Well that changed and Ive been beating myself up about it for a while and trying to navigate my feelings or just ignoring them idk I started to have feelings for a coworker I know typical He has been a friend at work and is married There has been nothing romantic between us and I dont get any indication from him that he is interested in more He has just been supportive as my coworker and a friend and that friendship doesnt extend outside of work at all I have no interest in pursuing a romantic relationship with him either I dont want to have infidelity in my marriage or try to convince someone else to be untrue And breaking marriages for another person just means a worse marriage This has really led me to contemplate my life Why when everything was feeling so right did I start catching feelings for someone else I looked back at our relationship and started seeing all the negative I questioned if I was just looking for reasons to justify how I felt I came to the realization that our dating relationship was abusive and early years of our marriage More than just bad or two stupid kids He was very controlling pushed sex on me before I was ready and even used a sexual act two different times as punishment that was painful Anytime Im alone with my thoughts I think that so much of how I am today in my relationship with him was shaped by the bad times He isnt that person any more he isnt controlling and treats me better overall But I dont have friends am scared to make him mad scared to talk about my feelings am super agreeable to avoid any conflicts He has been explosive and mean in the past when he gets angry although that hasnt been too recently Nothing ever physical I still feel like a terrible person for thinking about another guy and feel some blame for wallowing in the past I think if I would do it all over and theres no way I would stay in the relationship if given a do over If I had a daughter I would teach her how to avoid this and reach out for help I feel like my eyes have been opened to the truth of our past I tried to bring it up with him by asking what he thought about our dating relationship He said he doesnt really think about it and I said that I thought it was bad I brought up some things and he didnt want to talk about it He said he had apologized and I just hadnt forgiven him for it He got mad and I got upset and cried I remember him giving an apology several years ago we both got drunk and he said he felt bad about things and I consoled him but Im just now realizing it was abusive I wanted to get confirmation from him that he agreed it wasnt a healthy relationship just for healing But there was nothing productive about it I find myself lately being depressed and bottled up I work full time and my husband hasnt had a job for a few years now I really dont care if he works but want him to contribute to our relationship in some way Instead he spends a lot of time sitting around the house on his phone making a mess and spending excessive amounts of time on hobbies And no I dont think there is any chance he is cheating I think he is also depressed My guilt and frustration are overwhelming I love him and he loves me but Im spending too much time in my head not dealing with my feelings just hoping things find their place and go back even though I know thats not likely I know I could use counseling to work on past trauma and learn to be a better partner myself So maybe Ill finally do that,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 12:59:24 UTC,706,67,0.91,,,0,0

1j7547j,I feel like Im stuck in a relationship and dont know what to do,I 25F have been in a longdistance relationship with this guy 23M for the past 15 years He was really sweet and caring in the beginning and I talked to him for a considerable amount of time before starting a relationship with him Its just that I think his behavior has changed compared to how it was during the talking stage and the first few months of the relationship He says hes a faultfinder and that its just a part of his personality In the beginning he only used to praise my appearance but over time he started commenting on my facial features nose forehead etc and many other things Ive had a bad case of acne throughout my adolescence due to sensitive skin and genetic factors so it couldnt be cured completely While I dont have cystic acne all over my face anymore I still occasionally get breakouts The skin on my body also gets inflamed easily after waxing Earlier he never said anything about itin fact he used to love and support me despite all of this But eventually he started telling me to use certain products to improve my skin Ive told him multiple times that this isnt how things work since Ive undergone treatment for most of my life but he gets irritated and says I dont even want to try and that I lose hope too easily Similarly he made comments on my facial features and said I need to get plastic surgery When I got upset he claimed it was just a joke I have a very chirpy bubbly personality and get excited easily We recently went to a concert and everything was fine until we were walking back As we were side by side with his arm around my neck we reached a narrow space where only one of us could pass at a time I was focused on our conversation so I stood there for a second or two before moving He got annoyed removed his arm grabbed me from behind and pushed me through the space After that he started scolding me for being too dumb to stand there and not move immediately which I dont think is even a reason to fight For the next hour he kept verbally abusing me asking if I was really dumb or just pretending to be around him He even mocked my excitable personality saying I get too excited to see him and then start acting dumb He also said I dont deserve anything he does for me including the concert which was my birthday present from him He kept going on and on while we walked back for an entire hour My head hung low and I was holding back tears the entire time When I had to catch the train to return home he held my backpack tightly from behind and forced me to jump onto the moving train even though I was scared and there was a huge risk involved in doing something like this I mean anything could have gone wrong We had gotten late and almost missed it Just two weeks ago he faked breaking up with me to teach me a lesson because he thought that was the only way I would understand He said he had fought with me multiple times over a single issue and since I didnt seem to get it he had to do this At first I thought he was just angry and didnt take it seriously But the next day he texted me dryly and told me it was final I was heartbroken and broke down in tears desperately trying to reach out to him That afternoon I videocalled him while crying hysterically begging him to come back He laughed in my face and told me not to cry that everything would be fine in two to three months and that I should just leave him He was completely unemotional and unnecessarily cold Each word hit me hard and I kept wondering where all his love had gone He knows Ive had traumatic experiences in my past relationships yet he took advantage of my biggest emotional vulnerability He knows I get anxious overthink everything and become inconsolable Despite that he played on my emotions The very next day he went on a fiveday trip with his friends which they had been planning since the previous week He barely responded to my texts or calls while I was a crying mess unable to eat sleep or work properly When he came back I decided to talk to him one last time because I was so hurt that I had finally made up my mind to end things But when I called him he acted as if nothing had happened I lashed out and told him everything he had done wrong and how I felt all those days After listening he finally realized how horribly he had treated me and admitted that he thought we would reconcile He had only pretended to break up with me so I would realize my mistake It was never real He thought wed just talk and sort it out I wasnt in the right headspace but I still gave him another chance There are other things that bother me and Ive told him a million times to work on them I always get excited for the weekends because were busy all week and I look forward to spending time together I usually plan for us to watch a movie and he always promises to be there at a certain time But then he keeps postponing because his roommates drag him along saying he cant stop them He keeps pushing it forward until its too late and I end up waiting At the end of the night I just say I understand and go to sleep He apologizes promises it wont happen again and then does it again the next weekend After the breakup drama we discussed this and he promised to change But that very day he did it again And then again this weekend He has also told me multiple times that if I dont start making good money and move in with him soon he might get attracted to someone else and leave me He constantly tries to make me jealous by talking about other girls even saying he doesnt want to waste the best years of his life in a longdistance relationship and wants to hook up with other girls Later he claims hes just joking and doing it to motivate me to work harder earn well and move in with him On the other hand Ive never belittled him or made negative comments about his appearance or insecurities He has acne scars and body dysmorphia but Ive always loved him as he is making sure he feels comfortable in his own skin I tell him hes the most perfect guy for me and that he doesnt need to change anything to feel good or deserving But he constantly criticizes me mocks me when I express my struggles and calls me weak whenever I try to talk about things that hurt me He says he doesnt like weak people who crib all the time which makes me feel like I cant even discuss my problems with him If I do he gets annoyed fights with me and tells me Im playing the victim instead of being strong Honestly Im just really confused I love him and dont want to leave but I dont know if hes good for me PS The mistake he wanted me to realize was that he thinks I need to develop new skills to switch to a better job My current job is hectic and lowpaying but I have to work hard throughout the week With my parents declining health I cant study every weekend Sometimes I slack off because Im overwhelmed and need to cool off He tells me I need to hurry up and when I explain my situation he fights with me mocks me and says Ill never earn well or do anything in life because Im not trying hard enough Edit Additionally he has told me multiple times that other peoples opinions of him matter a lot He wants to be likable to everyone He said he used to get a lot of attention before developing acne but things changed after that which is why he constantly seeks validation from others He gets upset when girls in general dont give him attention Whenever I ask why he seeks attention from other girls when Ive always appreciated and motivated him he simply says its because Im his girlfriend so my words dont count He also gets noticeably excited and happy whenever he finds out that a girl is interested in him as it satisfies his need for validation Ive always brushed it off but idk if its a concern or not,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 10:46:43 UTC,1,3,1.0,,,0,0

1j73qfo,My partner is completely irresponsible with money and Im considering breaking up,I apologize in advance for any grammarspelling mistakes english is not my first language For context me 27F and my bf 25M have been in a relationship for 5 years and living together in my fathers house for 4 in my country living costs are really high so its pretty common to still stay with your parents beyond your 20s At the end of last year my bf decided he needed a new phone for posting content tiktok and reels since his current phones camera wasnt good and his career gym instructor personal trainer could use a boost from social media While I agreed that a new phone with a better camera would help and I knew that he had saved some money I asked him to wait a little longer 1 month or 2 before making any impulsive puchases since I was unemployed at the time and that money could be used for any emergencies Well he disregarded everything I said and decided to buy the phone anyway and to make a long story short it was a scam in wich he lost almost 800 To say I was disappointed is an understatement because i told him before that even though the money was his and he could use it any way he wanted the shop was really suspicious and it was better to buy from an official store if he was going to spend that much in a phone It was really frustrating but I tried to help him contact his bank to see if there was anything we could do and to my surprise they refund almost half of the money but my happiness was short lived because the very next day he fell for another scam and lost both the recovered money plus 300 250 from his account and 50 from mine I was livid at this point the car had broken down another 600 expense we had no way to pay our share of the bills plus the repair costs and he had to ask for money from his mother bless her to solve everything but we survived Well now Im employed and things were better until yesterday when he told me he was thinking again about buying the phone to wich I told him no way not right now since were not completely stable yet to spend that much money and I thought he would be at least a bit more mindful since were still paying for his poor decisions from last year and we barely have money for bills but he didnt want to listen to my reasoning kept justifying why he needed it and Im sure hell buy it even though he knows that if he does that Ill have to cover his share of house expenses and Im honestly mentally and emotionally exhausted I feel like he isnt my partner anymore just an oversized toddler and its draining me For additional context hes been betting his money on soccer games and although he wins most of them last week he almost lost all of the grocery money Our currency is not USD so those are all approximate values If you survived my ranting thank you for reading everything,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 09:04:59 UTC,9,7,0.86,,,0,0

1j73e1b,I killed my dog and its been haunting me for a long time now,A bit of backstory I used to live in the countryside with an older relative and she had a habit of acquiring pets she was unable and unwilling to take care of eventually we ended up with four dogs two small and two large The problem is that every time we would open the front gate to take the car out the dogs would run out into the brush and potentially put themselves in danger so wed lock them in a tiny cage for a few minutes while we drove out and then come back in and let them out into the yard The two large dogs started to get too big and the relative refused to buy a new larger cage for them and told me to figure it out it was my job to lock up the dogs and this relative could basically boss me around all she wanted eventually I started putting one of the smaller dogs in an open plastic barrel while the others stayed in the cage but she learned to jump out so I would put a lid on it for more than five minutes I hate myself for it but I am an extremely almost medically forgetful person And one day I simply forgot about the dogs and went to work truly believing that I had let them out as usual I came back to find that the dog had suffocated in the covered barrel I cant explain the emotions I had in that day but that happened when I was 16 and it still makes me nauseous to think about Ive had a very hard life but for some reason I think that this day was the worst day There was a lot of screaming and crying from both the relative and I and she made me wrap the dog in an old dog food bag and carry it to the car so that I could dump it far from our property unceremoniously It still fucking haunts me Everyone tells me it was an accident but I still have nightmares about it All I can think about is how horrible it must be to be a tiny innocent thing suffocating in a plastic barrel on a hot day It eats me alive Everything makes me anxious I dont want to be responsible for something like that happening again I want to have kids one day but how can I knowing that theres a possibility that they can meet a horrible end just because my mind is in the clouds The only time I spoke of this event was the day it happened to various online friends and then I never spoke of it again since until now Im laying in bed and trying to sleep and maybe it would help if someone knew Im sorry Lila I didnt mean to,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 08:38:30 UTC,0,1,0.33,,CONTENT WARNING ANIMAL ABUSE,0,0

1j706wr,I was a sexual degenerate as a child and feel deeply ashamed and uncomfortable about it,Throwaway account because I dont want anyone I know to see this This is something Ive only ever told one person and I feel deeply uncomfortable to even tell a therapist For context I have never been a victim of sexual abuse physically was raised in a super healthy home life etc Nothing traumatic has ever happened to me due to another person I personally knew When I was younger I purposely would go on a site called KidzChat I knew that predators would be on that site and would advertise myself as someone to talk to F 12 I was around the ages of 1014 doing this Older men would then message me super sexually explicit things We would sext for a while and eventually trade Skypes to talk or videochat The biggest instance that I remember was skyping an older man who wanted to show me his jumping jacks He would jump for a while and then his pants would conveniently fall off For some reason that moment is engrained in my mind I know Im a victim fully but I feel weird because I went out looking for it I guess thats the cost of unlimited Internet access Another entirely separate thing that bothers me severely is that one day aged 11 I had my family dog perform oral on me The dog didnt need any coaxing it liked the smell and went up to it I remember it feeling awful and I felt so intensely guilty afterward I never did it again but I realize that this has deeply affected me as an adult I absolutely cannot receive oral from a man because it reminds me of what I did with my family dog This fact genuinely haunts me as I know it was completely wrong and animal I dont even know how to cope with both of these facts as I was a victim and perpetrator These things still affect me in my sexual life now manifesting as intense fear and guilt to commit certain normal sexual acts with people like being eaten out sexting my boyfriend etc I know I dont have the guts to tell a therapist either,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 05:01:10 UTC,160,23,0.89,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j6zmot,I 35m think my Brother 32m hates me,I dont know what spurred this on our relationship was always seemingly good I 35m think my Brother 32m hates me Ive been in a rough phase of my life moved back in with my parents had just a terrible string of events dovetailing with my business failing and the loss of my Father all in short period He died suddenly Im still working through that I was the one who took him to the hospital a few times that week but the last time it was a serious emergency and he didnt get out He died a few weeks later after being in a coma for the time This sort of at least in my opinion galvanized us into having a closer bond Or so I thought Dad dying was only a few months ago It hasnt been a year yet But Im still trying to pick up the pieces and start moving forward And it was like our relationship with each other improved over it We were a very loving family before but this hurt us and we leaned on each other more Then I learned the other day my Mom brought the hypothetical prospect of me being homeless I dont intend to be homeless But she brought it up to him or he brought it up to her and he flat out told her that if I ever end up homeless I am not going to be living in his and his wifes house For the record I didnt ever ask or mention this But this conversation took place behind my back and he apparently said that I was never going to be allowed to live with them They have a very large house btw essentially half the rooms are empty at any given day That shocked my Mother to hear that and she told me And quite frankly it shocked me too I am not going to be homeless But to hear someone you thought you could rely on if things ever went to total shit say that its sad But what made me more sad was remembering a conversation I had with him a few months before He told me his wife 31 fs best friend 30 f who has a kid and either got kicked out of her own house or cheated or something became a single mother My brother told me he was actively considering moving her and the kid INTO their house She who has had numerous problems from heavy drug use alcohol use partying hard who has seemingly reformed her ways was welcome to live with them It didnt end up happening because she QUICKLY found a new guy But that was a total shocker to me that I who has had no problems with drugs and alcohol who helps take care of his kid who buys her toys and plays with her who has bought them gifts every holiday is lower on the totem pole than the single mom best friend of the wife It totally blindsided me and I feel betrayed Im not at any risk of being homeless but the conversation came up between my Mom and him and thats how it went To think your own brother wont be there for you but will be for some sketchy broad is totally insane And for me its like Im feeling just heartbreak resentment sadness disappointment all mixing together I love him I still do but I feel like I just got betrayed Betrayed over something that hasnt happened yet But that he thinks so low of me is shocking really I dont know what to do,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 04:27:13 UTC,2,5,0.75,,,0,0
1j6z9id,General depression post I suppose 28m,Hey Team Ive been feeling super duper down in the dumps lately and want to vent serious style without fear of personal societal repercussions This is a throw away account n such Not really curating this post just typing about whatever comes to mind Ive never really been the happiest of people Even in my youth I remember being melancholic more than not Didnt have the best upbringing not the worst by a long shot either My parents fought with each other all the time if I didnt have someone over I remember hiding in my room hearing them arguing downstairs hoping against hope it wouldnt lead into my room with them competing for my favoritism There were times either my mom or dad would try to drag me out of the house to stay at a hotel with them because the other parent was crazy and untrustworthy Events like this were common place once or twice a month in the house up until I was around 14 when it all kinda just died out My parents stopped fighting daily maybe once a month or so until not at all They never even acknowledge the horrors they would put me through They just tell me it wasnt as bad as I think but it totally fucking was It was hell not to mention how often they would remind me how abnormal of a human I am Ive been diagnosed either adhd and I highly suspect I have highfunctioning autism I never really managed to fit in around others as a kid often doing things my own way Friends were hard and socializing was harder My parents would try with all their might to assimilate me into normal behavior My mom didnt let me shop for my own clothes until I left the house I bought some shirts with some cats on them with one of my first paychecks maybe 16 yrs old She took and hid them from me because she was afraid people would think Im girly or gay which blew my mind My dad wasnt the most supportive of my interests either I recall a time when i was in grade school I really liked filming and doing stop motion Lego things I probably just caught him at a bad time wasnt very many good times forgot what I asked but I remember his reply was along the lines of it doesnt matter anyway it wont go anywhere in regards to my shortlived hobby I dont think I picked up that camera again after that I wish I did Cant blame myself there i guess I was young and impressionable I wonder often how things play out if he never said those words Probably not much different but maybe instead I just spent most of my time online hiding behind headphones blocking out the screaming Didnt have many friends growing up Id typically just pick one person I liked and puppy dog around them I was pretty shy and often to target of harassment from some of the meaner kids in school I got used to being the butt of jokes and such pretty early It didnt bother me much but it definitely scared me off from trying to form connections That said I managed enough I had a lunch table to sit at most of the time I wasnt usually the star attraction but the folks there didnt seem to mind my presence I recall once I didnt really feel comfortable sitting at any table so I sat at an empty one This prompted the principal to come over and with good intentions have me sit at a table with a bunch of strangers I didnt really know Horrifying experience That said I didnt really spend too much time hanging out with friends irl I unfortunely found connections on the world wide web Despite how strict my parents could be they let me have unfiltered internet access from the very get go when i got my first laptop at 12 or so They never monitored my activity or set restrictions on screen time or anything Longstory short I end up in some unsavory online spaces I met people who at the time I thought were nice friends parental figures people to talk to when I didnt have parents I could It wasnt until a bit later in my life I realized how groomed I got I never thought much about it at the time It seemed like people finally enjoyed my company wanted to invite me to chat and stuff I didnt see the harm at the time at all Just some textbased roleplays maybe a picture or two without my face Whags the harm Now in my adulthood I feel like Im able to see the effects more My libido is so high yet the thinking about sex makes me extremely uncomfortable in a way thats hard to describe I get jealous disgusted confused lustful etc etc etc whenever I see or am reminded of the mere concept of penetration Whats worse is I think its effected my love language too I feel I have a really difficult time feeling like Im showing I love someone if Im not having sex relatively often I doubt myself and if Im able to provide and be a good partner I know theres so much more to a relationship but my brain always defaults back to thoughts along these lines I hate it but the nature of the issue causes me to love it Its such a conflicting mess of sexual frustration I have no idea how to do a segway here so 3 Anxiety is a big thing in my life It wasnt so bad when I was younger mostly manifesting in social anxiety around new people or crowds Nowadays I sometimes feel anxious just leaving my apartment Going to the store is a massive panic attack and I have no reasons why I desperately want to put myself out there meet new people and enjoy this life I have but the exhaustion from the anxiety and depression just constantly kick my dick straight into the dirt Depression is the worst Its only gotten worse since I broke up with my seven year long partner we were engaged too at the time The break up is a long story with no heroes and only villains and victims I dont want to dive into it here Im a bastard theyre a bastard Point is Im a total bastard livid with regret over such minute details I miss my ex I care about them but I dont trust them anymore and I loathe the mere memory of them Its such a dissonance I cant think back to the early days and not wonder if any of it was real at all Im sure there was true love between us sometime I wonder when we lost it and I fear they mightve never felt love for me like I did for them We were young when we met Stupid too probably Grew up and got distant yadayada happens I still miss them their quirks and such The way they talked and the way they ate Even the things that annoyed me I miss its wild how much I miss the things that pissed me off Anyway this post is going a bit long Its bedtime for me Thanks for reading my cool epic post Might post more vents like this,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 04:05:50 UTC,7,0,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0

1j6yrtb,I feel stuck and I dont know what to do,Using a new account as I have people on my original account who know me irl and I dont want them to even come across this As the title says I really feel stuck at this point in my lifeIm currently 27 and turning 28 next week All of it started two years back when me and my then girlfriendlets call her M of 5 years started having a ton of arguments It was mainly regarding my admission process and my promise of hitting the gym I had quit my cushy job towards the end of 2022 to focus on my exams and my application process It was a frustrating time for me as I had a pretty good profileor so I was told and expected to get an admit from almost all the universities that I had applied to As it later turned out all my hopes got dashed as I only rejection after rejection In the middle of it there was a family function for which I had to travel to a different citythis is also the city where I did my undergrad from and M also lived To give a backstory we had been together since my sophomore year of undergrad and our relationship was a long distance oneWe only saw each other during classes when we were studying After graduation I had moved to a different city for work and went to my hometown when COVID hit us So during the time of this family event I planned to take out some time and planned a dinner with Mduring which I specifically told her that I didnt want to discuss my application process and that I was taking this trip as sort of a break Unfortunately our conversation ultimately went into that direction and what I thought would be a warm evening ended up with me feeling helpless and ultimately crying in the restaurant After the family event ended I travelled back to my city and then had a talk with her and we both decided well take a break and introspect why we were arguing almost on a daily basiswe specifically decided that we will not be seeing or planning to see anybody in that period but work on this and figure things out Almost a month later a mutual friend of ourslets call her C tells me that M actually went on a couple of dates to see peopleC and M were very close friends which broke the trust I had in the whole relationship and I told that my trust in us was broken and that we were done I developed this feeling of being inadequate and ended up getting addicted to porn to numb myself instead of studying and working on projectsMy whole routine was to hit the gym and work out till I felt pain in my body return back to home and sleep About a couple months later I learnt that it was C who had actually convinced M to go on dates and meet other people Furiously I cut contact with C and stopped any form of communication As far as things with M were concerned I was still too attached to her so we decided we can try to work on things Things changed a bit and I got an admission in a good university and started my postgrad journey here But during the winter of 2023 me and M again had some serious arguments and I decided to cut ties with her We still chatted on and off and she still told me she loved me Around 2 months from that time we tried to get back together again but ultimately I couldnt sustain it this timethe distance had become a pain turns out in a different country loneliness hits you like a truck And this time we broke up once and for all I felt and I still feel immense guilt for breaking up and putting her through a lot of pain I sank into a pretty low state got hooked to porn but studied enough to keep my grades up ultimately leaving any opportunity of upskilling myself or studying but kept sinking lower and lower Around a month back I talked to a therapist and told her about my guilt and that I had been in a state of feeling like I do not deserve anything nice because I hurt M and that I self sabotaged whenever anything good came in my life She heard all of my story and did tell me a lot of times when I was emotinally scarred and somewhat even manipulated by her as well Now that I see this I feel helpless I inflicted a lot of pain and self sabotage on myself and my addiction to porn has turned me into a very lazy person I know that deep down I have the potential to excel if I figure my shit out The thing is I am not able to I feel burnt outrecently even failed an interview at a reputed big tech company I hardly have energy to study reversed all the progress I made in the gym and somehow not able to shake off this addiction Its tough to put on a brave face and fake a smile telling my family that Im alright while Im numb deep down I want to cry and take some of the pent up emotions out but I simply cannot cry and give anyone a hint that Im not alright My family is very supportive and I dont want them to feel helpless knowing that Im not as good as I tell them Just wanted to take this feeling out Thank you so much for reading,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 03:37:44 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j6yegx,i think i ruined the friendship between my sister and her best friend,another long post for context myf18 sister17 and her best friendf15 almost 16 lets call her Dana have been friends for almost a decade theyve always spent a lot of time together because our moms were friends the last few years have been very very rough for Dana and weve always been here for her especially my sister and that made them even closer so today during lunch my sister came to my mom and asked her if she could go out for a party night with Dana and her friend group BUT here in italy there are two stages of the party the first one is open to everyone the second one is only 18 and she wanted to go right to the second one that begins around midnight my mom immediately said no and my sister started whining saying that Dana went there too a few weeks ago and guess how she did that fake ID and some connections and that surely didnt help to have a yes as an answer a few hours ago i was with my sister and Dana just talking until my sister asked my thought about going to that party at that hour and i said honestly i dont approve that not because youre going there but because youre gonna do it illegally and she got angry saying that she wanted to do that experience because shes a teenager and blah blah blah to which i replied yeah youre a teenager and have to do your experiences but you can make them on the first half of the night where you can go without any problem and i think she expected me to be the cool older sister because she got angry and it only got worse when my brother21 also said he agreed with me so she went upstairs and i stayed with Dana so i started talking with her about all this the conversation then went to my sisters general behaviour and we went to my room to talk more liberally after a while we were talking about how she my sister almost never wants to go out unless one of us has weed or cigarettes and stuff like that and thats when i told her something i had forgot last august they both were at home my best friend was there as well and we were all chilling in the backyard when Dana told my sister that she had to go to herDanas place that she promised that but my sister was whining about it saying she didnt feel like it but not giving a reason to break the promise so they came up with a deal Dana would have gone home and my sister would go there about a half hour later so Dana left i stayed with my best friend and my sister who started saying things like i dont wanna go i dont feel like it and i replied other things like why dont you tell her if you stand her up without saying anything ill tell her and she freaked out saying that if i did i would be a bitch and i just rolled my eyes after a while she left and went to her room and i immediately gave my best friend a i know how this will end up look but didnt say anything almost a hour later Dana calls me and says your sister isnt answering my texts and calls where is she i took a deep breath and face palmed mentally before answering shes in her room ill go check on her and so i did i muted myself and went to my sister who was awake and told her Danas on the phone what do i tell her and she replies tell her that im asleep my heart dropped and i didnt know what to do so i just played along unmuted myself and said shes sleeping Dana was so disappointed and told me to wake her up so i started shaking my sister trying to wake her up but she just pretended to fall asleep again and again and i heard Dana say look never mind let her sleep i asked her if she was sure and she said yes and i just said okay then bye love im sorry and hung up i looked at my sister and said a few things like youre an asshole youre a shitty friend so returning to two hours ago i told Dana about it even though i probably shouldnt have but i just thought it was the right thing to do her face dropped and she became visibly sad and disappointed said something like i dont even know what to say i cant think or look at her the same and i felt kind of guilty but still thought that she had the right to know we smoked two cigarettes and she went to sleep saying that she would figure out what to do about all this again shes clearly disappointed and tired of my sister being disrespectful its currently 4am and im sorry for ruining her mood but also scared of my sisters reaction in case she finds out that Dana knows ive already made a post about my sister and her behaviour english is not my first language so sorry for any mistakes andor things like that i just didnt want all this to eat me up,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 03:16:28 UTC,0,3,0.5,,,0,0
1j6y144,My mother is putting my grandfathers dog down without his knowledge,So almost 10 years ago my mother and my now ex stepfather got gifted two dogs My mother never wanted them since she already had a lot on her plate but since my ex stepfather did there really wasnt much of a choice My ex stepfather began getting more and more abusive until we all finally left and despite my mother knowing we didnt have the best ability to take care of them we took the dogs because they were also being abused by my ex stepfather Then my grandfather began living with us and eventually one of the dogs became his while the other became my stepbrothers who came with us when we left her father A lot of stuff happened and my stepbrother left and took his dog with him leaving the other to be my grandfathers completely as we somewhat moved into separate households Well more stuff happened and my mother ended up having to take the dog back with her living in a small camper on borrowed property It hasnt been ideal for her or the dog The dog has cancer and has occasional seizures and because of that and the unfortunate circumstances my mother has been wanting to put the dog down for a while She has some aggression issues after having pups being shot and being run over in a short span of time a few years back so she has been unable to rehome her Well its come down to it and because my grandfather is unable to take her she is getting put down soon without his knowledge I get she is a sick dog who isnt living in an ideal situation by any means but I still feel terrible that its going this way I just had to get this out,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 02:55:52 UTC,2,2,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING ANIMAL ABUSE,0,0
1j6xt9p,i 19F at the time was kidnapped and raped by a siblings friend 32M and now hes trying to come back into my life,im going to try keep details to a minimum as i dont want anyone to recognise me from this post so identifying details like genders names ect will be changed i would also like to note that i do suffer from a form of neurodivergence that can make me incredibly naive at times in the few months preceding this kidnapper event i had a partner who i suffered quite a traumatic miscarriage with he ended up cutting me off the day i was in the hospital it was terrifying and incredibly lonely at the time a sibling of mine whom i live with had been having some friends over often and naturally i started getting to know them and would hang out with their friends too this was something i did often as i was struggling heavily with the grief of losing both my pregnancy and essentially being broken up with and left to think about it alone After hanging out with my siblings friends for a few weeks Taylor M32 started giving me gifts I have quite an interest in sterling silver religious jewellery and he had given me a few pieces during this time of us hanging out a silver chain with a saint pendant a very dainty 14k gold bracelet another small silver bracelet I thought nothing of it its quite common amongst us here to exchange gifts often among friends and family so i didnt see it as anything more than that as i myself have given people fine jewellery randomly before One day he asked me if i wanted to go to his home to see his pets and just chill and do some art I agreed as he had some very unique reptiles which i was curious to see After getting to his house it was then that things took a really bad turn He sexually assaulted me on several occasions I was not allowed to leave the house unless he was supervising me and it would only be to his garden that i could go I was also not allowed to wear any clothes in his home he would take them from me under the guise of washing them and not return them unless he wanted me to go outside with him He allowed me to return to my own home on two occasions however he was present the entire time and would not let me out of his sight and would regularly complain about how we needed to leave back to his home He would regularly belittle my appearance try to convince me that i would have to laser remove all of my tattoos as they looked disgusting he told me that my earrings were disgusting and masculine and how he couldnt believe anyone would ever have had sex with me because of how gross they were He would force me to stand on weighing scales when i didnt want to so he could know my weight and then proclaim to me that well have to fix that I know that people will probably wonder where were my parents in this situation and the reality is that they were on vacation They left the family home for multiple months at a time and whenever my mother would call me he would answer the phone on my behalf and tell her how i was happy and i was okay and convinced her that i was his girlfriend even though i was being held against my will and assaulted in his home I asked on several occasions to go back home and he would tell me maybe next week and next week would just never come and even then i had no clothes so i simply couldnt leave i managed to escape because i had a large concert planned and after arguing with him for days he finally let me leave so i could go to the concert as soon as i got home i messaged him and told him never to speak to me again or i would be calling the police for a few weeks after this he harassed me on different platforms he posted pictures of me he had taken against my will on social media saying for people to look at his girlfriend he would change his profile pictures to pictures of me or would make profiles in my name in the end i ended up blocking him and changing all of my social handles that brings us to now its been about 10 months since this happened i did not go to the police as i did not want to have to relive what happened to me he also told me many stories of violence he had committed against women who had called the police on him in the past we also had no text conversations at all prior to me being harassed by him amp i truly just believe the case would get thrown out i have had a reoccurring nightmare about him breaking into my house killing me almost every night for the past few weeks i confessed this to my sibling who introduced me to him and was told that he had been trying to contact my sibling he was claiming to have purchased gifts for them and sending them photos of the gifts he had bought and how much he had paid and that this had been happening for weeks and my sibling had been simply ignoring his messages i feel sick why would he do this why would he want to come back into my life after the terror he put me through he told me on several occasions that he in his own words felt like he was the predator and that i was the prey and it was his natural instinct to hunt me down he also told me how he had only been coming to hang out at my house because he had been fantasising about me i dont know what to do in this situation all i know is that im scared and i feel like i have no one to tell who can truly understand my story or my fears of him trying to pry his way back into my life and into my

1j6wnuu,Teen Nightmare,Teen Nightmare This happened many years ago I dont want anyone to get in trouble or press charges I just need to finally be able to speak about what happened I was 17 at the time and I volunteered as a Sheriff explorer during this time I met a deputy who in the beginning was really nice to me I had just graduated highschool but my 18th birthday wasnt until a few months later I was scheduled to go on a ride along we were required to go on patrol at least once every three months or so and he volunteered to take me on this day This first time went fine I was super shy but he got me to open up he talked about himself and asked me about what my plans were after graduating It wasnt until the second time I went on patrol with him around a month later that things took a turn I knew he had a girlfriend she was only two years older me but this time around he started talking about how things were rocky between them I didnt think much of it I thought he was just venting and no harm done However he was being super touchy and was flirting and at that time I was too shy to say anything He ended up kissing me out of nowhere and he just smiled and said he needed to know if I was attracted to him Im not going to lie I was he was good looking but I asked him about his girlfriend he said she wouldnt care He offered to take me home after the shift and he did but not before he ended up taking me to an abandoned field and said he just wanted to talk We ended up making out in his car and i told him i didnt want to have sex that it was as far as i would go he said it was fine but kept pushing and pressuring for more He said if i really had feelings for him i would be willing to go all the way He took me home after about an hour and explicitedly told me that if i was asked by any other deputy to just say were friends I liked how special he made me feel and the red flags were there but i honestly thought he wouldnt force me to have sex with him since at that point he did stop when i told him to even if he continued to ask From this point on whenever I would patrol with him things would go further Until finally one day after my 18th birthday he said he would take me home but instead he hopped on the freeway towards his apartment I was scared but at that point I felt speaking up would get me abandoned somewhere unfamiliar or worse We made it to his place and he gave me a beer and led me to his bedroom I felt like I couldnt say no he told me to relax that I would like it that it was just my nerves We ended having sex but I finally was able to tell him he needed to stop that he was hurting me but all he would say was just let me finish its OK youll like it in a minute No amount of pleading worked until he finally rolled off me By then I was shaking and oddly felt numb about the whole thing He took me home and again told me to say we were just friends He would lose his job if anyone found out making me feel guilty I ended up quitting the program a few months later and foud out he was being investigated for misconduct on a whole different issue I regret keeping quiet but at the time I was confused and developed feelings for him Other deputies became suspicious since they noticed he would go out of his way to talk to me but no one ever asked me personally if anything happened I know this is long and confusing but it feels good to finally speak about it Ive held this in for 16 years I had posted and then deleted I freaked out a bit that it was shared but if it helps anyone else in a similar situation so they speak up then it is what it is Also for clarity he was nine years older than me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 01:41:28 UTC,1,0,0.99,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0
1j6wish,Im done holding on to the scraps of relationship my father and I have left,Very long and emotional story short or as short as I can get it gt013 I grew up a daddys girl I love my father with my whole heart and cherish his presence I am inherently anxious and suffer from undiagnosed AUDHD anxiety disorder and depression but it doesnt affect me as much because my family is loving and kind gt gt13 My mother and I caught my father cheating on her He told us he stopped and that he was sorry gt gt1315 I didnt talk to my father directly as I felt betrayed and hurt This was made worse when my mother kept trying to stand up for him I later learnt she was trying to stop the mistress from contacting my father so that she and him could work on their relationship gt14 My mother is diagnosed with cancer but they cant tell what kind or how far along it is My father grows even more distant from us and the arguments increase gt1516 My mother is hospitalized and my father starts talking to this woman on his phone I start to feel more anxious My mother advocates for my father but it just makes me more mad and hurt They argue more now and I find myself becoming emotionally distant from my father gtLate 16 My mother dies and I shut down as well as shut myself off from my family friends and peers I am angry at my father as he does not seem as affected and was also the cause of my mothers stress before she died My older brother tries to soothe me and we traumabond My father tries to relate to me as his mother died a few months before mine but he doesnt understand that it isnt the same gtMy father dates moves in and then marries a woman I have never met in less than 8 months His friends my trusted adults all support him as well as his family and peers I am hurt but I pass it off as him just grieving differently I was sure it was a phase and that they would break updivorce soon enough I later find out its the same woman he cheated on my mother with lied to us about and then continued to talk to while my mother was battling cancer I confront him about this and he says that he thought I knew who she was despite us never being formally introduced to her To this day I know next to nothing about her Only her first name where her mother lives and the name of one of her children gtFathers wife is emotionally and verbally abusive towards me and my brother but I being the younger and more emotional one take it harder gtShe tells me that Im killing my father by arguing with him and that he will end up dead just like my mother I yell back at her to defend my father as I take it very seriously when someone wishes death upon another even indirectly but my father takes her side and berates me for defending him gtHe does a myriad of other things threatening to sell off my cats locking them outside and causing one to die from the cold as punishment for me not agreeing with him as well as pretending not to hear when his wife flat out threatens to kill me He was right next to her when she said it mind you gtUnder the advice of my older cousin from my moms side I report the wife to the CPS but he denies hearing her threaten me to the social workers which makes me look like an emotional teenage girl We get placed into family therapy but the therapist is borderline sexist and just wants us to be a family unit regardless of the womans blatant disregard for my safety gtI ask my father why hes choosing his wifes needs over the safety of his biological children whom he claims to adore and he simply says that the Bible says wife before children Id argue that doesnt apply to wife that you cheated on your childrens mother with and who threatens you children but okay dad gtI sleep with a knife under my pillow just in case she tries to harm me My anxiety and depression levels are through the roof gt17 19 I cant remember much from these years but it mostly involves me trying to bond with my father as hes the last living parent I have I go through 3 relationships and have no one to talk to or seek comfort from when it goes downhill My father thinks were getting better because of him and not because of the gigantic effort and emotional stuffingdown Im doing as even being near his wife makes me anxious to the point of insomnia As angry as I was before I still love my father and want him in my life I tell him that he can pick any other wife just not her and I would be genuinely happy with that He doesnt care and only treats me well when shes not there away on vacation or at her mothers house When she is around though he is more distant and visibly more tense gt20 My father announced that he wants to split our house physically half of it is to go to me and my brother as it was built when my mother was alive and she paid for and designed it I tell him that I dont want him to do it as it will just drive us further apart but his reasoning revolves around his wife and her comfort My brother and I have long assumed that his wife is just with him to benefit from his money she doesnt treat him nicely but he doesnt seem to notice I know its childish and naïve but I didnt want him to distance himself from me even though he has hurt me so much for so long I still cry Ive actually just stopped crying as Im typing this whenever I think about how far weve already drifted apart Our relationship went from one of trust smiles secret fastfood lunch breaks and long hugs to me not even being able to tell him about the girl that broke my heart and how I would love to have one genuine dadhug from him so that he can tell me its alright I would love to have him at my wedding one day but I dont know if that will ever happen I dont want to grow up not in a world where he dies alone and regretful but it seems that thats the only way for me to not end up living my entire life clinging to his leg begging him to look back and maybe love me the way he used to So Im done Im done wanting his love and Im done waiting on him to realise he was wrong and that I still needed him Im going to be something and Im going to love someone and let them love me in return I deserve better TLDR My father has hurt me with his actions and his words for too long Im going to learn how to live without him no matter how much it will hurt to let him go,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 01:33:45 UTC,35,5,0.97,,CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCEDEATH,0,0

1j6cvlf,Ive been living with my abuser and my mothers rapist since 2012 and her 7 siblings protected him,Sorry in advance for this being DENSE with context and a little bit nonsequential at the end but its necessary to me understand the gravity of this I think My mother was raped by my grandfather when she was 26 He was 60 but strong My brother and I were 5 and 8 at the time and we were in the house when it happened I vaguely remember the screaming and having to be temporarily resituated at a friends house until my mom found out where to go Two of my uncles showed up one kept grandpa restrained while the other spoke to the police I think one of them threatened to kill him or something but regardless he never saw the inside of a cell for it I still dont know why more on that later He has ZERO criminal record except for vehicular manslaughter the young womans underwear was found in a nearby field and she knew our family for which he spent some time in a mental hospital My mother told me he was observed to have had antisocial personality disorder but Im not sure how she would know that because he would never tell her something like that This is a man that says shit like Ive never been depressed in my life I dont even know what that is Anyway we moved somewhere so he couldnt find us Problem there is Grandpa had a stalking habit so he found us after few months You have to understand my brother and I were in no position to understand what happened or at least that is reasonable enough of an assumption that mom didnt tell us what happened All I knew was Grandpa wasnt around anymore and that I missed him despite abuse of my brother and I up to this point which I will get to Once he found us he would spoil my brother and I to gain favor and make it harder for my mom to keep him out of our lives a pattern that would persist indefinitely My mom saved up money during Move1 and we relocated to an aunts house She was a close friend of my mothers that was stalked by my grandfather prior to all of this The aunt was also a pedophile I was too young to understand that the teenagers she was messing around with were not adults My mom was too traumatized to worry about anything other than feeding us loving us and killing the pain on her downtime with pills and partying She balanced it well and her recreational activities never interfered with us beyond waking us up in the middle of the night for a taco bell run so we wouldnt be left alone in the house Somewhere in there he found us again because of the stalking bit During this time he sank his claws deeper into my big brother and I Christmases and birthdays were always huge to us both because even though we were poor we were spoiled senseless by grandpa AND by my mothers dogged determination to outshine his efforts She had to spend every one of those Christmases and birthdays watching us thank and hug him in front of her telling him we loved him After a few years of living in that creepy shithole my mom made enough to move again She even wrangled us a stepdad for security SPOILER he loved crack and bullying us However he was young 27 and deeply troubled himself He actually kind of kept grandpa at bay for a minute but we still LOVED grandpa so much Our fathers never met us between my brother and I so there was a sort of role that needed fulfilling which was another reason she was scared to tell us what happened During this time my grandfather was abusing me by interrogating me about whether or not I was gay and forcing me in front of the mirror to pop my acne until I bled and the acne became infected My pockmarks are much worse than they need to be and he reinforced a lifelong belief in my hideousness and I was made to go to therapy at the age of 10 to address my latent homosexual tendencies What prompted his obsession I do not know I think he was scarred from when I wanted to be a girl for Halloween 3 years in a row from ages 3 to 6 A few years after Move3 came Move4 but it at this point my mom considered losing contact with him to be futile She would move further and further each time and he would constantly show up unannounced At this point Im in middle school brother in high school During this time my 15 year old brother kicked my stepfather out so my grandfather was around much more often so he could pressure me intensely to be confirmed Catholic our family is heavily Irish Catholic This would eventually cause me to have a psychotic break later at 15 where I had religious delusions for a whole year Around the time I finished high school my mom met my now stepmother and we moved 100 miles away Which was perfect considering grandpa would have an accident that made it harder for him to want to drive on the highway ever again The last time he saw my mothers face was at her wedding 15 years ago I would say his presence tarnished it but it was full of drag queens and LGBTQ folks so I like to think it was a difficult day for him the man is a vicious bigot This is around when mom tells me about how he raped her when she was 26 Im 19 at this point and I have been conditioned to worship my grandfather He was my father for all intents and purposes more than any other man in my life I was resistant and resentful I was stupid I buried what my mother told me and it created a rift between us that is since mended but it is one of my deepest regrets My absolute deepest regret is moving in with him Move5 left me in a rural town with only a grocery store to work down the street and I had no car or license TIP FOR YOUR KIDS Do not let them get away with thinking they are better than working their way out of a situation or that they wont be grateful to themselves for it Anyway I wanted to go to college and grandpa lived in Baltimore He offered to let me stay and I told my mother I loved her but I couldnt get stuck in that town I wasnt stuck I was undisciplined and ignorant I will never forget my mothers crying face as I left in his car So I guess that is the last time he saw her From 2012 onward I was living in Baltimore going to school working partying and going on trips with friends I was having a merry fucking time and rent free to boot undisciplined Somewhere in the first 2 years I did mushrooms and I gained a bonedeep certainty of how awfully I had betrayed my mother I called her and apologized for everything begged for her forgiveness I didnt have to because she understood Then she told me EVERYTHING EVERYTHING Not just about her rape but the vicious abuse of her 6 other siblings the rape and physical assault of my grandmother and the manslaughter Out of her 7 siblings 2 brothers defended her after the rape initially One said that grandpa was dead to him but reconnected only 3 years later The other just plain acted like it didnt happen even though he was the one keeping grandpa at bay while we left the house When my mom told her sisters 2 were silent one acknowledged that my mother was traumatized and the one I hate the most said He must have been so lonely The remaining 2 brothers kissed his feet like they always have without skipping a beat They still do My grandfather viciously beat every single one of his children He beat and raped my grandmother and put a gun to her head with his foot on her neck An uncle tried to defend my grandmother with a bat grandpa caught it midswing and completely blackened my uncles torso He coerced a neighbors wife to crawl across the floor to him to ask for a kiss in front of the neighborhood and his own wife and children at a party He hit me and my brother for as long as he and I were too young to defend ourselves at least until we acted like he wanted He beat me for bleeding on the floor when I cut myself by mistake at age 3 I was hit and screamed at if I cried At age 5 I watched him choke my then 8 brother like it was Bart and Homer for correcting his math He stalked my mothers friends and called them in the middle of the night to say disgusting shit He then raped my mother for god knows fucking what when I was 5 I have no idea what else hes done to my aunts and uncles Im suspicious that he did something to me too because I was absurdly sexually obsessive when I was 4 and 5 By obsessive I mean I cornered a girl when I was in kindergarten and tried to rip off her clothes while screaming Youre mine Where did those instincts come from How often do 5 year olds do that So I was drinking pretty heavily after what my mom told me enough to keep me from being able to move out from my moms rapists house and then I met my current partner in 2018 Like everyone I was with up til that point I begged her not to be friendly with him and I told her why She has some sort of hyperaltruistic reflex plus her grandfather treats her like shit so she just made my grandpa her grandpa After I begged her not to get close to him He then exposed himself to her multiple times and whispered something disgusting into her ear that to this day she will not repeat I know it wasnt age because when I confronted him on this he never did it again Between 2018 and 2023 I was basically killing myself with booze about this and a lot of things 5 hospitalizations in 2023 My mom confronted the one that said he must be so lonely and she said none of those things happened My grandmother can corroborate however and has Im posting this one because apart from my partner I have no one to talk to about it Im not looking for moral validation I know how badly I hurt my mother and what it says about me Grandpa is 91 now and I think its fair to say most of who he was is gone I dont forgive I see it as irrelevant to who is now Hes a scared husk thats been glued to a chair since 2008 I tried so hard to be a changed person in sobriety got into the habit of hugging him and telling him I love him but by the time I realized it makes me feel slimy I couldnt afford to stop My mom knows this and she is according to her at greater peace with everything than me My present disquiet comes from the constant thoughts like WHAT KIND OF BROTHERS AND SISTERS DONT DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO PROTECT THEIR SISTER There were 7 of them and they left us for the wolf There were 7 of them that never EVER let grandpop babysit their kids WHY HUH WHY CAN HE COME AROUND US AND NOT YOURS Why are we the black sheep Why did no one believe my mother after what theyve been through I have an uncle that still tells me he has always loved me hes my godfather and the sensible one and he has the fucking BALLS to ask me why mom doesnt talk to him anymore Last year every single one of my mothers siblings gathered to celebrate his 90th birthday Two of my mothers sisters are sitting on his lap in a photo they took together The one that said he must have been so lonely is so pleased with herself in the photo Recently she told me I was the favorite grandchild of his 9000 grandchildren and she looked like shes hated me for it for a while I wasnt the favorite I was a pressure point for a predator to make sure my mother could never get away None of these people have any idea that I know Neither does grandpa Neither do their children They just think Im a lazy alcoholic part true Been thinking about writing a book But also I just needed this If anyone can relate or just have some insight as to how in the fuck 7 siblings side with the incestuous predator and abuser Whats worse is how Ive found this to be far less unique than I thought I know more people than I would like that have relevant experience with men growing families as punching bags and sex objects Every kid I see makes me worry for them and I have a hard time seeing a father with their children and not have an immediate fear for the kids TLDR Seriously Just kidding Grandpa raped my mom and stalked her my brother and I through life and I eventually ended up marooning myself in the same basement where he did all of the worst things you can do to a person while his children treat my mom with denial and even resentment PS My mother is the strongest and happiest shes ever been and I love her and my stepmother so much She has chronic illness and PTSD but she is creating all the time and excelling at her work Ive never been more proud of her My brother is the same as hes always been stoic and quiet about all of it in a way that scares me PPS My aunts and uncles have been snooping while Im at work and leaving obvious signs they were in my fucking bedroom Where I fucking sleep If you are reading this good You should be fucking ashamed of yourself You were all in your fucking thirties and were successful when you shielded her attacker You had the resources to help your sister and put the man away You chose her rapist over her Youre not the Christians you say you are youre not good people youre psychotic lowlifes whose kids dont really know them some of them know just not exactly how spineless and mindless yet No wonder your daughter calls you by your first name like that To the other no wonder your daughter doesnt call you at all For all of you it is not close enough to karma that you have to literally wipe that mans ass now You seemed like you wouldve jumped at the opportunity to swallow his shit at the rate you guys sided with him Still thinking about that book EDIT For various grammaticalspelling errors and weird slashes I

1j6w2w8,Ive formed a little bond with an elderly homeless man who frequents my favorite cafe,He doesnt speak English very well so communicating with him is a little challenging but hes very sweet For example before we even started really interacting he brought me napkins when I spilled something Since then we always say hello how are you etc But Ive always gotten the impression that hes selfconscious about a lot of things His scent is not ideal and as I mentioned above his English isnt great and not everybody in the world is understanding about those things Today he seemed to feel more comfortable with me than ever before He came over said hello and sat down near me for the first time I tried to use Google Translate to communicate but he needs glasses and couldnt read the text so we just tried our best It was the most complex discussion weve had so far We discussed politics This is what he has to say on the current situation Im trying my best to remember precisely what he said Politics bad bad things Politics hurt people Mexicans woman good people Social Security Medicaid I assume he was expressing worry about the continued existence of both programs I just wish I could speak Persian so we could understand each other better Its clear that his life in America hasnt gone the way he must have hoped it would when he came here and Im extra worried about him now Anyway when he needed to leave I gave him a big hug I hope our interactions make him happy,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 01:10:16 UTC,155,20,0.98,,,0,0

1j6vvos,I hate Childrens Sevices,I have to get something off my chest its been bothering me for a while Department of Childrens Services Australia are the most incompetent useless stupid government agency Ive ever had the displeasure of working with whom Im sure hire only the worst and dimmest of candidates and have fostered a culture of ineptitude and apathy throughout the system I have nothing but complete and utter contempt for the department and their so called social workers as I can say truthfully and without hyperbole or exaggeration that I have not seen them make a good call on a child or family situation in the 30 years Ive been cursed with their association I am a psych and behavioural analyst and run a disability and aged care support company in remote Queensland I am involved with the department because I provide therapeutic placement for children with disabilities My company as best as I can tell is one of the very few with capacity for kids with serious behaviours of concern certainly the only one that I am aware of in my or any surrounding regions judging by how far some kids come to be placed with us The ignorance on display from DoCs staff is breathtaking They dont listen They dont understand disability which to be fair I dont really expect them to not really but they just are not willing to learn Somehow the decisions they make seem tailored to be cruel and hurtful to parents for no good reason and they are openly hostile and dismissive to families they have independently decided they dont like Vague examples for privacy Single mother with 5 month old baby Has 2 other children in placement Meetings for one occur in Town A Meetings for the other occur in Town B She lives in City C The meetings are set for 8am for one and 9am for the other Town A is 90km 56mi from City C and Town B is 107km 66mi from City C Town B is 193km 119mi from Town A She has no car and relies entirely on public transport to get around This is utterly impossible There is a department office 7 minutes from her house by bus They flat put refused to entertain the idea of having meetings at that office or even just Zoom meetings She had to attend in person Every failure was used as evidence of inability to manage her time and proof she shouldnt have her children Child with serious behaviours of concern violence property destruction suicide ideation who was surrendered by family was placed with us on short notice because previous two placements claimed no capacity Probably because of the damages combined between the two of them No behavioural plan was supplied despite them having one and being requested for 7 weeks in the end I had to go behind their backs and track down the practitioner that wrote it myself DoCs severely downplayed the behaviours upon placement and frankly if we werent so good at our jobs and able to adjust so fast serious harm absolutely could have happened due to the lack of accurate information provided We got lucky those first few weeks Their sole focus is on reunification with the family Their solution was to force them together every weekend No support no plan just shove a violent individual in a house with a shellshocked family for 2 and a half days the siblings of which actively and with good reason do not want them there for a couple of days and hope for the best When sexual assault claims were made by a sibling DoCs ignored it and tried to push for the next weekend anyway It took a call to Childrens Safety who in turn made a stern call to DoCs for them to decide against that decision for a weekend I sat with the case workers and supervisors and went through the complex disabilities and mental health issue for this individual and explained what realistically needed to happen for reunification What to expect A recommendation for steps to take moving forward I thought it went well A follow up meeting with the school a mere 2 hours later and the case worker said that a fidget spinner should keep them occupied for 4 hours and thus solve the school attendance issues Moronic No attention paid whatsoever They openly blame the parents their lack of parenting for the issues Stay at home dad mum has a pretty unusual job that has her travel often but pays very well They mock her in meetings talking about how shes living her best life on holidays when shes away for a week working I am so frustrated They are now looking at foster care options Removal from a therapeutic placement where they have made real progress for example nearly 100k in damages zero school attendance between 2 placement over 3 months compared to us where we have had maybe 500 in damages and school attendance every day at first with support and now independently between an hour and 4 hours and we have had them for 6 months to be put with some unsuspecting and unqualified family for 700 a week Absolute madness I just want to scream into the void The family is actively working with us the school is actively working with us but DoCs DoCs dont give a shit And they hold the cards They claim they care but when it comes to complex disability they actively ignore vital information and forge ahead like it was a typical kid damn everyone else Sorry I got a bit ranty They just piss me off so much,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 01:00:02 UTC,2,0,0.76,,,0,0
1j6vs1y,I 26f cant feel sexual pleasure anymore and its killing my relationship,basically what the title says Ive slowly lost sensitivity since we got married 4 years ago I thought at first it was due to my depression so I got therapy Then after overcoming depression I was still experiencing very lownonexistent libido no sensitivity nothing It didnt matter if I was on my antidepressants or not before during and after it was about the same I used to be able to enjoy sex and finish but now I cant even remember the last time I finished at all No Im not interested in masturbation nor has that ever done anything to me My husband has gotten mad at me over the years and accused me of being asexual or lesbian which I dont think is the case because I KNOW I am sexually attracted to men and not women and Ive experienced normal sexual response cycles many times before especially as a teen I did save myself for marriage if that makes any difference I then thought well maybe its not my depression maybe its sexual trauma from seeing and hearing my parents doing it a lot after they always told me sex was bad religious upbringing and so I went to a sex therapist and she said she couldnt help me I had another therapist after that who I really liked and helped with everything else in my life except my ability to enjoy sex have a sex repsonse cycle despite thoroughly discussing that topic and my traumatizing experiences as a child with my parents I went to my primary care doctor and he basically told me there were no meds except one that costs 1000 a dose and only has a 10 chance of working He did blood work on my hormone levels and those were all normal so basically no one can help me and it leads to dissatisfaction on both sides of this relationship and makes me so sad I feel like I should just divorce my husband so he can find a functional woman who can have and enjoy sex with him,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 00:54:53 UTC,1,7,1.0,,,0,0

1j6tw9e,i impulsively sent a personal letter to a situationshipfriend he told me i should do something with it,hello i hope im not going against any rules by posting this i intially wanted to post this to try and figure out how to turn this personal letter into an artistic creative thing that i can put out into the world but for now its just a letter that is true off my chest this is a letter i have sent a friendlover that is very important to me we have a weird secretive relationship dynamic somewhat of a situationship but much more communicative and relationshipy its weird the letter talks about it a little bit the thing is after he read it he told me that the letter was personal authentic and very beautiful that i should think about maybe doing something with it in the futurecreatively he meant we are both creative people studied creative writing together thats how we met anyways heres the letter keep in mind it is translated as it is originally in a different language Hi this letter contains things that are important to me that you know Every time I initiate a hang out with you to talk about things I end up not saying everything I want to say maybe because I forget or feel better at that moment when Im with you and dont want to create a worse mood for either you or me again dont want to be a burden so I end up not saying anything and end up regretting and getting upset when things dont work out between us So I want to take a moment here and write to you everything I can remember that I usually think and feel about us and hope that with all the recoil you probably get from this letter you can also take a moment of your time and read without too much pressure of responding quickly I want to start by saying that you are a person who is very very important to me I have said it many times and I have no problem saying it again simply because it is true you are the first person that I have ever felt true pure love a feeling that I thought people invent in movies that made me think it was not something that was even possible to feel You made me feel it It is real You know how sentimental and emotional I am it is very easy for me to look at a picture of us from a month ago and feel nostalgic because I miss a specific day that I had a really nice time with you Like for example on your birthday when you invited me to sleep over at your place and told me that I was really cute and that you wanted to kiss me in front of everyone These are things that are hard for me to forget and I hope I never forget because it makes my heart feel good Sometimes I am completely reluctant to mention things like this or talk about it at all because the fact that I talk about it means that in moments like these have a lot of weight It makes me very vulnerable and its scary I prefer not to mention any good moment we had not to say I love you not to say I miss something that happened two days ago and that way if you dont say something nice back I wont be offended by it I wont think its not mutual I wont think Im taking everything too personally and that for you Im just another person to have fun with every now and then even though i know if it was just fun it would have ended a long time ago for you But I choose to say it anyway because I want you to at least know how much good you can do even if you dont mean to I choose to get hurt a little every now and then I think you are very talented You write in a way that is very impulsive for better or worse In the pieces you wrote it is very clear that what you write comes from that moment deep inside and it is not calculated it is simply what is happening in your heart at that second and you bring it out Another talent you have is the way you get to know people Something that I am very jealous of but I feel I am lucky to experience it as a friend and even learn from you You ask bizarre questions that no one thinks to ask go into strange depths and we would sometimes laugh at you at that moment in class because it is really very funny that you ask things that no one thinks are interesting enough but it is a trait that I appreciate very much I think that I will move here in this letter between things that you might be flattered by and things that you have a chance of being offended by It is important for me to point out that it is okay to be offended just as it is okay to be flattered by everything I write but you should know that everything I write is things that I think and feel There are no facts here And there is not even a single intention to hurt If I could I would write this in a letter and bring it to you physically but right now we are after a not very pleasant interaction that was on through messages as there is every now and then between us And right now I am not in the mood to see you because I feel like I will cry and I will not be able to say anything coherent Maybe I am too sensitive and take everything too hard Maybe you love me but dont like me very much and sometimes try to hurt me It could be both Sometimes I feel like you really want to hurt me That you know exactly what combination of words will hurt me the most and you choose them specifically I dont think its bad intentions I think its more of you trying to defend yourself Maybe I say things that I think come out well but they hurt you and then you who feel attacked try to attack back because that way youll have the power and you can hurt and leave Sometimes we encounter a situation of unpleasant messages and at the peak youll say something like youre gonna stop answering me or something more cynicalpassive aggressive to imply to me that youre not going to answer anymore no matter what I say Sometimes Im in a good mood and after a conversation like that with you i get very sad in a restless way like i have to talk it out And when you cut off at the peak of this conversation I have no way to explain anymore no way to resolve no way to do anything All thats left for me is to sit with myself with the feelings I have about myself about how much I may have hurt you with the words I used incorrectly about how much I want you to understand that I dont think such bad things about you And to sit with myself with the feelings I have for you that with how much I love you you are the person who most manages to hurt my most sensitive points Once in a conversation of this style you managed to throw into the air that it would be better if we ended the relationship After that when we met and I mentioned it you said that you said it in the heat of the moment and that you didnt really mean it I think you did mean it just at that moment And then at some point when we managed to talk and get along again you regretted meaning it I think that both of these situations are correct and that they dont necessarily contradict each other Sometimes I really have thoughts like Wow maybe I should really end this relationship Sometimes I feel like the relationship with you is doing me a lot more harm than good Sometimes I feel like you hate me Detest me And maybe you stay in touch with me because its easier than breaking up And maybe thats true sometimes I dont know But I also dont think it necessarily contradicts other good feelings you might have for me sometimes In any case I can understand Theres not a single person in the world that I can say 100 that will never get on my nerves accidentally hurt me get tired of them and I also told you I think that if I spend enough time with anyone at some point Ill want to not be around them On the other hand youre one of the only people I prioritize spending time with And the only person I want to be around even if Im very hurt and were not at our best terms I think something happened the day we started hooking up for the first time That day I went out with you and a friend for a walk in the city we went into your old school the friend stayed outsid we were left with just you with the stories and experiences you had there with all the nostalgia from there and I was there and listened to you and I really enjoyed experiencing something sentimental with you A big part of your life you spent there and then I was there with you and somehow managed to be a small part of all of it of you Later that day after we hooked up when you walked me to the train and we were both very nervous because we had arranged to meet the next day but we were both afraid that suddenly we wouldnt want to meet again when the time came Because we both had that similar problem that weird avoidant way of dealing with life And then the next day came we still wanted to and it happened and it didnt exactly stop for a very long time Usually when I want someone as soon as they show interest in me back I stop wanting them It didnt happen with you You shared your flaws with me and not only did I identify with a lot of them but it only drew me in more I really fell in love with a person and not just an idea I think thats why its so easy for me to get hurt by you I love you very much The whole person that you are Im very attracted to you Physically emotionally mentally In just about every way What you think of me how you think of me is very important to me I really care about you and your opinions Sometimes you say things about me that you think Im not intelligent or things like that I say very directly that these are things that hurt me Insult me You take it more lightly and with a laugh and with a certain detachment towards me and how I feel I think you might have the feeling that youre above me in all sorts of ways That you have more power over certain things That your opinions are more important or true than mine And that facts are perhaps more important or true than my feelings Sometimes you are the most sensitive person in the world looking for a hug love intimacy making me laugh when Im not feeling well And sometimes you treat me as if you are a person who doesnt know how to be a friend That you have no ability to understand or contain my difficulty my feelings I think a lot of it is also my fault Every time I told you that you were crossing a certain line thats all it was I tell you that youre crossing a line And thats it there were no consequences beyond that I say my piece carry on as usual as always and then it repeats itself Again things are said again Im offended again I dont want to talk to you again in my life and then I come back to you the second theres a chance because I want you in my life Its like Im giving up a lot of myself so that I can feel good sometimes with you Ill say something now that if it wasnt clear before it can be very recoiling and disgusting to hear at least for me My relationship with you and you in general is very addictive to me Im addicted to you You feel like a drug to me and I cant find a better or worse way to say it thats how it feels to me When Im with you and everything is good everything is the best in the world When its bad its very bad there was another time at some day I was at your place I think a few days after we agreed not to sleep together anymore of course we met and slept together because how could we not There was one moment you put your head on my chest as if I were a pillow we just sat like that in bed for an hour cuddling calm comfortable quiet pleasant Why do I get so hung up on these moments Its like if Im not bipolar enough on my own theres another layer of bipolarity in our relationship I remember especially at the beginning of this relationship when I was at your place and I felt so nice and comfortable I didnt want it to end simply because it was the peak of the day for me The moment I had to go home just being on the drive back home alone sleeping alone suddenly that was the lowest point of my life Ive slept alone my whole life Why does it feel so heavy now Its like craving you helped me survive a little longer every time And this is the most unhealthy thing Ive ever experienced and the most disgusting thing Ive ever said Its embarrassing to admit it at all especially when Im sure its not mutual For a very long time I was emotionally dependent on you like if you were in a good mood it would be great for me but if you were feeling bad and would withdraw from the world I could easily take it personally Because when Im in a bad mood I still want to be near you I still want to talk to you And its disgusting to me Why is it different only with you Why am I not interested in sleeping with anyone except you Why did I think for years that I wasnt interested in sex at all and that I could easily live without it and then after I met you I became a nymphomaniac Why can I just say bye to people and leave without a hug but with you this intimacy is so important to me I dont even have one answer really I have no idea why its like this On the one hand I think if I kept my distance from you I would get used to being without you it would have been hard at first but little by little I would stop wanting anything like this with you and then maybe I would be able to quit you On the other hand Youre funny You love Why would I keep my distance just because its a little hard sometimes Im in these dilemmas every now and then But I really dont want to lose touch with you Sometimes I think you dont see or appreciate things I do for you take me for granted Why not actually you said so yourself no matter when you text me I will answer if you need a favor i will do it if you want me to come to you and be with you there will never be a situation in life where I will say no I havent given you a single reason to make you think that Im not simply there whenever you need or want So maybe its my fault Maybe Im too accessible not enough hard to get and its too convenient its easy to take it for granted I dont know Maybe youll read all of this and think Im a psycho Tell me that you think it would be best and most worthwhile to end the relationship and Ill understand from that that you dont want anything to do with me and Ill be offended and well never talk again and all that this relationship will be is some cute memories from time to time that are accompanied by a bad taste from how it ended Maybe youll read all of this and say nothing pretend you never got it maybe youll even see that you got this letter tell yourself wow this is really long Ill get to it someday and forget about ever getting to it Maybe youll read this and tell me what you think and feel too Share your side Tell me that everything is okay its okay what I feel its okay

1j6toid,Why has ghosting become so normalized these days,I try to connect with guys and in the beginning they act interestedtexting me consistently showing enthusiasm and making me believe theres potential for something real But after a while they just stop responding leaving me with no explanation Im tired of being ignored and blaming myself for their lack of accountability If theyve lost interest why not just be upfront about it instead of leading me on and then vanishing without a word Why even start a conversation show interest and build a connection if they never intended to follow through Im exhausted from meaningless situationships and the constant cycle of ghosting Its frustrating how people would rather disappear than have an honest conversation A simple message saying Hey I dont think this is working out would take seconds yet they choose to leave me confused and questioning what I did wrong Im done wasting my energy on people who dont respect my time or feelings,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 23:11:14 UTC,3,4,1.0,,,0,0
1j6tmay,I feel guilty that I miss having cancer,So I was diagnosed with Ovarian cancer in 2009 My life was pretty boring and the recession had just happened and couldnt seem to find a good job and I still lived at home Boom I get cancer such a surreal thing to have happen to you when you are a young adult out of college trying to make your way Everyone and I mean EVERYONE came out of the woodwork giving me stuff loving on me etc and I adored staying in the hospital because I felt safe taken care of and honestly other than the psychological stuff losing all my hair once I had the first surgery I wasnt in that much pain tolerated chemo well etc I am in the middle after almost 16 years possibly facing the C word again but it isnt a for sure thing as there are other possibilities for my symptoms I have seen my mother waste away and die from it so it isnt the cancer I want it is the break from life the permission to just be without guilt time to bingewatch and get caught up on reading etc Am I a bad person I dont have Munchousens I would never do something to myself or fake an illness or even worse make someone else sick by proxy I just really need a break from life,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 23:08:21 UTC,14,3,0.95,,,0,0

1j6sqzk,Years ago I had a close call with a motorcyclist Now I cant stop worrying about it Am I overthinking,I recently remembered an event from the past and I havent been able to stop thinking about it It happened a long time ago so its possible that what I remember is not exactly what actually happened A few years ago in 2022 when I was 14 I was coming home from school with some friends when an idiot thought it would be funny to open my backpack and ring a doorbell without telling me Immediately afterward everyone started running I quickly zipped up my backpack and for some reason I dont remember I decided to cross the road to the other sidewalk instead of running forward Maybe it was because there were too many people in front of me making it difficult to run quicklyI dont know I really dont remember The thing is as soon as I stepped onto the road an older man on a motorcycle appeared right in front of me just a few meters away I moved away as fast as I could and got back onto the sidewalk where I had been before I think I remember the driver swerving a little when he got scared after seeing me though Im not entirely sure about this I didnt hear any noise that would suggest the man had fallen nor did I hear a scream of painjust a Me cago en la madre which roughly means For fs sake in Spanish which I believe means he kept driving I think The problem is that I dont know if I started running once I stepped back onto the sidewalk which could have prevented me from noticing an accident if it happened But its more likely that I stayed still after stepping away from the roadat least long enough that I would have noticed if anything had happened Im not sure what exactly happened in that moment It all happened so fast and its been a few years since then When I saw the idiot who opened my backpack again all he did was laugh I guess he saw what happened in some way and thats why he made fun of me when we met again Or maybe I told him about it and then he started laughingI dont remember I also seem to recall that I had two other friends behind me on the other side of the road and when they caught up with us they were laughing too If what I remember is correct that would mean nothing actually happened I got home feeling like an idiot but at no point did I think I might have caused an accident Ive walked through that area dozens of times since then and while I wasnt specifically looking I never noticed any signs that an accident had happened I also searched online for news from that year in my city and I didnt find anything similar to what I experienced I never heard anyone mention that day again which reinforces my belief that nothing actually happened I recently remembered this incident and I think Im becoming paranoid Im scared by the possibility that the man could have had a serious accident or that someone nearby might have been hurt since it was a very busy area at that time with lots of cars and many kids coming back from school Ive been really worried for the past few days and I honestly feel bad about it Do you think Im just being paranoid I need someone to reassure meIm a bit scared,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 22:27:28 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j6sqct,I dont think I actually want a dream job,People always say to find a job you love but honestly I think I just want a job that pays the bills and lets me enjoy my life outside of work I dont want to be obsessed with my career I dont want my identity to be tied to what I do for money I just want to work go home and not think about it Is that really so bad,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 22:26:37 UTC,14,9,0.9,,,0,0

1j6snyp,I am so close to unleashing on my elderly mother,Im a woman in my 60s who for the bulk of my adult life has been able to keep and cultivate good relationships with friends family and coworkers I have suffered off and on with depression and anxiety that I felt was bad enough to seek treatment for since my mid 40s I had no shame in admitting this as it was a difficult time for me given perimenopause a stressful job kids heading off to college etc Things really began unraveling for me about a year ago I had gained a bunch of weight felt like crap was facing some unexpected backlash from my two adult kids whom I had raised alone and were each facing their own separate personal crises simultaneously was helping my widowed aging mother navigate life alone and a second new and stronger wave of ideology was evolving I started therapy for the first time in my life and leaned heavily into journaling out my feelings as I have a love of writing and my therapist felt it would be helpful for me I dove right in to a shadow work journal with writing prompts that ask you to relate negative thoughts and feelings you are having now to your childhood in order to heal your inner child I have written at length on my memories from early childhood and nothing came forward that I hadnt pondered before so no big revelations this time except for my anger After a year of processing these events poking at my anger examining every piece of it through the lens of this tired and wounded old woman and having the entire world bursting into flames exponentially more every day I am at my breaking point In the past year I have lost my 3 friends to the above mentioned ideology then most of my family and now because I am so sad and really suffering from the effects of anger about not only the abuse and neglect I experienced in my past but the trauma of the problems my entire continent is facing Ive got my mother in my face telling me she doesnt like how it makes her feel that consequences are happening as a result of her actions Nobody is blaming her for anything merely mentioning they are losing their job Or that they are struggling mentally Or that theyre boycotting hyper consumerism Or that theyre scared Or that they feel compelled now to join this movement or become antiwhatever to make a statement and support people whove been hurt She doesnt like feeling that feeling that comes up when she has to wonder if people actually know her leanings and maybe even think her actions are causing harm to them Its her own thought process guilting her and outing her at the same time Its so hard telling this without using certain words that are crucial to the story but hopefully Ive avoided the flags that will get this story banned Now I find myself on the verge of lashing out at my 84 year old mother the next time she berates me I see it coming because I dont know if Ill be able to bite my tongue I carried for 60 years the memory of her attempted suicide in front of me as a 3 year old where just before losing consciousness instructed me how to use a telephone to call for help She doesnt think I remember I protected my mother from her own shame of her daughter carrying this secret knowledge all her life while enduring beatings from her 2nd husband repeated emotional betrayals from her being called a slut every day of my teen life I was shamed mercilessly for my own emotional problems growing up and was told Im not good enough constantly My own suicidal thoughts at 13 were claimed by her as embarrassing and would make her look bad I was never allowed to feel my anger and it caused me to make some really poor choices regarding relationships in my life Well that rage has come to life and I think if I express it the way it deserved to be expressed all along it might kill her,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 22:23:31 UTC,1,4,0.67,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0
