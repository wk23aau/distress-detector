1j3bpsl,my wife had an affair when my mum died and blames me for the relationship breakdown,hi all i 30m started posting some of these incidents in aitah but it soon became clear that in some of these cases she very clearly is tah and theres no point in even asking. so ive come here just to list all the effed up things that have happened to me in the final months of 2024. i anticipate this will be very long have fun. so for some context in late 2023 my wife and i bought a house and i was spending a lot of time for a couple of months working on the house almost every evening and weekend i could spare. during this time my wife started going out with some new friends including this guy j. randomly one evening she looks a bit funny and says to me i dont trust myself around him. i hear this my heart sinks a bit but i feel like we have a strong relationship and i tell her i trust you not to do anything stupid just be sensible about what time and how you spend time with him. she liked this and we moved on but i decided to keep an eye on the situation. she started spending more and more time with him and these new friends going out and getting drunk while i was working late on the house. it was starting to make me uncomfortable and eventually i said so. i didnt ask for anything i just expressed my feelings. she said she understood but theyre just friends and theres nothing to be worried about. they keep hanging out until one day his partner a woman married to another man.... forbade him from speaking to my wife because she was jealous. so he ghosted my wife and she got really upset. it hurt me to see how upset she was for two reasons 1. my wife is upset thats upsetting 2. shes so upset it feels weird and shes acting like a breakup she asked me to proof read a message she wanted to send and i read a bit and had to put it down i said this is a breakup message i refuse to do this she remained adamant they were just friends and nothing more. i accused her of having an emotional affair again she denied it and was adamant they were just friends and that i need to get over this. some weeks later j comes back on the scene having broken up with his previous gf. my wife says shes going to talk to him but be very boundaried. i tell her that im uncomfortable with all of this if shes going to see him she should be careful. a week or two later she comes stumbling in at 5am i ask where shes been and she explains that she has been out with j went back to his place at around 2am and they played guitar. i was hurt and upset this was the antithesis of everything we discussed. i said you cant do that to which my wife took great offense accusing me of controlling her and being misogynistic. to be clear i never forbade her from seeing him i never tried to tell her what to do beyond please be careful and dont do anything silly and please respect me. that time i said you cant do that was the first and only time i specifically said what she could and couldnt do. and to me its obvious i wasnt controlling her i was just not saying the quiet part out loud which is you cant do that unless you want to ruin our relationship she is adamant nothing happened and weirdly i believe her. the issue for me is that she did the opposite of what we both agreed she disrespected me and my feelings and she is putting our relationship in jeopardy. to her the issue is that i tried to control her by being upset and that im putting restrictions on her. she pointed out shes a grown ass woman and she can spend time with her friends if she wants to. my being upset about it is a mode of control and i need to stop. in principle i have no problem with her seeing her friends but this guy makes me uncomfortable. so that all happened we were on the rocks she is clearly having an emotional affair at the very least but adamantly refuses to acknowledge it. im trying desperately to find a way to move forward and recover our relationship if we can. then october 2024. my mum died suddenly. i wont go too much into it but it happened very sudden shocking it sucks. my dad died when i was young so a lonely time as well. this is where my wifes behaviour started to seriously turn im going to list the major events as i remember them in the order they happened. i will also try to list areas where i was less than perfect but to be perfectly honest i dont think there are many. like really i have to keep checking myself surely it wasnt all so one sided surely i contributed meaningfully to this. just doesnt seem to be the case. anyway here goes. the day after my mum died we are at the pub with a friend we are talking about it all. my friend asks my wife how shes doing and she says im worried everyone is going to forget that my mum died for context her mum passed away 34 years ago from a long contracted period of illness. it spanned over covid and lock down. i lived in their house with them over all of lockdown and helped look after her mum watching her die and taking care of her for over a year. my wife had been dealing with this tragic and difficult loss for some time so i had some sympathy to her reaction. but bottom line its a shitty thing to say to your partner who lost their mum one day ago that youre concerned youre not going to get as much attention any more. that my loss will overshadow hers. it speaks volumes and sets up what is to come. a day later she says shes going to go and see this j guy i mentioned above. the one im really uncomfortable with. i made it very clear that i am uncomfortable with this and now is not the time to be testing me like this. i know hes just your friend and theres nothing actually happening im an idiot but this does upset me and i dont need to deal with this right now. id appreciate it if she didnt go. she said she understood but not to worry this is the last time shes going to see him really. their relationship has petered out more or less so it will just be the occasional coffee which is all shes going for. oh and they had plans to go see a jazz band in a few weeks time but shell cancel that on account of the funeral. shes barely going to see him so dont worry. i said it was fine. i saw it as if shes being truthful then i can accept the cost of one more uncomfortable period if the payoff is they really do just leave each other alone for a while. she went and came back a couple hours later no big deal. so the following week we had a spa trip booked i bought it for her for christmas. we decided to still go in spite of everything because why not. i need it. it was great. had a lovely time reconnected i was able to relax and destress a bit. but on the last day were in a hot tub together sharing a cocktail and shes on her phone. shes messaging j and arranging to meet the next day. i took offense and said i thought you werent seeing eachother any more? its just to study im falling behind on my thesis. so the next day she gets up early and leaves we agree shell be back at lunch. im very unhappy about all of this and just basically sulk all morning. i leave my phone upstairs and try to get on with my day as best i can waiting for her to come home and talk about it. 3pm comes and goes. i take a nap. 5pm comes and goes... i check my phone a couple messages and a couple missed calls. apparently she decided to stay out for lunch and asked if it was ok. when i didnt reply she decided to stay out for dinner and drinks too. she didnt get home until after i went to bed. i spent the whole evening feeling miserable and hurt. i dont need this. she comes home and i confront her asking if she thought any of that was ok. turns out its all my fault because i didnt reply to her and my lack of immediate response was me emotionally blackmailing her to come home. it really wasnt i just didnt want to have my phone on me and was expecting her to be home at the agreed time. maybe a little silly and selfish in my part. maybe. but im grieving and shes already pushed my boundaries i needed some alone time to deal with it. i had no idea i was emotionally blackmailing her. so anyway she stays out all day with the person that makes me uncomfortable days after my mum died days after she promised she wouldnt and im the asshole for not keeping my phone on me in case she decided to change her mind. great. a week goes by and its the day before were due to leave for my home town ready for the funeral in a few days. she asks me if we can hold off going for one extra day so she can go to this jazz thing with j. i say wtf? you said that wasnt happening? thats why you saw him earlier because you werent doing this. she says she knows but she really wants to go. i confront her and say i really dont feel like im your top priority no youre not my top priority ... please elaborate well i just dont see it as a hierarchy. everyones in a circle around me and youre all equal priority. you j etc.. right but im your husband and my mum just died. does that not put me ahead of anyone else? no. looking dead in my eyes. no. fine! go to your jazz thing idgaf. she says might as well the damage is already done by me even asking right? yeah. the damage is already done. i cant believe what she said to me so cold so heartless so unempathetic so selfish. btw this woman is a qualified therapist.. let that sink in. hope you dont get her as your therapist good lord. so she fucks off the next day and i delay my departure for her social plans. i contemplated going down without her but the ensuing drama and questions from family would not be worth it. it was my mums funeral after all not my marriages. the funeral goes fine the week is fine. she doesnt say or do anything shitty. i focus on the funeral and family and everything and mostly not think about the fireball train wreck that is now my marriage. on the drive home my wife decides to tell me that she thinks her ex boyfriend from school days is the one that got away. im dumbfounded because 1. what a thing to fucking say as i drive us home from burying my mother 2. its just patently untrue. so completely ludicrous that im not even bothered by the notion that she might be serious. it is at this point that it dawns on me that she may be hurting me on purpose. the next day we are having coffee and she says to me i never wanted this house i never wanted this dog and i dont want kids. lets be clear i did not push her to get the house or the dog. if anything she pushed for both of them but it was pretty mutual. she is now tearing up the entire foundation of our marriage. she is lighting fire to the entire future plans we had. the house and dog that i poured my heart and soul into for her for us. she never wanted apparently. just brutal. savage. she acted shocked when i started crying i didnt expect it to upset you this much incredible. the next day i go to my friends place and just cry on her for hours. i am in a complete state. its all too much overwhelming awful and just confusing. why is she being so mean? i wondered if she hated me then i thought.. maybe shes trying to get me to break up with her. shes clearly having an affair of some variety. my mum just died. maybe she just doesnt want to be the person to break up with their partner when their mum died. especially a partner who cared for her dying mother. and especially because she was having an affair. shed be seen as such an asshole so rather than just admitting everything and being an asshole she decided to torture me until i pulled the plug myself. not her fault then is it? anyway that thought occurred to me. but im in no state to decide the fate of my marriage. im grieving im distraught im reeling from the various harrowing incidents listed above. barely enough time to process one before another comes along. it may seem obvious to you and me now but at the time i just couldnt see clearly what was happening or exactly why. my friend gave me some advice that i didnt need to decide anything right now that settled me. took some pressure off at around this point my perception of time gets a bit funny. mixture of grief and brain fuckery. so now im pissed at her i dont trust her. i feel badly hurt. she says shes going out with j again. i say i dont care. resigned to this shitty behaviour unable to reason with her unable to discuss it unable to make the call and leave. she comes back at 4 in the morning high af they had taken mdma together. the oxytocin drug. under the influence of this drug he confessed his feelings for her. she was totally shocked by this and said it was all a little uncomfortable. ok i said. whatever. the next day were driving somewhere and i really cant remember what she said but it just set me off. i think it was something along the lines of i dont know why youre so upset with me? i was furious i was worn down i was mistreated. for the first time i raised my voice. i was shouting at her. listing all of these shitty instances that were cutting me up whilst i grieved. i raised my hand clenched my fist and brought it down on the steering wheel in anger. it made a dull bang noise. this was the start of a new narrative from my wife. the scary aggressive husband narrative. the perfect excuse in her eyes to leave me without raising questions about her betrayal and complete lack of empathy. youre scary she said. i was cowering in the passenger seat she said. youre just like my aggressive father she said. i tried defending myself but please remember i was in a complete mess mentally and emotionally. i started to believe her. maybe i did lose control maybe i am one of those guys. maybe i threatened her. i thought that yes it was an outburst but no it wasnt threatening. im not a big scary person. im just a human being that has been deeply hurt and wounded when theyre at their most vulnerable. but maybe thats not a good enough excuse. maybe i crossed a line. she sowed the seeds of doubt in my vulnerable mind. i started doubting my memory of events did i black out for a moment and do something really scary? she told me that i was potentially abusive. to be clear shes not accusing me of being abusive shes accusing me of maybe becoming abusive in the future. and she cant take that risk. im not safe to have children with you know the children she said she didnt want before i ever shouted. i believed her. what a monster i was. how could i be so terrible i never thought i was like this. no wonder she was having an affair for the last several weeks. i shouted at her and hit my hand on the steering wheel in frustration. she lent into it but not too far. she was manipulating me telling me its ok. you just need to go to therapy and sort yourself out. as long as im going along with her narrative shes all ok my side. if i ever doubt her im terrible and hurtful and potentially abusive. she decided it was time to end things she had the get out of jail free card she wanted. she didnt leave me for another man and emotionally abused me when my mum died she saved herself from an potentially abusive relationship. my greatest crime was hitting a steering wheel. one of the last things she said to me. she spoke with a friend of hers who had broken up with her partner of 8 years had two wild years and then they got back together for several years. i asked what she meant by wild years just connecting with lots of people. so she turns to me and says i think were a lot like them you know? i wanted to say i bet she didnt abuse her partner. i bet she didnt hurt him when his mum died. i bet she didnt manipulate him into believing he was abusive. and the sheer audacity of sitting there and looking to me to approve of her fucking a bunch of people for two years before i take her back. i said nothing she nudged me. desperate for me to implicitly condone her actions and behaviours by giving even the slightest inkling that i might take her back when shes done fucking around. i turned away and left. i was done. not two days after our official break up she declared herself in a relationship with j. but to her family she accused me of being aggressive and scary and forcing her to leave. she denies having had an affair pretending that her and j are not an item. she goes to my friends and asks them to meet her new partner j. again implicitly asking them to condone her actions by meeting this j guy. my friends all refuse and begin to cut contact with her. theyve seen what shes done. they knew what she was doing to me before i did. they wont tolerate her bs. i love my friends. my wifes sister knows everything she heard it all from my wifes point of view and still she took my side. then she heard what i had to say.. boy was she pissed. she told her whole family the truth my wife tried to convince them that her sister was a liar. that she didnt understand. shes pregnant btw. my wife just tried to turn her family against her pregnant younger sister. in her attempts to not be seen as a terrible heartless b that would abandon her husband when he needed her most she turned herself into an even worse monster. an abuser according to some. a liar a manipulated a nasty piece of work. sometimes you meet your destiny on the path to avoid it. im 2 months free. i dont want to let another human being close to me like that again but maybe that will change with time. my therapist and my wifes sister whos also a qualified therapist both said that she has been emotionally abusive to me. coercive controlling behaviour. i dont know about that but i know ive been treated unfairly. thanks for reading this far i hope it was entertaining. x,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 14:15:25 UTC,466,128,0.97,,,0,0
1j3bnhi,realised my family dont respect me now im heartbroken and dont know what to do.,hello reddit long time reader but finally posting for the first time so please be kind also this is on mobile so im sorry if my grammar and format arent very good. trigger warning as this might be a hard read for some and contains talk of abuse. my 29 life story isnt a happy one lots of loss abuse and loneliness. abit of background im the middle of 3 kids an older sister and a younger brother were all close in age and didnt get along at all as kids but did become closer as we got older or so i thought. my dad died when i was young and this had a massive negative impact on my family but especially my mum who became a partially functional alcoholic with lots of mental health issues which she has never gone to or considered therapy for. she also has dated alot of abusive and weird partners over the years so i grew up in a violent and toxic environment she has not had a successful long term relationship since my dads death. i am autistic and have afew mental health problems myself but i have been in and out of therapy for a long time and have done alot of work to try to better myself and work on my flaws. i have chronic illnesses and chronic pain from degenerative issues which make day to day living hard i dont want to sound all woe is me but unfortunately this is just me being honest about whats happened and still happening to me. i absolutely love animals i have grown up around all sort of animalspets and honestly i love them more than people they love unconditionally and my soul pet was there throughout all ive suffered in life always there to love and comfort me in my time of need ive never felt more loved in my life than the love i felt from them and ill always cherish my 10 years with them. they unfortunately passed away 2 years ago and i still struggle with the loss today. ive lost a fair few animals over the years and grief is nothing new to me but its never any less painful each time. i was bullied relentlessly through out my educational years and even in the workplace im abit different and maybe a lil weird but i will never understand why ive been bullied the way i have i always try to be kind and caring to people and will always have someones back but sadly its never reciprocated and i have faced my bullies alone. all this and i still strive to be a good and kind person as for me kindness is my default and i never want to or intend to hurt anyone. thanks to all the bullying i have alot of selfesteem and self worth issues that i deal with but will always try and make others feel good about themselves. ive suffered through multiple physically and emotionally abusive relationships in my life im not perfect but have never treated any of my partners the way i have been treated. ive been put down called names financially abused hit and raped by past partners and was sexually assaulted by a family friend ive never received any justice for whats happened to me and sadly theyve all gotten away with it. my mum has been abusive to me and my sister growing up shes the typical toxic narcissistic gaslighting and body shaming mother who hates all but one of her kids my eds started primarily thanks to her and her fatphobia which has inflicted lasting damage on me and my siblings. shes hit me verbally abused me and been physically violent to me from ages 8 upwards she never acknowledges her actions and has literally never said sorry or apologized to me ever. its almost like she is physically incapable of saying sorry to me specifically. shes thrown me out the house multiple times and gaslights herself into saying that i moved out which just isnt true the last straw was throwing me out with nowhere to go and i had to figure out everything on my own ive lived independently ever since and even when ive been homeless theres no way id ever put myself through living with her ever again. i am queer and trans she has not shown any respect for my identity or just me as a person. ive been out as trans for 4 years and it was pretty obvious in my teen years that i was not comfortable with my assigned birth gender. shes not homophobic but is not supportive of trans identities at all and has been very open about her lack of respect for it which has been devastating to my identity and my mental health ive done so much to help her and financially support her over the years and thanks to therapy ive realized how bad it is and have cut her out my life for good. my sister has 2 kids i absolutely adore them and would do anything for them their dad has been in and out of their lives so i have helped alot with raising them and i love them like theyre my own. i do not want children myself i thought i did growing up but as ive gotten older ive realised that i would not be a good parent and would not want to bring children into the world with a parent thats messed up no child deserves that. i moved away from my home town about 4 years ago to get away from the small town racism and homophobia it was not possible for me to be who i am in that place and have been happier where i live now. unfortunately this has had a negative impact on my relationship with my siblings they make minimal to 0 effort to see me and its always me travelling to them and considering im disabled and they arent seems abit unfair to me. i am very different from them and have different beliefs than them too this has put a strain on our relationships our political beliefs are not the same and sadly theyre quite closed minded and disrespectful towards foreign womens and transqueer rights. they say the apple doesnt fall far from the tree but i fell and rolled off a cliff away from them and their beliefs. so now im faced with a dilemma back away and barely or never see my sisters kids again allowing them to be raised in this environment or sit and allow my family to continue to disrespect me my identity and my beliefs. its heartbreaking cus i have just 1 friend who understands loves and respects me i have no one else and spending most of my life being and feeling alone is taking its toll. i try so hard to make friends and find partners but i always end up alone. feeling alienated from my family is awful as family means so much to me but i clearly dont matter to them in the same way. sorry this was long but i just needed to scream something into the internet void about how i feel as i cant talk to my family about things as it just causes arguments. thank you for reading,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 14:12:26

1j3b7oq,i 35f think i have to distance myself from my best friend and im heartbroken over it,this happened over the passed weekend and i feel like im digging myself out of a ditch i didnt even realize i was in. . . it started with a lunch date with my best friend just gonna use bff because i cant be 100 sure she doesnt use reddit and one of her daughters. she had promised a lunch date to me for my birthday last month but between her kids getting sick and then her and her husband getting sick we had to push the date back a while. i had no problem with that since myself and my husband have been putting out fires figuratively were governmentfederal workers at work with all the latest shenanigans happening in the government. the lunch date started out great getting hugs from them her daughter saying that she misses myself and my husband their kids call us aunt and uncle and catching up with how their household is doing. just before this lunch date my bff asked me to talk to her second oldest about possibly getting a job at where i work as he had a phone interview and was super nervous about what to sayask. now the kid is 19 so obviously he wont start off anywhere high up and he would have to wait for a security clearance background check to go through anyways but i gave him all the information i could about the culture down in the shipyard where he would be working and what he should ask and what he should steer clear from in his answers. my bff knows i started in the shipyard as a janitor and knows that i had a great reputation around everyone i worked with so my name carries a little bit of weight as a hard worker down there. context before his interview my bff admitted to not knowing how to help her son out because she had been out of the workforce as a stay at home mom for nearly 20 years. so she didnt know how to prep him for his first formal interview. hence why she called me. but at the lunch date the first thing she says about the interview is that she was trying to answer the questions for her son because she was standing right next to him. and then made it a point to tell the interviewer that she was well informed of the interview process because she interviews people in real estate now. i was caught off guard by this sudden admission from her and just kinda stared at her knowing full well that she just speared her sons chances of getting into the company. but i didnt want to say anything negative about her or her process in front of her daughter so i bit my lip and said that hopefully hell get a call back. then we met up at their house over the weekend for drinks and a late dinner because bffs husband has been saying he wants to hang out with my husband. and it dawned on my husband and myself that no matter what we said to them they would never actually listen to us. once the kids scattered to their rooms and play areas my husband brought up the fact that hes stressed about losing his new job with the federal government because of the probationary period hes still in. hes a manager and has been working long days to overhaul his department and get them back up to code and has been getting praises from way higher up people and has been invited to dc to speak about the changes that have to occur. but from their reactions you would think he was a toddler coming up to our best friends with his latest macaroni noodle art. the two of them just gave a sympathetic grunt and bffs husband just said yeah sucks for you dude. and then proceeded to say how he was so busy with his job that he couldnt work his side gig in real estate any more on the clock. . . and the worst offender was when my husband was talking about a certain email he had to respond to that everyone in the government has been criticizing. because the individual asking for the information is not read into any of the programs and therefore cannot ask for the information that he wants to see. and all bffs husband could say was well he has a security clearance with nasa or something like that so he can ask for it. full. blown. brainwashed. we left the house after finishing up the movie we were watching and as soon as we got in the car we lost it. security clearances do not work like that need to know does not work like that and sharing sensitive information does. not. work. like. that. the scariest part for us is that bffs husband knows this because hes also federal. the passed few days this was all my husband and myself could talk about how we werent taken seriously how theyve never listened to us and how we have made excuses for them the entire time. my husband has been involved with the federal government for longer than bffs husband has been but because im the youngest of the group they think that he is too hes 45. and that above it all we were faced with the only outcome of distancing ourselves from our friends or who we thought were our friends. and what is killing me the most is that we are invested in their kids lives too. my husband has tried to help the 2 oldest to try and get them into safeish positions in the military hes a veteran and has a lot of connections but they didnt take it. i have tried to give advice to the daughters about relationships but was ridiculed by bffs husband for meddling in their lives. we have tried so hard to help but have never been heard. so when bff and her husband would vent to us about these issues we just tried to help them with we stayed silent. because they didnt want solutions from us clearly. im just so gutted that now all i can do is look back at all my interactions with her and suddenly see them for what they were. anytime i made a new dessert that her husband and kids loved she had to make it next time and tell me not to make or bring anything cuz the kids werent crazy about that dessert and probably wouldnt eat it. when she was suddenly getting botox lip injections and getting her arms and legs done after i had my own surgery to fix the muscles in my stomach she would say ill give you my botox doctor and he can add to your lips and get rid of your forehead scar. i do have a large scar on my forehead from chicken pox and poison ivy as a 7 year old but ive learned to embrace it and love it after years of bullying for it. then recently with the job interview questions for her son why is what i am and good at a threat to her? i just feel lost and sick when i think about this stuff and hate that after 5 some years of friendship myself and my husband no longer have best friends.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 13:51:31

1j3ayv7,ill have a brother at the age of 19,hello! i f19 have a weird relation with my mom. my parents got divorced when i was 4 or 5 since then ive been living with my dad. the reason for their divorce was my mom cheating even in from of me she would kiss other guys. i broke contact with my mom but reconnected with her when i was 10. she had changed i started to love her. she was my support i was neglected by my dad. after some time she started dating again. she had 2 lovers that i know about one of them being her husband now. they both were amazing people but there was something off about my mom. she would ignore me. i had a lot of mental breakdowns because of this even in front of her but she just apologized and promised she would change. i dont know why this affects me so much i think i have some bad attachment issues from my parents. this august i went in a vacation with my mom and her husband to some relatives. as we were all together they started talking about kids and her husband said something like i hope well have one in the future. the next day i asked my mom if they want a kid. she told me that he wants but she doesnt. i told her that i dont know if ill accept a brother and probably ill break contact with her if that happens because ill feel more ignored and neglected i know this is childish but i cant help. im already feeling ignored by my mom and told her thousand times that i fell this way and i would not stand being even more so the best solution i found was me getting out of her life. she told me not to worry about that that she doesnt want a child and that she also really want me in her life. fast forward to yesterday she told me that she is pregnant. i told her that im mad on her for lying to me she tried to convince me that she didnt wanted at that time but reconsidered. she tried to make me understanding but on a calm tone i reminded her what i said back then and that i would leave. she begged me not to do that but i didnt made a choice yet. what should i do? im angry im sad i dont know what to tfell. i fell really unwanted and i know that my actions are childish but i cant help. thanks for reading and sorry for my english.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 13:39:22 UTC,2,6,0.75,,,0,0

1j3arxo,i work in a massive privately owned manufacturing company.the corruption coverups and nightmare work culture they dont want you to know about,i have to be as vague as possible because if this company is identified and they figure out who i am not even kiddingi feel like theyll come looking. lol. no joke this privately owned would be fortune 500 corporate giant makes black mirror feel a little too real. some real dr. evil shark tank with piranhas type stuff lol. the company i work for is responsible for just about everything plastic. if its plastic packaging theres a good chance it passed through here. i live in a place so small its not even a townits officially considered a village. no mcdonalds barely any businesses and one massive factory that showed up about 20 years ago and just kept growing. what started as a laidback trustworthy workplace with great pay eventually expanded into multiple buildings and became the towns biggest employer. then after a major buyout billions of dollars started flowing through and everything changed. now you cant step into one of the two gas stations or small handful of stores without seeing someone wearing the company shirt they hand out. but when outside corporate interests took over they started bringing in their own people handing out management positions to friends and running the place like a private club. and once a company gets big enough in a small town theres no accountability. what used to be a solid job turned into something straight out of an hbo drama. the usual corporate nonsense got worsefudging time cards sexism favoritism and adjusting drug test results after major accidents. but it doesnt stop there. were talking covering up assaults extreme drug use highranking executives not saying how high just in case cheating and keeping mistresses in plain sight in the giant glass hr building and fullblown criminal activity. one of the companys truck drivers had a history of drinking on the job and multiple duis. one day he drank before his shift and ended up ending a motorcyclist. after what i can only assume was a ton of money changing hands it was swept under the rug. no company name in the news just one vague article about a truck driver. in a town this size that should have been the biggest headline of the year. instead? nothing. when you work here long enough you start to feel like they could make you disappear if you did something they didnt like. im not some highranking executiveim just a few steps above entrylevel still working on the factory floor. but over time ive pieced things togetherbetween constantly signing paperwork agreeing to their policies overhearing the right conversations and befriending a supervisor who introduced me to a highranking corporate employee who was a little too trusting with their secrets. i still consider these people friends but the work environment is toxic and after enough time it starts to mess with your sanity. we work 12hour shifts and if you think workplace screaming matches are rare try several a night. the corporate systems they claim improve production dont actually work which throws everything into chaos. meanwhile the building managerwhos supposed to oversee operations regularly sleeps for half the shift hides in a janitors closet and watches movies. but if we stray from their broken systems? its not pretty. you can get written up for not wearing gloves while using a tape measure and speaking up about only getting one 10minute break in a 12hour shift is a quick way to get fired no questions asked. and before you ask why dont you just leave?well the pay was really good then and its really good now and in a small town with almost no other highpaying jobs thats not an easy decision. i want to highlight two specific incidents that really set the tone for what kind of company this is. i have plenty more stories id be willing to share if anyone is interested. first not long ago an employeewho to be fair was very good at their jobhad a serious problem with anger and violent outbursts. whether there was something personal going on i dont know but theres no excuse for the level they took it to. were talking constant verbal abuse to all of his peers throwing heavy and sharp objects and even threatening to end multiple coworkerswhile openly keeping a weapon in his vehicle. the companys solution? slap a no weapons sticker on the door and call it a day. one time during a rage fit over a production issue he threw a metal holder containing a sharp industrial blade. it hit a coworkerfortunately the injury wasnt severe but it was serious enough that it should have led to real consequences. instead behind closed doors the injured employee was convinced to stay quiet promised that action would be taken. nothing happened. that same injured employee weeks later asked for a break after eight hours of nonstop hard labor and hinted that he might speak up about what had happened to him if he didnt at least get a few minutes to eat. the next day? he was fired. the guy who threw the blade? still works here no consequences. and the man who was fired? one of the hardestworking most respectable guys ive ever met. this one really gets to me. now lets talk about one of the biggest food specific product not named companies in the country. my company is pretty much the sole provider of all product for them and theres a strict rule in place a specific banned chemical cannot be used in any productionnot just in their products but in any product we run period. to keep the contract we get frequent audits. when that happens? a fullscale coverup goes into motion. that banned chemical is hidden on the highest warehouse shelves fake labels are created and paperwork mentioning it is thrown out and replaced after. employees in charge of this are explicitly told to make sure nothing with the chemicals name is left visible. if this information ever got out i can guarantee that contract would be terminated immediately. the deeper you go in corporate manufacturing the more you realizeethics are a pr stunt safety is a technicality and coverups are just business as usual. sorry for the long read but if you made it this far i seriously appreciate it. just had to get some of this off my chest.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 13:29:34 UTC,639,43,0.98,,,0,0
1j3ahkl,being a teacher makes me hate everything,im a teacherlibrarian at an elementary school in my tenth year and it has become increasingly apparent that this is not the job for me. despite not wanting to be another statistic in the world of education i need to get out before i completely lose it. reading and libraries used to be my life. i would spend countless hours reading books and browsing through the stacks in libraries. whenever i traveled my first stop was always the library. growing up no one ever doubted that id become a librarian. life took some twists and turns along the way but i finally finally made it back to the libraries i love. now i fucking hate it. along with anything else that used to give me joy in life. i used to love to go hiking shopping working out just be out and about for no reason at all but now all i do is crawl into bed and sleep until the next morning. and calling it sleep is very generous. running on about four hours of sleep has become standard and dont think that the lack of sleep contributing to my overall feelings about life has gone over my head. problem is that nightmares about going back to work wake me up and fretting over the students for several hours after makes sleep a luxury for me. im sick of spending the majority of my day managing behaviors. im sick of trying to find engaging lessons for the students to absolutely not be able to handle it. im sick of the constant noise the screaming and the violence. why is violence the first thing these kids turn to? im sick of these kids leaving the library and the books in pieces acting as though they havent had me since kindergarten and know how the library is supposed to be kept. im sick of the students acting like its their first goddamn day on earth. im sick of hearing the phrase im sorry and just watching them do it again five minutes later. i told one girl that her apology had less meaning than a pigs fart and i dont even feel bad saying that. im sick of their entitlement and how they think they deserve to take every piece of me without giving a modicum of respect in return. im sick of getting excited and emotional over a book i bought the students thinking that theyll like it just for them to roll their eyes. its like these kids have only two settings mean little bastards or asleep. i used to be a creative. i used to spend my free time drawing painting knitting and writing. boy how i loved to write! i looked at some old google docs of my stories and i miss that girl the one who could spin worlds out of nothing and create endearing and courageous characters. but that girl is dead. i couldnt write even if you pointed a gun to my head. these goddamn energy sucking vampires disguised as children left me bereft of any emotion willpower or desire to do anything. i cant even distract myself in the company of other people. the single life has plagued me for over two years and i want to get into dating but im such a miserable person that i dont think its fair to subject someone to the unpleasant experience of being in my presence. i barely want to be in my own company. the only other people i occasionally hang out with are other teachers so our primary form of entertainment is drinking and trauma dumping. i dont even like reading anymore. reading! for a librarian! i pick up a book and it reminds me of school a straight up hell and thats enough to turn me off. the thought of having to do this for another twenty years drives me to despair. can you believe i used to win teaching awards? i used to be a good teacher. i dont know where i went wrong. like the only thing that is keeping me here is my dog and shes 13 years old. but with a lot of spunk! once shes gone i wont know what to do with myself. so like i dont know what my aim is with this. the jobs here are pay a fucking joke and i already feel like a failure enough that losing my house will definitely send me over the edge. so here i am day after day spending the better part of my life with people i hate.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 13:14:19 UTC,16,16,0.91,,,0,0

1j380ag,i dont think i belong here in any capacity,i dont know how to type this. i dont know where else i could even be expressing these feelings. is this the appropriate place? i hope it is otherwise id be making a fool of myself. this might be a bit of a doom and gloom complainfest but im choosing my words wisely to keep this relatively short. if i were to go into all the nitty gritty details then itd be too long to post. i 18f attend a private college dorm. its nice. theyre single rooms with aircon and a mini fridge. some of the rooms even have bathrooms. meals and room cleaning are provided too. its nice. but its not. ive been here for nearly a month now. i wake up im here. i go to bed im here. i go to classes and come back here. i get food and come back here. i visit my mum and then come back here. and here doesnt even feel like a place where im valued where im wanted where i matter. ive been here a month. i have not made a single friend. my mum complained to the dean a bit embarrassing but at least she cares. the dean asked a group of residents to sit with me at mealtimes. nice now i wont be sitting alone. i sit with them once twice. maybe three times. they invite me to go on a shopping trip with them once. i feel like a baby. anyone here have younger siblings? its like when your mum stops you before youre about to go hangout with your friends and is like bring your younger sibling with you so they can have some fun too. im the younger sibling i guess. i felt like a lost puppy. like a little kid just tagging along because they were lonely. there was no real effort to acknowledge me apart from one guy who asked me a couple questions. there was no room for me to speak and when i did id get weird looks. there was just no place for me there. i dont blame them for that im an intruder in their group technically. so i get back to the dorm. and i go to bed and i think i know i dont fit in but thats not horrible at least ive got some people to sit with. i go to dinner the following day. i sit down with my food. that group comes in the ones who i sat with. oh nice. maybe theyll come back to sit with me. i wait. they sit down on the other side of the room. some of them glance at me while they eat. i tried not to look at them. i dont want to look too desperate. i walk back to my room. have a brief panic attack. its been a month and i am truly utterly alone.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 10:41:41 UTC,1,2,1.0,,,0,0

1j37fax,i keep remembering when i was groomed.,this happened years ago but i still remember it vividly. honestly it was one of the worst nights of my life. i was around 1314 at the time. it was mid december. a week before christmas. i met him online but i forgot how. he was 19 and average looking. he lived only a two hour walk away. i remember i waited till it was around 12 pm. he came over to pick me up and i snuck out of the house. he picked me up. it was very awkward. when we got to his place he told me to be quiet because his grandmother was there or something. honestly it was so weird. red flags all around but i was too nervous to do anything. i remember lil peep beamer boy was playing quietly in his room when it happened. it was a messy room. it had red led strips around the room. we sat on his bed and had a very awkward conversation that i dont remember. he kept scooting closer and i kept awkwardly scooting away. his bed was in the corner so soon i had no room to scoot. his phone was ringing over and over but he ignored it and let it ring. turns out it was his girlfriend but i was too scared to protest. i didnt want to sleep with him. and him having a girlfriend made me want to sleep with him even less. i did not want to be there but everything was so sketchy. i felt i had no choice but to go along with it. after all he was bigger older and stronger then me. anyways i was in the corner of his bed i was scared but i didnt show it or at least i dont think it showed. i tried not to seem scared. but i was terrified and i was sweating. he was rubbing my thighs and leaning closer and closer. i felt like i was suffocating. thing is i didnt tell him no. i just kept awkwardly trying to start a conversation. awkwardly moving his hand away. it was clear i did not want it. his hands trailed from my thighs to my.. you know. he fingered me for a while. i hated it. i wasnt even aroused. i did not want it. it was awkward as hell do. i wanted it to stop as quickly as possible so i just faked it. faked an orgasm because i was worried if i didnt hed hurt me or worse. thats when he stood up and started undoing his pants. he put a condom on ill give him that. thats when he turned off the lights and all there was was the glow of the red led lights dimmed all the way. it didnt last long. but i hated every second he was inside me and the phone was still ringing. he didnt look at me. he didnt even finish. he got frustrated and pulled out threw the condom out and walked me out of his apartment and called his girlfriend and left me outside. remember when i told you it was december? yeah. it was snowing. and no not a light dusting. it was snowing hard. my jacket and pants were still in his room. i had to walk home on my own alone in the middle of a storm in nothing but underwear and a long tshirt. no one pulled over to help. i was crying the whole way home. i was too embarrassed and ashamed to call my mother to pick me up. i remember frantically texting friends to call me. only person who was awake was someone from a group chat a friend put me in ages ago. i never talked to him personally. but he called me. tried to comfort me the whole 2 hour walk home. my feet were frost bitten and my legs were cramping and sore when i did get home. my mother was still asleep so i snuck back into my room. he stayed on the phone all night that night. became my friend. im happy he was there for me. he was a good friend. i was close with him for years. recently we drifted apart but im thankful for him being in my life even if he wasnt in my life for long. anyways i just wanted to tell someone. it has been bugging me for years. if you read it all thank you and i hope it didnt trigger anyone. i just needed to get it off my chest. and no my mother still doesnt know.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 09:59:44 UTC,4,1,0.75,,content warning sexual assault,0,0

1j36rpc,my friends surprised me when i wasnt expecting it and made me realize how lucky im to have them on my side,not an english speaker. so yesterday i texted on our group chat if someone was free to help me to take my things since im moving out of my house to transfer to a new country for my job due to a big promotion. when i texted it i for real thought that maybe a few of them would come cause i know by myself that everyone have his life his troubles so for real i wasnt expecting much of it but like always they surprised me. i didnt checked the replies until this morning cause i was busy packing stuff trying to understand what to do with the house if selling it or maybe rent it and while i was at the phone with a friend who is a real estate agent i heard the door bell ring and i thought that a few friends was there to help me but when i opened it they werent just a few but actually 10 of them were there with boxes ready to raid my house of my things.i told them for free cause i didnt had time to sell them well i got surprised and after like 3 hours my house was empty of all my things and only the fornitures remained there. during this hours we all joked laughed and they always made jokes about raiding the house of the rich asshole. i mean it was truly heartwarming seeing how much they helped me with my unwanted stuff and how they were for real there for me when i nedeed the most. after they emptied my house i proposed lunch and that i was paying for it because they helped me a lot and after a bit of hesitation they accepted it. maybe sometimes i give for granted the fact that i always have them on my side but when things like this happens i realize for real how lucky im to have them with me and how easy is for me having them. right now im home finishing to pack my last stuff and reorganizing the last things but i cant stop thinking at this morning and thanking to have them on my side. this night we have organized a night out with all of us as one of the last moments of all of us together before my travel to my new country and believe me when this things happens and i take them for granted i cant stop smiling and saying to myself that i might be overselective with my friends and the poeple i want around me but whenever i ask for help they are always there for me so my overselection have a meaning after all ahahah.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 09:09:24 UTC,19,3,0.96,,,0,0
1j362xe,feeling used the morning after,ive been going out with my boyfriend both mid 20s for about half a year now. he doesnt drink but ill be honest i like to go out and have fun from time to time. i dont drink often but sometimes when im out with friends i can get a bit carried away. i know my limits and never get blackout drunk but i certainly can get past the point of tipsy on occasion. my boyfriend often likes to come along even though he doesnt drink. when he does come along hes my dd which is very nice of him. being self aware of my flaws unfortunately doesnt make them go away. when i drink i hate to be alone. i get unbearably lonely when im left alone drunk. im a happy drunk complete life of the party until theres nobody around then suddenly it is the most soul crushing experience. usually i can just go to bed the minute i get home and sleep through the worst of it but its not always what i end up doing. when hes around and ive gotten past the point of tipsy i end up practically begging him not to drop me off at home. usually i flirt and when i do he listens. he takes me back to his house. of course we end up having sex every time. then in the morning i always wake up feeling used and bitter. i know i shouldnt. im the one who initiates after all. its not like he would ever force himself on me. but i feel like i cant say anything about it to him because im the one who starts things and i would hate for him to feel bad about the whole thing. all of my exes refused to touch me when id been drinking and they hadnt so this is entirely new territory for me. i know the real answer here is to stop going out drinking with him but we seriously always have fun when we go out. its just the after part that makes me feel bad.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 08:15:00 UTC,0,6,0.3,,,0,0
1j361gg,my older sister sexually abused me as a child and im tired of pretending it didnt happen,ive never opened up about this before to this extent. when i was 6 to 8 years old i was molested by my older sister 6 years older than me. as ive grown i think it has started to take a toll on my mental health a lot more. it weighs on me and it has affected all the relationships ive had throughout all my life. ive never had sex because i dont let anyone touch me like that. when i turned 10 i already knew i liked women and now i often wonder if i do because of what happened to me or if thats why i have problems having intimacy. i hate my body and i feel disgusting. i still see her until this day and it hurts to remember all the things she did to me and how can i still feel sorrylove not much for her. i pretend like nothing happened but remembering cuts deep into my heart. i know im a victim of child on child sa and ive gotten to an age where i cant cope with this anymore. was she abused too? why did she do that? how can i get my childhood back? these are things that have been on my mind recently. i know cocsa is complicated but still. ill feel less of a burden telling this to the world i am tired.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 08:11:49 UTC,21,26,0.83,,content warning sexual assault,0,0

1j35k1u,im trying not to hate the players or the game but just dont think ill ever be able to win my prize,just like most other humans i 29f started out wanting nothing more than to love and be loved. but now it feels like i built up too many survival instincts and defensive mechanisms that now my ability to feel and love is all out of whack basically lamenting a classic lovergirl to jaded cynic trope. and this all has been informed by plenty of varied experiences with the whole spectrum of male attention or desire from endurance runs within vanilla dating dipping my toe into the sugar bowl or sporadic sampling of the kink world it truly feels like ive seen all the good bad and the ugly. its not like i could ever be accused of being a serial dater but essentially just been burned badly enough from first boyfriends then sped ran through all sorts of situationships and entanglements without truly forming any lasting romantic or mental connections. there just never seems to be someone tuned into a similar enough wavelength or frequency for very long anyway. perhaps overcompensating for the traumas of young love inflicted on an already fragile self i had to adapt to the unfortunate realization that men were best compartmentalized or kept at a distance either physically or emotionally maximizing the enjoyment pleasure mutual benefit or conditional exchanges of both parties while attempting to minimize any negative side effects to be mindful of the diminishing returns of engaging in modern dating rituals while still maintaining the grandeurs of courtship or romance. but now i realized that i might have been gravely misguided in that sole determined focus on selfpreservation and fear of being repeatedly heartbroken. ive gotten so good at putting my guard up and playing defense that i wonder if thats going to ironically end up cost me the prize. detriments of paranoia dismissiveness and cynicism rather than pattern recognition and learned experience. over time i kept switching arenas going up against bigger better players and ran the gambit in terms of strategies and playbooks feeling like i surely mustve gotten better at the game by now? i certainly feel bulletproof of sorts it would definitely take a hell of a man to affect me these days. then if so why does it feel like im farther from winning than ever?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 07:35:37 UTC,1,14,1.0,,,0,0
1j359c4,im retrospective i did cheat on my expartner and thats the best thing ive ever did,ive been dealing with some complicated memories and feelings lately and i feel like its finally time to try get this out there ok so some context around 2 years ago i currently 25 f was in a relationship with a girl lets call her h for almost 5 years at the time. i used to feel like we were inseparable played video games together liking the same stuff and daring to go out into a world specially after i grew in quite the conservative household h was a bastion of courage to get myself out there. eventually polyamory came into the question and we were both on board and started a weird relationship with another girl lets call her n. this lasted for like 2 months honestly things werent that bad n really helped me to start understanding things about my sexuality i never did plus she was and still is probably one of the only persons that understands all of my simpsons references. then a party came around and another girl s appeared. we all got drunk and it was clear s was very into us. what at first was uncomfortable flirting quickly worked on h before i knew they were both kissing in front of me ...wich i hated but then h hitted me with the join us or we are over afraid like the little idiot i was i complied joined in what is to this day one of my most shameful nights not only in bed but because they made me lie to n. for the next few months i was like dead in life following h and s with everything be it more parties slandering and victim blaming n or hearing them play with other girls. at this point is where o appears.... o was the first shining of light in a dark time we clicked immediately we talked a lot enjoyed many things together and honestly just understood each other a lot. at the time i thought hey if we are already in a open relationship whats wrong with me having another partner well the things was i wasnt it was one of those situations were the relationship was open for a person but not for the other. h and s had both other partners but it was a problem when i did because then i stopped being their little errand girl. the breakup was nuclear it was 2 months of whole on fighting and cussing at each other o was there for me the entire time and helped me understand a lot of my own feelings. while at the same time i had to see h become the worst version of herself getting drunk and violent. probably only didnt hit me because s stopped her.... cause oh boy she did in previous fights. i parted ways with both of them moved cities to be closer to o and let me tell you ...life has never been better o helped me rebuild a bridge with my family to rebuild a sense of self confidence. where i have been fearful or anxious before o was only supportive and understanding she helped me see many things of my previous relationship how they were the stoy of lies manipulation and isolation that i refused to see in the past with o i feel loved not like a versión of me wich i could growing into but as truly me. o has encouraged me to get into a masters degree and ive encouraged to fix the relationship with her family too. and while i miss the friend h was from time to time i am happy to be where i am i wish both h and s a happy life together too i hope they dont get to toxic to each other and to grow into better people too. to n i wish i could apologize properly but understandably she blocked me from any form of contact and honestly i dont blame her hope she is having a great time living all the adventures she wanted too. and as for me....honestly o is the love of my life and even of weve been together for little more than a year and a half ive decided once i get my masters degree and get the chance to compete for better paying jobs i will marry this person and try to live our best life together. i swear i will try to make o the happiest on earth because honestly she already made me the happiest. ive never wanted to live my life as much as i do now and its all thanks to her. we are playing yakuza like a pirate and going to watch the new gundam movie next weekend soni think we are on a great start for a rest of out life. if theres is anything to learn here just remember you do not deserve the minimum effort nor crumbs of affection you all deserve to be loved for who you are. dare to break free form your status quo and be happy believe you deserve to love and be loved p.d. please dont cheat on your partners even polyamory has to be properly consensuated and agreed upon or else is cheating too,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 07:13:28 UTC,0,0,0.17,,,0,0
1j354wi,is it normal for a mom to act like this? feels like i have a teenager for a parent,what do i do? sometimes i feel like my mom can just be the worst. she can be so rude immature and she acts like a teenager. am i wrong for thinking this? i keep switching between self pity and guilt because i just have no idea if this is normal or not because all in all she is my mom and i love her very much but sometimes when i witness some of my friends relationships with their mothers i feel tears come to my eyes literally. basically for context i graduated from high school four months ago and im only going to university next year so taking a gap year to travel and work and im leaving overseas in three months. so basically my day to day just consists of learning the piano trying to find a job reading a bit organising my oe and occasionally hanging out with friends. today i was watching tv which to be honest i rarely rarely do and out of nowhere she comes storming in with a horrible attitude and my heart just immediately starts racing because for some reason i can never fully relax around her. im just always on edge even the sound of her footsteps gives me anxiety. she starts complaining and getting angry at me basically muttering this lazy bitch etc to herself because she was working and didnt have time for lunch yet while i was sitting infront ofthe tv. i mean am i wrong for getting a bit uncomfortable and weirded out by that? just because i feel like she shouldnt be comparing herself to me and it just feels very immature and strange like is it entitled for me to think yes well your the adult and im not sure why your comparing yourself to your teenage daughter? like she was trying to guilt trip me. shes just always angry and taking shots at me and it feels so weird because im the one that has to endure her tantrums and ive learnt not to react or give her my emotions and try and just stay level. its to the point where if she does decide to be nice to me i just get sad or even angry because its like i cant even enjoy it because i know it wont last. its like she flips a switch depending on her mood. it reallly feels like im on eggshells when im in the same room as her and it almost feels stuffy and hard to breathe. like i just cant enjoy myself or let my mind be at rest im always aware of where she is and what shes doing and when she leaves the room i can breathe. i understand to an extent why she is so angry and frustrated with me all the time but its just upsetting because i feel like i can count on one hand the amount of times she speaks to me nicely in a week. to be honest my room is a pigstye and i know it and i hate it too but im just in a bit of a rut right now and i know its bad and ive been trying to clear it step by step but its very overwhelming for me and i dont blame her for being frustrated about it. but i was finally makin some progress the other day and packing my dirty clothes into one basket and organising them in the other and then i go to bed and leave it for the next day to put away. i wakeup and the clothes are thrown everywhere around the room and i hear her yelling that i shouldnt be using the baskets she needs for laundry or something like that. to be honest i wasnt really even suprised or angry. but today i decided to sort of get back at her a bit which i know is immature but i couldnt realy control my emotions and when i get angry i dont yell back or argue i just do something small to the other person which sort of calms down my head so i squirted a bit of ketchup from my lunch onto the carpet. it was really only a dollar coin size but i go back to my room and i hear her storming down the stairs and throwing open my door and starting to scream at me about it. i just really am at a loss and dont know if its me or if its her.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 07:04:41 UTC,1,2,1.0,,,0,0
1j34wfr,i gave my eldest daughter up for adoption 15 years ago today,i was 18 when i had my first born. between no support system and post partum depression i never bonded with her. it was just me and her i would ask my friends to watch her her while i worked to be able to afford daycare so i could make a life for me and her yet i still never felt any connection with her. i knew it wasnt her fault she never asked for me to be her mother. i told myself i would push through and hope for a better future. i despised her. her cries sounded like nails on a chalk board and i would end up crying after taking care of her. i still reminded myself she never asked for me to be her mother i had to push through. my post partum depression progressed i never got treatment because of fear. i feared she would be taken away from me because of how we were living. section 8 a messy house not having enough food for both of us. i always gave her my meals what little there was. i went from 150 to 114 in a very short amount of time. i was hungry tired overwhelmed but she never asked for me to be her mother. her father came back into our lives when she was around 14 months. it felt like my saving grace. maybe we could be a little family and have a home full of love and laughter. he was a drunk. i was still alone with my daughter and now i had the heavy burden of having someone in my house that could help but chose not to. 2 months later i fell pregnant again. i was horrified when i found out. i couldnt restart everything again. i kept her because of a previous miscarriage. i felt it wasnt right for me to be ungrateful. i had a rough pregnancy. i was very depressed and had a turbulent relationship. he left me constantly during my pregnancy. he said cruel things. it only got worse when i had to go on maternity leave. i was called lazy and a bad mother for not working up until i gave birth. my daughter was born 10lbs 1oz i was exhausted and i hurt severely. my second daughter was born and everything was so easy. i connected with her immediately. she was such a happy baby. she never cried just to cry. she only cried when she needed something. when i took care of her needs there was no crying. she was happy and content at such a young age. i realized this is what motherhood was supposed to feel like. it wasnt supposed to feel like a burden i wasnt supposed to secretly despise my child i wasnt supposed to be angry at a helpless newborn. havjng my second really changed me. i was so much more nice to my first i still found her annoying most of the time but i felt i loved her for the first time. it was short lived unfortunately. the post partum depression returned when my youngest was 78 months. she was still the apple of my eye but i turned my hatred to my oldest again. that was the moment i realized i needed to consider adoption. how could a mother hate her child? as the months went on i found myself not giving affection towards her. i would ignore her tantrums and yell at her for them. i would tell her no when she asked if i could hold her. i stopped kissing her forehead or cheeks. she wasnt an easy child since birth but it got so much worse as she aged. i laid in bed next to her and admitted to myself i hate my own child. i hated her as i would hate a person who has done wrong by me for years. the night finally came i had enough. i had been trying to put her to bed for an hour. hearing screaming being kicked having my hair pulled. i snapped. i pinched her. hard. multiple times until she fell asleep. then once more after she fell asleep. the same punishment my mother would do to me. i was turning into my mother. the person i promised myself i would never be like. i had the most rude awakening that night and cried for hours after she went to bed. i took her to the cps office the following morning and told them i couldnt be her mother anymore. that was all i said. i left her in the waiting room. i didnt hug her i didnt kiss her i just left. it ate at me for years and still does. i was the only person she knew in her life. i knew her finding a loving family was better than having a mother like me. i moved a few states away 2 days after. i didnt want to be found. i didnt want any possibility of them trying to return her to me because i knew i did this for her own good. it was the only genuine loving gesture i had to offer her since she was born. they never reached out or tried to find me as far as i knew. i still carry the guilt and shame. i still cry for her. how confused and scared she must have been to never see her mother again. why couldnt i be the mother she deserved? 2 12 years of thinking the bare minimum was the most love she would ever receive. im glad i gave her up. not for me but for her. i searched through multiple schools near my old town a few days ago. i found her. i took the information i had and found her as well as her adoptive family on facebook. she has an amazing life. she looks radiant in every picture i found of her. shes absolutely gorgeous. i know i couldnt have given her that life. i hope this was a selfless act not selfish. i hope she doesnt remember me. i married and had one more daughter. im so in love with my 2 other children which brings a perpetual guilt to my life. i wish i couldve been her mother. i still mourn her. i havent allowed myself to feel negatively about giving her up only for the way i treated her. it was for her. she never asked to have a mother like me so i gave her to a mother that could love her the way she deserved.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 06:48:08 UTC,58,144,0.59,,,0,0
1j34w4q,everyday i think about cheating. its getting harder to push the thoughts away,for the record i have not nor will i cheat on my partner. yes i do love them our sex life just really sucks. i would be lying if i said that at least once a day i didnt i wish was with someone else because they cant give me what i wantneed. for context were both kinky but my partner wayyy over stated their desires regarding bdsm when we first started dating. they also wayyyyyyyyyyyy undersold how intense their specific fetish is. i dont want to list it here because its specific enough youd likely find them. regardless their fetish impacts out daily lives in negative ways because we cant go out and do things as freely. disclosure i dont mind the fetish its just not my thing. ive incorporated it into our sex life because i know my partner likes it but im tired of always giving and never getting. im so bored and so tired of bringing it up and getting nothing in return. i love my partner. we been living together for awhile now. they truly are my best friend and i cant imagine my life without them. but i feel manipulated and mind numbingly bored where sex is concerned. to the point i dont even want to handle myself. all the effort in the beginning with the big talk and at least trying the things im into its honestly not that crazy and they said they wanted it too it all feels like it was a ploy to get me and get invested in the relationship. basically once they knew i was all in rug pull with anything kinky going out the door. i fantasize daily about being able to come home to my sweet and loving partner after being with a better matched sexual partner. i dont want them to change. their sweet and wholesome and kind nature is part of why i love them. other than our sex life everything is perfect. i wish i didnt have these thoughts. i wish it wasnt an issue. but i dont know how to stop these daily thoughts.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 06:47:27 UTC,0,4,0.43,,,0,0
1j343pd,good life but frustrated with my own development. looking for feedback,i male 30s have needed to emotionally vent frustrations about myself and stunted growth as a person. i have to begin and say my life for outsiders looking in is great. i have a fiance expecting a child both great careers and a home. i just started picking up a sport which makes me appreciate life alot so what more could ipeople ask for? but im sad and heres why. ive been in a similar career most my life and its almost like a golden pair of handcuffs at this point. i sit at a computer for so long my posture has gotten terrible. ive tried youtube channels with timers a self shocking watch back straps. yet it still shows up and bleeds to outside work. i even have a standing desk. meals become easy to miss because i wrap myself in work which comes and goes. so im thinner build as result. my own self communication and arguably articulation of thoughts has gotten worse from working remotely i rarely interact with anyone except my fiance. i try not to use social media or be on my phone. i want to reduce screentime but it at the same time im almost more isolated and out of touch with the world. ive never had a knack for learning names or being able to follow sports which is arguably the easiest conversation starter so thats a bit of a bummer. the lack of exposure to people and social media id arguably say has made me dumber as a person. i get less time communicating forming sentences and even articulating my own biasededucated views on topics. i find my self starting sentantices with i forgot or i think more often then id like to admit. so whats my deal? am i crazy? getting alzheimers? uneducated? losing all enthusiasm to life? do other people feel this way? i just dont get it. i dont like living like this. i recently bought things to get in shape but i still worry that im too uneducated or fell too far behind from my single minded career focused brain. i even get a small fear that ill let my fiance down by not having meaningful communications if i stay on the track. im not sure if im looking for advice someone to placate me or sanity check that people typically be human easier then me and that im actually the issue. im aware i need to be my own change or see a therapist but why not ask a world of strangers first i guess...,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 05:53:56 UTC,1,0,0.99,,,0,0
1j33xmo,wish people would stop lying to me about my appearance and my relationship chances.,i know the mean well but when my mom andor people her age 2530 years older than me call me handsome it makes me want to punch a wall. like why do they feel the need to lie? i have fucking eyes i know that i look like jared the subway guy crossed with shrek and a little fat bastard for good measure. so why the hell do people insist on saying shit like that? im never going to find a relationship. i just turned 33 and have never had one. ill always be destined to pay for physical touch whether its a massage or something more doesnt matter never will i experience what its like to have someone find me attractive. and i might be able to come to terms with it one day but not if people continually try to gaslight me into believing im anything other than fat and ugly inside and out. wish i could say this right to peoples faces but then id probably lose the few people in my life who actually tolerate my existence. and im already so incredibly fucking lonely as it is. so i put up with it because i know theyre trying to be nice even though they have no fucking clue how much it hurts. just the act of them lying reminds me of how absolutely cooked i am. one of these days i just know im gonna snap and say how i really feel about myself how i know everyone actually sees me as ugly and pathetic and just has pity for me. and that will be the day i fully give up and start giving away my belongings spend the rest of my money on 1 last afternoon or night of companionship before getting the fuck off this godforsaken rock. and its probably going to very very soon.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 05:42:44 UTC,1,10,1.0,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0

1j33mak,my marriage ended after 25 yrs,im doing this on my phone so excuse the formatting! and also excuse the rambling. upto 2023 my marriage was on good footing. but then my physical and mental health took a nose dive. i lost interest in sex and i couldnt explain why to my husband because i didnt know why. my migraines were coming at 67 a week yes almost daily and lasting 612 hrs long and i was having issues with bleeding most of the time. i have several other medical obstacles and i am considered disabled by social security. i closed off thinking my husband didnt want to hear about my petty complaints. housework became his responsibility as well as cooking dinner on top of working full time. i cant work due to my physical and mental health he was overwhelmed and asked if i could cook dinners again. i did for about two weeks and then i couldnt because my migraines were making it hard to smell food let alone eating it. my day basically was laying in bed all day listening to audiobooks to try to get my mind off the pain of the migraines. then at the end of may i had a needle biopsy of my thyroid come back abnormal most likely cancerous and that made me spiral more. thats when i got a text from an angry husband telling me that my husband was seeing his wife. this happened within a few days of finding out i needed to get my thyroid out. it was not a good week to say the least. i immediately confronted my husband with the text and he confessed it true. i thought it was only an emotional affair but he said it became physical back in april when he went on a writers retreat with several people or so i thought. it turns out it was just her and my husband. i completely lost it and was sobbing in his arms. this was not his first affair i asked him to break it off and go into counseling with me but he said no. he cared for her and didnt want to lose or hurt her. this was a major blow to me. i had been seeing a therapist for a while but she retired. so a week before i found out about my thyroid i started seeing a new counselor. on my second appointment with her was a mess. i told my counselor about my thyroid and of my husband cheating. we had just celebrated our 25th anniversary before i had found out. i started having suicidal thoughts and told her about them. i even had a plan to carry out the suicide involving oding on one of my meds. she urged me to get a lockbox for that med and give the keys to my husband. he still loves me but was not in love with me anymore. he our 15 yr old son and i talked about the drug issue and it was decided for my safety that either my son or my husband would portion out the days worth of med about an hour before i was due to take it. we didnt tell our son the exact reason why it needed to be controlled because we didnt want to alarm him. i was spiraling down fast at this point. i stopped going to my water aerobics class and became a recluse. i didnt want to see anyone. it was hard for me to focus on conversation so i lost interest in talking at all. i was seeing my counselor weekly and my prescriber of my antidepressants and antipsychotics monthly. that time is somewhat fuzzy in my head. august comes around and they took out half my thyroid. turns out i had medullary thyroid cancer in that half. so they needed to remove the entire thyroid the other half was taken out in october. that side was clean thank goodness. they had caught it before it could spread outside my thyroid. my husband started driving to see his ap on a biweekly basis. we didnt tell anyone not even our son for a while. we tried to keep things normalish as to not upset him. my husband and i decided to remain friends at least and he wanted a divorce. we broke the news to our son in december about us splitting up but he was the only one to know. my parents arent the most forgiving people so we wanted to keep the news from them for as long as possible. my relationship with my father is rocky at best my counselor and i were talking on a weekly basis at this point trying to reason with me that killing myself isnt the answer. i knew i didnt want to die because of our son but that was the only reason i could even rely on. everything was just falling apart around me. my husband moved out of our bedroom in december so i was sleeping alone. and crying myself to sleep almost every night. we would talk about his day in general and about our son but that was about it. when my depression would spike and i was feeling very suicidal at one point i tried to find the key to the medicine safe he would talk me down. i still dont know if that was a good thing or bad thing. ap lives 8 hours from us. so every other weekend he would drive to see her she filed for divorce a week before they met irl in april and in her state you have to be physically separated for a year before the divorce is finalized her ex is an a and kept harassing me and my husband. so a year after i found out may 24 my husband says he wants to move in with ap so he needs to get a job there. i tell him i cannot stand to stay living in our townhouse as it has too many memories. he suggested i look for another apartment that our son and i can live in after he moves. we did just that. he started working his new job the week after we moved to a flat. july24 just before we moved we had to put down one of our cats she was fading and we didnt think shed survive the move plus she couldnt walk or use the litter box on her own moving seemed to help my mental state. im not having as many panic attacks or psychosiss hearing voices that arent there im able to do some of the housework myself cooking vacuuming keeping the kitchen wiped down my bedroom and my bathroom. our son now 16 does his own room his bathroom the dishes the trash and the kitty stuff like feed the cat and keep the litter clean we are currently working on a dissolution on our marriage. since we dont have much just a car really and our son there isnt too much to split. we are on the same page about spousal and child support in the state i live in if youre married more than 25 yrs i get 30 of his income for the rest of our lives or until i marry again and child support until our son is 18. our son and i get to see my stbx every 34 weeks for a weekend. its painful to be separated from him but it also hurts to see him. i know i failed persevering_face and its mostly my fault our marriage ended. its been like this for about 6 months. he wants me to start seeing other people but after the 2nd betrayal of trust by him i dont know if i can trust anyone anymore. and i need trust to get close to someone else. thanks for listening. edit thank you all for your kind words. a lot of them made me cry.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 05:23:01

1j33m73,worried about regrets and finding the right path,hey everyone im really struggling to figure out my career path and id love to hear from people who have been in similar situations. i know ive been privileged to have the opportunity to choose between highearning fields but i feel stuck because im worried i wont actually like or be good at anything. my main concerns dentistry im drawn to the stability and handson aspect but i worry that the field is becoming too corporate with private equity firms buying up practices. if thats the case would i be better off just going into finance or private equity directly? plus id be in dental school until almost 30 without making money which makes me nervous. lawfinance i have this vision of being a lawfinance girl working in the big city and i like the prestige and business aspects of both fields. but i also hear about brutal hours burnout and slow career progression. would it be worth working my way up the corporate financelaw ladder getting an mba or jd and trying to break into something lucrative? entertainment industry a part of me is drawn to working in entertainment law production or the business side of hollywood because ive always found movie sets fascinating. but i know its hard to break into and i dont want to waste time chasing a dream that wont provide financial stability. what i want financial freedom and stability a solid career path with structure not just bouncing around good worklife balance time for family travel and personal interests a mix of business and creativity not just sitting at a desk all day potential to pivot into multiple careers im 25 and feel behind already. i know grad school is an investment so i want to be sure before committing. im not naturally great at science but i also worry that readingwriting all day in lawfinance might bore me. dentistry would give me handson work but would i enjoy it longterm? or would business and investing be the better move? would love to hear from people whove navigated similar crossroads. did you regret your choice? what helped you decide? thanks in advance!,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 05:22:50 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0

1j32iaa,my dads girlfriend tried to get me to forge documents,my mom and dad have been separated since i was 13 and it was because of my dads abuse and neglect. he has brain damage from a bad car accident and has poor impulse control as a result. despite this ive tried my best to be on good terms as an adult but his psycho girlfriend is too much to deal with. her name is cherry he started dating cherry about 3 years ago. shes had three kids and lost them all to the system because shes too crazy to care for them bipolar and sometimes else shes estranged from all of them important notes for later she is loud rude quick to anger and prone to simple and complex delusions when something doesnt go her way. im positive the only reason my dad is still with her especially after she killed his cat supposed by accident is because she came into a lot of settlement money from hernia mesh complication. since then theyve been living it up together. about a week before christmas cherrys oldest son got hit on a moped on the highway by a big truck. he felt into a coma and is brain dead. his long term girlfriend and mother of his son was given power of attorney aa per his medical wishes. now cherry lost custody of him when he was just 9 years old and havent spoken to her in over 5 years. she had never met her grandson or his girlfriend until she came to the hospital. cherry immediate assumed she was in control over his medical decisions and requested the plug be pulled and openly discussed lawsuits and burials in front of his girlfriend and son. girlfriend told her to stop and said she didnt have the right and before long cherry is banned from seeing him and banned from the hospital as a guest forever. in cherrys mind and version of events his girlfriends grandfather forged her sons name on the medical records declaring her to make decisions on his behalf in case of coma the reasoning is her grandfather works for the county court as a traffic ticket clerk and her evidence is i know my son shes repeatedly asked my opinion on the matter because i work in critical care nursing and ive explained it multiple times as simply as i can but she refuses to believe that a common law partner with a child of 10 years would be granted power of attorney over an estranged parent who lost custody for mental health and sex work and drug convictions. this leads me to the trap i feel in. theyve been bugging me about meeting for lunch for weeks to discuss something and every time id ask what for they say we need to talk in person i was going to be in town that way last saturday so i agreed and figured a free meal and theyd stop bugging me. the day before my dad ask me to bring my notary stamp im a notary good side gig and i press and they say we need you to look over some papers i get suspicious and stiff out what theyre up to. i call them out of it and they insist that it isnt related to it... i get there we order our food and they pull out power of attorney forms. they try to say that the court told them they just had to fill these out get them notarized and cherry would get power of attorney over her son. i explained these forms required her son to sign them and says it doesnt because hes in a coma. i explained this was forgery and her rebuttal was well that bitch forged her name to take my son and i had to calmly explain that even if it did happen nothing would change without a lawyer and they dont take this stuff lightly. cherry has a melt down and accuses me of plotting against her and my dad had to get her to stop because at this point she causing scene yelling slamming her hands on the table. i get up and leave and my dad tried to call my four times before he got the message. today he texted me saying why couldnt you just do it if youre right they wont accept the form noways like he didnt ask me to commit a crime for his psycho girlfriend. they deserve each other and feel horrible for her children ever having to deal with crazy crack head. one day ill never have to deal with her or my dad and ill celibate with kfcs finest to commemorate the time they tried to bribe me with a 5 fill up to commit forgery to get control over a person in a coma,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 04:19:06 UTC,27,4,0.87,,,0,0

1j32apg,i 20s hate my mom 50s,i just want to be able to say that. i hate her. thats all. i dont want to. i will keep her in my life. at the end of the day she is my mom. she gave me life. she does so much for me. she loves me. but god is she unbearable. shes the black sheep of the family so its not just opinion. shes loud. shes annoying. shes stupid. shes a karen. just today she humiliated me in walmart by nearly getting into a yelling match with an employee over 2 because it was stocked in the wrong spot and that wasnt her fault. she literally took a picture of it stocked wrong for evidence. wouldnt let the employees talked and just kept shoving her picture on her phone in their faces. in the car she refused to admit to any wrong doing and she was so upset with how they treated her. i tried so hard to get her to see that the rest of the world saw her the way she saw them but she just couldnt see a world she was in the wrong. im locked in my room crying from just embarrassment. i invited her and she visited and she helped me out and bought a ton of groceries and stuff and we had such a great time together overall but shes constantly doing little things like this and has a long history of doing things like this. a small sampling from the most recent years includes trying to take me to a preacher psychologist when i came out as gay at 16. inviting my brothers girlfriends but not my partners to events when i reached similar age milestones. yell at my aunt because i ranted to my aunt about my mom but my aunt was spreading lies about my mother threaten to shoot my uncle in a discussion over who would be pallbearers at my grandmas funeral constantly shove in my face anything she ever does for me as if shes entitled to worship make everything about herself get pissed off that me and an aunt happened to run into my other aunt and see their engagement ring before her denied that she was sick after coming to christmas with a cold and 5 of us had the flu the next week including an infant she was all over causing some issue at every single family gathering shes a little dumb. you can tell her soemthing and she will just not comprehend it and ask you the same exact question 3 or 4 times. she tries to help. she tries to make up for things. deep down i love her. i mean she used to be my best friend before i turned 15 and started to become my own person and come out and flourish. shes just someone that if she was not my mother i wouldnt have anything to do in life. we are very different people and yeah. i guess i just feel really bad for her too. as much as she just angers me beyond all belief i know shes sad. shes just lashing out. i wish she would get help. it sucks when you feel like you have to parent your parent. this is a lot. it feels good to have it off my chest. it feels good to have typed it out. she leaves tomorrow. this gives me enough energy to leave my locked room and deal with her for the rest of the night. i hope the 2 was worth the mental distress she caused her son.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 04:09:16 UTC,9,0,0.91,,,0,0
1j31y7l,grindr broke my brain and its affecting my relationship,so i 20m and my boyfriend 32m have been in a relationship for about a year. before i started dating him i was very active on grindr and had multiple hookups. just to give you some context i really think my boyfriend is an attractive man and he is very sweet and kind to me. yes we do have a big age gap which i initially liked because ive always been into older men but now i feel kind of insecure about it since he already works has his own apartment and can do whatever he wants while im in college living with my parents. but thats not the problem. recently ive been feeling very turned off by him. its not that the sex isnt good but i really miss going out with different guys and i dont know why. i mean i still think hes attractive but i kind of want to sleep around again even though i felt very empty when i did that before. its also been almost two months since we last had sex. i study medicine and dont have much time to see himwe usually only see each other on sundaysso its not like id have time to go on multiple dates or anything again. but i think the issue is that our relationship has reached that phase where the initial spark has faded a little. sometimes when im at the gym i catch myself looking around at other guys. my tiktok and instagram feeds are basically just shirtless men and i still follow some of the guys i used to flirt with so their stories catch my attention. at the same time while part of me wants to break up and go back to grindr i also really like him and i know he really likes me. this is my first real and longest relationship so i dont know if what im feeling is normal. and even if it is normal what should i do? id really appreciate some advice and im happy to answer any questions you might have.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 03:51:00 UTC,1,5,0.54,,,0,0

1j31tre,i love my family and i paid for their travel to europe,i dont have any place to share this story because it may be too braggy so i hope to post this here. i 33m am the eldest of my family with my 2 siblings 32f 29m and my parents almost 60. my earliest memory was of my siblings and i sleeping in a storeroom frequently visited by roaches and mice and us playing with street children. amid this our parents still found the money to install an ac in the storeroom and got us into the best primary and secondary school in our town. this reflects how my parents worked hard for the family while making sure that me and my siblings are living comfortably. due to my upbringing being quite positive and never having felt impoverished i always thought of myself as normal and at times even rich. it was only during the past few years of maturity that i realised that my parents truly kept the family afloat. while i always wanted to give back to my family i was assumed to become the poorest among my siblings. we say this in jest so it was totally fine. my siblings were the businesstypes and theyve saved up enough money to be far richer than me while i am still doing my phd hence underpaid. due to my academic degrees ive travelled quite a lot especially within europe travel between countries is super cheap!. each country i stepped into i always hoped that i could bring my family with me i never thought that this would be a possibility because my family lives oceans away and again i am a phd student. fast forward to last year i was scanning through linkedin and found an airelated job which completely fits my profile. i have a unique set of skills from my previous msc and my current phd which made me uniquely fit for this job they literally should have just put my name on the job ad lol. due to being related to ai and the unique nature of my specialty the job paid extremely well. additionally it was a completely freelance and remote job. i applied and got in and made my way from being a normal worker to becoming one of the heads of the team even getting facetoface with the huge ai companies yes those ones. i was paid weekly and within the first week i was able to comfortably buy the latest iphone and an ok desk setup during the second week. i am quite a simple guy who really just wanted a good phone and desk so the next few weeks the money was just gathering in my account. anyway my graduation from my european msc was coming up it got delayed and i really wanted to bring my parents. with no hesitation i invited my parents to the graduation all expenses paid. my mother also asked if my siblings can also tag along. at this point i did not have enough money for everyone but i said they can come. somehow along the way my siblings also had all their expenses paid by me. haha. i worked my ass off while my mother planned the trip. we ended up with a planned trip across 6 countries in 3 weeks. honestly i did not expect it to be as intense but i still said yes. my mother really wanted to visit those countries. and how could i even say no if my mother keeps showing me her planned outfits beret included! there isnt enough space to list down all the things we did but here are some of the heartwarming ones gtmy father was never the type to express his emotions well and whenever we used to have our local trips he was mostly unimpressed. for the first time i saw him taking photos of a landmark eiffel tower and he was quite lovey dovey with my mother especially in paris. they were so cute. gtmy siblings and i had extremely deep conversations in amsterdam. about our lives our family. how proud we were of each other and also reminiscing some of our childhood memories and that and look where we are now moment. we never really talked to each other in such profound ways and i am so glad we had those conversations. gtour last stop was in amsterdam my family had to take the train to the airport while i had to take the train back to the uk. in the most dramatic way we found ourselves on adjacent platforms which meant we were waiting at the same bench for our trains im fucking crying now. their train was about to arrive on the platform so we said our goodbyes. we were not the type to hug so i just awkwardly said good bye to each of them while waving my hand. my mother was surprised and asked me for a hug instead imagine her saying it in a stereotypical spoiled brats voice lol. we did. this was the first hug we had since ive become an adult damn the onions. they went inside the train and kept looking at me. i hated seeing them on the train. i did not want them to leave and return to their normal lives back home. tears starting to form on my eyes and i had to look away. i know it was truly dramatic. and the timing was perfect because their train ran on that instant and mine came to my platform. i miss them. the work was a short term one so it stopped around mid of last year but it is starting up again. i barely had any savings but i have no regrets. i wish i can bring them here again.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 03:44:18 UTC,13,2,0.93,,positive,0,0

1j30kev,i was in the nca dalles crisis.,im a cheerleader on a special needs team i will be censoring the names due to privately. where about to go to warm us taking a team picture before we go i was happy at realizing where my spot was as last time i was worried i was in the wrong spot but my coach thought it was ok suddenly a buch of cheerleaders started screaming and running passed us at the time i assumed they way excited to get to warmups and was about to say why there where so happy being confusedamused three things happened however one of the cheer dads shouted at us to run and i realized that not only was everyone running but they where all terrorfied and i realized something was very wrong. i panicked i was trying to get in the middle of the crowd hoping to shelter me ran to a secrutly guard i also started to slow down both because i was looking for people on my cheer team and was also in shock. thankfully another team member found me and told me to go with her lets call her 1 she was being really rational so i was following her thought i felt a bit silly since shes a teen. we also found three more 2 3 and 4. we where directed to go up to to a place that was more dirty think a warehouse where found our coach she was talking on a phone i never seen her so scared. mind you shes normally a very tough cheer coach she was crying while talking on her phone later found out it was a her dad saying that she had to find someone since she cant run later found out it was another team member who has cerebral palsy and a bad knee. they where directing us to go over a this thing its kind of like a cliff inside of a basement if that makes any sense sorry not sure how to get call it where all trying to get coachs attention eventally i gotten louder and touched her arm and told her to over there and we all did with some help down. once where walking we where told to grab hands i grabbed the woman next to me thinking she was a member of my cheer team though she was not she laughed and told me it was fine things gotten calmer was thinking it all over and maybe even as 1 said that it was a misunderstanding and there wasnt any gunfire some people where crying and i told her them it was going to be ok. but then people started screaming and running again i also heard what i thought was gunfire sounding like pop pop pop! we ran back again i lost the hand of the cheerleader and grabbed 2s hand instead she started crying and saying that she didnt know what was going on i felt really bad for because while where both autistic shes higher support needs then me in my head i was thinking there was an mass shooter in here though i didnt want to tell her that since it would freak her out even more so i didnt say anything she also asked if it was going to be ok and i told her yes to ease her which seemed to help. i paniced again and tried to jump over this fence like thing but i wasnt good enough so i gave up and ran way along with some others. during the chaos we lost sight of our cheer coach and her assistant coach. also durning all of crisis i had a couple of thoughts in my head admitly i was thinking of want to post to trueoffmychest but i was also wondering on why on earth a mass shooter came and shot up cheerleaders like did he had some vendetta against them? i was also thinking maybe it was like 2017 las vegas shooting and there was no reason he just wanted to shoot up a place. yes i was aware that we just didnt know the motive but that was the shooting that came up. i was praying to god that my dad and my other cheermembers where not dead especialy one of them since she was in a wheelchair i didnt know where she was and she couldnt move as fast as 1 in her wheelchair not her fault 1 is just really fast she also couldnt run i felt bad for my dad since i know he was proctive over me and i left my phone with him we wont allowed to take with us for warmups so i thought he was terrofried and upset that he couldnt even contect me to make sure i was ok when things where calmer i was also thinking of jokes to make in the group me such as worst thing i thought at first we might lose worst thing now literal gun statistic and in mist of chaos 3 still makes friends she likes to make friends with everyone and while where walking she started to chat with other cheerleaders once we got outside things again started to get calm and i again started to think it was going to be ok but again they started to scream and run and i think i heard the popping sound again where all run down towards the bottem of the bridge to shelter us i sprained my ankle a couple of days earlier so it was hard to run on half of hill especially with holding 2s hand once i got to the bottem i accidently step into mud in my daze i thought i liked my shoes but it was ok. thinking i was wearing my normal shoes instead of the cheer ones they again directed towards up to hill and to the fence at first i didnt want to go thinking it was safer down here since i wanted shelter 2 kept on tuggin on my arm to go up i did eventally trusting them so we ran up again a cheerleader fall down into mud i didnt want to go down to hold her up thinking it was unsafescary but i did yelled at to get help she did to my hapiness once we got up there things where calm and thankfully remained calm ever since 3 at this point was crying and the cheerleaders she was talking to her contiuned to ask her questions to keep her distrated i jouned in i hugged 3 to help her and she hugged back i also hugged another cheerleader who was also crying i saw the women that fell in the mud and she was fine so i didnt talk to her but was happy she wasnt dead again. at one point i started to zone out thinking of all the event today 1 noticed and told me not to go someplace else as she needs me here i told her ok and i wasnt daydreaming she was doing breathing excerise to calm herself down. we where again directed towards to walk over a bridge once we got to the other side we set by some buildings again we talked to other cheerleaders and coaches i again tried to comfort another cheerleader who was crying along with her friends one of the coachess offered to call our parents though she could ony calltext 3s mom since i didnt know my parents phone numbers 1 always had her phone with her since she hide it lol over time 1s 4s dads came every time i heard screaming of people calling for their family member i gotten nervous because at that time i assoalted screamingrunning and gunfire though i did think we where safe since if there was a mass shooter we where no longer by the nca building also i looked over there and saw what appeared to be i asked on her the other cheerleaders where ok and they said i was too worried to ask about my dad i was still prying for them instead my head. eventally my dade i told my dad i was happy he came later 1s mom came we sat and talked about the entire thing the helicopter that i saw that i eventally told them my jokes again i did say to earleir cheerleaders and coaches my dad confirmed that the heliopter that i saw circuring around was connected to the corrent issue orginally i just thought it was normal helicopter i was wrong about being a police helopter it was news helicopter there was an active news story so we talked about that apparantly two cheer parents got into a fight and there thought they pulled out guns i ended up saying nothing says rationality like gunfire though officaly my dad and 1s mom says that was no gunfire i felt like the parnets would be banned for life and i felt bad for the daughtes because they got punished for something their parents did the phones where also going off with a warning about avoing the place and ther was a cheer perfomance that had inturpted for they can be evacuated my dad also said how people where being trumped and he saw one cheerleader with her leg bent i asked if she was alive and he said yes but crying i asked her if she was going to get it amputed and he said no it wasnt that bad. the youngest cheermember came we all comfoted her since she was hugging later found out she was crying for hours. my dad 2 want to our moms we came togather along with 5 it was a long walk and my back and ankle where really hurting i have very slight lumbar scoliosis there was a misnderstanding and we had to walk back 2s mom meet as half way for she can hug 2. we made it back 5 and i hugged and she was crying my mom hugged me and wanted to take a picture i asked if this was for something like our familys group text or the prayer team she said yes i think i said if it was called im not dead! photo and she laughed and agreeed later found out was for the group message though maybe also the prayer team as she today said she made it. on the our way there we read the news story and how they thought there was no gunfire but there was a genera agreemtn that they was gunfire since more then one of us heard it thankfully no one dead. my mom said even it was no gunfire it was real to us i agreed with this i got mad when i found out some people online thought it was funny the fear was very real and most of the people there are either teenegers nd or maybe even both and even with that its safer to get out then risk it not being real.since more then one of us heard it thankfully no one dead. when i got home i did more reaserch we talked about in the car but i wanted to read for myself there where dads and got in a fight the offical statemnt was that the poles being pushed it was sounded like gunfire i also heard other things while reading around like one dad having a seizure is what sounded like gunfire or the music in the cheer routine mixed up with the fight sounded like gunfire im netural but the general consensus is still among the cheer group was that it was gunfire since again we heard it and my dad said he heard it even outside. where at a pool for parents could have a meeting about it and we talked more nsa was going to be put in houstin next year and 5 thinks it would be from now on our coach doesnt want to come back to nsa andinto there is more secrutiy which was pretty surpsing to me since it where want every cheer season even whiel i was in mexico for my brothers wedding she pushed nca to march instead of skipping it lol 5 also says our coach wants us to have the wrist bindsblack marker lighting saying our phone number theres even as statement around the group of her changing the no phone role but thats not confirmed 5 also thinks she broke her big toe because while everyone was running someone stepted on her toe and it was really bruised there was more sayings on the group panic running but i had no issue with that myself so it was kind of shocking on the phone thing i later told my mom about it she said she wants me to memorlized her and dads phone number as she didnt realize i didnt know it. we also talked about the cheerleading compention most everyone ended up complenting on sunday instead except for the special needs teams which was canlled though even if we didnt our coach said wouldnt complete anyway since again gun panic the first day we wont in first place so the first day team ended up winning she and her coach assasiant was fighting it since she didnt think it was fair because neither them or us gotten the second day she even said even if our team won she wouldnt accept the reward for this very reason we had a group party plannedwe where worried we might have to cancell if everyon was too upset but thanfully we didnt and it was fun.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04

1j30jik,i cant fall out love of my best friend and its killing me,some clarification before english is not my first language so i apologize beforehand if theres something you didnt understand. feel free to ask if thats the case. for some context first me 23m and my best friend 21f lets call her nicky are friends since first year in college. we started getting along better in second year and later i started catching feelings for her. last year i couldnt resist and decided to invite her out surprisingly she said yes. we got through the talking stage and laid out some emotional things and said beautiful things to each other. unafortunately when we finally got to our first date she told me that she was actually confused and looking for something different than i am. obviously i was crushed. i was so over the moon with her and thought it was going well. it took me some time to recover from that but finally we got to be friends again which made me happy because aside from all romantic feelings im very fond of her or whatever you say when you love someone but not romantically lol. now the main issue here is that some weeks ago i realized i still have feelings for her and its getting really strong every day and im 110 sure she only sees me as a friend. still some part of me has some kind of hope but even though i feel bad because i promised her to be a good friend with no other interest between and im failing at that. every time i think about her i smile and im a profesional daydreamer so that happens very often. i cant imagine myself with anyone else but with her shes just wonderful i like everything about her. shes charismatic funny smart compassionate empathetic and i can keep going. so now im lost about what to do because if i tell her i know that its gonna ruin the friendship but i cant keep my feelings hidden anymore its killing me. also i have no idea if she knows or not. im aware my behaviour towards her may have changed and im being more... affectionate? but in words not physical. but i dont know if she can tell or not also because were talking via text and havent hung out since like a week ago.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 02:36:42 UTC,0,2,0.33,,,0,0
1j30j9z,my babydog died and everything is worse now.,my baby boydog died in my arms two days ago and im a mess. i was gifted my dog when i was 8 and was lucky enough to grow up with him. he was 15 had lost his sight and hearing but was a happy little dog. i came home from work and knew he was going to pass. he was lying on the floor with my mom breathing heavily and kept pooping himself. i held him in my arms and told him that it was okay and that i loved him. he died 30 min later. it was so random. wed been having a good couple of days. i brought his ashes home today and it feels like hes here. obviously hes not but i keep looking for him making sure not to step on him or wanting to share my food with him but hes not here. i know he wouldnt want me to be sad and that he loved me and that he knew i loved him but holy f it hurts so bad. i dont know how to be home without him. i was never truly alone because i always had him. but now i lay here in silence waiting to hear him snoring. how do people deal with this pain? i am miserable. edit thank you so so much for all of your kind words. they mean a lot to me and i really really appreciate you all.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 02:36:22 UTC,64,23,0.9,,,0,0
1j2zw99,my boyfriend keeps bringing up future relationship milestones and i dont know if hes being serious or not,i 17f have been dating my boyfriend 18m for the past few months and its been perfect it feels natural and not rushed and so far weve established that we want to have a long term relationship together but obviously we dont know how long that long term is going to be. i would like to see us reach future milestones because he is the loml and i couldnt imagine life without him but he has told me that he has certain views on things like marriage because his parents got divorced when he was four and says that marriage is something that he maybe doesnt see in his future because of the fear of ending up like his parents. but in the past week he has maybe multiple remarks about future milestones one day we were laying in my bed and he saw my baby pillow and was reading it and saw the part that said the proud parents of this baby a amp a and said just imagine this happens to us its gonna say the proud parents of this baby c amp c because like my parents me and my boyfriend have the same first initial. another time we were on the phone and he said ive been thinking a lot lately what are your thoughts of the idea of us getting married some day which caught me off guard because he said that he maybe didnt see himself getting married. hes also brought up promise rings with my friends at work because me and him work together and they have told me about it. and today while we were out to eat he brought up moving in together after i graduate. i love my boyfriend so much but i dont understand why the switch from having these certain views to changing those views and talking about that stuff and i dont know if hes joking about it or actually being serious. i want to believe that he is but with what he has said in the past is confusing me. im going to bring this up to him but i dont know what to say exactly. is it a sign that he may be changing his views and considering a future with me or is it something i should be worried about?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 02:03:11 UTC,1,14,0.6,,,0,0

1j2zgg1,i 23m still love my ex 24f and i dont know if she feels the same,so its basically as the title reads. we hadnt talked since we broke up in highschool 2017 up until she called me last year during an important family event. now we talk every few days and have an upcoming hangout planned. issue is that i dont know how she feels or what the vibe for the hangout is supposed to be. shes aware of how i feel because i drunkenly told her one day but she responded jokingly by saying that she was the one that got away i have no idea if i should ask her if this is supposed to be a date or if i should just be happy that she still wants to hang out with me.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 01:40:32 UTC,3,9,1.0,,,0,0
1j2zd9q,my mom passed away and bf is becoming more abusive,its been 6 months since my mom has passed. the first month was the hardest i didnt have the energy to do much of anything. and then came the nausea. turns out i got pregnant by my bf. i was extremely saddened by it bc i already had one abortion when i didnt think i was ready for it years ago. and i had promised myself that i wouldnt go through with that again. the problem is my bf is very verbally abusive and cops have been called multiple times bc of it in the past 6 years. today he was upset that the gym was too crowded and he kept being negative over the whole thing. that annoyed me and so i just said we should just go since hes killing the mood over nothing. we both were free for like 4 hours so waiting just a bit wasnt going to effect much. he then started driving very aggressively and that bothered me further since i am pregnant and hes supposed to be more careful on the road. he kept saying things to me none of them were questions or anything i could really say anything to. that made him start yelling at me and calling me an asshole for ignoring him. i told him to stop calling me that and that began a screaming match. i felt my baby going crazy in my womb so i told him to stop the car and i walked out a mile and a half away from home. i ignored all the calls and texts while i walked. i read my bible to calm down my thoughts and the baby. i also stopped to grab a green juice and a tuna wrap since i hadnt eaten anything. im torn about the whole ordeal. he wont listen to me about basic respect and im scared that the baby will have to deal with his antics as well. im not looking for advice really i just needed to vent. thanks for listening.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 01:36:04 UTC,2,3,1.0,,,0,0
1j2zd0k,i am struggling with the decision of accepting money from my dad when i plan on cutting him off again.,for context i am 29 years old and i grew up in an extremely abusive household. my dad nearly tried to take my life on several occasions and knew that my brother was sexually abusing me and did nothing about it. my dad constantly threatened to either kill me or himself and would not let me move out or live my life even through my 20s. he would pretend to be poor and ask me to help him with bills all the time but he was sitting on a half a million dollars and just didnt want to use it. it got to the point that even in my early and mid twenties he tracked my location my credit card bank account etc. and would abuse me choke me punch me threaten to kill me if i spent any money on anything. once i even asked to move out and he grabbed a kitchen knife and said hell either kill me or himself if i ever leave. i ended up getting cancer and my dad never even helped me with any of my bills for treatment and still continued to ask me for moneyhelp. fast forward to last year i finally ran away. i changed my last name my phone number moved to a different city and took my dog and left. i went one full year without contact filed restraining orders and everything. my dog has been my only consistent family my entire life. he has been the only support ive ever had and is my emotional support dog. he was just diagnosed with cancer and i broke down. out of sheer emotion i called my dad. which was the dumbest thing ive ever done. he was so elated to have me call him and back in his life that he offered to pay for my dogs surgery to help him be cancer free. i let him and i was so happy to have support. i need to cut him off again because hes already talking about wanting to leave his wife my mom and move in with me so we can leave happily ever after. he makes comments like we can get a second puppy and raise him together as if we are a couple and we would live a life together. my father is making me extremely sick and i am reminded why i had to cut him off. anyway i was told my dog may need a round or two of chemotherapy. giving him chemotherapy could give him a matter of years of his life back versus only months. my dog is in excellent condition couldnt even tell he was sick. he is worth saving. my dad is offering to pay for the chemotherapy. because he thinks he will be able to keep me in his life by doing so. am i a bad person if i accepted his financial help and then cut him off all over again right after? is that morally wrong? would i be the ah? im learning how to live life at 29 years old for the very first time and barely making it. i was never taught financial literacy or how to manage my money because my dad did everything for me. and didnt let me take charge of my own life. i never knew how to cook or do anything. they took my life away from me because they wanted me to live with them forever. i need this financial help to save my very best friend but i also dont want to do something that would make me a horrible person. i could technically afford his chemo but it would pretty much make me have 0 savings. so.... wibta to take his money and then run? i also considered telling him that id only accept the money if he knew it was no strings attached and that he has to be fully aware that i am not letting him buy a relationship with me.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 01:35:42 UTC,0,1,0.5,,,0,0
1j2zba1,who holds the leash?,its been a wonderful year and half with my handsome fiancé who seems to love me way too much. over protecting sometimes and free spirit. a boyfriend that became a lover and a possible future husband. perhaps!! two weeks ago i asked him what was his fetishes so i could plan a nice surprise party for him. and his answer was i would love to see you wearing a strapon. i was shocked and didnt know how to react. should i assume he just want to see me wearing it or he expect me to perform on him also? wont be able to accept the truth if this comes in our way.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 01:33:07 UTC,0,4,0.33,,,0,0
