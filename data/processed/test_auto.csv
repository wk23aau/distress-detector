1j6gkb7,obsessed with my best friends pornstar girlfriend.,im still trying to wrap my head around the fact that my friend from high school is dating a pornstar. i mean ive known him for years and weve been through thick and thin together. but when i stumbled upon her videos my mind was blown. i couldnt believe what i was seeing. shes doing some extremely hardcore stuff im talking multiple giant cock gangbangs and her body is just... wow. she has a gigantic ass that seems to be the center of attention in almost every scene. at first i felt a mix of emotions shock curiosity and a little bit of jealousy i wont lie. ive always thought of my friend as a bit of a shy guy so its hard to imagine him with someone whos so... outgoing. but as i watched more of her videos i started to feel a twinge of concern. i mean this is a whole different world that im not familiar with and i worry about my friend getting hurt or caught up in something thats not good for him. but at the same time i have to admit that im also kind of fascinated. ive never seen anything like this before and its like my eyes are glued to the screen. i feel like im getting a glimpse into a secret world that most people dont know about and its both thrilling and terrifying. i dont know how to process all of this to be honest. part of me wants to talk to my friend about it to ask him if hes okay and if he knows what hes getting himself into. but another part of me is afraid of judgment of being seen as a hypocrite or a voyeur. i mean who am i to judge what hes doing or who hes dating? all i know is that my mind is reeling and i dont know how to reconcile my feelings about this. i guess all i can do is wait and see how things play out and hope that my friend knows what hes doing.,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 12:54:39 UTC,0,142,0.48,0,obsessed with my best friends pornstar girlfriend. im still trying to wrap my head around the fact that my friend from high school is dating a pornstar. i mean ive known him for years and weve been through thick and thin together. but when i stumbled upon her videos my mind was blown. i couldnt believe what i was seeing. shes doing some extremely hardcore stuff im talking multiple giant cock gangbangs and her body is just... wow. she has a gigantic ass that seems to be the center of attention in almost every scene. at first i felt a mix of emotions shock curiosity and a little bit of jealousy i wont lie. ive always thought of my friend as a bit of a shy guy so its hard to imagine him with someone whos so... outgoing. but as i watched more of her videos i started to feel a twinge of concern. i mean this is a whole different world that im not familiar with and i worry about my friend getting hurt or caught up in something thats not good for him. but at the same time i have to admit that im also kind of fascinated. ive never seen anything like this before and its like my eyes are glued to the screen. i feel like im getting a glimpse into a secret world that most people dont know about and its both thrilling and terrifying. i dont know how to process all of this to be honest. part of me wants to talk to my friend about it to ask him if hes okay and if he knows what hes getting himself into. but another part of me is afraid of judgment of being seen as a hypocrite or a voyeur. i mean who am i to judge what hes doing or who hes dating? all i know is that my mind is reeling and i dont know how to reconcile my feelings about this. i guess all i can do is wait and see how things play out and hope that my friend knows what hes doing.,0,0

1j6pyo0,i witnessed domestic violence and didnt do anything about it,i was walking home from school this was the 90s so we were all just walking around freely for miles and passed by the same neighborhoods i always passed. there was this one small house on the left side of the road and coming up on it i could hear splitting noises like someone was being hit but i think i couldnt believe it until i actually got close enough. there was this guy 20s maybe both of them standing over his wife or girlfriend on the front lawn she was lying down on her side and had her arm stretched out. then as i walked by slowly unable to stop for some reason he started beating and slapping her and grabbing her by the hair and yanking her towards the house. he also kicked her multiple times. i think he might have called her alicia. but the eerie thing was that she was surprisingly quiet about it not like crazy screaming but just like please stop! you would think shed be screaming and crying out for help or something. i remember that i was just walking in horror the guy didnt seem to notice me or if he did he didnt care. i couldnt stop and i couldnt stop looking at them. i think i was trying to figure out what street i was on but i had never thought to memorize the alley way streets so i didnt know. the whole scene moved in slow motion but i still remember the entire beating the sounds the sounds of grass scraping the shape of his hands. just broad daylight at 3pm on a weekday front lawn no one else on the street but them and me springtime. i ran home in tears and told my mom who just told me not to get involved. when i tried to tell her that i think he was going to kill her she asked me what street and address this happened because if we report it ill have to know all these things. i had no idea so again she told me to mind my own business. i was 10 or so when this happened and im in my 30s now. i still have the exact same fantasy memory of having gone back in time and instead of walking away and running away from the scene i get in between them and save her somehow. if not save but at least make such a fuss that someone calls the cops. its always the same thing that i dont care if i get hurt in the process i would have done the brave thing. instead of what i actually did... just run away in literal horror. i feel so haunted by this scene. i dont think ill ever forget it for the rest of my life honestly.,content warning violencedeath,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 20:19:25 UTC,10,10,0.86,0,i witnessed domestic violence and didnt do anything about it content warning violencedeath i was walking home from school this was the 90s so we were all just walking around freely for miles and passed by the same neighborhoods i always passed. there was this one small house on the left side of the road and coming up on it i could hear splitting noises like someone was being hit but i think i couldnt believe it until i actually got close enough. there was this guy 20s maybe both of them standing over his wife or girlfriend on the front lawn she was lying down on her side and had her arm stretched out. then as i walked by slowly unable to stop for some reason he started beating and slapping her and grabbing her by the hair and yanking her towards the house. he also kicked her multiple times. i think he might have called her alicia. but the eerie thing was that she was surprisingly quiet about it not like crazy screaming but just like please stop! you would think shed be screaming and crying out for help or something. i remember that i was just walking in horror the guy didnt seem to notice me or if he did he didnt care. i couldnt stop and i couldnt stop looking at them. i think i was trying to figure out what street i was on but i had never thought to memorize the alley way streets so i didnt know. the whole scene moved in slow motion but i still remember the entire beating the sounds the sounds of grass scraping the shape of his hands. just broad daylight at 3pm on a weekday front lawn no one else on the street but them and me springtime. i ran home in tears and told my mom who just told me not to get involved. when i tried to tell her that i think he was going to kill her she asked me what street and address this happened because if we report it ill have to know all these things. i had no idea so again she told me to mind my own business. i was 10 or so when this happened and im in my 30s now. i still have the exact same fantasy memory of having gone back in time and instead of walking away and running away from the scene i get in between them and save her somehow. if not save but at least make such a fuss that someone calls the cops. its always the same thing that i dont care if i get hurt in the process i would have done the brave thing. instead of what i actually did... just run away in literal horror. i feel so haunted by this scene. i dont think ill ever forget it for the rest of my life honestly.,0,1

1j5jc5t,im almost 22 and ive never been on a date,like the title says ive never been on a date. women have expressed interest in me ive had past relationships but they were all long distance. which means ive never gotten to take a woman out for dinner or coffee. heres the kicker tho every time i tell someone that ive never been on a date i get a variation of no way or youre lying or how?. getting these types of reactions means that i am good looking to an extent i guess but it hasnt translated to any dates. i will admit tho i am a late bloomer i was bullied mercilessly as a child was fat then skinny and now im in the middle which is nice. i know i need to put myself out there more but every time i do so i get burned rather quickly in spectacular fashion i may add. im also afraid of rejection which doesnt help. my luck isnt the best either and considering how unavailable people in my city are i guess it makes sense. i just feel so far behind my peers i feel weird. i get everyone has their own timeline but at the same time when most people your age are in committed relationships or going out on dates its hard not to feel unlovedunwanted in addition to feeling like youre behind. i also wonder if i should ever tell a woman this when not if the day comes? will she be turned off? will she be weirded out and think to herself whats wrong with this guy? how has he never been on a date? thank you for reading and take care.,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 09:05:42 UTC,2,3,1.0,0,im almost 22 and ive never been on a date like the title says ive never been on a date. women have expressed interest in me ive had past relationships but they were all long distance. which means ive never gotten to take a woman out for dinner or coffee. heres the kicker tho every time i tell someone that ive never been on a date i get a variation of no way or youre lying or how?. getting these types of reactions means that i am good looking to an extent i guess but it hasnt translated to any dates. i will admit tho i am a late bloomer i was bullied mercilessly as a child was fat then skinny and now im in the middle which is nice. i know i need to put myself out there more but every time i do so i get burned rather quickly in spectacular fashion i may add. im also afraid of rejection which doesnt help. my luck isnt the best either and considering how unavailable people in my city are i guess it makes sense. i just feel so far behind my peers i feel weird. i get everyone has their own timeline but at the same time when most people your age are in committed relationships or going out on dates its hard not to feel unlovedunwanted in addition to feeling like youre behind. i also wonder if i should ever tell a woman this when not if the day comes? will she be turned off? will she be weirded out and think to herself whats wrong with this guy? how has he never been on a date? thank you for reading and take care.,0,1

1j8jqqb,parents divorce when i was young led me to struggle with intimacy and accepting love,i feel like i cant accept love. i cant form connections with anyone and even if i could i wouldnt be able to accept love from them. when someone puts me on a pedestal like family members i feel so uncomfortable. when they are happy that i graduated college i feel uncomfortable. these things ive achieved mean nothing to me. if i feel like a connection might be made i feel awful inside and want to pull back. my parents divorced when i was 5 but even before that their relationship was just a series of dramatic situations the kind youd read in a depressing novel. nothing bad happened to me personally but a child shouldnt have to be exposed to that much darkness. i was too young to understand everything but i still felt it. the tension the instability. it was like i was watching a storm i couldnt stop. but back then i told myself i didnt care. theyre stupid. none of this matters. i dont care about them or anything. that was my mindset. i didnt feel anything. at least i thought i didnt. but now looking back i see how much it actually affected me. me thinking i didnt care was just a defense mechanism a way to protect myself. after the divorce i lived with my mom and her boyfriend until i was 15. when she moved far away she left me with my grandparents. a year later she had a child with some guy i dont even know. my dad has his own family four kids all around 11 years old. hes lived with them way longer than he ever lived with me. thats his real life now not the one with me. i was just the test subject the first attempt. they were immature and not ready and i had to figure out everything on my own. i missed out on emotional development and i battle with this every day. i feel like unconditional love doesnt exist. i cant even comprehend it. ive seen my mom and dad maybe once a year since i was 15. even before that it was rare. how could someone like that grow up to understand emotions like everyone else? how could i be normal? and its at the point where i genuinely feel uncomfortable when i have to meet with them. i just feel weird inside being near my parents gives me a weird physical and psychological reaction. like i just dont want to be near them. the only family member who even tries to show me love sometimes is my grandma. but even then it makes me uncomfortable. really uncomfortable. if anyone tries to show me even a little bit of care i physically feel weird inside like something is deeply wrong. its not just discomfort its like my body and brain reject it. i dont know how to explain it but i feel this awful sensation like i need to escape. like i genuinely in those moments want to be left alone. like genuinely. a lot of the times i feel like i want love unconditional love from someone from who i can trust its unconditional not family. but even if i somehow got it i know i wouldnt be able to accept it. my mind pushes it away. my body fights it. and thats the most frustrating part wanting something so badly but being incapable of holding onto it. it just makes me feel more alone. i dont see any other family members much at all. i do live with my grandparents but my grandpa is emotionally unstable and its hard to connect with him. every single one of my family members is messed up in a different way each their own kind of broken. ive become really good at reading people but it doesnt matter much since when it comes to using that knowledge i freeze up and blank out. and when i do try to interact it never goes right. i think in a logical way. thats how ive survived. no one cared for me so i had to figure everything out on my own. when someone has a problem i immediately see the logical reason for it and the solution. so i say it. thats how ive always handled things fix the problem and move on. but when i do this with my family members they get mad. they say im cold emotionless that i dont care. but this is how they made me. they left me to figure out life alone and now they hate that i see things this way? i dont mean to be cruel. i mean well. but instead of hearing the truth they just want someone to sit there and feel sorry for them. i dont get it. no one ever felt sorry for me. coping with a problem instead of fixing it only makes things worse. why would i encourage that? ive also never really connected with another human being. there have been some rare friends here and there but even that was never deep. it always felt surfacelevel maybe slightly deeper but eh.. and if were talking romantically ive never experienced any of that. im 23 now and the idea of love relationships or even just simple emotional connection with someone feels like something that exists in another world one i dont belong to. its like theres an invisible wall between me and everyone else and i dont know how to break through it.,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-11 05:34:28 UTC,2,0,0.67,0,parents divorce when i was young led me to struggle with intimacy and accepting love i feel like i cant accept love. i cant form connections with anyone and even if i could i wouldnt be able to accept love from them. when someone puts me on a pedestal like family members i feel so uncomfortable. when they are happy that i graduated college i feel uncomfortable. these things ive achieved mean nothing to me. if i feel like a connection might be made i feel awful inside and want to pull back. my parents divorced when i was 5 but even before that their relationship was just a series of dramatic situations the kind youd read in a depressing novel. nothing bad happened to me personally but a child shouldnt have to be exposed to that much darkness. i was too young to understand everything but i still felt it. the tension the instability. it was like i was watching a storm i couldnt stop. but back then i told myself i didnt care. theyre stupid. none of this matters. i dont care about them or anything. that was my mindset. i didnt feel anything. at least i thought i didnt. but now looking back i see how much it actually affected me. me thinking i didnt care was just a defense mechanism a way to protect myself. after the divorce i lived with my mom and her boyfriend until i was 15. when she moved far away she left me with my grandparents. a year later she had a child with some guy i dont even know. my dad has his own family four kids all around 11 years old. hes lived with them way longer than he ever lived with me. thats his real life now not the one with me. i was just the test subject the first attempt. they were immature and not ready and i had to figure out everything on my own. i missed out on emotional development and i battle with this every day. i feel like unconditional love doesnt exist. i cant even comprehend it. ive seen my mom and dad maybe once a year since i was 15. even before that it was rare. how could someone like that grow up to understand emotions like everyone else? how could i be normal? and its at the point where i genuinely feel uncomfortable when i have to meet with them. i just feel weird inside being near my parents gives me a weird physical and psychological reaction. like i just dont want to be near them. the only family member who even tries to show me love sometimes is my grandma. but even then it makes me uncomfortable. really uncomfortable. if anyone tries to show me even a little bit of care i physically feel weird inside like something is deeply wrong. its not just discomfort its like my body and brain reject it. i dont know how to explain it but i feel this awful sensation like i need to escape. like i genuinely in those moments want to be left alone. like genuinely. a lot of the times i feel like i want love unconditional love from someone from who i can trust its unconditional not family. but even if i somehow got it i know i wouldnt be able to accept it. my mind pushes it away. my body fights it. and thats the most frustrating part wanting something so badly but being incapable of holding onto it. it just makes me feel more alone. i dont see any other family members much at all. i do live with my grandparents but my grandpa is emotionally unstable and its hard to connect with him. every single one of my family members is messed up in a different way each their own kind of broken. ive become really good at reading people but it doesnt matter much since when it comes to using that knowledge i freeze up and blank out. and when i do try to interact it never goes right. i think in a logical way. thats how ive survived. no one cared for me so i had to figure everything out on my own. when someone has a problem i immediately see the logical reason for it and the solution. so i say it. thats how ive always handled things fix the problem and move on. but when i do this with my family members they get mad. they say im cold emotionless that i dont care. but this is how they made me. they left me to figure out life alone and now they hate that i see things this way?

asking friends and most of them tell me it was dumb and a bit disrespectful but not cheating that our love must go above this mistake. for her friends and family all tell her im disgusting its unforgivable and she told me you cant repair a broken glass... she never forgave cheating and wont. she is now ghosting me blocked me everywhere because i have been spamming her to talk to me at least. i didnt realised at that time it was cheating and i feel miserable. ive been sleeping for weeks ive had found a job that i left the day after she broke with me i even booked a flight and then canceled it losing money in the process. its been one weeks and i desperately need her help she was the one goal of my life the only one ive ever been able to love again i feel like killing myself

1j6snyp,i am so close to unleashing on my elderly mother.,im a woman in my 60s who for the bulk of my adult life has been able to keep and cultivate good relationships with friends family and coworkers. i have suffered off and on with depression and anxiety that i felt was bad enough to seek treatment for since my mid 40s. i had no shame in admitting this as it was a difficult time for me given perimenopause a stressful job kids heading off to college etc. things really began unraveling for me about a year ago. i had gained a bunch of weight felt like crap was facing some unexpected backlash from my two adult kids whom i had raised alone and were each facing their own separate personal crises simultaneously was helping my widowed aging mother navigate life alone and a second new and stronger wave of ideology was evolving. i started therapy for the first time in my life and leaned heavily into journaling out my feelings as i have a love of writing and my therapist felt it would be helpful for me. i dove right in to a shadow work journal with writing prompts that ask you to relate negative thoughts and feelings you are having now to your childhood in order to heal your inner child. i have written at length on my memories from early childhood and nothing came forward that i hadnt pondered before so no big revelations this time except for my anger. after a year of processing these events poking at my anger examining every piece of it through the lens of this tired and wounded old woman and having the entire world bursting into flames exponentially more every day i am at my breaking point. in the past year i have lost my 3 friends to the above mentioned ideology then most of my family and now because i am so sad and really suffering from the effects of anger about not only the abuse and neglect i experienced in my past but the trauma of the problems my entire continent is facing ive got my mother in my face telling me she doesnt like how it makes her feel that consequences are happening as a result of her actions. nobody is blaming her for anything merely mentioning they are losing their job. or that they are struggling mentally. or that theyre boycotting hyper consumerism. or that theyre scared. or that they feel compelled now to join this movement or become antiwhatever to make a statement and support people whove been hurt. she doesnt like feeling that feeling that comes up when she has to wonder if people actually know her leanings and maybe even think her actions are causing harm to them. its her own thought process guilting her and outing her at the same time. its so hard telling this without using certain words that are crucial to the story but hopefully ive avoided the flags that will get this story banned. now i find myself on the verge of lashing out at my 84 year old mother the next time she berates me i see it coming because i dont know if ill be able to bite my tongue. i carried for 60 years the memory of her attempted suicide in front of me as a 3 year old where just before losing consciousness instructed me how to use a telephone to call for help. she doesnt think i remember. i protected my mother from her own shame of her daughter carrying this secret knowledge all her life while enduring beatings from her 2nd husband repeated emotional betrayals from her being called a slut every day of my teen life. i was shamed mercilessly for my own emotional problems growing up and was told im not good enough constantly. my own suicidal thoughts at 13 were claimed by her as embarrassing and would make her look bad. i was never allowed to feel my anger and it caused me to make some really poor choices regarding relationships in my life. well that rage has come to life and i think if i express it the way it deserved to be expressed all along it might kill her.,content warning suicideself harm,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 22:23:31 UTC,1,4,0.67,0,i am so close to unleashing on my elderly

1j8zwps,growing up with 7 siblings in a low middle class family has really shaped me,well when i was under the age of 6 i had 5 siblings. the two came after i turned 10. i didnt play with them at all because by the time the last two were of playing age i was already a teen. but my mom always made sure that we behaved in public. whether it would be by her pulling us to the side by the ear and threatening an ass whooping or to leave us at home it worked. we would walk single file behind her sit at restaurant tables and chat quietly with each other never raising our voices. we ended up homeless for a year or two when i was young so we were put in one small room. we were made to clean the house and learn chores so we could help the people we were staying with. when my mom was able to find a house she said it was always hard because renters always thought that many kids wouldnt be worth a tenant. so anytime we moved we would clean the house spotless. we moved a lot. we also would clean spotless whenever the land lord was visiting. my mom knew how it looked to have so many kids behind her especially when her husband wasnt around because of work so it was only him. she thought people saw her as a poor ghetto woman with an army of kids who she couldnt control so she made damn sure we wouldnt be like that. but like why have that many kids in the first place.... or continue having them even after experiencing homelessness? we were back and forth between many of friends and family after my parents divorced. and we moved 13 times before i was in high school. yet she still had kids but thats another topic for another day.... that basically taught all of us to keep up with appearances. my mom was also incredibly mentally physically and emotionally abusive so there was always fear in my house. it was my siblings and i against her so we were all close and together. but then we started to turn on each other as we got older probably from my older siblings maturing and growing bitter and angry at the abuse. im going through that phase now. either way it led me to become emotionally detached from my siblings. there was always just so many things going on it was hard to keep up. once my older siblings moved out i was the oldest in the house and it became my responsibility to cook and clean for everyone. i got tired of it and moved out a month after graduating. i got sick of taking care of others when i was a child so i just left. another step i took to separate myself from my family. sure having big families are fun. its never quiet immediate family reunions are crazy and loud my mom also had 7 siblings so imagine how big they got you get to grow up with multiple best friends but when you have an emotionally and mentally unstable mother with an enabler husband its terrible. never a peaceful moment especially not with the homelessness or having to share rooms with siblings when we got our own houses constant arguments because nobody knew how to regulate themselves and constant abuse. it drove my older sister insane. i havent seen her in years. its driving me insane now. i never had room to be myself not until after i turned 18. i never got to properly develop so now i have mental issues. and chronic illnesses. growing up with 7 siblings was hard. my moms attention was only focused on the younger one. yeah we would have fun times and a lot of them but that doesnt overshadow the abuse or anything else. i always get jealous of people who are close to their siblings. i can never have that not anymore. i can barely form and maintain friendships much less familial relationships. not to mention how people react whenever i tell them how many siblings i have. ive had to fight few people who talked crap about my mom being a whore. my siblings have had to fight other kids for the same thing. nothing says bonding time more than beating the kid who made fun of your younger sibling. classy?

1j5fth6,i hate my parents for not letting me have surgery for pectus carinatum.,first of all i want to apologize for my poor english since im doing this through a translator. im a 19yearold guy who has had pectus carinatum his whole life. it has brought me a lot of teasing and stares and even though i have the mildest case i have a small bananashaped protrusion on my sternum. ive wanted surgery since i was 14. as a first option they wanted me to wear a compression brace for a year which is complete nonsense. i knew it wouldnt fix what i have and even the doctor said so. i fought for years to get surgery until one day they took me to the subcapital to see a doctor. the doctor told me it was a very mild case and that the surgery was very simple they would cut two cartilages push the sternum inward and that was it. this happened in june 2024. i was very excited about the idea of having a normal chest. my experience with this condition has been horrible and has caused me a lot of insecurity. every time i wear a tshirt the lump is noticeable making me look much fatter than i actually am. ive been training for five years and its horrible to see how i cant make progress in my chest because this damn protrusion sticks outits all ive seen in the mirror for five years. going back to what i was saying my parents postponed the surgery until 2025. i got angry with them and gave them an ultimatum either i get the surgery or i leave the house. i want to clarify that this was the only thing i was asking for the only thing i wanted. im the youngest child and i have a 29yearold sister who is studying her second degree because she realized that the first one wouldnt get her a job. my father has always helped her with her apartment and university expenses. ive always known she was the favorite and i wasnt asking for muchjust this surgery. today we went to see a doctor in our city and instead of agreeing with the previous doctor he said they would have to break my abdomen cut all the cartilage and insert a prosthesis. i suspect this was all planned because my father is a doctor and i have a feeling he talked to this doctor to make me change my mind or to have an excuse to say no. i walked home because i was so angry at them. ive been fighting for this surgery for about five years and they found the perfect excuse to deny it. tonight at dinner i ate in my room. im so tired of themthey are the most vile cruel and arbitrary people i know. i hate them for making me go through my entire adolescence and now my adulthood with this lump in my chest just because they dont want me to have surgery. they have no idea how much ive suffered or how much i wish with all my heart to die. i wish i could just wake up one day and no longer exist in this horrible world. i hate the parents i got and i hate my sister for being the favorite. if i could id take a gun and blow my brains out so i wouldnt have to endure this anymorebut i will make them pay. as soon as i get a job ill

1j4hyop,im a rent man and i think i have a crush on my client,warning slightly sexually explicit. probably nsfw. i dont really know how to say any of this but i know i need to write it somewhere. ill probably delete this at some point after. im 27m and im a rent man. another term for what i do is male escort. but i live in a small sleepy town and we just dont call ourselves escorts. i decided to get into this because i needed some money to help me finish my degree. im also in good shape so i thought it would be an easy side hustle. i didnt dont have a partner and i havent been interested in dating. business is generally very slow. when i first started i only had 1 client who i would visit every week. after that she moved away and i had two more clients that i would see periodically. it was always a very clinical and mechanical experience get in do what needs to be done get out. things were quiet for about a year and a half. i wasnt really providing services anymore. but a few months ago i got a message on my profile from a lady who was interested in my services. she was just reaching out asking how it works. we spoke for a bit and we decided to meet up. my services are customisable and she selected a variation of the boyfriend experience. i went to her house and i was... surprised? she had a really nice place. in a rich neighbourhood. im sure this might not be out of the ordinary for other male escorts but my previous clients werent situated in rich neighbourhoods. i didnt grow up rich. she was very welcoming. she was a few years older than me. she seemed to have a successful career. we sat in the living room and just talked. she told me that shes had sex for her whole adult life and shes enjoyed it for the most part. but shes had some kind of sexual awakening recently and shes looking for someone to explore this with. she said she doesnt even care if we didnt have sex that night. she wanted to talk to make sure that we would be a good fit for what she had in mind and if i was okay with it. that was also a first for me. my previous clients didnt really care what i was okay with. anyway. lots has happened since then. i see her maybe once every two weeks. and its always an incredible experience. i cant explain it. sometimes we have sex. sometimes we dont. sometimes we eat pizza and watch movies sometimes we drink and have sex. its so passionate. sometimes its primal. sometimes its lazy and intense. its not the mechanical sex that im used to. she truly turns me on. she likes it when im satisfied. sometimes we just talk and nothing else. ive opened up to her about my life. she pays me every time. ive even started insisting that she doesnt need to. but she believes in me and my future and wants to support me in finishing my degree. the problem is i no longer see this as a professional relationship. i really like her. and she seems to really care about me as a person. we know so much about each other but i feel so weird to say that were friends... she pays me for my time so are we really friends?

she had a really nice place. in a rich neighbourhood. im sure this might not be out of the ordinary for other male escorts but my previous clients werent situated in rich neighbourhoods. i didnt grow up rich. she was very welcoming. she was a few years older than me. she seemed to have a successful career. we sat in the living room and just talked. she told me that shes had sex for her whole adult life and shes enjoyed it for the most part. but shes had some kind of sexual awakening recently and shes looking for someone to explore this with. she said she doesnt even care if we didnt have sex that night. she wanted to talk to make sure that we would be a good fit for what she had in mind and if i was okay with it. that was also a first for me. my previous clients didnt really care what i was okay with. anyway. lots has happened since then. i see her maybe once every two weeks. and its always an incredible experience. i cant explain it. sometimes we have sex. sometimes we dont. sometimes we eat pizza and watch movies sometimes we drink and have sex. its so passionate. sometimes its primal. sometimes its lazy and intense. its not the mechanical sex that im used to. she truly turns me on. she likes it when im satisfied. sometimes we just talk and nothing else. ive opened up to her about my life. she pays me every time. ive even started insisting that she doesnt need to. but she believes in me and my future and wants to support me in finishing my degree. the problem is i no longer see this as a professional relationship. i really like her. and she seems to really care about me as a person. we know so much about each other but i feel so weird to say that were friends... she pays me for my time so are we really friends? and sometimes i let my mind wander... what if we were more? shes quite an incredible woman. and weve had many deep conversations. shes been through a lot. one of the topics that came up was her previous relationships. because i was wondering why she would approach a service instead of exploring this with perhaps a romantic partner?

i get all excited about pakistani food and ask him to tell me what are his favorite dishes from his hometown. then i proceed to describe in excruciating detail all my favorite dishes from my country. recipes mouthwatering ingredients the whole thing. by the time i realized that he must be starving it was 4pm after all i was already rambling for about an hour already. i apologized immediately and he was super nice about it but this doesnt make me less of an idiot. so after this great success fast forward to a few hours later i am on the plane seated near the back squeezed into the middle seat. we are about to depart the plane is on the move and i realize that my seatbelt gets loose without me lifting the little lever thingy. i ask for assistance and the flight attendant tells me dont worry the seatbelt will work later. so i ask him how is this possible...? thinking that i really dont do well during flights that i used to get panic attacks that i managed to control after a lot of therapy and ltltomg i am about to fly and if something happens i will break my neck crashing on the roof of the plane!!!gtgt. he sighs then tells me he will replace the belt and goes away. comes back after a minute or so and he says that the plane needs to depart and that there is no time they will need to move me. there is quickly some commotion all the flight attendants make some signals to each other and they find me a free row at the front. so i thank them profoundly i apologize for the last minute chaos that i caused and go to my new princess seat but the window with extra legroom that i didnt pay for. i sit down i put the seatbelt on.... and i realize that the new seatbelt also gets loose if i push the metal thing! i test it out a little bit and then it hits me. if i just pull the belt it stays locked. if i put my finger under the metallic thing and push slightly it gets loose. so that means that i did all this.... for no reason. i close my eyes and start thinking that it cant be that im so inconsiderate today. and how embarrassing. meanwhile im doing my breathing exercises trying to relax. there is turbulence today and my mouth is dry i cant handle it anymore. i open my eyes and soon as i see the flight attendant handing out chocolates i ask for some water. she says i will check if we still have and im thinking oh wow how strange! it cant be that they dont have at least one bottle. quickly she comes back hads me one and finally i drink some water. finally i can try to relax im thinking. then i realize must have dropped the chocolate she gave me. i start looking around and then i look to my left and i freeze. on the seat next to me there is yet another water bottle that the flight attendants must have left for me while i was trying to breathe iiiiin hooooold exhaaale the plane is safe the plane is safe the plane is safe. so thats it. this is another successful day. i am sitting here patiently writing this to distract myself and i think i will post as soon as we land. thank you for listening to my rambling dear reader lt3,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 22:03:29 UTC,0,9,0.5,0,today i was that karen that people vent about when theyre just trying to do their job and i feel so embarrassed i really need to take this off my chest because today i fcked up multiple times and i feel extremely embarrassed. maybe i am in my head but im definitely somewhere in the wrong. ok so my day started fine with me taking a ride to the airport. the driver a super nice guy from pakistan shared with me that he is fasting and he will only get to have water or something to eat after 6pm. so what do i do?

1j92y8w,i hope my ex never finds a moment of peace,tw mention of drg use. i spent years from 18 to 31 almost my entire adult life being manipulated and abused by my ex. who i knew was an alcoholic but i didnt realize was a drug addict. meth and cocaine apparently boy that was a doozy when i figured that out. so naive on my part. until therapy. therapy was great for me. i didnt even know i was being abused until my therapist was basically like hey. none of this is normal. this is not okay. even though my family and friends were worried for me and tried to get me to see it i continued to stand up for my ex and cover for them until therapy. wherever you are therapist jas you helped me start to save myself. when i decided i wanted out all i wanted were my things and my dogs. no smear campaign. no fights. just my items and to disappear into the void. things did not work out like that actually. they didnt allow me to take most of my things most of which were given to me by my great grandma and grandma. i left with two duffel bags and a tote. on the day they were nice enough to let me get more of my things all i ended up with was my great grandmas table which was a win to me and some lovely boxes of actual garbage can trash that they put together for me. including but not limited to old food wrappers contents from multiple ash trays a sex toy id never seen and most of my photos ripped into tiny shreds. they would not let me have my dogs. like a buffoon for weeks i attempted to get my dogs back. they couldnt afford to feed the dogs much less themselves so i offered to buy the food cover upcoming vet bills allow visits. they kept my dogs. i never got to see them again. i never even got to go inside the home and say goodbye. its been a few years but i found out recently that my ex lost their house. and then another. so satisfying for me to hear honestly but what threw me off the most was when i found out what happened to my dogs thanks to one of my exes family members. one ran away. this particular dog never left the yard. never left my side. she was a very good girl. in the 10 years id had her not once was she ever lost or missing. one we dont know what happened. so a dog just disappeared into thin air. got it. and the last one... was neglected and malnourished and treated so badly he went blind. he was so bad that by the time one of my exes friends took him to the vet there was nothing they could do but put him down. the family member said it wasnt two weeks later and the ex got a new dog. i was devastated. that particular family member no longer has dealings of any kind with my ex but found me to let me know about what happened. i appreciated that even though i was heartbroken. he knew i fought hard for those babies and i would have kept fighting but i couldnt because i ended up getting a well deserved order of protection for a multitude of other reasons. its been a few years. im married and a mom now. i live a very safe comfortable happy life with a man that is extremely good to me. im still working to rewire my brain from the years of chaos and abuse. im still pretty triggered by certain things and i still have nightmares from time to time. but most of all im still grieving my dogs. i wanted to save them. i wanted to fight for them. i wanted them with me. to live happy free lives. i miss them. and i hope they didnt think they did anything wrong when i left. i hope they know i cry everytime their pictures come up on my photo memories. i hope they know i did my best and i never forgot them. i hope they knew i loved them and that i still do. and i hope that my ex never has a moment of peace or fortune or anything close to good for what they did to my dogs. not even what they did to me. but to my innocent sweet loyal amazing

1j65iqy,i got terminated from my volunteer position with no explanation,so i 18f just finished volunteering for the day at my workplace animal sanctuary yesterday when i got a message from my boss to see he sent me a termination letter nothing in the message either just the letter itself and they have ignored me since. also sorry this is a long one i just have a lot of things in my head i need to sort out. so a bit of backstory since i was around 14 ive been dealing with the struggles of depression anxiety and adhd and ended up leaving school in yr10 because of it. took a while to figure out but i ended up going to tafe to complete my cert ii and iii to become a qualified zookeeper as ive always loved animals and cant see myself doing anything else. because of tafe i had to start volunteering to complete the practical component of my course and ended finding this amazing sanctuary to work at. so i ended up starting there in early february 2024 and fell in love with the place and the people. i was originally going once a week but started going twice a week in around november bc i loved it so much and wanted to be there more. they always told me they loved how i would be there consistently every week and i would pride myself on it as it was a big commitment for me as i lived an hour away. the environment there was great honestly i couldnt have asked for it to be any better. the owners always quite involved and prided themselves on this and wanted us to feel more like family rather than a workplace. because of this i became quite close with the people who were on my days and considered them my second family. the owners also lived on site and their kids were always around because of this i became quite close with them as well even buying them small presents for their birthdays and helping them with their homework. i suppose im telling you this so you understand how close i was with them their family and the other volunteers so you can understand how hurt i am by the way theyve handled this situation. even on my bad days they were half the reason id get up in the morning even when i didnt want to drive or talk to people id still show up bc i didnt want to let them down as again i seen them as my second family and greatly valued their opinion. so fast forward back to yesterday it was completely normal. nothing out of the ordinary we were still talking like normal doing all our tasks as normal having lunch together like normal i even got a last minute tour and stayed back to finish it up which brought in a fair bit of money for them. also just a note its a nonprofit all the money from tours goes right back into the sanctuary to care for the animals food and water vet bills etc. so just my little routine afterwards i stop on the way home to go to the bathroom get food etc. so i was checking my phone like normal and seen he sent me an attachment funny thing is i thought he was sending me a dumb reel or something. boy did i have a rude awakening when i read termination letter. so naturally i read through it and start crying because again that day was normal there was not even a hint that something like this was coming. luckily i had one of my friends with me so i didnt do something dumb like driving with so many tears in my eyes i could barely see and probably getting into an accident. in the letter he basically highlighted the fact that he wants to maintain a positive workplace and while he values my input he needs to put the sanctuary first blah blah blah the typical things in a letter that would put the blame on me so he doesnt seem like the bad guy. so one important thing to mention they say this to everyone but from the start they said that theyre the kind of workplace to make sure everyones included and dont like people to form cliques. however i became really close to two people in particular specifically because theyre great friends and have done so much for me. now while i was really close with these two i feel we included everyone when we could. especially since some days at the sanctuary wed be so busy wed barely see each other that day. so wed always go out for lunch however wed always ask everyone if they wanted anything and never ate out always came back to be a part of the whole team. wed all have a break at the same time. now obviously being friends wed hang out after work but again wed ask some people if theyd wanna come if we werent going too far away. and we would call and stuff but i feel its normal for friends to do that. so one thing i could see where they wouldnt have been to happy with this is that we were doing an animal course about 5 hours away. you have to finish the online part first before you go do the practical bit. so one of my friends told the boss that we were going to be doing it he already done it prior and was just driving us and unlike the last time it was done they didnt put it on the group chat or anything for people to say theyre interested. i think they assumed wed tell people that we were doing it and ask if theyd want to come. mind you this was about a month in advance so plenty of time for people to do the online section. i will say this course ends up being quite expensive so some people werent able to do it due to financial reasons anyway. anyways long story short one other person from the sanctuary ended up doing the course btw the course only has 4 spots for the prac part. we had a great time and included him in nearly everything we did he traveled separately to us so was only left out of stuff we did on the way. we even had a game night and everything and really the only people who were left out were the people who couldnt come but wanted to which i dont blame them for. i can only assume that this is the reason they fired us my friend that drove was quitting next week was going to be his last however they messaged him yesterday basically telling him to not come back and my other friend also got a letter similar to mine. again i was completely blindsided by this as yesterday and even the last few weeks were completely normal. no they didnt even try to chat with us saying something like hey this is what we can see is happening and we dont like it can you just try to include the other people more. something like that and i wouldnt have been as devastated. the only other thing it might be is that i would make some pretty crude jokes although i wasnt the only one that would say them and me and my boss would say them to each other and everything were aussie btw its part of our culture i suppose if we dont know you or dont like you well be quite civilpolite to you but if we do like you then youll probably cop it. although i dont think this was the problem bc again it wasnt just me making these jokes. i guess what hurts the most is that i really respected my boss and viewed both of them quite highly. like theyre great people at least i use to think so theyre great parents really community oriented and from what ive heard quite highly regarded in our field. so basically for him to not even have the decency to even send me a message along with the letter it is what hurt the most. so naturally i sent them both a message asking them to give me a call bc for my own peace of mind i really need an explanation. both of them i assume accidentally opened the message and i can see they read it however they both ignored it. so i sent them an email this morning however still waiting on a reply. ive never been through a breakup but i imagine itd be like this except instead of breaking up with one person ive just lost my second family. with no warning no explanation. anyways thanks for listening to me ramble sorry it was so long im just kind of at a loss for now. hopefully ill stop crying and get out of bed soon. thank youse heart_hands tldr i was volunteering at an animal sanctuary when i got a termination letter from my boss with no warning no explanation. i feel like

normal for friends to do that. so one thing i could see where they wouldnt have been to happy with this is that we were doing an animal course about 5 hours away. you have to finish the online part first before you go do the practical bit. so one of my friends told the boss that we were going to be doing it he already done it prior and was just driving us and unlike the last time it was done they didnt put it on the group chat or anything for people to say theyre interested. i think they assumed wed tell people that we were doing it and ask if theyd want to come. mind you this was about a month in advance so plenty of time for people to do the online section. i will say this course ends up being quite expensive so some people werent able to do it due to financial reasons anyway. anyways long story short one other person from the sanctuary ended up doing the course btw the course only has 4 spots for the prac part. we had a great time and included him in nearly everything we did he traveled separately to us so was only left out of stuff we did on the way. we even had a game night and everything and really the only people who were left out were the people who couldnt come but wanted to which i dont blame them for. i can only assume that this is the reason they fired us my friend that drove was quitting next week was going to be his last however they messaged him yesterday basically telling him to not come back and my other friend also got a letter similar to mine. again i was completely blindsided by this as yesterday and even the last few weeks were completely normal. no they didnt even try to chat with us saying something like hey this is what we can see is happening and we dont like it can you just try to include the other people more. something like that and i wouldnt have been as devastated. the only other thing it might be is that i would make some pretty crude jokes although i wasnt the only one that would say them and me and my boss would say them to each other and everything were aussie btw its part of our culture i suppose if we dont know you or dont like you well be quite civilpolite to you but if we do like you then youll probably cop it. although i dont think this was the problem bc again it wasnt just me making these jokes. i guess what hurts the most is that i really respected my boss and viewed both of them quite highly. like theyre great people at least i use to think so theyre great parents really community oriented and from what ive heard quite highly regarded in our field. so basically for him to not even have the decency to even send me a message along with the letter it is what hurt the most. so naturally i sent them both a message asking them to give me a call bc for my own peace of mind i really need an explanation. both of them i assume accidentally opened the message and i can see they read it however they both ignored it. so i sent them an email this morning however still waiting on a reply. ive never been through a breakup but i imagine itd be like this except instead of breaking up with one person ive just lost my second family. with no warning no explanation. anyways thanks for listening to me ramble sorry it was so long im just kind of at a loss for now. hopefully ill stop crying and get out of bed soon. thank youse heart_hands tldr i was volunteering at an animal sanctuary when i got a termination letter from my boss with no warning no explanation. i feel like ive lost my second family.,0,0

heart pining after someone who stopped loving me a long time ago. we met too young. you were depressed from your parents separation and your dads infidelity. i helped you get off antidepressants. you never went to prom so when our university threw a formal dance i asked you to go with me. for your birthday i bought you guitar lessons with your favorite musician and we drove all the way to kentucky so you could take them. during a hurricane in florida once we got under the same poncho and made out while it rained. we went to six countries together and i moved halfway round the world to be with you after we got engaged. you wrote me songs and gave them to me as presents. i never told you this but my biggest regret with you is a small moment that meant so much to me. we were visiting a cave in spain and as we were walking out you wrapped your arm around my waist and said i love you so much. it was one of the happiest moments of my life...and i should have told you how much i loved you back but i was too choked up to speak so i just clung to you. six months later you got bored called me unmysterious and dumped me. id moved halfway around the world with you which meant i had nothing set up when i got home. had to basically start from scratch. even these few years later i still get tearyeyed thinking about it. about you. for a long time i kept hoping youd realize what we had. when your family told you youd have a fun life with her. when your friends said shes the kind of girl you marry. i kept hoping youd realize your mistake. but you didnt. not even when you buttdialed me when you were with your next girlfriend. not even after she dumped you. not after years of me occasionally sending you little checkin texts my way of leaving the door open for you to talk to me if you wanted. you havent married you arent dating. your mom sometimes still talks to mine and gives updates. i heard through our mutual friends that you told them you think about me a lot miss me even. but still you havent reached out. i feel embarrassed now for leaving that door open for so long. even if you came back now its too late. id feel like an afterthought. i deserve better than i was lonely

1j80bit,toxic friend still in my life dont know if i should end it,so this is rantstorytime about a toxic friend who is still in my life and im unable to remove her. lets call her sara. so i met sara in the 1st year of my college through my exroommate lets call her jane jane and sara were in the same class so one day she came to visit janes room where i lived too. she immediately started talking to me very excitedly and telling about herself and asked for my insta acct probably because me and her both are from the same religion jane isnt. so then we started hanging out often all three of us and she also started meeting my other friends from college etc. sara lives with her brother theyre both studying here. fast forward a few months and thats when it started getting unhealthy. she started acting very possessive and would get upset over me hanging out with other friends without inviting her or posting stories etc. she would even get jealous when i went out with jane or posted stories with her she was my roommate ofc we would have fun together and be close. when a few times me and jane have fought she would always come and tell me things like yeah she is like that lets go out etc. instead of trying to reconcile us. i think she enjoyed it when i would have disagreements with my other friends. apart from the possessive nature she is very cheap in money matters. whenever we would go out to eat or have tea or anything she almost never paid. and if she ever did she would ask me to send half of it. she would use this trick where she wouldnt order anything and if i did she would eat from it. and if said to pay she would say that she didnt even order anything or she just tasted my food. if we ever made plans for the movies or any other activity she would beforehand say i dont have any money expecting any of us to say we will cover her and if no one said that and we went without her she gets upset. she then once caused such a big misunderstanding between me and jane that we didnt speak to each other for 6 months and started living separately. we have started talking again now but live alone and not together. jane still doesnt speak to sara and probably wont ever which i think is good for her. she also has this habit where she would just take my stuff. my parents live abroad and they would send me chocolates or some food items available abroad suppose they have sent 2 packets she would just come pick up one and say im taking this. now i am a person who cant say no to someone like this when they ask me for some food item or something i dont know i try but i just cant bring myself to it. she then started asking for my other things too which are not 2 packs or just anything. like she once saw my aloe vera gel and said oh i want it what will you do of it or even my plates and cups hair brush anything she would just say oh i am taking this i have not given any of those to her. i have told her that no i need it but she would still insist it was very tough for me to have those arguments. she once even asked for a gift that was given to me by my fiancé his apple earphones and said oh i need these i said no he gave them to me why would i let you take it and guess what she was upset about it. but she wouldnt stop. there are so many such incidents. one that has stuck with me is when i brought chocolates for her from abroad and i asked her to give me one from the pack and she straight up refused saying they were hers. i was baffled that how could she refuse me chocolates that i brought her??? it was so cheap. so these are all small things and in the past few months some pretty serious and big things she has done which are 1st she absolutely ruined my birthday. so my fiancé lives in another country had planned a celebration at a fancy restaurant with all my friends as a surprise for me. he reached out to jane to help prepare for the surprise as he couldnt manage effectively from so far away. when sara found out that he reached out to jane and not her she got mad and upset about it that why she wasnt asked and also cause she and jane dont speak to each other. she made a fuss about it and on my birthday in the restaurant she sat there making a faces didnt eat anything at all wasnt talking to anyone and also whispering comments to someone either about me or jane. i asked her several times whats wrong and she just said nothings wrong and continued behaving like that. everyone saw that it was affecting my and everyone elses mood so they kept asking her to cheer up but she didnt. she didnt even eat a single bite of the birthday cake also constantly made faces didnt smile for once the entire time and left. the next day i confronted her about it and she said she is sorry and she was upset why she wasnt chosen by me. i said my fiancé planned it all and i didnt know about it but she said i probably knew how could i not know. i told her that she ruined my day and she texted me im so sorry with the hands folded emoji making it a sarcastic mean sorry. 2nd this incident happened a few days ago and has really made me think that i have had my last straw now and this is getting so so toxic. so she had borrowed money from me which she was supposed to return last month. when i asked her for it she said she doesnt have it and sent me a small amount and said she will send me the rest later. i said okay. now a month has passed and im really broke right now and need some money. so i texted her asking her to send me the rest of the money she said to me again that she doesnt have any money. i said why not even i dont have money and i need it please ask your parents to send it or do whtever but please give me my money at least give me half back as i am in need of money right now. but she just said that i dont have money i will give it when i have it. i asked her when will that be and she said 45 months!! thats when my college comes to an end and i will be literally leaving the country thats when she wants to pay me back. its also not a huge amount which she cant arrange out of nowhere she also has had time of several months but is still not returning my money. i argued with her for around half an hour over text asking her to give my money back now as i need it now and not months later. i even gave solution that she can pay me little by little each month at least but she plainly said no i dont have to all of it. i dont know how to get the money now. and cherry on the cake is ever since i asked her the money back she is upset with me. for asking my own money back!!! when i need it!!! she didnt say shes upset but she isnt sending me any reels as she used to stopped reacting to mine doesnt send snaps which all she does when she is upset. i just dont understand where she gets the audacity to be upset here?? i should be the one upset as she is not giving the money back. i feel like this is literally the last straw. theres so many more things she has done but i cant write all of them down here or this will be too long. now i know whoever reads this will ask me why i havent ended the friendship now that is because we have been friends for the past three years and my whole family my fiancé my inlaws they all know her and they ask about her frequently and ask if weve been hanging out and how is she and everything and ill be passing out college in the next three months and after that ill be moving to another country and probably wont see her anymore maybe once in a blue moon in a lot of years but we wont be meeting again i think so. so i just wanted to avoid any drama since the past six months i have been thinking that i should just let it go because its just a few months and i dont want to create the drama and i dont want the fuss of explaining all the family members of why i dont speak to her anymore and all that but i think this is just getting so much out of hand. even now she is still in my life thinking that its just three more months and itll all be done but i dont know anymore if i should end it now or wait. all this time ive been such a good friend even after she has done all of this i continue doing things for her. i continue trying to help her whenever she needs. i lent her the money after she did all that fuss on my birthday. and yet she is like this. this is very very toxic.,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 14:47:34 UTC,2,3,1.0,0,toxic friend still in my life dont know if i should end it so this is rantstorytime about a toxic friend who is still in my life and im unable to remove her. lets call her sara. so i met sara in the 1st year of my college through my exroommate lets call her jane jane and sara were in the same class so one day she came to visit janes room where i lived too. she immediately started talking to me very excitedly and telling about herself and asked for my insta acct probably because me and her both are from the same religion jane isnt. so then we started hanging out often all three of us and she also started meeting my other friends from college etc. sara lives with her brother theyre both studying here. fast forward a few months and thats when it started getting unhealthy. she started acting very possessive and would get upset over me hanging out with other friends without inviting her or posting stories etc. she would even get jealous when i went out with jane or posted stories with her she was my roommate ofc we would have fun together and be close. when a few times me and jane have fought she would always come and tell me things like yeah she is like that lets go out etc. instead of trying to reconcile us. i think she enjoyed it when i would have disagreements with my other friends. apart from the possessive nature she is very cheap in money matters. whenever we would go out to eat or have tea or anything she almost never paid. and if she ever did she would ask me to send half of it. she would use this trick where she wouldnt order anything and if i did she would eat from it. and if said to pay she would say that she didnt even order anything or she just tasted my food. if we ever made plans for the movies or any other activity she would beforehand say i dont have any money expecting any of us to say we will cover her and if no one said that and we went without her she gets upset. she then once caused such a big misunderstanding between me and jane that we didnt speak to each other for 6 months and started living separately. we have started talking again now but live alone and not together. jane still doesnt speak to sara and probably wont ever which i think is good for her. she also has this habit where she would just take my stuff. my parents live abroad and they would send me chocolates or some food items available abroad suppose they have sent 2 packets she would just come pick up one and say im taking this. now i am a person who cant say no to someone like this when they ask me for some food item or something i dont know i try but i just cant bring myself to it. she then started asking for my other things too which are not 2 packs or just anything. like she once saw my aloe vera gel and said oh i want it what will you do of it or even my plates and cups hair brush anything she would just say oh i am taking this i have not given any of those to her. i have told her that no i need it but she would still insist it was very tough for me to have those arguments. she once even asked for a gift that was given to me by my fiancé his apple earphones and said oh i need these i said no he gave them to me why would i let you take it and guess what she was upset about it. but she wouldnt stop. there are so many such incidents. one that has stuck with me is when i brought chocolates for her from abroad and i asked her to give me one from the pack and she straight up refused saying they were hers. i was baffled that how could she refuse me chocolates that i brought her??? it was so cheap. so these are all small things and in the past few months some pretty serious and big things she has done which are 1st she absolutely ruined my birthday. so my fiancé lives in another country had planned a celebration at a fancy restaurant with all my friends as a surprise for me. he reached out to jane to help prepare for the surprise as he couldnt manage effectively from so far away. when sara found out that he reached out to jane and not her she got mad and upset about it that why she wasnt asked and also cause she and jane dont speak to each other. she made a fuss about it and on my birthday in the restaurant she sat there making a faces didnt eat anything at all wasnt talking to anyone and also whispering comments to someone either about me or jane. i asked her several times whats wrong and she just said nothings wrong and continued behaving like that. everyone saw that it was affecting my and everyone elses mood so they kept asking her to cheer up but she didnt. she didnt even eat a single bite of the birthday cake also constantly made faces didnt smile for once the entire time and left. the next day i confronted her about it and she said she is sorry and she was upset why she wasnt chosen by me. i said my fiancé planned it all and i didnt know about it but she said i probably knew how could i not know. i told her that she ruined my day and she texted me im so sorry with the hands folded emoji making it a sarcastic mean sorry. 2nd this incident happened a few days ago and has really made me think that i have had my last straw now and this is getting so so toxic. so she had borrowed money from me which she was supposed to return last month. when i asked her for it she said she doesnt have it and sent me a small amount and said she will send me the rest later. i said okay. now a month has passed and im really broke right now and need some money. so i texted her asking her to send me the rest of the money she said to me again that she doesnt have any money. i said why not even i dont have money and i need it please ask your parents to send it or do whtever but please give me my money at least give me half back as i am in need of money right now. but she just said that i dont have money i will give it when i have it. i asked her when will that be and she said 45 months!! thats when my college comes to an end and i will be literally leaving the country thats when she wants to pay me back. its also not a huge amount which she cant arrange out of nowhere she also has had time of several months but is still not returning my money. i argued with her for around half an hour over text asking her to give my money back now as i need it now and not months later. i even gave solution that she can pay me little by little each month at least but she plainly said no i dont have to all of it. i dont know how to get the money now. and cherry on the cake is ever since i asked her the money back she is upset with me. for asking my own money back!!! when i need it!!! she didnt

1j789eo,i think im falling out of love,im so lost. i know relationships are never easy but im just starting to think that maybe we didnt meet at the right time in each others lives. i have so many insecurities in regards to being included in outings. her communication is really lacking and forgoes telling me how she feels about things. our most recent disagreement has been in regards to travel we cant come to a compromise and find a balance between her travelling with her and also my friends with time for us to spend together. we promised wed travel with each other after this year fell through for similar reasons. instead i had to leave it at she will go with her friends instead of me. im hurt because it feels like she doesnt want to go away with me but shes hurt because i think that. shes promised to do better and apologised so many times for not communicating. i feel like our bad times are more frequent than the good. i want to push through because she is so loving caring and sweet but ive got a massive piece missing rn and if i explain this to her she breaks down and stops talking entirely. im stuck. i know i am so far from a bastion of perfection in this relationship but i just cant help but be frustrated and saddened by this. today i was sick and quite feverish so i spent a while thinking back to a past relationship. while im absolutely over that girl i just couldnt help but reminisce about how that short relationship three years ago made me feel. i do hold it in very high regard because i was in the wilderness prior to it alone and totally confused about my place in the world before she showed me so im now quite nostalgic about what she was for me especially now my needs just arent being met. that girl and i met in the wrong time and the wrong circumstances to last but we ended very amicably. i know its horrible and so unfair for my gf as well as the previous girl to keep thinking like this. i love spontaneity and random intimate things and i have told her this but never does she ask me to come over for a karaoke drive at midnight with the windows down. never does she say she wants to spend the night with me somewhere random. i sometimes ask but its usually a no. i feel like im right back to where i was preprevious relationship and im lost and so sad. i want to make things better and i know constantly comparing my last relationship to my current is really poor. i know im focusing on the negative things she does. i know i could be better but im so fucking demotivated bc she just doesnt talk and we just dont go out to do things. then a rift forms and i have to be the one to try and pull it back and then shes extremely upset and scared that i might leave her or she thinks shes a bad person. i cant say how i really feel because of that. it takes days for our usual fun side to return and then theres a couple weeks of good. rinse and repeat. longterm relationships are loads of battles to stay in love. some are so much harder but i do love her. though is it worth losing parts of who you are when im this age?

1j8hble,secret admirer gone wronggrinning_face,a few months ago i received a snapchat request from someone i didnt recognize. they wouldnt tell me who they were right away only that they had feelings for me and talked about how they admired me . the first message they ever sent me was creepy it was i know you see me just like i see you but im not ready to step out of the shadows yet. neither are you i know youre a private person but theres something about you that pulls me in every time even from a distance. im someone you know but i cant say who i am yet. just know that i see you in a way thats deeper than you might imagine bye lm blocking you at first i didnt think much of it. i thought maybe it was just some random person who had seen my profile and was curious. but as the messages continued they started to feel... strange. the person was saying things that made me uncomfortablethings that made it clear they were watching me. they would mention things from my life that only someone who really knew me would know and it started to feel like i was being stalked. and to be clear im 19 and i never had a boyfriend never had my first kiss was homeschooled and moved into a new city so no friends either . they kept texting me for weeks sometimes daily and i couldnt shake the feeling that something was off. but i was curious. i didnt want to seem paranoid so i kept responding hoping maybe theyd reveal who they were soon. they kept saying they wanted to talk and that they had a lot to say but i kept putting it off. honestly i was scared. i knew this wasnt just a random personit felt like they were trying to make me comfortable only to reveal something i wasnt ready for. it was only after i was pretending to enjoy talking to him and after months of cryptic messages the person told me their identity. when i saw the name pop up i felt my stomach drop. it was someone i knew my entire life. someone i thought i could trust. someone who had been a constant presence in my life. it was my uncle. i was in shock. how could this be happening? everything started to make sense the way he told me who he was was unsettling he said he thought i was ready to know who he was and said hed share a memory wed had together and itd all click for me. he said sushi express i was confused a memory popped up but i thought no way so i asked him to give me a more specific one he then said sushi express failure my heart dropped. cause the only memory i thought of was when my uncle would take me to eat sushi express for a series of times sometimes with his wife and sometimes with just me and my brother and one day we went to a new sushi express place and we went in and we didnt like the place and walked out i had always known him as someone close to the family someone i saw regularly. i had known him for as long as i could remember. but now it all started to make sensehis strange behavior all the hints that he gave me the manipulative comments. it was him the whole time. but that wasnt all. the first day he added me on snapchat the day he first reached out to me was also his birthday. and that detail looking back felt like a punch to the gut. why did he choose that day? was it planned? was it a way to manipulate me even further? the more i thought about everything the more the horrible truth hit me this wasnt the first time hed crossed boundaries with me. when i was a child he sexually assaulted me everyday for i dont even remember how long.i buried those memories for so long told myself i was just being dramatic that it didnt matter. but now the pieces were falling into place. he had been trying to manipulate me all along using this new online persona to control me. i wasnt sure what to do. i knew i had to tell someone so i went to my auntshis sistersi didnt tell my mom cause she was pregnant and i didnt want to stress her. i thought theyd be my allies that theyd stand up for me. i told them everything and i expected them to act. i expected them to confront him to take some kind of action. at first they seemed supportive. they promised they would confront him that they wouldnt let him get away with it. but as the weeks passed nothing happened. not even a word from them. one aunt sent me a voice message explaining that she had been thinking about confronting him but she still hadnt done it. she kept saying that she needed to find the right moment that she didnt want to approach him too suddenly. meanwhile im left here feeling like ive been forgotten waiting for someone to help me while hes out there still living his life without consequences. she said things like i dont want to catch him off guard and im trying to think about how to say it so hell actually listen. it felt like she was more worried about his feelings than about what he did to me. she even told me she wanted to talk to him privately at her house where she thought it would be calm but weeks have gone by and nothing has happened. its like no one is taking me seriously and im just expected to keep waiting. im done waiting. im done feeling like i have to justify myself to anyone. he thinks he can get away with this and he probably feels like im too shy or quiet to speak up. hes wrong. the next time i see him im going to make it clear that im not afraid anymore. im not going to pretend everything is okay. i dont care if he feels uncomfortable. he doesnt get to control the narrative anymore. im done with the silence. im done hoping that someone else will fix this for me. im going to take control of my own story no matter what. he doesnt have power over me anymore. the truth is enough.theres so many other details that i thought were too much to add but lmk if yall wanna know,content warning sexual assault,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-11 03:10:05 UTC,2,1,0.67,0,secret admirer gone wronggrinning_face content warning sexual assault a few months ago i received a snapchat request from someone i didnt recognize. they wouldnt tell me who they were right away only that they had feelings for me and talked about how they admired me . the first message they ever sent me was creepy it was i know you see me just like i see you but im not ready to step out of the shadows yet. neither are you i know youre a private person but theres something about you that pulls me in every time even from a distance. im someone you know but i cant say who i am yet. just know that i see you in a way thats deeper than you might imagine bye lm blocking you at first i didnt think much of it. i thought maybe it was just some random person who had seen my profile and was curious. but as the messages continued they started to feel... strange. the person was saying things that made me uncomfortablethings that made it clear they were watching me. they would mention things from my life that only someone who really knew me would know and it started to feel like i was being stalked. and to be clear im 19 and i never had a boyfriend never had my first kiss was homeschooled and moved into a new city so no friends either . they kept texting me for weeks sometimes daily and i couldnt shake the feeling that something was off. but i was curious. i didnt want to seem paranoid so i kept responding hoping maybe theyd reveal who they were soon. they kept saying they wanted to talk and that they had a lot to say but i kept putting it off. honestly i was scared. i knew this wasnt just a random personit felt like they were trying to make me comfortable only to reveal something i wasnt ready for. it was only after i was pretending to enjoy talking to him and after months of cryptic messages the person told me their identity. when i saw the name pop up i felt my stomach drop. it was someone i knew my entire life. someone i thought i could trust. someone who had been a constant presence in my life. it was my uncle. i was in shock. how could this be happening?

1j4xbz7,my wifes family are a bunch of ungrateful aoles.,tldr wifes family felt entitled to my money to help with their mothers retirement and none of them have ever expressed one word of gratitude. not looking for advice just venting. backstory im 65m wife is 61f. married 36 years. wife has three siblings one older brother one older sister one younger sister. we were very close with all of her siblings and their spouses for many years we went on dozens of vacations with all of them always had gatherings at holidays spent weekends at each others homes etc. her brother and i were as close as we could be always hanging out playing music and having a great time. i loved him more than my own brothers. he began to hate me in 2020 because i had the gall to disagree with his political views. when he found out i voted for biden he screamed at me were fucking done at a family gathering. hes barely said two words to me since then. her older sister and her husband have had a simmering illwill towards my wife and i for many years. back in the 80s and 90s i was earning great money and we used to take them and their kids on vacations that were 99 percent paid by me because they didnt have two nickels to rub together. if we bought a new piece of furniture or tv or whatever we would offer them our barely used stuff for free which they seemingly gladly accepted. we did these things because we loved them. evidently they took our generosity as treating them like a charity case. now that they are both in highearning careers and dont need anything from us they basically hate us for treating them that way and now simply look down their noses sneer and snub us. her younger sister and her husband have always been good christians but have become more fervent evangelical southern baptist over the years. i made the mistake of having a discussion about religious beliefs i am an atheist with the husband several years ago. i know a thousand times more about his holy bible than he does and the discussion did not go well for him. ever since then they have done their best to ostracize us from the family at every opportunity. fast forward my wifes 80yearold father passed away a couple of years ago leaving his wife my mil also 80 widowed. they relied almost exclusively on social security for their retirement income. after his death there was a shortfall in the mils monthly ss income. my wifes three siblings had a meeting and decided that the shortfall would be made up by the four siblings split evenly. each share came to 2500 annually to make up the mils shortfall. all three of the other couples are fairly wealthy with annual incomes in the 250350k range and all have 401k accounts over 1 million which they brag about. my wife does not work. i own a small business which has slowed dramatically since covid i make around 75k in a good year. i would like to retire at some point so i am trying to save every dollar that i can in order to do so. i will rely heavily on social security for retirement income. the long and short of it is that i had to funnel 2500 per year into mils retirement needs that would have otherwise gone towards my own retirement savings. the way the siblings view it is your money is your wifes money therefore she needs to chip in to help her mom. fortunately two years into that arrangement the mil sold her house she moved in with one of the siblings and netted around 200k. she told my wife that with that money plus her ss income and the 50000 she already had in savings i would no longer need to contribute to her income especially since her expenses were now basically zero. so thankfully i only had to donate 5000 of my retirement money to the mil. the shitty part is that not one of the siblings or the mil have ever expressed one word of thanks or gratitude to me even though they are well aware that the money we contributed came 100 from my earnings. we still have to see them every now and then at weddings or funerals or whatever and they have never even acknowledged my contribution and sacrifice. their sense of entitlement is appalling especially in light of the fact that they all have a great disdain for me and consider me

1j8u2gn,i regret that i sacrificed my teens to care for my husband,edit its all happened between 2017 lets say 2020 2021 i lost my love for him and i needed to learn to love him again. something inside of me never stopped believing that we can get through it. when we first meet in real life i just knew i wanted to be with him. he now works as a optician shop assistant. first off my husband 25m and i 25m have known each other for nearly 14 years. we got married in 2022 and i love him deeply. we have a strong bond. we now have a relationship stronger than ever but sometimes esp. now that i am at my lowest these thoughts come creeping in. i definitely not regret having him..just would make things differently if it makes sense were both ftm female to male transgender and have gone through our transitions together. my husband started his transition at 16 while i began in my early twenties. due to ptsd i had shut myself off from feelings of being wrong for a long time before finally starting my transition. i moved in with my husbands family when i was 17 because my mother left the country and my fatherwho was a gambling addict and had many womendid not provide a stable home. so i took the chance to leave. at first it was tough living together in such a small spacejust a 20m² room his childhood bedroom. i went from total isolation to suddenly being part of a family of five. fastforward a bitmy husband was manipulated by his family and ended up developing a severe eating disorder anorexia nervosa. meanwhile i was slowly starting to figure myself out and attending therapy for my ptsd. what made things worse for him was that he was an undiagnosed autistic man who couldnt understand or process his emotions. the early years of his transition only intensified these struggles. he was constantly overwhelmed couldnt give me the space i needed and often shut down completely. we were both damaged teenagersjust 18 years oldwithout a real understanding of the world or ourselves. i fought alongside him through his transition and worked for his familys acceptance of him. when he started spiraling into anorexia i was attending a really good school that my dad had enrolled me in. but because of my own mental health struggles and the start of my own transition i started missing school more often. i drove him almost daily to a lecture class he was taking to improve his job and school qualifications since he had missed a lot of regular school due to mental health issues. i skipped my own classes for him while he was letting go of everything. eventually i got him admitted to a mental hospital to treat his anorexia. at his lowest he was 1.58m tall and weighed only 38kg. he was allowed to come home on weekends but had to return to the hospital at night. i rarely saw him and i became sick myself. i didnt know what to doi had no friends and my family wouldnt have taken me back. luckily we found a way forward and i was able to help him recover. i monitored his eating habits carefully helped him through the ups and downs and cooked food that wouldnt make him nauseous. it took us over a year to bring him back to healthit was like learning to walk all over again. that year i missed even more school which meant i had to repeat a grade. because of that i lost my chance at earning a masters degree or an engineering title. i graduated with good grades but i didnt qualify for higherlevel jobs. recently i was diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my shoulder meaning i can no longer work as a painter. i feel like im at my limit. i keep rethinking everythingif i could go back i would take better opportunities get him professional help sooner and make sure i secured my own future. i know im only 25 and still have my life ahead of me but careers start young. now that im jobless im trying hard to market myself to at least get a decent job. i also know that without me my husband wouldnt be here today. but sometimes i regret sacrificing so much for him. i always joke that if youre unlucky in gambling youre lucky in lovesince we have a strong relationship and will celebrate 10 years together in 2026. but i regret missing out on so much in my youthnot being able to go out either because of my ptsd or because i couldnt leave my husband alone. the worst part for me is that i always promised him id build a home where hed be safe from his familys toxic traits. but after everything ive lost i dont know if i can fulfill that promise anymore. sometimes i wonder if i would be better off with a partner who had better mental health. but then how could i even think that? he was always the one person who stood by me who wanted me in his life. my own family treated me like a burdensomething to be moved around something unwanted. my mother even told me to my face that she had wanted to put me up for adoption when i was five. im so exhausted. i just want stabilitya decent job enough money to pay the bills without constantly worrying about groceries. i want to build a good life for us.,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-11 15:56:08 UTC,73,18,0.78,0,i regret that i sacrificed my teens to care for my husband edit its all

1j4b2z1,im leaving for college soon... but its breaking me apart...,this also gon be long i cant help it i am literally crying as i typed this... tldr im leaving for college soon and while im excited im struggling with the thought of leaving my mom behind. weve always been close since my dad works overseas but lately ive been unintentionally pulling away getting irritable and saying things i regret. i thought distancing myself would make leaving easier but it only hurts more. seeing how much my mom will miss memade me realize i dont want to leave things on a sour note. i keep having vivid dreams about my departure and the guilt of how ive treated her is overwhelming. i want to fix things before i go but i dont know how. im moving away for college in a few months and as excited as i am for this new chapter i cant stop thinking about how much im going to miss my mom. shes been my biggest source of comfort my whole life and since my dad works overseas weve always had a strong bond. but now that im getting closer to leaving i feel this huge mix of emotions that i dont know how to deal with. lately ive noticed myself pulling away a littlenot intentionally but i think its my way of trying to make leaving easier. instead its just making me feel worse. ive been more irritable and i hate that ive raised my voice at times when i never used to i always used to listen to her life stories even if i had heard them countless times her rants too whenever she shouted for reasons i wasnt even wrong... but now i am talking back to her get angry on her and say awful things when she tells her stories i say they are boring and please shut up i dont know why i am doing this... i still want to listen to her rants and yapping but i am not able to i am going into that angry zone and i have done many mistakes. i havent even apologized properly and that weighs on me. its like im watching myself act this way but cant stop. i know this is all part of growing up but the thought of leaving her behind even temporarily is really hard. i dont have many close friends so my mom has always been the one i could talk to. but over time i started keeping things to myself thinking i shouldnt burden her with my problems. i used to be able to just rest my head in her lap and cry when things got hardwhen i got bullied when i felt alonebut i havent done that in years. it makes me sad because i feel like ive lost that connection a bit and i dont want to leave things this way and now when i probably need it the most i feel like i cant show her the weak side of me that i have long pretended to have erased. the other day something happened that really got to me. my mom was taking a nap and before sleeping she had asked me to grab some groceries. while she was resting my little sister was joking around and said he left for college and my mom suddenly started crying in sleep. she thought i had already gone. i was still at home but seeing that broke me. i rushed to get the groceries but i was tearing up the whole time. it made me realize just how hard this is going to befor both of us and precisely the reason i was trying to distance myself from her that she doesnt grieve much but no now i feel that she will cry more that i left and our relation were sour and not mended i genuinely want to say sorry right now but i am stuck and i am going crazy. at night i keep having vivid dreams about the day i leave and they feel so real i do have genetic hyperphantasia from my mom that too that i wake up feeling broken. every time its like im reliving the moment before it even happens i know mom must be having those dreams too. it makes me feel so helpless because no matter what i do that day is still coming. i was going to leave this january but postponed it to august because in january we were close to ripping each other off that level of arguments... but now things are settling down but still it isnt back to what it was last year... i know i have to go and i know my mom wants the best for me. she always encourages me and im so grateful for everything shes doneraising me taking care of me making sure i dont feel alone i do feel but i pretend i dont to not hurt her i do have suicidal thoughts sometimes but i hold back that it will all fall into place soon however indefinite the soon is. i just want to spend these last few months showing her how much she means to me and making good memories before i leave. i just want to do the right thing but i feel so lost. i thought distancing myself would help but it only hurts more... idk how to leave without hurting my mom... how do i say goodbye without breaking her heart... all of these are constantly revolving in my mind and im going crazy... i still have a few months but i dont know how ill manage... i want to mend things... but i am thrown into my guilt... for those whove gone through something similar how did you make the transition easier? how did you make sure your mom knew how much you appreciated her before you left? i dont want to take this time for granted and id love to hear any advice on how to make these last few months meaningful for both of us. i know now that pushing my mom away wont make leaving any easierif anything itll only make it worse. i tried to make her love me less so she wouldnt hurt when i leave but all i did was create more pain for both of us. i dont want her to remember our last months together with regret. i just want to fix things before its too late and lastly just to clarify this is about my bond with my mom as a parent nothing else. were asianif i ever even thought otherwise shed personally set me straight with a slipper and more ultimate weapons. my dad works overseas but is always present calling daily morning and night and supporting her even more than i do listening to her rants and all. i love my mom because shes always been there for me and ive supported her in return. she doesnt rely on me for happinessi rely on her. i know i have

1j8n5p9,middle school me was devastated present me is pleasantly surprised,21m. alright so lets be real us guys have tried to measure our dickss atleast once in our lives. i did too and let me tell you... i mismeasured mine as a kid and spent years feeling insecurity over nothing. back in middle school i thought i was below average thats what the numbers said. every time i heard girls joke about how 4 or 5 inches is way too small it stung. i started avoiding those conversations dodging situations where i might have to prove myself. i even fumbled with girls who were actually into me just because i was in my head about it. as i became more mature my mindset changed. i stopped giving fucks. now i was more of a fuck this it is what it is kinda guy. i was determined to focus on the things i can change. i went to the gym grabbed my balls and asked out chicks i liked on dates and honestly? life got better. fast forward to last week i randomly saw a measuring tape lying around. me being bored i figured why not? maybe it grew a bit maybe it didnt but at this point i couldnt care less and was purely measuring for fun. holy shit!!! i was the average joe before but now somehow my dick is inches bigger than the average size. i couldnt believe it. measured again. and again. even got a different measuring tape. same damn results. i felt dumb but also kinda hyped. all those years of insecurity for nothing. ps this post isnt to make my fellow chads feel insecure. up until last week i was riding with the belowaverage squad. it doesnt really matter and ive accepted that too. there will always be someone bigger stronger or better than you in some way what makes you special is your uniqueness and how much you own who you are. focus on the things you can change life will treat you better. thanks for reading,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-11 09:54:28 UTC,0,2,0.3,0,middle school me was devastated present me is pleasantly surprised 21m. alright so lets be real us guys have tried to measure our dickss atleast once in our lives. i did too and let me tell you... i mismeasured mine as a kid and spent years feeling insecurity over nothing. back in middle school i thought i was below average thats what the numbers said. every time i heard girls joke about how 4 or 5 inches is way too small it stung. i started avoiding those conversations dodging situations where i might have to prove myself. i even fumbled with girls who were actually into me just because i was in my head about it. as i became more mature my mindset changed. i stopped giving fucks. now i was more of a fuck this it is what it is kinda guy. i was determined to focus on the things i can change. i went to the gym grabbed my balls and asked out chicks i liked on dates and honestly? life got better. fast forward to last week i randomly saw a measuring tape lying around. me being bored i figured why not? maybe it grew a bit maybe it didnt but at this point i couldnt care less and was purely measuring for fun. holy shit!!! i was the average joe before but now somehow my dick is inches bigger than the average size. i couldnt believe it. measured again. and again. even got a different measuring tape. same damn results. i felt dumb but also kinda hyped. all those years of insecurity for nothing. ps this post isnt to make my fellow chads feel insecure. up until last week i was riding with the belowaverage squad. it doesnt really matter and ive accepted that too. there will always be someone bigger stronger or better than you in some way what makes you special is your uniqueness and how much you own who you are. focus on the things you can change life will treat you better. thanks for reading,0,0

1j7y9vs,to every brother who crossed the line who took advantage.. i have a question for you.,maybe you were young. maybe you didnt know better. maybe no one told you that some lines should never be crossed. but what about now?! are you still a minor?! do you still believe that being younger at the time means you were automatically forgiven?! let me be clear..no you are not forgiven when i was 17 my 15yearold cousin tried to touch me while i was sleeping. his mom knew. he got yelled at. everyone else moved on. i didnt. i still remember that day how scared he made me. every detail. my aunt never talks about it. i tried to forget but i cant. i realized i wont be okay until he says sorry. to my face. he needs to say what i did was wrong. im ashamed. i think about it every day. how could i do that to my own sister?! watching him laugh and carry on like nothing ever happened.. it infuriates me. i dont want him to suffer but he doesnt get to erase the past not when hes grown and fully aware of what he did. the worst part?! he even speaks about morality about respecting women as if hes never betrayed those very principles. and i know im not alone in this. many of you havent forgotten either. its a nightmare.. seeing him makes me sick. his words are like a joke. i want to scream to tell everyone the truth about what he did. because of him im still afraid of men. i flinch at even the gentlest touch even from friends. i sleep alone. i cant bring myself to say yes to a date no matter how kind the guy is.. because deep down i know i have nothing left to give. i dont feel normal anymore. im exhausted by the questions why do you only have female friends?! why do you act so distant around men?! do you hate them?! are you a lesbian?! maybe i am. but even if i were it would still be better than living in fear of men. i want to confront him to demand answers.. but i hesitate. hes still family. maybe he wants to forget maybe he carries his own guilt and yet a part of me wonders what if speaking up hurts him?! so i ask this now.. to every brother who has made his sisters life a living hell do you truly regret what you did?! are you ashamed?! have you ever wanted to face your sister and ask for her forgiveness?! do you even seek to be forgiven?! is the person you are today real or just a mask you wear?! if your sister confronted you how would you respond?! how would it make you feel?! do you like us carry this weight and long to set it down?! i just want to know.. how do you all feel after everything?! because i feel devastated. even after all these years i still cant forget. i wonder is there even a single man in this world who has sincerely apologized for this?! who has taken responsibility helped his sister heal and given her a chance to live a normal life again?! i want to believe that no one is beyond change that people can choose to be better if they truly try. is that too much to hope for?! if any of this resonates with you then please.. apologize to your sisters. understand that we still carry this weight.. even when we smiled even when we pretended to have moved on for the sake of the family...,content warning sexual assault,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 13:12:21 UTC,0,0,0.42,0,to every brother who crossed the line who took advantage.. i have a question for you. content warning sexual assault maybe you were young. maybe you didnt know better. maybe no one told you that some lines should never be crossed. but what about now?!

1j7ik5i,7layer carrot cake the shame. not death but pretty similar to a death sentence.,the way life taught me about sex. not my mom or dad or a sex ed teacher. but life. lets keep in mind that as humans we have an innate instinct to procreate. my dad used to babysit me while my mom would go to work. he would put asian music videos on in the living room and i would sing and dance to the songs all day long. i was 4. i was a sociable outspoken singing daddys girl and i loved people because they would dote on me. what im really trying to say here is at 4 i could recognize humans and human beings. my dad took me over to his buddys house. his buddy had two sons. one was about 7 and the other son was about 4 as well. while he and his buddies were hanging out downstairs the older boy 7 showed me a book his dad had of naked people in all sorts of sexual positions kind of like a kama sutra. he proceeded to usher me into a closet and took off all my clothes. my dad found me naked in the closet and helped me put all my clothes back on and we went home. at around 5 years old i woke up one morning and looked around. my little brother was sleeping in a separate bed in the same room as me. as you know and as i have mentioned above i loved watching tv because of the music videos and because of barney and other things i would watch on tv. so this somber morning i woke up walked to my parents room and they were sleeping and i didnt want to wake them up. i walked back to my room where my brother was sleeping. we had a tv in our room and laying around on the floor were a vhs tapes. so i picked one up and popped it in. it was a porn tape. i remembered the naked people from the book that one kid had showed me and this porn tape had the same people. naked and actively doing things. i somehow knew it was bad. so i turned down the volume and i watched the whole thing instead of taking out the vhs. lets just say curiosity killed the cat and i was the very curious kitten. then around the same year at 5 years old i was molested by my uncle. he was living in the same house as us in the basement. it happened to my memory one time and one time only. i knew what had happened to me the moment it happened. i knew something bad had happened to me and i knew what sex was but i just didnt know the exact words for what everything was. that is my 7layor carrot cake story. not exactly 7 layers but it just seems that bad things of a sexual nature kept making its way into my very short life and i came out on the other side too knowing and too knowledgable way too soon. every day i wish i had had the chance to be innocent and to be trusting of others and of people. i wish i had the chance to be a happygolucky kid unburdened. but i was denied that. i grew up with no friends at all because of the amount of guilt i felt. the fact i understood sex at such a young age and being molested it was like an awkward secret i just kept inside. but secrets weight on you. even if you dont think they do. its a physical manifestation and i was not the beautiful child i always wished i was. i was dark and small and always was a little heavier than other girls. because of all those reasons i still have no friends i have never made a friend. i still have extremely low selfesteem paired with a high body count. im just not normal. it feels this way at all times. i always stick to myself and i never look anyone in the eye. the shame. i also want to note to anybody that was raised around too many males. just dont. its not safe for any parent with a small female child to be around that many menmales all at once and even if you trust them i would say you should always have a considerable amount of doubt and remove your child from danger or harm.,content

1j4zka7,ive been selfprescribing my adhd with crystal meth for little over a year now and its changing my life.,in my younger years ive struggled with drugs. ive done everything you can think of but the only drug that scared me to my core was meth. the first time i smoked it my brain said this is what youve been looking for your whole life so i was a functional meth addict for 3 years would go on weeklong benders every 45 months then i quit cold turkey with all substances for 5 years started getting muscular at the gym got my life stable and manageable. now i own my own landscaping company and i flip homes life is good. but it was getting overwhelming. the paperwork that comes with selfemployment is the bane of my existence. especially because i was diagnosed with severe adhd as a child. so about a year and a half ago i went to my doctor to get diagnosed again so i can get prescribed some kind of medication. i knew i was going to need something to keep my business growing without completely crumbling it under my lack of focus. i went through the long process and got denied because by divine providence i smoked weed for the first time in years about 5 days prior. i was infuriated. so i finally said fuck it and looked up old contacts and bought 3 grams of meth the next day. i still remember holding that bag like i was sméagol with the one ring lol. the deep whisper that calls to all addicts beckoned me to go all in to smoke that shit right up. but by that point i had already realized the simple joy of living a true peaceful life and i knew i would throw it all away if i started back up again. i bought a milligram scale and started off with 25 milligrams. the realization of seeing what 25 milligrams of meth looked like made me understand the sheer power of amphetamines. for years people were smoking grams of this shit. consuming it like candy yet all you ever need is a crystal the size of a grain of sand. i put them into individual pill cases and started to take one a day. if i havent taken a dose before 10am then i would skip taking it altogether. ive tried adderall in high school from friends and i really enjoyed how it made me focus meth felt cleaner more aggressive. over time i started to remember my appointments without having to write them down. my sleep schedule became predictable as i never sleep during the day anymore. and my willingness to work harder is becoming effortless. sex is always amazing and i stopped drinking again because ive become sociable without the need for alcohol. the best thing that has happened is that im more aggressive with business negotiations. im less nervous and im not afraid to assert my dominance when i feel it is necessary. now i can never think of ever smoking this stuff again. i know im the exception and im not telling you to use drugs. meth is powerful and will destroy your life before you realize whats going on. but i just needed to tell someone. ask me anything you want. btw i

1j63eh6,i feel stuck in this life of disappointment,damn i will definitely be embarassed about this in the future but anyways ive always been a sensitive person i always cared about others and made sure to make them feel good and happy. my middle school years werent the best i had to move out of my old house and i completely changed life by moving to a town 50 minutes far from my previous residence. you can imagine that i an introverted and nerdy kid wasnt able to make many friends and so i got lonely. in fact i was known as the lonely kid no one ever wanted to talk to me and sometimes even made fun of me i discovered some years later that everyone talked behind my back during those years and that was the reason no one even wanted to approach me. and so i spent three years of my life by myself i spent my days alone definitely years that i wouldnt want to live again. once middle school ended i was full of hope that same summer i made some friends and had a lot of fun with them and so i was positive about starting high school. and so once my first year of school started i tried to me more extroverted and social the outcome was awkard im not good at being extroverted. even tho i tried the outcome wasnt positive. this time no one talked behind my back but i had trouble making friends and so i became the lonely kid once again. i was depressed spent my days listening to music and sleeping all day just to escape that feeling of void that was suffocating swallowing me whole. i was ready to end it all but i wasnt brave enough to even try so i kept living my life and eventually things got better. i made new friends i became more social and felt truly happy after years of suffering. i am happy about how i lived the rest of my teenage years but that feeling never got away. i am now left with an overthinking mindset idk if i can call it like that which leads me to anxiety about all the friendships that i currently live i cant be calm because i sometimes think that everyone will sooner or later go against me and make me live the hell i went through one more time. i cant trust anyone and this thing is making me mad because come on why am i so defensive? why cant i just live my life like the others and not worry about this? i dont truly know why i wrote this probably to feel better or to relate to someone here who perhaps lived my same experience. anyways i feel costantly feel this overwhelming sense of entrapment in my own life i feel like my past will always follow me no matter what i do. no matter how many new people i will meet i will always have this anxiety that they will disappoint me and life is so hard this way. i dont even know if someone will read this i will probably only get some upvotes and my post will be forgotten in this sub,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:24:33 UTC,2,1,0.63,0,i feel stuck in this life of disappointment damn i will definitely be embarassed about this in the future but anyways ive always been a sensitive person i always cared about others and made sure to make them feel good and happy. my middle school years werent the best i had to move out of my old house and i completely changed life by moving to a town 50 minutes far from my previous residence. you can imagine that i an introverted and nerdy kid wasnt able to make many friends and so i got lonely. in fact i was known as the lonely kid no one ever wanted to talk to me and sometimes even made fun of me i discovered some years later that everyone talked behind my back during those years and that was the reason no one even wanted to approach me. and so i spent three years of my life by myself i spent my days alone definitely years that i wouldnt want to live again. once middle school ended i was full of hope that same summer i made some friends and had a lot of fun with them and so i was positive about starting high school. and so once my first year of school started i tried to me more extroverted and social the outcome was awkard im not good at being extroverted. even tho i tried the outcome wasnt positive. this time no one talked behind my back but i had trouble making friends and so i became the lonely kid once again. i was depressed spent my days listening to music and sleeping all day just to escape that feeling of void that was suffocating swallowing me whole. i was ready to end it all but i wasnt brave enough to even try so i kept living my life and eventually things got better. i made new friends i became more social and felt truly happy after years of suffering. i am happy about how i lived the rest of my teenage years but that feeling never got away. i am now left with an overthinking mindset idk if i can call it like that which leads me to anxiety about all the friendships that i currently live i cant be calm because i sometimes think that everyone will sooner or later go against me and make me live the hell i went through one more time. i cant trust anyone and this thing is making me mad because come on why am i so defensive?

1j4fr1m,update i started washing and putting away my roommates favorite mug whenever she uses it. when she caught me i lied about why.,good morning yall! a couple days ago i made a post at 3 in the morning to confess to doing my roommates dishes because i secretly love to watch her do a happy dance when she sees her favorite mug is clean for her to use again. that post changed our lives and im only being a little dramatic by saying that. i gotta say thanks to everyone who upvoted and commented on my original post im still shook at just how many people read about me and my mug happy best friend. the amount of people saying my post made them smile or reminded them of their own friendships or significant others has kept me smiling for days. im kind of into making people happy if that wasnt already obvious so the fact that so many people had even a moment of positivity because of me has been awesome. when i made that original post it was because i just wanted to tell someone about the mug dancing but i knew gwen wouldnt like it if i told anyone we knew so i came to reddit to shout to the void and oh boy did the void shout back. there were so many comments asking if i really thought we were just friends and ill be honest when i made that post we absolutely were just friends. we had never talked about being more than friends and i was happy being friends because we have an amazing friendship. i hadnt really thought about there being a possibility for more because dating was always something i planned to do when i had my life together or when i had more money. i never let myself consider what i was missing out on by waiting for the right time. her finding my post opened up the chance for gwen and i to talk about things that we hadnt before and over breakfast that morning we found where we stood with each other and what we thought things could look like moving forward depending on what we both agreed was the best course. we didnt make any solid plans or decisions and didnt want to rush into something that would ruin the good we already had going for us but ill admit i was hoping for a specific outcome. there was one comment on that first post that had really caught my attention. to paraphrase they told me to think about how i would feel if someone else got to see gwen do her happy mug dance instead of me and it hit me so hard. i didnt mind the idea of someone else seeing her so happy. i just dont know if anyone she dates would notice what i did and decide to do what i did. what if they didnt care or didnt think it was that important or any of the other things i do to make her laugh or smile. i really didnt like the thought of not being there to make sure she has that extra reason to smile in the morning. gwen wants me to admit that im a sappy moron because i teared up writing this. im a sensitive man in touch with my emotions and you know you love it so shut it you squinting_face_with_tongue. to all the people saying its possible for platonic relationships to be like ours you are absolutely correct. our friend group is very open with physical and verbal affection and we help each other all time with big and small things. we all say i love you to each other its just normal communication for us as a group not just between gwen and i. honestly if i hadnt made my original post im not sure when or if we would have gotten to the point we are now. maybe we would have continued as we were and that would have been just as happy of an outcome just a different one like a choose your own adventure with multiple options for a good resolution. which brings me to the actual update. gwen and i agreed we want to try dating. we arent putting a new label on our relationship yet but our first date is next week. im making it all a surprise. gwen helped write this post and will be reading the comments so i cant give any details but its going to be the best first date she has ever been on or ill eat my candy corn patterned socks. i think she might be the one for me and im going to take every chance i can to make sure she thinks the same about me. yall are the best and we love you. do something kind for your loved ones for us and everyone can and should find something to happy dance about it makes life more fun. love gwen and peter pink_heartspider_web,positive,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 22:17:28 UTC,5967,371,0.98,0,update i started washing and putting away my roommates favorite mug whenever she uses it. when she caught me i lied about why. positive good morning yall!

1j657gu,am i being used?,am i being used? do i 26f need a reality check? ive been friends with my friend blake 26m for over a year now. we have been pretty close since the beginning. when we first met we bonded over our shared love for playing soccer together and music. i would say we have many similarities. we both enjoy adult animation like studio ghibli raves and playing board games. since we shared many similarities we kept in touch daily through text messages phone calls and facetime. we had a mutual friend named jennifer. jennifer and i were very close until i noticed that whenever we spent time together she spoke negatively about everyone around her. as a result i gradually distanced myself from her. around the same time jennifer and blake started dating. although i wasnt close to jennifer and didnt personally like her i wanted blake to be happy. blake and i maintained a consistent relationship and communication. we talked every day even during our lunch breaks via facetime. however things took a turn when jennifer informed blake that i had feelings for him and wanted to pursue a romantic relationship with him. that was not the case and i was even in a relationship at the time. as a result blake ended our communication to preserve his relationship with jennifer. we did not talk for eight months. however in january he reached out to me. he told me that jennifer suddenly broke up with him in december. since then weve been hanging out again. in february we attended a rave and ended up having sex that night. a week later we confessed to each other that we had both harbored feelings for one another since weve first met. at this point i informed him that i didnt want to be a rebound and he responded by stating that he wasnt ready for a relationship and wanted to focus on healing. i accepted his decision. we continued spending time together and continued having sex. however i later told him that i no longer wanted to have sex with him because i was struggling to separate our friendship and romantic feelings. around the same time his exgirlfriend jennifer filed a protective order against blake. sidebar personally i have had past experiences with abusive men which may have influenced my perspective. however i must admit that i am not entirely aware of the details of jennifer and blakes relationship. given jennifers personality i cant help but wonder if this situation is a attentionseeking ploy. on the other hand i have only heard blakes side of the story. however i suggested that we establish boundaries. we agreed to refrain from having sex and i told him i need a break from constant communication. i also told him to fine another trusted friend to confide in about the jennifer situation because i havent healed from my own trauma from the abusive i had endured. blake expressed his agreement to the physical boundaries and expressed he didnt want to lose me again and our friendship. since implementing these boundaries our relationship has undergone a significant change. we dont talk that much anymore and when we do the protective order case seems to be the main topic of discussion. although last night i visited blakes place to watch star wars. during the movie he asked me to engage in a platonic cuddle. we did and he said thank you. i inquired about the reason behind his gratitude. he mentioned that my presence was naturing and made him feel less lonely. am i only in his life because he feels lonely?,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:52:22 UTC,2,4,1.0,0,am i being used?

1j7tujn,parents sat me and my little brother down for a talk and now my whole world is falling apart. update,hello i know its been forever since my original post. i honestly dont even know how to start this off. since my original post was 2 months ago i figured an update was probably needed since i left so much in the dark. over these 2 months my dad has moved out and is living somewhere else. me and my brother go over there after school and hang out until our mom can pick us up. they still act cordial in front of me and tyler but they have so much built up tension its concerning. but on new years or like at 1ish on january 1st i tried to talk to my dad since he and tyler my little brother got into an argument about lighting off fireworks. i had gone downstairs since i thought i could talk to my dad and get his side of the story and just talk since he is my dad. but he had been drinking way way more than i have ever seen my dad drink before. so when i went to talk to him things took a sideways turn. my dad had ended up saying some words and the words he said still really fucking hurt. what he said to me really cut deep. he told me i hate my life. im stuck in a shitty job a shitty marriage i have a son who treats his mom like shit and then you. i have a daughter who is a piece of shit. when i found out i was going to have a daughter as my first kid i was so excited. i thought i would have a daughter who loved to fish hunt and ve hardworking. instead i got a fucking snowflake of a daughter who doesnt like anytbing is a worthless lazy piece of shit who expect her parents to bend over backwards for her. i got a daughter who doesnt give a fuck and is just nothing but a bitch. that cut so fucking deep. and i hear those words in the back of my mind so much. and i havent even really had a chance to really process the whole split with my parents. because right after i was told my mom told me that i had to ve strong for my brother since this is really hard for him. so i had to grow up and swallow the fact that my parents are taking a break. so i tried to turn to my boyfriend now ex for comfort and support. instead i got a couple comforting words and hum telling me its going to ve okay. then he proceeded to tell me about his problems and how he got shot in the knee. if anyone wants the story on this shit please let me know because at this point i need to talk because i cant afford a therapist and im going to explode if i dont let this shit out i havent gotten a break since this whole problem at christmas. i get a christmas present of my parents splitting. i start the new year with my dad telling me he hates me. later i finally have enough with my toxic boyfriend and decide to leave him and the police end up getting involved. literally the only good thing about any of this shit is that i currently have a new boyfriend who is loving and supportive and doesnt gaslight verbally and mentally abuse me and will actually listen to me and all my problems. and i had my 15th in february as well. if anyone wants more context i have much more but its currently 219 in the morning and i havent gotten a good nights sleep in about a week and a half. thank you to anyone and everyone who takes the time to read this mess of words. i hope you all have an amazing daynight.,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 08:19:15 UTC,1183,39,0.96,0,parents sat me and

in february as well. if anyone wants more context i have much more but its currently 219 in the morning and i havent gotten a good nights sleep in about a week and a half. thank you to anyone and everyone who takes the time to read this mess of words. i hope you all have an amazing daynight.,0,1

1j7emh1,i f19 think i have feelings for my new friend f19,to start off this isnt a girl crush or anything. ive been a lesbian since the womb so im definitely not confused. i met a girl chloe in one of my college classes when the semester started in february. when we met i thought she was really pretty. we were both in a committed relationship with different ppl when i met her so i didnt think much of it. we became friends as the semester went on and she introduced me to her friend group. weve spent a lot of time together this past month and chloes a really great person. me and my most recent ex broke up a week ago and it was hard. we were together for a year but we had issues so i broke it off. after telling chloe abt the break up shes been inviting me out more and ive hung out w her everyday since then. whenever were together i feel like we have a connection. im wondering if this feeling is just a way of coping from the break up or if i have unfortunately developed a crush on a girl that is in a relationship with another girl. if i do conclude that these feelings are real i would never act on it. id never be disrespectful like that but i just wanted to get it off my chest.,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 18:53:07 UTC,1,0,1.0,0,i f19 think i have feelings for my new friend f19 to start off this isnt a girl crush or anything. ive been a lesbian since the womb so im definitely not confused. i met a girl chloe in one of my college classes when the semester started in february. when we met i thought she was really pretty. we were both in a committed relationship with different ppl when i met her so i didnt think much of it. we became friends as the semester went on and she introduced me to her friend group. weve spent a lot of time together this past month and chloes a really great person. me and my most recent ex broke up a week ago and it was hard. we were together for a year but we had issues so i broke it off. after telling chloe abt the break up shes been inviting me out more and ive hung out w her everyday since then. whenever were together i feel like we have a connection. im wondering if this feeling is just a way of coping from the break up or if i have unfortunately developed a crush on a girl that is in a relationship with another girl. if i do conclude that these feelings are real i would never act on it. id never be disrespectful like that but i just wanted to get it off my chest.,0,0

1j8y574,i feel guilty that i want my girlfriend to stop posting lewds,early on before we had actually started dating she did mention she liked to post lewds on occasion and even asked my permission to do so. talking about it she told me that she didnt post nudes and that it was more of a confidence thing for her. i said i was fine with it so long as it was just lewds. later on when we were officially together it came up again and i added the condition that it had to be sent to me first and that i had the power to veto anything i wasnt comfortable posting. she agreed with no argument. this hasnt been something she does often. weve been together and shes only posted a few times and the couple times i did veto a pic she didnt complain or argue. i truly do believe she respects and values my feelings about this. the first time she posted something before we were actually dating it was a bit... odd. not really unpleasant but not necessarily something i enjoyed. when she posted while we were together i knew that i would not be okay with her doing this forever. at some point if the relationship was to continue i would need her to stop. i wanted to give it time. i didnt want to go up to her and say weve been together a couple months time to add some new boundaries! the most recent time she posted i knew i wasnt happy with waiting longer. i felt i had to talk with her and let her know my feelings on it had changed. and i feel guilty about it. i do love her and want to out her happiness first. she also does have terrible self esteem and is extremely insecure about her body so i can absolutely believe that she does it to help with her confidence. and a part of me wants to believe that if it helps her in any way to see herself and her body more positively that this is a necessary evil. but im not okay with it continuing. i dont like the idea of her posting more lewds and i want her to stop. and i dont even expect an argument from her! when we first talked about it she told me that even if i said no shed still choose pursuing a relationship with me over finding someone who is okay with her posting lewds. paet of me expects her reaction to be apologizing for posting them. i almost expect her to be holding back her own tears of guilt for making me uncomfortable. and that just makes me feel even more guilty. i fear that im going to hurt her because i want to put myself over her feelings. im not interested in hearing i would never date anyone who even thought about doing that while dating me!

1j8z8t3,my ex is dating my neighbour,my 30f ex 33m is dating a neighbour in my building. we broke up about 8 months ago. we were together 3.5 years. throughout the course of our relationship there were definitely issues. we lived together for two years and after the break up we still lived together for a month and a half as we had to sell our house. whats wild is we talked about getting married two months before we broke up and he was 100 on board. we broke up over a really intense fight where he blamed me for something he lost. its a long story but we fought for 3 days decided to take a break for a week to think about what we wanted to do about this. he decided to end the relationship. living together still was hell. he was awful. he threatened to throw my stuff away because he thought i was dating. i found out he made two catfishing dating profiles right after we broke up which he later matched with me on and then would block me. i found out from a close friend of his what he was doing. curiousity got the better of me. i made a real profile of myself to see if it was true. he swiped on me blocked me and remade those profiles a few times. he called me dumb each time i disagreed with him with things concerning selling our house. he skipped out on the last mortgage payment. he also refused to help prepare the house for sale. i did everything on my own. meanwhile he still ate my food kept walking in on me while i was changing the door didnt lock and would sometimes pressure me to still sleep in our bed because as he put it we slept together for almost 4 years whats a few more nights. he also got me an insanely expensive birthday gift and wrote me in as a plus one to a wedding both after we broke up. for weeks after he moved out he kept trying to sleep at our old house for a whole week. i put my foot down here and told him i needed space. i tried to be respectful as possible from the start to honor his wishes. i didnt want to be with someone who didnt want to be with me. besides one conversation about our relationship after we broke up a few weeks in i left him alone. i only talked about the house or things we had to communicate about. i tried setting some boundaries but after he called me dumb i gave up and bit my tongue through it until he moved out. he always knew where i was moving to it was also in our documents for the notary. i told him when i found a place which street and he mentioned the building. since i moved in i swore i saw him often driving by. i knew he bought a car that also looks incredibly similar to mine. i also was pretty sure i saw his bike parked outside my building a few times. i heard from a cousin who followed him on strava that he also ran close to my place or in my street multiple times a week for months. then there was when i had a dating profile i saw he was on there for real as himself and it kept saying he was 650 feet away and sometimes 1 mile away. id sometimes block him and then hed have a brand new dating profile again showing the same sometimes. each time i deleted him for months he popped back up. it was triggering me so much. i did delete all dating apps two months ago. i had a stalker different guy for five years with court dates and all. this same ex helped me through this. he was so empathetic about everything i went through with having a stalker. and here my ex is also invading my space. in a different way sure. now last saturday i saw him help a girl move a piano in. he was in the entry way of my building. i felt my heart race and my anxiety spike. there was another guy there so i was hoping that maybe this guy was her boyfriend and he was just friends with them. then this morning as i was returning from walking what used to be our dog now just mine he walked out of the elevator freshly showered. he smugly greeted me as if i was an old acquittance. as i looked out the window of the elevator i saw he used a key to the building. that made me feel a bit uncomfortable too. i was now even more suspicious and panicking. i texted a mutual friend. i dont care that hes dating. if i saw him in the city on a date i probably wouldnt react much. i do care that hes in my space. the mutual friend confirmed hes seeing someone and told me her name. we have a group chat with everyone that lives in the building and low and behold there she was. just...what the fuck. who does this? he knew when he probably first went to her place that i live here too. and when i guess things got more serious he also knew. whats worse is that that friend told me a friend of ours set them up who also knew exactly where i moved to. if i was dating someone and i found out they lived in his building id either stop seeing that guy i would send a courtesy text or id at least ask the person im seeing if we could primarily hang out in my building. i feel he could have at the very least sent a message. i thought i was being paranoid for months thinking i saw signs of him being in my space. now i hate the fact that i may run into him this often but i would have much rather known hes dating someone than think he was stalking me. i also was just moving on with my life. seeing him is still a bit upsetting. its one thing if this was years later but its only been 8 months. all of the things hes done sinceits so unbelievably cruel. i am so angry. i havent messaged him because i dont think hed respect my boundaries. i just want to move on. i deserve that. i dont deserve this. ive come to the conclusion that he should be the one who feels uncomfortable seeing me. not the other way around. i shouldnt have to feel uncomfortable in my own space. sorry for the cursing but what a motherfucking asshole. never called an ex that but he absolutely deserves the title. just

1j85hv5,i am a man. i got sexually assaulted. she twisted it and accused me everyone only believed her.,its been a few years since this happened i had to quit college and end my studies because of it. i have mostly pretended it never happened but ive recently been looking back and processing it and i need to talk to someone about it. i dont have anyone to talk to about this so i decided to come here. many years ago i was 17 and had just started college. i befriended a girl lets call her emma. emma started dating this bisexual girl lets call her jenny and once she came into the picture the three of us formed a friend group. we were a good friend group for a while and had lots of fun hanging out and studying together. still at some point emmas and jennys relationship started to go really sour jenny had bpd and their relationship had started to become really unstable. they had arguments almost daily even at our college. and during these times i became the therapist whenever i individually met them they would rant to me about each other. and jenny and i really bonded and became good friends since she actually listened to my rants too. the day it happened the school had organized a disco party. emma was working and had to get home get ready and head straight to the party. so jenny had invited me to hang out at her place before the party get ready together hang out and then head over to meet emma at the party. we were just hanging around typical college kid age things and everything was light hearted. but suddenly things got really weird she started talking about sexual things asking me about my kinks and fetishes asking me about all sorts of sexual questions and it somehow evolved to her taking out her computer and showing me the kind of porn she watches and yes when i say showing i mean putting on the actual videos of her favourite porn and asking me to show mine. from there it kept escalating into much weirder sexual things after the porn she started talking about emma and telling me what they do in bed then she pulled out her phone and started showing me nudes of emma without emmas permission or knowledge of it. the next part which i feel extremely uncomfortable thinking about and trying to forget. her parents were downstairs eating dinner after showing me a bunch of nudes of emma without her permission she opened the door and at that point her parents could probably hear whatever we were talking about. then she sat down next to me started talking about how much she misses being with a guy put her hands inside my pants and sexually assaulted me while making remarks about how much she liked feeling me. eventually her parents started to come upstairs. she stopped and at that point i said i had to go and went home skipping the party. i didnt want any of that. i only saw her as a friend and i didnt consent. i just..froze. many people have asked me when i tell this why i didnt stop her and said to me that i consented by not stopping around the part she started showing porn or emmas nudes. but i was dissociating the whole time. i cant really explain it but i was in shock the entire time. afterwards the next day when i came to college she had told emma at the party that she cheated on her told her i had made a move on her and she reciprocated it. this broke our friend group entirely and i was left alone with no friends. it all went completely sideways when a mutual asked me about what happened to our group and once i told her the story she asked me isnt that sexual assault? and thats when it hit me what it really was to which i said yes. not too long later that person talked to jenny about it. jenny told her a completely different story that she was the victim of sa and i was the one who did it she twisted the whole story in a way where she told people i did all the things she did that night the kink questions porn begging to see nudes of emma and then i assaulted her. no matter how much i told the truth. no one listened they all believed her. it didnt take long for the whole school to believe her and paint me as a sexual predator i became an outcast and everyone treated me like a monster it led me really close to suicide and i dropped out of school and have never gone back not long after i dropped out i developed very heavy substance abuse and have been struggling with it until recently i am sober for around 9 months now. i really dont know how i feel about posting this but i genuinely just needed to tell my story i just needed to vent. im sorry if this is too much. i hope you all have a good day.,content warning sexual assault,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 18:23:02 UTC,1153,47,0.96,0,i am a man. i got sexually assaulted. she twisted it and accused me everyone only believed her. content warning sexual assault its been a few years since this happened i had to quit college and end my studies because of it. i have mostly pretended it never happened but ive recently been looking back and processing it and i need to talk to someone about it. i dont have anyone to talk to about this so i decided to come here. many years ago i was 17 and had just started college. i befriended a girl lets call her emma. emma started dating this bisexual girl lets call her jenny and once she came into the picture the three of us formed a friend group. we were a good friend group for a while and had lots of fun hanging out and studying together. still at some point emmas and jennys relationship started to go really sour jenny had bpd and their relationship had started to become really unstable. they had arguments almost daily even at our college. and during these times i became the therapist whenever i individually met them they would rant to me about each other. and jenny and i really bonded and became good friends since she actually listened to my rants too. the day it happened the school had organized a disco party. emma was working and had to get home get ready and head straight to the party. so jenny had invited me to hang out at her place before the party get ready together hang out and then head over to meet emma at the party. we were just hanging around typical college kid age things and everything was light hearted. but suddenly things got really weird she started talking about sexual things asking me about my kinks and fetishes asking me about all sorts of sexual questions and it somehow evolved to her taking out her computer and showing me the kind of porn she watches and yes when i say showing i mean putting on the actual videos of her favourite porn and asking me to show mine. from there it kept escalating into much weirder sexual things after the porn she started talking about emma and telling me what they do in bed then she pulled out her phone and started showing me nudes of emma without emmas permission or knowledge of it. the next part which i feel extremely uncomfortable thinking about and trying to forget. her parents were downstairs eating dinner after showing me a bunch of nudes of emma without her permission she opened the door and at that point her parents could probably hear whatever we were talking about. then she sat down next to me started talking about how much she misses being with a guy put her hands inside my pants and sexually assaulted me while making remarks about how much she liked feeling me. eventually her parents started to come upstairs. she stopped and at that point i said i had to go and went home skipping the party. i didnt want any of that. i only saw her as a friend and i didnt consent. i just..froze. many people have asked me when i tell this why i didnt stop her and said to me that i consented by not stopping around the part she started showing porn or emmas nudes. but i was dissociating the whole time. i cant really explain it but i was in shock the entire time. afterwards the next day when i came to college she had told emma at the party that she cheated on her told her i had made a move on her and she reciprocated it. this broke our friend group entirely and i was left alone with no friends. it all went completely sideways when a mutual asked me about what happened to our group and once i told her the story she asked me isnt that sexual assault?

1j61gx2,i need advice,to start off im 27f with a 22m boyfriend. weve been together for almost 3 years and we met due to working together. i still cringe at our 5 year age gap. i have a friend that is 30f and i dont know if i am a complete ahole for wanting to cut ties with her or maybe i already accidentally did. the last time i saw her i ended up staying for a weekend which was fun at first and we tried to drink but we both fell asleep too fast which her boyfriend got mad about. i did not like this boyfriend 36m due to him constantly sleeping with his ex and being so obvious about it but shed be in this denial or whatever and cry to me constantly about it. he was also somewhat a neglectful parent to his daughter from what my friend would tell me. so anyways the next day came and i agreed to stay an extra day to watch her two daughters and figured id be getting paid because we discussed it prior. well i didnt and during this i ended up getting bed bug bites on my neck hands and ankle area. pretty much where my skin was exposed. since leaving there i still feel like i have bugs on my skin and im honestly afraid to ever go back. i dont know why i pick and choose when to be confrontational because i just let left and didnt say anything. i dont know whether to say anything at all. weve talked about bedbugs before and shes said shes gotten rid of them so i dont know what to say. fast forward a few days and she tells me her and her boyfriend 36m broke up and shes back together with an ex 32m. this ex 32m was sleeping with a 17 year old girl and my friend 30f let both of them move into her home with her two children before they both just dipped and apparently had left the place trashed and thats when the bedbugs originally came about around this time too. oh and that man32m knew her children for a few months and was having them call him daddy. i felt so uncomfortable witnessing all of this and then seeing what she allows herself and her children to be put through willingly. for months i was telling her xyz was not right and shed be defending herself and him 36m until they broke up. at that point is when she is like oh i could never be with someone who does xyz and completely shitting on this man talking about everything she defended and excused when she put up with it for months and would have continued to put up with it if he 36m didnt have his baby momma over again to stay the night after she had been begging him to stop for months doing that for months. so im just over it? im like why are you actively choosing to put yourself through these things? i dont like to sugar coat things because why the hell should i act like neglecting a child is okay just to be a girls girl? their relationship wasnt abusive or anything like that a lot of accusations of cheating coming from both amp issues starting a few days after they began dating which is never a good sign but neither were afraid of each other it wasnt like that and she will put up with almost anything to keep a guy around and thats my issue. i used to think she was a good mom but i dont think shes that great anymore. i used to praise her when she would say she wouldnt let strangers around her kids and doesnt let anyone else watch her kids until i realized shes letting men she just met meet her kids inside her home and be around them unsupervised. i used to think she was a good mom until i realized she raises her daughters through sugar and electronics and doesnt really watch even though around her children. all of these realizations have come to me now after she broke up with her long term boyfriend of 2 years34m and have gone through 45 relationships in a year and i dont think shes the person i thought she was and i feel awful but i dont want to be around someone like that. so she has her new boyfriend ex boyfriend 32m currently living with her again and i sent her a message a couple days ago saying i think that hes a pedophile and i dont want to be around him to which shes never responded but has sent other things. i know that once her and her current boyfriend 32m break up or start having issues she will be wanting my pity party but i cant do it anymore. i feel like i have no empathy for her anymore. if we had more to talk about than her and her relationships i feel like it wouldnt be such an issue but she has no subsidence to her at all if it is not about a man. any advice on what you would do in my situation? its not my life so i dont know why im so bothered.,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 21:57:32 UTC,1,0,1.0,0,i need advice to start off im 27f with a 22m boyfriend. weve been together for almost 3 years and we met due to working together. i still cringe at our 5 year age gap. i have a friend that is 30f and i dont know if i am a complete ahole for wanting to cut ties with her or maybe i already accidentally did. the last time i saw her i ended up staying for a weekend which was fun at first and we tried to drink but we both fell asleep too fast which her boyfriend got mad about. i did not like this boyfriend 36m due to him constantly sleeping with his ex and being so obvious about it but shed be in this denial or whatever and cry to me constantly about it. he was also somewhat a neglectful parent to his daughter from what my friend would tell me. so anyways the next day came and i agreed to stay an extra day to watch her two daughters and figured id be getting paid because we discussed it prior. well i didnt and during this i ended up getting bed bug bites on my neck hands and ankle area. pretty much where my skin was exposed. since leaving there i still feel like i have bugs on my skin and im honestly afraid to ever go back. i dont know why i pick and choose when to be confrontational because i just let left and didnt say anything. i dont know whether to say anything at all. weve talked about bedbugs before and shes said shes gotten rid of them so i dont know what to say. fast forward a few days and she tells me her and her boyfriend 36m broke up and shes back together with an ex 32m. this ex 32m was sleeping with a 17 year old girl and my friend 30f let both of them move into her home with her two children before they both just dipped and apparently had left the place trashed and thats when the bedbugs originally came about around this time too. oh and that man32m knew her children for a few months and was having them call him daddy. i felt so uncomfortable witnessing all of this and then seeing what she allows herself and her children to be put through willingly. for months i was telling her xyz was not right and shed be defending herself and him 36m until they broke up. at that point is when she is like oh i could never be with someone who does xyz and completely shitting on this man talking about everything she defended and excused when she put up with it for months and would have continued to put up with it if he 36m didnt have his baby momma over again to stay the night after she had been begging him to stop for months doing that for months. so im just over it?

1j7qf3k,i caught my boyfriend masturbating to other women.,i know this doesnt seem like a big deal but my heart hurts. this weekend i was using his phone to look up a restaurant and i saw in his search historybar that he looked up at least 2 specific womens only fans leaked. and he clicked on multiple websites just to find these womens leaked images. i also thought to look at his twitter after finding this out and saw he looked them up there too. between these 2 women he clicked on at least 10 different websites to find these womens leaked photos. the funniest part is that me and these women look nothing alike. these women are beautiful dark hair dark eyes. while im a redhead with blue eyes. our bodies are completely different as well. i just feel ugly. he was saying all men do it but i dont believe that. it just hurts that he sought these women out hard to find pictures of them to pleasure himself to when weve been in a committed relationship. i know this is a controversial thing among people but ive always thought why do you feel the need to pleasure yourself to other women when you have me? and finding out these women look nothing like me just makes me feel not good enough and it makes me feel so ugly. he knows ive battled with weight and eating disorders and i feel like this is making it worse and it is torturing me. the worst part to me is he sought so hard for pictures of them when he went across multiple social media platforms to find them and pleasure himself and knowing they dont look like me and knowing hes in a committed relationship. how can i believe when he calls me beautiful yet pleasures himself to women that look nothing like me. edit his needs are being met someone told me i should mention this as well but i can assure you his needs are met with how much we go at it! also he doesnt like me masturbating to other men! so i dont masturbate to other men but he is masturbating to other women even though i dont like it. so im also upset about that because i followed his wishes but he doesnt follow mine!,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 04:18:16 UTC,13,256,0.52,0,i caught my boyfriend masturbating to other women. i know this doesnt seem like a big deal but my heart hurts. this weekend i was using his phone to look up a restaurant and i saw in his search historybar that he looked up at least 2 specific womens only fans leaked. and he clicked on multiple websites just to find these womens leaked images. i also thought to look at his twitter after finding this out and saw he looked them up there too. between these 2 women he clicked on at least 10 different websites to find these womens leaked photos. the funniest part is that me and these women look nothing alike. these women are beautiful dark hair dark eyes. while im a redhead with blue eyes. our bodies are completely different as well. i just feel ugly. he was saying all men do it but i dont believe that. it just hurts that he sought these women out hard to find pictures of them to pleasure himself to when weve been in a committed relationship. i know this is a controversial thing among people but ive always thought why do you feel the need to pleasure yourself to other women when you have me? and finding out these women look nothing like me just makes me feel not good enough and it makes me feel so ugly. he knows ive battled with weight and eating disorders and i feel like this is making it worse and it is torturing me. the worst part to me is he sought so hard for pictures of them when he went across multiple social media platforms to find them and pleasure himself and knowing they dont look like me and knowing hes in a committed relationship. how can i believe when he calls me beautiful yet pleasures himself to women that look nothing like me. edit his needs are being met someone told me i should mention this as well but i can assure you his needs are met with how much we go at it! also he doesnt like me masturbating to other men! so i dont masturbate to other men but he is masturbating to other women even though i dont like it. so im also upset about that because i followed his wishes but he doesnt follow mine!,0,1

1j53tt6,til that my coworker had a title ix case against him from my predecessor and hes still here.,i dont really know what to make of this and i dont really have anyone to talk to about it. i 23f started my masters this academic year and was brought in as a graduate assistant in one of the academic advising offices on campus. our office has a new director who comes from a high school administration background and relatively new advisors two of them both have been here five years max. until yesterday i didnt know why the previous ga left her role. she clearly left in a hurry because my office her office still had wall decorations cork boards with posters and flyers supplies and cabinets chockfull of folders with papers guides flyers you name it its here. it looked like the place was already in use is what im getting at. she created entire binders about our departments programs and even fully stocked the supply closet that we have. i knew she hadnt left due to graduation it had to be either right before she graduated or she hadnt renewed her contract but i didnt know why. its not really my business but i was curious and wanted to be sure it wasnt for something nefarious. so my suspicions rise when a classmate of mine m recognized the office that i said im a ga for a handful of us are gas most of them for our college but me in this advising office and she brought up that she used to work there in undergrad until she graduated last year. m started asking about names from when she was there and it became apparent weve had a lot of staff changes in less than a year. i thought interesting i wonder why? she also did not like most of the people advisorsdirector who arewere here. i kind of shrugged it off figuring that she probably just had some bad experiences or that the leadership prior to our current director was suboptimal because i liked my coworkers. naïveté on my part ill admit. but something hasnt quite left me since that day m said the previous director lets call him colin resigned after being caught in a relationship with a student. i took this with a grain of salt because i hadnt heard that not even from the other student workers who like to gossip and m had made it clear that she didnt enjoy the office atmosphere. things came to a head for me yesterday when i met with the current director to discuss some issues with the website. things progressed to how she doesnt like how disorganized the supply closet currently is and her plans to clean it out with our administrative assistant over spring break. she mentioned having so much stuff left behind by the previous ga like thick binders of whoknowswhat and not knowing what to do with them. theyre multiple 5inch binders stuffed to the brim. bringing up the ga snowballed until director casually mentioned how my coworker lets call him andrew one of the two advisors in our department was the one caught making sexual advances and toward the previous ga. they had gone out for drinks afterhours unsure if it was with a group and he had texted her inappropriately about hooking up. the thendirector colin received word of this but didnt want to do anything about it. he was promptly fired for his inaction once an actual fullblown title ix case opened against andrew. the ga left after this incident and no one has seen her since. she left everything behind. her friends harassed the office to try and hold colin accountable but it wasnt until the case was opened that action was taken. im in shock and just dont know how to process these instances. he came onto my predecessor yet she left and he is still working here. i dont even know if shes graduated but it makes sense now why her stuff was left behind and why nobody talks about her aside from the student workers who dont know the truth.,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 19:29:57 UTC,10,3,0.75,0,til that my coworker had a title ix case against him from my predecessor and hes still here. i dont really know what to make of this and i dont really have anyone to talk to about it. i 23f started my masters this academic year and was brought in as a graduate assistant in one of the academic advising offices on campus. our office has a new director who comes from a high school administration background and relatively new advisors two of them both have been here five years max. until yesterday i didnt know why the previous ga left her role. she clearly left in a hurry because my office her office still had wall decorations cork boards with posters and flyers supplies and cabinets chockfull of folders with papers guides flyers you name it its here. it looked like the place was already in use is what im getting at. she created entire binders about our departments programs and even fully stocked the supply closet that we have. i knew she hadnt left due to graduation it had to be either right before she graduated or she hadnt renewed her contract but i didnt know why. its not really my business but i was curious and wanted to be sure it wasnt for something nefarious. so my suspicions rise when a classmate of mine m recognized the office that i said im a ga for a handful of us are gas most of them for our college but me in this advising office and she brought up that she used to work there in undergrad until she graduated last year. m started asking about names from when she was there and it became apparent weve had a lot of staff changes in less than a year. i thought interesting i wonder why?

1j6wish,im done holding on to the scraps of relationship my father and i have left,very long and emotional story short or as short as i can get it gt013 i grew up a daddys girl. i love my father with my whole heart and cherish his presence. i am inherently anxious and suffer from undiagnosed audhd anxiety disorder and depression but it doesnt affect me as much because my family is loving and kind. gt gt13 my mother and i caught my father cheating on her. he told us he stopped and that he was sorry. gt gt1315 i didnt talk to my father directly as i felt betrayed and hurt. this was made worse when my mother kept trying to stand up for him. i later learnt she was trying to stop the mistress from contacting my father so that she and him could work on their relationship gt14 my mother is diagnosed with cancer but they cant tell what kind or how far along it is. my father grows even more distant from us and the arguments increase. gt1516 my mother is hospitalized and my father starts talking to this woman on his phone. i start to feel more anxious. my mother advocates for my father but it just makes me more mad and hurt. they argue more now and i find myself becoming emotionally distant from my father. gtlate 16 my mother dies and i shut down as well as shut myself off from my family friends and peers. i am angry at my father as he does not seem as affected and was also the cause of my mothers stress before she died. my older brother tries to soothe me and we traumabond. my father tries to relate to me as his mother died a few months before mine but he doesnt understand that it isnt the same. gtmy father dates moves in and then marries a woman i have never met in less than 8 months. his friends my trusted adults all support him as well as his family and peers. i am hurt but i pass it off as him just grieving differently. i was sure it was a phase and that they would break updivorce soon enough. i later find out its the same woman he cheated on my mother with lied to us about and then continued to talk to while my mother was battling cancer. i confront him about this and he says that he thought i knew who she was despite us never being formally introduced to her. to this day i know next to nothing about her. only her first name where her mother lives and the name of one of her children. gtfathers wife is emotionally and verbally abusive towards me and my brother but i being the younger and more emotional one take it harder. gtshe tells me that im killing my father by arguing with him and that he will end up dead just like my mother. i yell back at her to defend my father as i take it very seriously when someone wishes death upon another even indirectly but my father takes her side and berates me for defending him. gthe does a myriad of other things threatening to sell off my cats locking them outside and causing one to die from the cold as punishment for me not agreeing with him as well as pretending not to hear when his wife flat out threatens to kill me. he was right next to her when she said it mind you. gtunder the advice of my older cousin from my moms side i report the wife to the cps but he denies hearing her threaten me to the social workers which makes me look like an emotional teenage girl. we get placed into family therapy but the therapist is borderline sexist and just wants us to be a family unit regardless of the womans blatant disregard for my safety. gti ask my father why hes choosing his wifes needs over the safety of his biological children whom he claims to adore and he simply says that the bible says wife before children. id argue that doesnt apply to wife that you cheated on your childrens mother with and who threatens you children but okay dad. gti sleep with a knife under my pillow just in case she tries to harm me. my anxiety and depression levels are through the roof. gt17 19 i cant remember much from these years but it mostly involves me trying to bond with my father as hes the last living parent i have. i go through 3 relationships and have no one to talk to or seek comfort from when it goes downhill. my father thinks were getting better because of him and not because of the gigantic effort and emotional stuffingdown im doing as even being near his wife makes me anxious to the point of insomnia. as angry as i was before i still love my father and want him in my life. i tell him that he can pick any other wife just not her and i would be genuinely happy with that. he doesnt care and only treats me well when shes not there away on vacation or at her mothers house. when she is around though he is more distant and visibly more tense. gt20 my father announced that he wants to split our house physically half of it is to go to me and my brother as it was built when my mother was alive and she paid for and designed it. i tell him that i dont want him to do it as it will just drive us further apart but his reasoning revolves around his wife and her comfort. my

distance himself from me even though he has hurt me so much for so long. i still cry ive actually just stopped crying as im typing this whenever i think about how far weve already drifted apart. our relationship went from one of trust smiles secret fastfood lunch breaks and long hugs... to me not even being able to tell him about the girl that broke my heart and how i would love to have one genuine dadhug from him so that he can tell me its alright. i would love to have him at my wedding one day but i dont know if that will ever happen. i dont want to grow up not in a world where he dies alone and regretful but it seems that thats the only way for me to not end up living my entire life clinging to his leg begging him to look back and maybe love me the way he used to. so im done. im done wanting his love and im done waiting on him to realise he was wrong and that i still needed him. im going to be something and im going to love someone and let them love me in return. i deserve better. tldr my father has hurt me with his actions and his words for too long. im going to learn how to live without him no matter how much it will hurt to let him go.,content warning violencedeath,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 01:33:45 UTC,33,5,0.93,0,im done holding on to the scraps of relationship my father and i have left content warning violencedeath very long and emotional story short or as short as i can get it gt013 i grew up a daddys girl. i love my father with my whole heart and cherish his presence. i am inherently anxious and suffer from undiagnosed audhd anxiety disorder and depression but it doesnt affect me as much because my family is loving and kind. gt gt13 my mother and i caught my father cheating on her. he told us he stopped and that he was sorry. gt gt1315 i didnt talk to my father directly as i felt betrayed and hurt. this was made worse when my mother kept trying to stand up for him. i later learnt she was trying to stop the mistress from contacting my father so that she and him could work on their relationship gt14 my mother is diagnosed with cancer but they cant tell what kind or how far along it is. my father grows even more distant from us and the arguments increase. gt1516 my mother is hospitalized and my father starts talking to this woman on his phone. i start to feel more anxious. my mother advocates for my father but it just makes me more mad and hurt. they argue more now and i find myself becoming emotionally distant from my father. gtlate 16 my mother dies and i shut down as well as shut myself off from my family friends and peers. i am angry at my father as he does not seem as affected and was also the cause of my mothers stress before she died. my older brother tries to soothe me and we traumabond. my father tries to relate to me as his mother died a few months before mine but he doesnt understand that it isnt the same. gtmy father dates moves in and then marries a woman i have never met in less than 8 months. his friends my trusted adults all support him as well as his family and peers. i am hurt but i pass it off as him just grieving differently. i was sure it was a phase and that they would break updivorce soon enough. i later find out its the same woman he cheated on my mother with lied to us about and then continued to talk to while my mother was battling cancer. i confront him about this and he says that he thought i knew who she was despite us never being formally introduced to her. to this day i know next to nothing about her. only her first name where her mother lives and the name of one of her children. gtfathers wife is emotionally and verbally abusive towards me and my brother but i being the younger and more emotional one take it harder. gtshe tells me that im killing my father by arguing with him and that he will end up dead just like my mother. i yell back at her to defend my father as i take it very seriously when someone wishes death upon another even indirectly but my father takes her side and berates me for defending him. gthe does a myriad of other things threatening to sell off my cats locking them outside and causing one to die from the cold as punishment for me not agreeing with him as well as pretending not to hear when his wife flat out threatens to kill me. he was right next to her when she said it mind you. gtunder the advice of my older cousin from my moms side i report the wife to the cps but he denies hearing her threaten me to the social workers which makes me look like an emotional teenage girl. we get placed into family therapy but the therapist is borderline sexist and just wants us to be a family unit regardless of the womans blatant disregard for my safety. gti ask my father why hes choosing his wifes needs over the safety of his biological children whom he claims to adore and he simply says that the bible says wife before children. id argue that doesnt apply to wife that you cheated on your childrens mother with and who threatens you children but okay dad. gti sleep with a knife under my pillow just in case she tries to harm me. my anxiety and depression levels are through the roof. gt17 19 i cant remember much from these years but it mostly involves me trying to bond with my father as hes the last living parent i have. i go through 3 relationships and have no one to talk to or seek comfort from when it goes downhill. my father thinks were getting better because of him and not because of the gigantic effort and emotional stuffingdown im doing as even being near his wife makes me anxious to the point of insomnia. as angry as i was before i still love my father and want him in my life. i tell him that he can pick any other wife just not her and i would be genuinely happy with that. he doesnt care and only treats me well when shes not there away on vacation or at her mothers house. when she is around though he is more distant and visibly more tense. gt20 my father announced that he wants to split our house physically half of it is to go to me and my brother as it was built when my mother was alive and she paid for and designed it. i tell him that i dont want him to do it as it

1j7xxzs,i feel guilty eating anything,i f26 constantly feel guilty about eating anything. i count every single calorie and honestly its exhausting. im from a southeast asian country where most of my peers are naturally small and skinny. even if they eat a lot they either dont gain weight like i do or lose it effortlessly. at 58 and 150 lbs i dont think im that heavy. yes im on the heavier side compared to the people around me but i carry most of my weight in my chest which only makes me look even fuller. on top of that im considered tall for a woman here so i always feel like a giant. peoplefriends strangers family freely comment on my height and weight and not in a good way. my family especially constantly gives me unsolicited diet advice tells me ive eaten enough and makes jokes about my body. but the worst part is my mom. shes obsessed with having a perfectlooking daughter and to her that just means being pretty and skinny. my academic achievements my promising careernone of it matters. to them im just the fat one. because of this im always forcing myself to choose the healthier option trying to burn off every calorie i consume. i religiously log everything into myfitnesspal and limit myself to 10001500 calories a day on top of working out. but no matter how much i restrict myself my weight wont drop anymore. its frustrating. i just want my mind to quiet down so i can enjoy a meal but i feel like im not even enjoying my life anymore. people still see me as the giant friend or the oversized girl in the family and no matter what i do the comments never stop. if i ever defend myself i get dismissed as being salty because im fat. i love food. i love cooking and baking. but ive realized that ive been trapped in this toxic cycle of diet culture for almost 13 years. and after all this time people still wont stop commenting on my body. its made me start hating the things i once loved. i hate my reflection. i hate the small portions i force myself to eat just to fuel my body. and sometimes when the guilt gets too overwhelming i purgenot even after binge eating just after a regular meal. ive even told my mom about it when she criticizes my weight but she just stares at me and says i must be lying because im not losing any weight. i tried brushing everything off and thinking as long as im eating healthy and my body is healthy then its okay but this is every single day and some days it gets to me...and is mentally stuck in there. i dont know what to do anymore. this is mentally draining and i just feel stuck. if you have any thoughts and or advice id appreciate hearing them.,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 12:55:30 UTC,2,0,0.67,0,i feel guilty eating anything i f26 constantly feel guilty about eating anything. i count every single calorie and honestly its exhausting. im from a southeast asian country where most of my peers are naturally small and skinny. even if they eat a lot they either dont gain weight like i do or lose it effortlessly. at 58 and 150 lbs i dont think im that heavy. yes im on the heavier side compared to the people around me but i carry most of my weight in my chest which only makes me look even fuller. on top of that im considered tall for a woman here so i always feel like a giant. peoplefriends strangers family freely comment on my height and weight and not in a good way. my family especially constantly gives me unsolicited diet advice tells me ive eaten enough and makes jokes about my body. but the worst part is my mom. shes obsessed with having a perfectlooking daughter and to her that just means being pretty and skinny. my academic achievements my promising careernone of it matters. to them im just the fat one. because of this im always forcing myself to choose the healthier option trying to burn off every calorie i consume. i religiously log everything into myfitnesspal and limit myself to 10001500 calories a day on top of working out. but no matter how much i restrict myself my weight wont drop anymore. its frustrating. i just want my mind to quiet down so i can enjoy a meal but i feel like im not even enjoying my life anymore. people still see me as the giant friend or the oversized girl in the family and no matter what i do the comments never stop. if i ever defend myself i get dismissed as being salty because im fat. i love food. i love cooking and baking. but ive realized that

1j58nr5,ive been in a secret relationship for the past 9 months and im afraid to tell my family,hi everyone last summer i 22f met a man on this app who is 45m. the day after we met online we had a phone call and ended up spending nine hours on the phone! the following month he flew out to see me and i spent that whole weekend with him. we had an instant connection and even nine months later things still feel really great. him and i live only a few states apart so for the past nine months we have been traveling a lot just to see eachother. we have been traveling back and forth so much that this weekend is our 20th visit with eachother and we have spent roughly 100 days together in person! when we first started seeing each other i didnt tell anyone because i was too afraid of the judgment people would say. i have no clue how people in my family or community might feel about our age gap. overtime it just got more and more involved but i still did my best to hide my relationship from everyone. this upcoming may i need to find a new place to live and i dont really have many options. the best case scenario is for my partner to move to my state and for us to live together. that is a realistic plan for us but the only issue is that i dont think i can hide that from my friendsfamily. i am also starting to think about just telling them since there are times where it is hard to have to hide my relationship especially when its such a big part of my life. i am really worried about what my family might say. i am worried they will look at me in a negative light. i know that its just their opinions but it isnt easy to feel judgment. i am really stressed and confused on what the right decision is. any advice would be greatly appreciated white_heart,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 22:55:24 UTC,0,8,0.46,0,ive been in a secret relationship for the past 9 months and im afraid to tell my family hi everyone last summer i 22f met a man on this app who is 45m. the day after we met online we had a phone call and ended up spending nine hours on the phone! the following month he flew out to see me and i spent that whole weekend with him. we had an instant connection and even nine months later things still feel really great. him and i live only a few states apart so for the past nine months we have been traveling a lot just to see eachother. we have been traveling back and forth so much that this weekend is our 20th visit with eachother and we have spent roughly 100 days together in person! when we first started seeing each other i didnt tell anyone because i was too afraid of the judgment people would say. i have no clue how people in my family or community might feel about our age gap. overtime it just got more and more involved but i still did my best to hide my relationship from everyone. this upcoming may i need to find a new place to live and i dont really have many options. the best case scenario is for my partner to move to my state and for us to live together. that is a realistic plan for us but the only issue is that i dont think i can hide that from my friendsfamily. i am also starting to think about just telling them since there are times where it is hard to have to hide my relationship especially when its such a big part of my life. i am really worried about what my family might say. i am worried they will look at me in a negative light. i know that its just their opinions but it isnt easy to feel judgment. i am really stressed and confused on what the right decision is. any advice would be greatly appreciated white_heart,0,1

1j4ypt0,the girl best friend is always the issue,i 20f just went through my boyfriend 21m of seven months phone for the first time. i have my face in his phone and hes told me multiple times that i can. however what i found has hurt me and hit my confidence in myself and my relationship. i know that some girls have felt it too that little nagging feeling that something is wrong. when i looked i went straight for the girl best friend. and that is exactly where i found messages between them sexting. it was about a year ago at this point that these messages were sent however they were saved in chat. he is still best friends with this girl and did not tell me about this because he said that he didnt wanna lose her. to give a little context i have been cheated on with the girl best friend before twice. so this immediately raised some red flags for me. to top it off too recently the amount of times we are intimate has severely decreasedonce a week or sometimes less i cried for a bit and then i woke him up to talk to him about it. he apologized and i was very mature and tried not to let my jealousy show. i told him its ok that he is still friends with her. i just wish she had told me. however a couple days later here we are i cant stop thinking about it and how shes everything im not. shes skinny with blonde hair he sexted with her and never does with me and he seemed to be way more attracted to her than me. i cant help but overthink and be jealous. edit thank you for all of the advice. i talked to my boyfriend and we have started to work it out and set some boundaries so we can move forward. i am a firm believer of not having friends of the opposite sex but i also would never want to make him choose between us. he is an amazing guy and hopefully this just ends up being something we look back on. we have some growing to do of course were young and new to this relationship but we want to work it out together. to clear some things up no he did not cheat just saying i have experience that issue with girl best friends in the past and saying that i invaded is privacy is wrong. he put my face in him phone and told me i can look through it if i needed to. yes im crazy jealous yeah i have some self doubt but i was just venting about something that was bothering me so then i could put words to paper and evaluate how i wanted to go about handling this. just want to

1j8xe7v,i dont think my family loves me,sorry if there are any typos im writing this on my phone in the dark. i 15f have been struggling with insecurities for as long as i can remember. about my weight face height teeth and hair. i think its because of my older sister as she used to make fun of my appearance even in front of her friends. my hatred towards my body has left me very sensitive its important to note that my mother died when i was younger so that also adds to my sensitivity. so it does happen for me to overthink every comment made about my body or anyone who looks like me in any way shape or form. and because of that i tend to cry a lot. and my sister still makes the same remarks and insults after years of seeing how much i dont like my body. this evening we were having dinner in front of the tv when my dad got up to wash the dishes. the series we were watching had a shot of a talkie walkie in the intro and my sister said that i was built like the object. it got to me and my dad saw it when i brought him the dirty dishes in the kitchen and asked why i was pissed. i said nothing because i knew if i told him why he would either tell me that she didnt mean it or tell me to just ignore her like he always does. he started telling me how i need to stop acting like this. i went back to my seat and started crying so i left to my room to cry in peace. i heard my dad yell from the kitchen how i was so sensitive and emotional and how i always just get outbursts and strat crying over nothing. my sister then came to apologize saying that not everything is about my weight like she did when i got pissed off earlier at the table. i told her to leave me alone and she did after saying well i tried to comfort you i did what i had to do. then she came back telling me to join them and when i told her to leave she told me i was overreacting and that its not that deep. and now as im writing this i hear them joke around and laugh in the living room like one of them didnt body shame me and the one one didnt yell at me for showing emotions. and its not the first time something like this happens. you can tell that shes the favourite if you were living with us the way he talks to her the way he treats her and her friends the way he respects her boundaries and not mine the way it feels like hes trying to make me uncomfortable with the jokes he makes about me and my guy friends. i feel like im not loved and i cant help but wonder that maybe if my mom was still alive he wouldnt traet me like that or that shed stand up for me. i cant wait for when i turn 18 and leave. ive been living this for so much and sometimes i dont even wanna live anymore. but it pains me to think of my father and sister like that. i keep telling myself that theyre good people and sometimes they are but i feel their hatred overshadows their love for me and im honestly done. ive thought about writing here so many times because i truly have no one to talk to in real life. i dont feel like my bff would get it since her parents love her a lot and last time i told her about a fight i had with my dad she took his side. i dont know what to do please help me with anything im tired

1j8wcxx,emotionally intense relationship with a friendam i experiencing limerence a soul connection or just being used for validation?,tldr i have a deeply magnetic connection with a close friend that feels like it transcends labels. weve spent countless hours talking traveled together and shared moments that feel intimate and meaningfulbut shes also in a relationship with someone else. she never explicitly confirmed or denied our interactions as dates but always showed up. i dont know if im caught in limerence if were karmically connected or if shes just enjoying my presence while keeping me at arms length for her own reasons. looking for nuanced perspectives. i 28 f met my friend 33 f at an event back in 2021 and from the moment we met we clicked. there was an instant pulllong deep conversations effortless understanding and a sense of recognition that felt beyond just surface attraction. we texted innocuous surface level conversations for the first few months just checking on each others mental health. we were both working in different places overseas for the first few months right after meeting. our first real hangout almost a year after meeting briefly was accidental but lasted hours and hoursthe kind of deep connection that makes time disappear. when i saw her again it felt like we were the only two people in the room. the second she saw me i was instantly greeted with that familiar warm joyous energy. when we locked eyes i cant explain it fully it just felt like a knowing of sorts. i dont think ive ever seen someone part a crowd like that to get to me. when we embraced it felt familiar. like coming home after a long work trip to see someone who loves you has made your favorite meal run you a bath with a nice glass of wine lit a few candles and groovy lofi playing in the back. just grateful to be home to peace. we did not have plans to hang but after embracing we were inseparable. as the festival was getting rowdy i and my group of friends decided to uber to a local bar closer to our apartment downtown. guess who came with us smirking_face. while in the bar we get some food and drinks. as im about to pay she slaps my hand and pays for us and my friends ngl turn on! in hindsight this next interaction has made me really consider that she may just be using me for my top tier attention. one of my friends had invited a few acquaintances to join us one of these new people was kind of flirting with me. i wasnt paying it any attention other than just being polite. the girl im enamored with is looking at me almost like a piece of meat at this point. but we have been exclusively flirting all night and shes also a bit tipsy now. so i just give her a wink and she returns my wink with a blushed coy smile. dude im already in super like at this point. my brain is playing out our whole lives at this point. probably the cancer in me unamused_faceface_with_rolling_eyesmelting_face as im having conversations with my friend i hear the woman i like talking to the acquaintance. she was telling the acquaintance how amazing and smexy she thinks i am. and then she turns to catch my gaze while talking to the acquaintance and says clear as day and said im going to f the sh out of her fine ass. it felt like a claim a moment of possession but also a testwould i react? would i take it seriously? aside from that comment the entire evening before and after that moment was very different. after ditching our buddies we spent hours of alone time in front of a local lake discussing our pasts hopes dreams and plans for our individual futures and indulging in adult beverages. lots of things unfolded all initiated by her pg13 of course. first intimate moments moments imo should be more sober. plus im a lover girl. that kind of pushpull dynamic has defined our connection ever since. we continued spending time together going on what felt like datesme calling them dates her never rejecting the term but also never confirming. shed set things up invite me and treat me with a level of attention and care that felt more than friendship. the reciprocal level of attention was intense and intriguing for me. then came a moment of clarityor maybe just contradiction. during one of our latenight conversations she said she would never date a woman again. that confused me because well what is this then? our dynamic has never felt strictly platonic. there have been intimate momentsnot just emotional intimacy but physical closeness moments that felt like desire but were never fully acted on. if it were just friendship why did she never establish clear boundaries? why did she let the connection continue in such an ambiguous way? the complication the other person i later found out not through her but through context clues that she had been actively dating at least one other person the whole time. that alone might not have been a huge dealpeople can have multiple connectionsbut what struck me was that she never openly talked about them with me unless it was to tell me vaguely about how the person she was seeing possessed some quality that she first noticed in me and admired and enjoyed. like what is the point of comparing our qualities is this somehow now girl talk? and if so why is it important to point out similarities between us? recently she asked me if i was seeing anyone and i mentioned that i wanted to focus on securing some additional certifications and pay down the debt on my home before settling down. the irony? i only found out about her boyfriend being a serious option as her partner from her recent birthday invitation where his name was listed. odd i know everyone else by name on this invite list. i looked him up yeah maybe i shouldnt have and there were years worth of occasional pictures with the together but she never once shared a photo with me. though these photos appear to be platonic and sporadic until as of late which is when i suppose they made it more official. personally this whatever our relationship is has helped me discover parts of myself that im truly grateful for. in the past few months ive released the need to feel needed. this girl has sparked some self healing i didnt know could happen and thats why i feel ok being friends and not considering a future together if you love someone or something let it go i am grateful to be here. when she talks about him she seems happy so im happy. at the end of the day i do love her but i know i love myself more. and that has made all the difference. however sometimes when she talks about him its oddly detachedlike a relationship based on logic stability and cultural alignment rather than passion. she has in the past said she prefers dating within her race for financial and cultural reasons but this guy is not of that background. i know people can change and evolve so while i was taken aback by this seemingly 180 degree switch i just accepted that was her new normal. when i asked why she chose him she basically said he worships her and is obsessed with her culturewhich makes her feel safe. its weird because i know her to be fiercely independent dominant and controlling in her relationships. though us together. its yin and yang. when shes right shes right and i have been given that same respect. we laugh have deep expansive conversations travel to far adventurous places and just do life together. we are so in tune that we often do or say exactly what the other person needs with no prior conversation. we have solved so many problems together i cannot even begin to list them all. with him it sounds like she plays a more passive roleletting him adore her while keeping a level of emotional separation where she still may hold the power dynamic not sure since we rarely talk about him theyre moving in together this month and he is basically in charge of finding and securing their apartment. though in contrast he does provide additional and cherished emotional and financial support. which is a stark contrast to what she has been used too based on the relationships shes told me about in the past. for that i am truly thankful. so what is this relationship really? at this point i feel like im oscillating between different interpretations of whats happening here. small_blue_diamond is this limerence? am i just caught up in a psychologicalemotional fixation because she represents something i deeply crave?

tldr i have a deeply magnetic connection with a close friend that feels like it transcends labels. weve spent countless hours talking traveled together and shared moments that feel intimate and meaningfulbut shes also in a relationship with someone else. she never explicitly confirmed or denied our interactions as dates but always showed up. i dont know if im caught in limerence if were karmically connected or if shes just enjoying my presence while keeping me at arms length for her own reasons. looking for nuanced perspectives. i 28 f met my friend 33 f at an event back in 2021 and from the moment we met we clicked. there was an instant pulllong deep conversations effortless understanding and a sense of recognition that felt beyond just surface attraction. we texted innocuous surface level conversations for the first few months just checking on each others mental health. we were both working in different places overseas for the first few months right after meeting. our first real hangout almost a year after meeting briefly was accidental but lasted hours and hoursthe kind of deep connection that makes time disappear. when i saw her again it felt like we were the only two people in the room. the second she saw me i was instantly greeted with that familiar warm joyous energy. when we locked eyes i cant explain it fully it just felt like a knowing of sorts. i dont think ive ever seen someone part a crowd like that to get to me. when we embraced it felt familiar. like coming home after a long work trip to see someone who loves you has made your favorite meal run you a bath with a nice glass of wine lit a few candles and groovy lofi playing in the back. just grateful to be home to peace. we did not have plans to hang but after embracing we were inseparable. as the festival was getting rowdy i and my group of friends decided to uber to a local bar closer to our apartment downtown. guess who came with us smirking_face. while in the bar we get some food and drinks. as im about to pay she slaps my hand and pays for us and my friends ngl turn on! in hindsight this next interaction has made me really consider that she may just be using me for my top tier attention. one of my friends had invited a few acquaintances to join us one of these new people was kind of flirting with me. i wasnt paying it any attention other than just being polite. the girl im enamored with is looking at me almost like a piece of meat at this point. but we have been exclusively flirting all night and shes also a bit tipsy now. so i just give her a wink and she returns my wink with a blushed coy smile. dude im already in super like at this point. my brain is playing out our whole lives at this point. probably the cancer in me unamused_faceface_with_rolling_eyesmelting_face as im having conversations with my friend i hear the woman i like talking to the acquaintance. she was telling the acquaintance how amazing and smexy she thinks i am. and then she turns to catch my gaze while talking to the acquaintance and says clear as day and said im going to f the sh out of her fine ass. it felt like a claim a moment of possession but also a testwould i react? would i take it seriously? aside from that comment the entire evening before and after that moment was very different. after ditching our buddies we spent hours of alone time in front of a local lake discussing our pasts hopes dreams and plans for our individual futures and indulging in adult beverages. lots of things unfolded all initiated by her pg13 of course. first intimate moments moments imo should be more sober. plus im a lover girl. that kind of pushpull dynamic has defined our connection ever since. we continued spending time together going on what felt like datesme calling them dates her never rejecting the term but also never confirming. shed set things up invite me and treat me with a level of attention and care that felt more than friendship. the reciprocal level of attention was intense and intriguing for me. then came a moment of clarityor maybe just contradiction. during one of our latenight conversations she said she would never date a woman again. that confused me because well what is this then? our dynamic has never felt strictly platonic. there have been intimate momentsnot just emotional intimacy but physical closeness moments that felt like desire but were never fully acted on. if it were just friendship why did she never establish clear boundaries? why did she let the connection continue in such an ambiguous way? the complication the other person i later found out not through her but through context clues that she had been actively dating at least one other person the whole time. that alone might not have been a huge dealpeople can have multiple connectionsbut what struck me was that she never openly talked about them with me unless it was to tell me vaguely about how the person she was seeing possessed some quality that she first noticed in me and admired and enjoyed. like what is the point of comparing our qualities is this somehow now girl talk? and if so why is it important to point out similarities between us? recently she asked me if i was seeing anyone and i mentioned that i wanted to focus on securing some additional certifications and pay down the debt on my home before settling down. the irony? i only found out about her boyfriend being a serious option as her partner from her recent birthday invitation where his name was listed. odd i know everyone else by name on this invite list. i looked him up yeah maybe i shouldnt have and there were years worth of occasional pictures with the together but she never once shared a photo with me. though these photos appear to be platonic and sporadic until as of late which is when i suppose they made it more official. personally this whatever our relationship is has helped me discover parts of myself that im truly grateful for. in the past few months ive released the need to feel needed. this girl has sparked some self healing i didnt know could happen and thats why i feel ok being friends and not considering a future together if you love someone or something let it go i am grateful to be here. when she talks about him she seems happy so im happy. at the end of the day i do love her but i know i love myself more. and that has made all the difference. however sometimes when she talks about him its oddly detachedlike a relationship based on logic stability and cultural alignment rather than passion. she has in the past said she prefers dating within her race for financial and cultural reasons but this guy is not of that background. i know people can change and evolve so while i was taken aback by this seemingly 180 degree switch i just accepted that was her new normal. when i asked why she chose him she basically said he worships her and is obsessed with her culturewhich makes her feel safe. its weird because i know her to be fiercely independent dominant and controlling in her relationships. though us together. its yin and yang. when shes right shes right and i have been given that same respect. we laugh have deep expansive conversations travel to far adventurous places and just do life together. we are so in tune that we often do or say exactly what the other person needs with no prior conversation. we have solved so many problems together i cannot even begin to list them all. with him it sounds like she plays a more passive roleletting him adore her while keeping a level of emotional separation where she still may hold the power dynamic not sure since we rarely talk about him theyre moving in together this month and he is basically in charge of finding and securing their apartment. though in contrast he does provide additional and cherished emotional and financial support. which is a stark contrast to what she has been used too based on the relationships shes told me about in the past. for that i am truly thankful. so what is this relationship really? at this point i feel like im oscillating between different interpretations of whats happening here. small_blue_diamond is this limerence? am i just caught up in a psychologicalemotional fixation because she represents something i deeply crave?

1j4wh50,got committed to an insane asylum,throwaway account. sorry if the story is too long because the details are a bit fresh. i have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for a couple of years. i am finishing up university but since i major in humanities my career prospects seem bleak. also i had problems with with uni so i had to repeat a few semesters. both of these things are a source of my anxiety and depression. i have friends and family members but not a significant other or a person with whom i can talk about my problems. for the past several months i have been looking for a job without too much success. at the same time i was trying to find help for my depression insecurities and suicidal thoughts. since im broke and cannot afford a therapist i found an organization that offers free counseling. after filling out their application they told me i should go to the hospital because they are not qualified to handle patients experiencing suicidal thoughts. i had my reservations about doing that since public healthcare especially regarding mental health albeit free is pretty bad in my country. fast forward one month i managed to get two job offers one in a translation company which is a 9 to 5 and an evening teaching job. i was pretty excited about the success in getting not one but two job offers so i decided to take it easy and not exaust myself with work. i thought that the best course of action for me was to start doing both jobs until i figured out which one i liked more so i could focus on that job or even quit the other one. monday was my first day on the translation job. in short it went pretty horribly. the translation job turned out to be a regular office job where i had to scan documents and edit word files and it did not involve any sort of translation or useful skill that could help me further my career. bear in mind i have had several translation jobs and i am not a complete beginner. after coming back home i just started crying and felt desperate because that unpleasant experience on my first day on the job brought up all my repressed emotions to the surface uncertainty about my career loneliness and the fact that all people my age have accomplished something in their lives except me. therefore i gathered my courage and took a taxi to the hospital hoping to find a therapist with whom i can talk about my problems. i went to the er and talked to the nurse working at the reception who was very compassionate and patient. then she led me to talk to a psychiatrist who after listening to my woes politely informed me that i would be transferred to a psychiatric hospital or a mental asylum if you like since the hospital is full and they cant take me. he also told me that i should not try and leave the hospital otherwise they would be required by law to call the police since i said that i sufferred from suicidal thoughts. then i waited for two hours until the ambulance arrived and an ambulance crew member escorted me to the car holding me by my arm so that i would not try to escape completely ignoring the fact that i came looking for help and did not try to hurt myself. fast forward to the insane asylum i was interviewd by a middleaged psychiatrist who gave an impression as if he wanted to be literally anywhere else but in that room talking to me. after the interview he told me that i would have to be committed either involumtarily which would last for 48 hours or voluntarily in which case i would have to talk to a different doctor and stay in the insane asylum until she decided what is to be done with me. i tried patiently explaining to the psychiatrist that i only wanted to find help for my anxiety and suicidal thoughts and that i did not want to be committed to this institution. moreover i stressed that my emotional issues are connected to my career and that i had to go to work on the following day. i tried reasoning that missing the second day of my job and possibly losing both of the job offers is hardly productive for my mental health. he shrugged it off saying that it wasnt the end of the world. the nurses then marched me off to the psych ward gave me different clothes and showed me to my room. the room had three beds and the furthermost one from the door had a heavilysedated patient whose arms and legs were tied to the bed. the nurse in all seriousness even asked me if i would prefer to sleep next to the sedated patient or i would choose the first bed. the lights went out and i took the sleeping pills that the nurse offered and slept peacefully... until at least my roommate woke from his sedativeinduced stupor and started cursing swearing and yelling at the top of his lungs demanding to be released from the restraints. two days have passed since then. i have not showered brushed my teeth or shaved since i wasnt prepared to be committed to an insane asylum and had not prepared any of my things when i initially went to the hospital to get help. a lot of thoughts have gone through my mind in the past few days so i hoped that writing it all down and sharing with strangers would help me make some sense of it. tldr tried to
