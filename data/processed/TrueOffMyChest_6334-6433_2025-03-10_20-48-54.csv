1j52tul,I think I was raped and still have problems to process it,"Writing from a throwaway.
Three days ago, I met a guy. He found me on social media, and we talked on the phone for a few days. He seemed easygoing and respectful, so when he asked if I wanted to meet for a cigarette, not at my place, just somewhere outside in the neighborhood.
When he arrived, we sat outside and talked for a bit. Then he suggested going to a nearby hotel. Only if I wanted to, of course, but it was cold and dark, and he said we could just sit inside, have a drink, and talk. He promised he wouldn't try anything, that he didn't want to be intimate either. He seemed harmless, trustworthy even. So I agreed, telling him I only had two hours anyway.
At first, he was still friendly. But as time passed, he started acting off. I kept my distance, positioning myself in a way that made it clear I wasn't comfortable with any physical closeness. Then he went to the bathroom. When he came back, he was only in his boxers.
I told him to put his clothes back on and that I was leaving. That was the moment I felt truly unsafe. I got up, heading for the door when he grabbed me by my ponytail and pulled me to the floor.
I fought as hard as I could, but he knew exactly how to overpower me. At first, he didn't rape me he *enjoyed* me fighting back. He hit me, yanked my hair, and choked me so hard I couldn't even make a sound. He threw me all over the room. My body is covered in bruises, even on my throat. And then, at some point, he raped me. I pleaded for him to stop, but he just threatened me over and over again.
Eventually, my phone rang. I saw my chance and told him I had to answer it, that my friend would be suspicious if I didn't call her back immediately, and that she had my location (she didn't and it wasn't a friend calling I was lying). I told him I'd just meet her quickly and then come back. He let me go and I left.
If this had happened to someone else, I would never blame them. But standing in my own shoes, I can't stop thinking: What the fuck is wrong with me? Who goes to a hotel with a guy they just met? I'm almost 30. I should know better. I should have learned my lesson by now.
But I don't feel scared. I don't feel sad. I don't even feel vulnerable. And that makes it hard to process what actually happened to me.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 18:48:58 UTC,0,1,0.5,,CONTENT WARNING: SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j52ns5,My best friend told my biggest secret,"I (19M) am bisexual. About two years ago, I fell in love with my best friend, T (now 19M). I knew he wasn't into men, so I triedand succeededin getting over it. However, one night while I was drunk, he was taking me home, and I confessed. I told him that I had been in love with him but that I wasn't anymore. I apologized sincerely and explained that I just felt he had a right to know.
Naturally, he was uncomfortable, but we agreed to try and maintain our friendship. Things were never quite the same, but we remained close. I made every effort to respect his boundaries and avoid making him uncomfortable. I also felt guilty, as if I had hurt him and ruined our friendship. Though he never explicitly said so, that was the impression I got. Whenever I asked, he insisted that everything was fine.
About a year and a half after that, due to circumstances beyond our control, we had to sleep in the same bed. I asked if he was okay with it or if we should switch rooms, and he said it was fine. Still, I did my best to stay on my side of the bed so he wouldn't feel uncomfortable. Unfortunately, at some point during the night, I rolled over onto his arm in my sleep. He woke me up and asked me to move. The next night, he decided to sleep in a different room, saying it was because of the bed. I thought that was an excuse, but I didn't press himhe had every right to make that choice. Instead, he slept in a room with two of our female friends, A (19F) and K (18F).
After that, things mostly returned to normal, except I noticed that A and K became more aggressive toward T.
Fast forward to about a month ago: I was out for coffee with A, and we were discussing T. He had made an awful joke toward K, and I was defending him when A suddenly said she had to tell me something. She revealed that on the night he changed rooms, he had told them about what happened. He told them I had feelings for him, that he constantly felt uncomfortable around me, and even outed me as bisexual (I am closeted because I live in a very homophobic country). He also told them that he couldn't wait to work abroad for the summer so he could get a break from me.
At first, I didn't want to believe her, but she knew details only he and I had discussed, and I was sure I hadn't told her. A said they hadn't told me sooner because they thought I wouldn't believe them.
I was crushed. I confronted T over the phone, but he claimed he didn't remember anything from that night and insisted A and K were just trying to ruin our friendship.
We're meeting for drinks in a few days to talk face-to-face and hopefully resolve things. I don't know what to think. Everything points to him betraying me, and his excuse isn't convincingbut I don't want to believe it. Any advice would be welcome.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 18:41:54 UTC,5,6,0.73,,,0,0
1j52lb5,I feel like my body is too ugly to have sex with a gym guy,"Hello, I (21F) have been big most of my life. My parents didn't cook much so I had a lot of fast food growing up then it was a mix of me stress eating/having pcos. During covid I went up to 250 pounds but last year was a bad year for me mentally and I lost 90 pounds without going to the gym. My body looks good in clothes now but my naked body is pretty saggy and has wrinkled lose skin and cellulite in some places. My boobs which used to be my favourite thing about me now look like small sad deflated balls of sand. I've been talking to this cute guy to meet up for casual sex and I want to do stuff with him but he goes to the gym every day and his body looks great and mine looks terrible. He's seen what I look like in photos and in clothes but im afraid he will be disappointed by how I look naked and I don't want to catfish him or go through the process of him rejecting me in person.
I'm against sending nudes for security reasons and I also wouldn't want to go through with it if he's just going to screw me that night just to get off and ghost me because I don't look good. Should I just cancel and stop talking to him? I really like him but I feel like I might have to stay celibate till I can get the motivation to go to the gym and have the money for a breast lift.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 18:39:08 UTC,838,157,0.9,,,0,0

1j52jag,"I lost my home, my mother and my job on the same day","I(18/ M) passed my theoretical exam for my drivers license today, it's crucial to me to have a license because I live on a mountain far outside the city.
I went home and told my mother about the great news, she asked me wether I had to do another one or not, we had agreed 2 weeks earlier that I would do the 2 exams( general knowledge/ Automobile) split because learning and memorizing 1400 questions isn't for me. I told her I did have to do another one but the next placement is on the 20th of march. she got very mad screamed at me and threw things while yelling what a disappointment I had become.
I have to add, the last couple of months have been hard on me, my boss had a big problem with my appearance( for understanding I worked at a high class gym in my city) because I am very muscular and outshine him in a lot of ways, I also have a buzzcut but that shouldn't matter. because of my boss bullying and nagging me the last 7 months( yes it started in august), I quit, today I handed in my letter of resignation, I couldn't do it anymore, working 50-60 hours a week for an ungrateful boss that hates me and wants to fire me anyways isn't my thing I don't take disrespect. I've been into working out for a couple of years and got my personal trainer license in winter of 2023, my mom was so proud. Yet she didn't work, my first paycheck went entirely into her purse, I didn't mind because I like responsibility and do plan to have kids in the next few years, so I have to be able to provide for people, yet she blew all my money on cigarettes cheap alcohol and gas to drive my sister and me to school, oh and the rent and electricity bill of course, there are no gas bills because we heat with wood.
I was and am fine with that nothing wrong there, but after almost a year of unemployment for her she started becoming unbearable, she started yelling at me daydrinking, at one point she tried to punch and fight me physically.
I begged one of her friends to find her a job at their workplace so she could finally get some fresh air, she had a boyfriend whom I got along with very well, very intelligent man, but her stubborn attitude and her narcissistic behavior obviously drove him away, I couldn't even blame him, in the time of my mothers unemployment I raised my half-sister (13/ F)
drove her to practice on my bike,until I crashed it beyond repair, I made arrangements for her to be driven and picked up from everywhere. my mom started working, it is nice to see her happy and thriving, but she always had a bad temper and a lot of self hatred. I love my mother, I have always loved her for every sacrifice she made for me. but I stopped feeling anything towards her today.
after a heated argument, me staying mostly calm because I'm the type to shut down and become quiet once I'm yelled at, and my mother yelling at me. She said, that I don't have money, I don't have assets, I don't even work anymore, and that all this bullshit that has been piling up was too much for her to handle.
I asked her if she wants me to move out and she said I should fuck myself and go to hell or wherever else I wanna go, I'm in tears. I've been living in this house for 7 years, a comfortable life that I tried to sustain for as long as possible. I have a job offer in chicago, but I don't have the funds to go there, I don't have enough money to buy a one way ticket for me and my fiancee (18/F) and one month of rent+ a downpayment on an apartment. I could move there but it's 10000km away. I have had reasons to move out before but decided to stick around so my sister has a male influence growing up, now she's a teenager and I'll never stop being there for her. I have packed my bag, I have prepared to get away from my home which I've lived in for so long. I'm applying for jobs tomorrow, going to a jobcenter, getting all my documents, renewing my CV and just applying at every gym I know. I'm crashing at my fiancees place tomorrow night and see how long it takes for me to find something to start over with in a proper manner. I'm in shambles, I know I could live in this house for another month, another half a year too, but I lost my will to do so long ago. I've always wanted to compete in bodybuilding, but I am scared that all the dreams I have such as: Building a beautiful healthy family, having a homestead, winning and receiving an IFBB pro card, retiring my future wife and building wealth for my family, I come from nothing but I need to do everything, I'm hopeless scared and alone, I'll figure it out by myself though I'm confident.

1j5297d,Trueoffmychest My sister is getting adopted by my step dad today and I'm not happy about it.,"*!no names are real names!* For some context let me start by explains my family tree and giving some history. I 20 female am the oldest child. My parent we'll call them Bob and Lynda (not real names) had three kids me and a set of boy/girl twins ( East and brook). Then my mom cheated and got with a guy (Tony) and had two half brothers (Timmy and tommy). She then cheated again with a new guy (Bret) who was also cheating on his wife. He had two kids with his ex wife (Kat and Sam) my now step sisters. And my mom Lynda and Bret had two more kids (spike and Leo). Meanwhile my dad and step mom (Molly) had one daughter (Katie). So there's 9 kids total with my mom, in order it's: me, East and brook, Kat, Timmy, Tommy, Sam, Spike Leo. My parents had 50/50 custody of us given to them by the court. My dad tried reporting my mom for abuse and the court did nothing about it. It's very pro mommy where we live. My mom Lynda and Bret are very abusive parents. They used to to things like hit us, throw us outside, make us stand on chairs for hours on end without being able to get down, put shock collars on us and starve us. I remember once that I missed a spot mopping the floor and they made me use my toothbrush to clean it ( no I didn't get a new one). We were also very low income but my mom and Bret always found a way to take trips to Disney and have expensive date nights. Them being out often left me home alone with kids for hours if not days at a time. This went on from the time I was 11-16. At 16 I finally said enough was enough and made the decision to live with my dad. I got thearapy and have been doing much better. It's been 4 years since I left. I have tried to fix things with my mom and Bret multiple times but my mom always falls short and blames me for leaving instead of herself for her actions. However when I left to stay with my dad my sister brook chose to stay with my mom without giving anyone an explanation. My dad wasn't bad to her but they where never close. My sister brook is my moms golden Child, her favorite and her mini. My sister was a snake my whole childhood and could get away with murder. So she left my dad and never looked back. Well this year she turned 18 and on her birthday my mom had posted a video of her asking my step dad to adopt her and today was the day of her adoption. I found out through my moms ex baby daddy Tony that she was being adopted because Timmy messaged him about being taken out of school to witness it. He shared the messages with me and then I shared them to my step mom and other family. Not my dad because in these 4 years he has been grieving my sister leaving and finding this out will only hurt more.I'm devastated for my dad and have left it up to my step mom to tell him. I just cannot understand what there thoughts are and why my sister has done any of what she's done in the last 4 years but I cannot say I'm happy for her. But I wanted to get this out and I just needed to vent it somewhere. I guess in the 4 years I've been gone I've really been holding in a lot of what happened to me and still cannot find it in myself to let go or forgive them.

1j52025,I think I'm going through withdrawal,"Lately Facebook has been making me super depressed, so my boyfriend suggested we try to go a full week without checking Facebook. It's actually been great, the first few days were hard but now I don't even really care about checking Facebook. On a conscious level, I feel like not being on Facebook is great. But I also noticed on Tuesday that I was feeling really low and didn't know why. Same yesterday, and today is even worse. It occurred to me that my brain isn't getting its usual constant dopamine supply throughout the day from checking Facebook and seeing that I have notifications or new info to read (even if it turns out to be nothing interesting). I know that social media is engineered to give you a hit of dopamine with every notification to keep you engaged and coming back for more. And I'm starting to think my brain is literally addicted and I'm going through withdrawal. I'm actually really proud of myself and given how awful I feel right now, I feel even more resolve to break this addiction and not go back to how I was. But man, I feel like shit. I just feel so depressed and want to do nothing but sleep. I keep wanting snacks even though I'm not hungry, and I think that's my brain desperately seeking other sources of dopamine. This sucks.

In the last 3 years my 3 closet friends have passed away all from unexpected and tragic accidents. All unrelated just honestly the crappiest thing ever. One was 31 and two others 21. I had a good sized friend group after that of people I went to school with last year a guy in that group SA a girl much smaller than him when they were alone. I decided I couldn't be a apart of that group of people anymore and distanced myself from them. No one else seemed to think what he did was a ""big deal"" and also claimed the woman was ""making it up"" I met the woman and can say I believe her story completely (she also chose not to press charges)
Now around 5 months later I'm miserable. I have no friends anymore and even miss the group I used to hangout with although I can never go back to them because of the horrific act that guy did that the rest seemed fine with. I'm alone 100% except for the 1 hr a day I spend sparing in martial arts. I went on a first date recently to try and meet someone new and I honestly was probably pretty bad company, not that I was a bad date, I paid for dinner and we had a good time. I just wasn't there mentally, couldn't really stay focused and afterwards she said that we didn't need to meet again.

1j503q8,I broke up with my girlfriend last night and it's killing me on the inside.,"First post here and from phone so apologies if there's poor formatting. Also not sure if this is the right platform but turning to here as I need to get this out of my system.
As the title says, I (21M) ended things off with my girlfriend (21F) last night and I feel awful. I had initially thought that I would feel relieved
but it's tearing me apart. She was my first. We were together for 2 years and all of 5 mins it was just gone. Took everything in me to not lose it on the train ride home. Even though I initiated it, I hate myself for what hurt it has caused her and I haven't been able to sleep or eat well. It's really harder than I had imagined.
Of course with any relationship, there were low moments but there were also some of the highest highs and I was so blessed to be with her. I broke things off because I haven't been in a good place recently and I didn't want to ""bleed"" on her due to whatever circumstances I may have. In hindsight, this was immature thinking as I chose the easy way out and I'm now dealing with immeasurable amounts of pain as a consequence.
Today at work the events from the previous night replayed in my head over and over. I said what I had wanted to say but something still didn't feel right. Thing is, I do not think this is a ""take time to heal"" situation. Part of me feels like it was poor judgement to not fight off my thoughts of leaving.
I really miss her terribly.
Not looking for any sympathy here. Just wanted to pen down my thoughts that clearly aren't very cohesive with no fear of judgement.
If you're reading this, thank you for everything. I'm sorry for the small things we bickered about that escalated unnecessarily. Thank you for our fun dates that brought me so much joy.

1j4zka7,I've been self-prescribing my adhd with crystal meth for little over a year now and it's changing my life.,"In my younger years, I've struggled with drugs. I've done everything you can think of, but the only drug that scared me to my core was meth. The first time I smoked it, my brain said , ""This is what you've been looking for your whole life,"" so I was a functional meth addict for 3 years (would go on week-long benders every 4-5 months), then I quit, cold turkey with all substances, for 5 years, started getting muscular at the gym, got my life stable and manageable.
Now I own my own landscaping company and I flip homes; life is good. But it was getting overwhelming. The paperwork that comes with self-employment is the bane of my existence. Especially because I was diagnosed with severe ADHD as a child.
So about a year and a half ago, I went to my doctor to get diagnosed again so I can get prescribed some kind of medication. I knew I was going to need something to keep my business growing without completely crumbling it under my lack of focus.
I went through the long process and got denied because by divine providence I smoked weed for the first time in years about 5 days prior. I was infuriated. So I finally said fuck it and looked up old contacts and bought 3 grams of meth the next day. I still remember holding that bag like I was Smeagol with the One Ring lol. The deep whisper that calls to all addicts beckoned me to go all in, to smoke that shit right up. But by that point I had already realized the simple joy of living a true, peaceful life and I knew I would throw it all away if I started back up again.
I bought a milligram scale and started off with 25 milligrams. The realization of seeing what 25 milligrams of meth looked like made me understand the sheer power of amphetamines. For years, people were smoking grams of this shit. Consuming it like candy, yet all you ever need is a crystal the size of a grain of sand.
I put them into individual pill cases and started to take one a day. If I haven't taken a dose before 10am then I would skip taking it altogether.
I've tried Adderall in high school from friends, and I really enjoyed how it made me focus, meth felt cleaner, more aggressive. Over time, I started to remember my appointments without having to write them down. My sleep schedule became predictable as I never sleep during the day anymore. And my willingness to work harder is becoming effortless. Sex is always amazing, and I stopped drinking again because I've become sociable without the need for alcohol.
The best thing that has happened is that I'm more aggressive with business negotiations. I'm less nervous and I'm not afraid to assert my dominance when I feel it is necessary.
Now, I can never think of ever smoking this stuff again. I know I'm the exception and I'm not telling you to use drugs. Meth is powerful and will destroy your life before you realize what's going on. But I just needed to tell someone. Ask me anything you want. Btw I still haven't finished the 3 grams I first purchased a year ago. It'll probably last me another year before I have to go back out on the streets for more.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 16:34:54 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j4yx7b,The cp case against my ex husband has been closed and I don't know how to feel about it,"In the beginning of the year, my (27f) ex husband (27m) came to me after not talking for a year since the divorce finalized, to confess to me of having sexual fantasies about children and looking at cp while we were together.

And it's a relief that, to the best of my knowledge, he didn't hurt any children or consume any content that hurt actual children. But I was also warming up to the idea that he would face some kind of consequences for his actions. Because he also emotionally manipulated and raped me throughout our entire marriage. I know that I could still try to press charges for what he did to me, but I don't really have any proof except for my own words. And I want to be able to just move on and enjoy my life now that I'm free from him. But he has a new girlfriend who is significantly younger and reminds me of me when I was young and fell for his bullshit. It feels so wrong that he can just do all of this and put me through so much and have nothing happen.
I hope he's telling the truth about getting help and wanting to change, but I also can't help but believe that every word that comes out of his mouth is a lie, even when he believes it's the truth. But I've done what I can, it can't be my responsibility anymore.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 16:07:52 UTC,32,10,0.83,,,0,0
1j4ypt0,The girl best friend is always the issue,"I (20F) just went through my boyfriend (21M) of seven months phone for the first time. I have my face in his phone, and he's told me multiple times that I can. However what I found has hurt me and hit my confidence in myself and my relationship.
I know that some girls have felt it too, that little nagging feeling that something is wrong. When I looked, I went straight for the girl best friend. And that is exactly where I found messages between them, Sexting.
It was about a year ago at this point that these messages were sent, however, they were saved in chat. He is still best friends with this girl and did not tell me about this because he said that he didn't wanna lose her.
To give a little context, I have been cheated on with the girl best friend before, twice. So this immediately raised some red flags for me. To top it off too, recently the amount of times we are intimate has severely decreased(once a week or sometimes less)
I cried for a bit, and then I woke him up to talk to him about it. He apologized, and I was very mature and tried not to let my jealousy show. I told him it's OK that he is still friends with her. I just wish she had told me.
However, a couple days later here we are, I can't stop thinking about it, and how she's everything I'm not. She's skinny with blonde hair, he sexted with her and never does with me, and he seemed to be way more attracted to her than me.
I can't help but overthink and be jealous.
Edit:
thank you for all of the advice. I talked to my boyfriend and we have started to work it out, and set some boundaries so we can move forward. I am a firm believer of not having friends of the opposite sex but I also would never want to make him choose between us. He is an amazing guy and hopefully this just ends up being something we look back on. We have some growing to do of course, we're young and new to this relationship, but we want to work it out together.
To clear some things up, no he did not cheat, just saying I have experience that issue with girl best friends in the past, and saying that I invaded is privacy is wrong. He put my face in him phone and told me I can look through it if I needed to. Yes, I'm crazy jealous, yeah I have some self doubt, but I was just venting about something that was bothering me, so then I could put words to paper and evaluate how I wanted to go about handling this.
Just want to remind some people that everyone is different, along with their relationships.
I hope you have the day you deserve <3",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 15:59:29 UTC,55,89,0.72,,,0,0
1j4xfoh,I overheard one of the funniest conversations ever and i can't stop laughing,"Not an English speaker.
So i'm actually walking back home from the park where i was and i can't stop smiling and laughing alone like a crazy person.
So after a long walk i stopped in a bar in the park and ordered a coffe and sitted outside thinking and thinking. After like 5 minutes i heard a couple starting to argue pretty loudly.
I don't know who they are but just listened a bit. They were arguing about a possible break up after he caught her kissing another guy and she wasn't apologetic or something like this but was arguing back that everyone make mistakes and after 3 years of relathionship for her this wasn't a major reason to break up cause she was drunk and don't remember anything about it.
I'm gonna say the exact piece of conversation that i heard: her ""are you serious? You wanna break up with me for a kiss that didn't meant anything? Are you insane?"" him ""of course, what else would you expect? Me cheering you up for another? Or maybe more?"" her ""but this insane, it's not cheating. It was just a kiss when i was drunk. It meant nothing"" him ""to you maybe not but to me yes. It's called taking responsabilities of our own actions. I can't believe i'm even here to argue about this"" her ""me too cause this insane, it was just a damn kiss while i was drunk that meant nothing"" him ""well this ends here, i'm tired of you and your excuses"" her ""you know right that if you break up with me you will never find anyone like me right?"" him ""well honestly i hope so"" pause and then she ""do you think you are funny? Should i laugh?"" him ""do what you want but i really hope to never find someone like you"" her ""i was way out of your league anyway so it's your loss and not mine"" him ""whatever you say ex gf now i wanna go home and text your sister. She is hell hotter than you"" her ""don't you dare. I will ruin you if you only try"" him ""well this is funny cause a few days ago she texted me first so let's see how things goes"".
Believe me i almost chocked myself from not laughing at this. I just love this things and this little conversation made my day ahahah.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 15:03:35 UTC,1121,32,0.92,,,0,0

1j4xbz7,My wife's family are a bunch of ungrateful a***oles.,"TLDR: Wife's family felt entitled to my money to help with their mother's retirement, and none of them have ever expressed one word of gratitude. Not looking for advice, just venting.
Backstory: I'm 65M, wife is 61F. Married 36 years. Wife has three siblings: one older brother, one older sister, one younger sister. We were very close with all of her siblings and their spouses for many years; we went on dozens of vacations with all of them, always had gatherings at holidays, spent weekends at each other's homes, etc.
Her brother and I were as close as we could be, always hanging out, playing music, and having a great time. I loved him more than my own brothers. He began to hate me in 2020 because I had the gall to disagree with his political views. When he found out I voted for Biden, he screamed at me ""WE'RE FUCKING DONE"" at a family gathering. He's barely said two words to me since then.
Her older sister and her husband have had a simmering ill-will towards my wife and I for many years. Back in the 80's and 90's, I was earning great money, and we used to take them and their kids on vacations that were 99 percent paid by me, because they didn't have two nickels to rub together. If we bought a new piece of furniture or TV or whatever, we would offer them our barely used stuff, for free, which they (seemingly) gladly accepted. We did these things because we loved them. Evidently, they took our generosity as ""treating them like a charity case"". Now that they are both in high-earning careers and don't need anything from us, they basically hate us for ""treating them that way"", and now simply look down their noses, sneer, and snub us.
Her younger sister and her husband have always been ""good Christians"" but have become more fervent (""Evangelical"" Southern Baptist) over the years. I made the mistake of having a discussion about religious beliefs (I am an atheist) with the husband several years ago. I know a thousand times more about his ""Holy Bible"" than he does, and the discussion did not go well for him. Ever since then, they have done their best to ostracize us from the family at every opportunity.
Fast forward: My wife's 80-year-old father passed away a couple of years ago, leaving his wife (my MIL, also 80) widowed. They relied almost exclusively on Social Security for their retirement income. After his death, there was a ""shortfall"" in the MIL's monthly SS income. My wife's three siblings had a meeting and decided that the shortfall would be made up by the four siblings, split evenly. Each ""share"" came to $2,500 annually to make up the MIL's ""shortfall"". All three of the other couples are fairly wealthy, with annual incomes in the $250-350K range, and all have 401(k) accounts over $1 million, which they brag about. My wife does not work. I own a small business, which has slowed dramatically since covid; I make around $75k in a good year. I would like to retire at some point, so I am trying to save every dollar that I can in order to do so. I will rely heavily on Social Security for retirement income.
The long and short of it is that I had to funnel $2,500 per year into MIL's ""retirement needs"" that would have otherwise gone towards my own retirement savings. The way the siblings view it is: ""your money is your wife's money, therefore she needs to chip in to help her mom"". Fortunately, two years into that arrangement, the MIL sold her house (she moved in with one of the siblings) and netted around $200k. She told my wife that with that money, plus her SS income, AND the $50,000 she ""already had in savings"", I would no longer need to contribute to her income, especially since her expenses were now basically zero. So thankfully, I only had to ""donate"" $5,000 of my retirement money to the MIL.
The shitty part is that not one of the siblings, or the MIL, have ever expressed one word of thanks or gratitude to me even though they are well aware that the money we contributed came 100% from my earnings. We still have to see them every now and then at weddings or funerals or whatever, and they have never even acknowledged my contribution and sacrifice. Their sense of entitlement is appalling, especially in light of the fact that they all have a great disdain for me and consider me to be ""their asshole brother-in-law"".",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 14:59:10 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j4ww33,"My ex cheated on me multiple times, used me for money, and still won't leave me alone","I don't even know where to start, but I need to get this off my chest. My ex (26F) and I (26M) were together for a long time and have a 4-year-old son together. I was completely loyal to her, but she put me through hell.
Before we were evicted from our home last year, she was already actively cheating on mefirst with a guy named Liam. She would stay at his place while I was home taking care of our two stepkids (5 and 8) and our son (4). I was struggling financially because she was out drinking all the time with her friends, spending money we didn't have, while I stayed home looking after the kids.
Then, in December 2022, she started cheating on me with a different guyMark. She promised over and over that she'd stop, but she never did. We ended up getting evicted in April 2023, and she moved in with her brother. I was staying elsewhere, and she had our son and her two kids. During this time, she kept lying to me about where she was living. She said she was at her brother's, but in reality, she had secretly moved in with Mark. I found out when I logged into her accountsyeah, I know I shouldn't have, but it was the only way to get the truth because she compulsively lies. (She was living at her brothers for a couple months then after the wedding she moved in with him)
She even took Mark to her sister's wedding, bought him clothes for it, and kept telling me we were going to fix things. She made dozens of promisessaying she'd visit me with the kids, bake me cakes, buy me giftsbut she never showed.
Even after I found out everything in October, she still asked me for money in December, saying Mark wouldn't help her. And I gave it to her, like an idiot. In total, I've given her around 3,000 because she made it seem like we'd work things out. I even paid for the carpets in her new house because she told me she'd cut Mark off once she moved. But now I know that was just another lie.
Throughout all of last summer, she was constantly gaslighting me. I caught her sending nudes to Mark while playing Stardew Valley with him late at night while I was asleep. She'd go out every night with him, and whenever I confronted her, she'd call me crazy and make me feel like I was the one in the wrong. At one point, she and Mark even tried to get me to be friends with himwe all played games together, and I had no idea what was actually going on behind my back.
Even now, when I ignore her, she acts upset and says ""there's still something there."" But all she ever does is use me. She sends me explicit pictures and videos while claiming she ""just wants to be friends."" And when I tell her she's confusing me, she shuts down the conversation because it's ""too stressful"" for her. Meanwhile, I've been the one supporting her, giving her money, and being there for her when she needed help.
I also hate her friend Emily because she covered for her constantly. she's cousins with Mark and was helping her lie to me the whole time.
One of the worst moments was when I visited her brother's place while she was staying there. I found used tissues under the bed, and she swore up and down they weren't what I thought they werebut come on, it was obvious. It was disgusting. And yet she still called me crazy. (She actually made out they were snot cause she had a cold but there was like 50 tissues under the bed lmao)
Whenever I ask her what she wants, she just says, ""I don't know. I need to live alone and figure things out because I'm not well mentally or physically."" But if that were true, why is she still stringing me along, keeping me as a backup plan while she's with him?
She tells me I'm ""stalkative"" and that I'm the bad guy, but I only ever found out the truth by logging into her stuffbecause without doing that, I'd still be believing her lies. I know I should've just walked away, but I love her. I actually cared.
Maybe I'm just too nice, or maybe I'm an idiot. But a part of me always thought this was just a rough patch, that we could fix things and go back to how we were before all of this. Maybe she's sick mentally, or maybe she's just a terrible person. I don't know.
The one thing I do know is I feel used, betrayed, and like I've wasted so much time and money on someone who never really cared about me the same way. And the worst part? She still wants me to keep all of this quiet.
At this point, I feel like I should just tell Mark everything and ruin things for her, because I don't think it's fair that after everything she got it all.
(This is actually typed by me)
Like I'm currently on my parents sofa, I barely see my son, I keep trying to find private or council places but I'm getting nowhere. My depression is genuinely awful like I feel like after everything I have nothing I've just lost it all and no matter how much I try it won't get better. I used to be depressed at uni, even tried to kill myself on my birthday but my flat mates actually got me a birthday cake and stuff and it put me off for a bit, like it was genuinely heartbreaking.
Thing is my credit score is completely fucked as well cause I let her use my credit card and my very account and stuff and my credit score is tanked to hell because of it.
Like I am genuinely screwed and it's like trying to claw myself out of quicksand, struggling is just making me sink further into it.

1j4wh50,Got committed to an insane asylum,"Throwaway account.
Sorry if the story is too long because the details are a bit fresh.
I have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for a couple of years.
I am finishing up university, but since I major in Humanities, my career prospects seem bleak. Also, I had problems with with uni so I had to repeat a few semesters. Both of these things are a source of my anxiety and depression.
I have friends and family members, but not a significant other or a person with whom I can talk about my problems.
For the past several months, I have been looking for a job without too much success. At the same time, I was trying to find help for my depression, insecurities and suicidal thoughts. Since I'm broke and cannot afford a therapist, I found an organization that offers free counseling. After filling out their application, they told me I should go to the hospital because they are not qualified to handle patients experiencing suicidal thoughts.
I had my reservations about doing that since public healthcare, especially regarding mental health, albeit free, is pretty bad in my country.
Fast forward one month, I managed to get two job offers, one in a translation company, which is a 9 to 5, and an evening teaching job.
I was pretty excited about the success in getting not one, but two job offers so I decided to take it easy and not exaust myself with work. I thought that the best course of action for me was to start doing both jobs until I figured out which one I liked more so I could focus on that job or even quit the other one.
Monday was my first day on the translation job. In short, it went pretty horribly. The ""translation"" job turned out to be a regular office job, where I had to scan documents and edit Word files, and it did not involve any sort of translation or useful skill that could help me further my career. Bear in mind, I have had several translation jobs and I am not a complete beginner.
After coming back home, I just started crying and felt desperate because that unpleasant experience on my first day on the job brought up all my repressed emotions to the surface, uncertainty about my career, loneliness, and the fact that all people my age have accomplished something in their lives except me.
Therefore, I gathered my courage and took a taxi to the hospital, hoping to find a therapist with whom I can talk about my problems.
I went to the ER and talked to the nurse working at the reception, who was very compassionate and patient. Then, she led me to talk to a psychiatrist, who after listening to my woes politely informed me that I would be transferred to a psychiatric hospital (or a mental asylum if you like) since the hospital is full and they can't take me. He also told me that I should not try and leave the hospital otherwise they would be required by law to call the police since I said that I sufferred from suicidal thoughts.
Then, I waited for two hours until the ambulance arrived and an ambulance crew member escorted me to the car, holding me by my arm so that I would not try to escape, completely ignoring the fact that I came looking for help and did not try to hurt myself.
Fast forward to the insane asylum, I was interviewd by a middle-aged psychiatrist, who gave an impression as if he wanted to be literally anywhere else but in that room talking to me. After the interview, he told me that I would have to be committed either involumtarily, which would last for 48 hours, or voluntarily, in which case I would have to talk to a different doctor and stay in the insane asylum until she decided what is to be done with me. I tried patiently explaining to the psychiatrist that I only wanted to find help for my anxiety and suicidal thoughts and that I did not want to be committed to this institution. Moreover, I stressed that my emotional issues are connected to my career and that I had to go to work on the following day. I tried reasoning that missing the second day of my job and possibly losing both of the job offers is hardly productive for my mental health. He shrugged it off saying that it wasn't the end of the world.
The nurses then marched me off to the psych ward, gave me different clothes, and showed me to my room. The room had three beds and the furthermost one from the door had a heavily-sedated patient, whose arms and legs were tied to the bed. The nurse, in all seriousness, even asked me if I would prefer to sleep next to the sedated patient or I would choose the first bed.
The lights went out and I took the sleeping pills that the nurse offered and slept peacefully... until at least my roommate woke from his sedative-induced stupor and started cursing, swearing and yelling at the top of his lungs, demanding to be released from the restraints.
Two days have passed since then. I have not showered, brushed my teeth or shaved since I wasn't prepared to be committed to an insane asylum and had not prepared any of my things when I initially went to the hospital to get help.
A lot of thoughts have gone through my mind in the past few days so I hoped that writing it all down and sharing with strangers would help me make some sense of it.

1j4vn9k,I can't feel anything and it's weird,"I'm 27M and life is so weird to me. I see people seemingly caring and loving each other but I struggle to feel that at all for anyone. I know my parents and family love me and I had a great environment growing up. But I'm just... detached. Like, I gained the ability to cry on command to feign sadness when something bad happens, but in reality, I don't feel anything at all. When my mother died, I know I was supposed to feel sad. I know I was supposed to love her as she did me, very much... but I failed at both. I really tried.
I've had relationships in the past where my partners would tell me they love me, but I couldn't feel the same way. They treated me amazing and I try my best to be a good partner, but I could never get attached to someone or care for someone in that way.
I know it sounds cruel, but I just can't seem to love anyone nor care for anyone no matter how hard I try.
I find it hard to feel what others feel. For example, when my friend's dad died, I knew I needed to feel sad, but I just didn't. I didn't understand what he was feeling so I just tried my best to be there for him and take care of him. Even though I couldn't relate to him at all. It's just, I know this is the action that should be done, but I have no emotions attached to it.
When I got a perfect GPA in college, and my cousin who was in the same college as me, in the same course did worse, I knew she didn't feel good, but I cant describe what that would feel like, if that makes sense. I mean, I've been bad or failed at things before and I just felt indifferent. So when my family was praising me and comforting my cousin, I was so confused because I had to feign being happy and sad at the same time.
It's so frustrating because I want to feel for people, but I can't look at people as anything else other than just... people. I can't relate to their struggles even though I try. I know I'm supposed to but I can't. I've been acting this whole time but I have no idea what's wrong.
I know how I'm supposed to feel but I can't feel it. Everything is just monotone for me and things that happen just happen. I know what emotions are and it's so hard for me to feel them or relate to anyone else's.

1j4vi0l,"I'm a male escort and I have a crush on my client: Part 2? (Tiny update on my plan, and back story)","I just want to say thank you for all the replies. Honestly, it's really opened my eyes. I think I was very lost in my feelings, and I truly appreciate everyone encouraging me to go for it, as well as those who reminded me to be careful and respect her boundaries. That's really important to me. The last thing I want to do is make her feel uncomfortable or like I've overstepped, so I want to be very mindful of that.
I also just want to say thank you for all your love and support. I'm a bit shocked. You guys are incredible people.
Someone suggested a book for me to read, and someone else suggested that I HEAL... Yes. I do think this is the crux of the matter. Thank you for that. I looked into the book and honestly, I think it's exactly my current experience.
I got a lot of DMs asking for my personal experience and also, how to become a male escort. I thought I'd give a tiny update on what I plan to do, and then my story, in case people might be interested.
Sorry of its long and jumbled. I've only ever really spoken about some of these things with my current client.
Okay so my idea: I don't know if it's going to work, but I think it allows me to put the idea there in a careful way. Based on how she reacts, I might then make the decision to drop her as a client because I don't think this situation is healthy for me. Some people have pointed out that this isn't a great way to do business as an escort, and I completely agree.
Honestly, if I'm being real, I don't think I'm a good escort anyway grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes businesses wise.
So, here's my plan. My birthday is later this month, and there's a company in our area that specializes in theatrical productions. They have a live performance at a restaurant where you get dinner and a show all in one. From what she and I have talked about, this is exactly the kind of thing she values. She loves theater, singing, opera, she's very cultured in that way. And it's something that appeals to me, too, for my own reasons, which I'll write in my back story, in case someone is interested. She also knows this is something personally meaningful to me.
So, I'm going to buy two tickets, but I won't invite her outright. Instead, I'll reach out and jokingly reference the terms of the boyfriend experience she paid for, something like, ""You know, technically part of the package is me checking in on you, and I haven't heard from you in a while (haha)"". Depending on how she responds, I might then say something like, ""I was actually given two tickets to this event, but I don't have anyone who would really appreciate it. Would you maybe want to come with me?"" She knows that's true. I really don't have anyone else for something like this.
The reason I thought this might be a good approach is because a lot of people pointed out that her paying puts her in control of the dynamic, which I completely agree with. But in this scenario, there's a disconnect from that. It's something separate... What do you think?
Here's my story:
I grew up in a small rural town, close to where I currently am. My home life wasn't ideal, a bit of a mix of financial instability and neglect. I didn't finish school and by the time I was around 16, I was doing odd jobs, mainly in auto repair.
I learned from the older men in town, working informally in backyard garages. I guess I figured this would be my future. Everyone in this town was kind of like that. Grew up there. Married someone who lived there. Never left... Everyone has dated everyone, kind of thing. I was never really interested in dating.
There was a girl a bit older who only showed up on weekends and during school holidays. She was visiting from somewhere bigger. She went to school in the city. We weren't close or anything, but just knowing someone like that existed, that could... Leave the town? I don't know. I think it gave me hope or something.
Later on, I got an opportunity to work as a farm laborer in the area. The farmer was an older man, past retirement age but still running around and working. He had a wife and two adult children. I was fixing fences and machinery, driving tractors, hauling feed, digging in the dirt with spades, but eventually the farmer saw, I don't know, potential? In me. He gave me more responsibilities, and a few years later, I had some kind of a foreman role.
One day, I was about to go into the farmer's office when I overheard him and his son talking about me. I ended up eavesdropping, probably shouldn't have, but I did. His son is more 10 years older than me, I'm not exactly how much older, and he was basically saying that me and my whole family were low class.
And honestly? It hurt. But also because I felt like he wasn't wrong. We were low class. But my mom was trying her best. She wasn't around much, but that was because she was working constantly to make ends meet. And I have my own complicated feelings about her, but I also recognize that she was doing what she thought was best for us.
What really got to me, though, was the son has had every opportunity handed to him... His family is wealthy, he can travel wherever he wants, study whatever he wants, never worry about money. And yet, he does nothing. I don't want to sit here and judge someone else's life, but he sleeps until 10am every day, barely does anything, then goes out drinking every night.
Half the time, he's passed out on a couch, sometimes puking from drinking too much. And that's the person calling me low class?Someone who's never had to fight for anything, never had to struggle to survive?
But maybe he has his own demons he's dealing with. Maybe this is just his way of coping. I don't know. What I do know is that comments like that stick with me. And I do know that I'm not that guy passed out on the couch. I'm out here trying.
Eventually the farmer offered to pay for a GED for me. I took the opportunity and I'm so grateful for that man. I took a GED course that was offered by the university in the next town over. The ""big city"". But it was actually just a bigger town face_with_tears_of_joy
It opened my eyes. Suddenly, the world felt bigger. I had savings from working on the farm, and I wanted to go further, get a degree, but I needed a way to make some more money.
That's when I kind of considered escort work. I don't really have some dramatic story. I just Googled ""Male escort agencies near me"" grinning_face_with_sweat
I was surprised by how many results popped up. At first, it was just research, out of curiosity more than anything. But found a website that seemed legit (or at least, more polished than the sketchy looking ones). I sent an email, attached a couple of photos. And then a few weeks later I got a call and I met up for coffee with two men. One was the ""manager"", the other was an escort himself. They explained the business was small, just a handful (lol) of guys. Their clients are men and women. They weren't high-end, but they aimed for discretion and professionalism.
At first I wasn't sure. But I did like these men and the way they carried themselves. They were confident, polished, almost like businessmen who just happened to be in a very unconventional business. They made it seem... professional. I decided to just give it a go. Why not...
They provided me with a handbook of some sorts. It had information on how to conduct one self as an escort. How to negotiate with clients. Self defence... Information on drug use. How to identify and avoid STDs. Things I always need to take with me when seeing clients. How to dress yourself. Some legal aspects that might arise. Honestly it was all very helpful.
My first client was a woman in the middle of her PhD. I didn't know what I expected... But I guess it was not was I was expecting? She was blunt, straightforward, and treated the encounter like a business transaction. There was no awkwardness, no false pretenses. It was surprisingly easy. She was my client for a long time. I saw her maybe twice a week.
Over the next two or three years, the agency changed. More men joined, some left, and eventually, the guy managing it moved on to other things. The few of us who remained started working more independently but still using the agency's reputation, but mostly managing our own profiles.
That brings me to the current situation, I guess.
Some people have asked about my future plans, whether I'm thinking about a different job or what happens if things pan out with my client. So I thought I'd write something about that here.
From the beginning, my business as an escort was always slow. It seems like the escorts who take both male and female clients get more work, but I was only comfortable working with female clients, so maybe that played a role. Either way, it was never something that fully supported me. There were times, especially over the last year and a half, when I didn't get any work at all. It was really just a side hustle, something that sometimes worked out and sometimes didn't.
I'm trying to focus on getting my degree. I'm older than most of my classmates, of course.
In my second year, I got the opportunity to work as a pharmacy assistant. The pharmacy was close to my university, so I could walk over after class. I'm really grateful for that job because it helped me a lot financially. Then, from there, I landed an internship at a company in my field. It's part-time, but they're paying me to work there, and there's an understanding that once I graduate (which, if all goes well, should be by the end of this year), they'll offer me a full-time position.
So, escorting was something I turned to as a way to earn extra income, and for a while, it did help. But I always knew it wasn't sustainable, and I've been slowly stepping away from it. In fact, before this specific client, I hadn't taken on anyone in quite a while. I had a few once off clients here and there.
Some of the comments suggested that I should let my client know that I'm quitting escorting and that if she still wants to stay in touch, we could. That's something I've been thinking about too. Because the truth is, I am stepping away. The agency doesn't really exist anymore and it's basically just a bunch of us still lingering. But I think I'd like to make this official. It feels like the right time to close that chapter and fully focus on what's next.
As for why this event that I want to ask her to is special to me:
It ties back to something from my childhood. When I was growing up, there was an old lady in town who played the organ at the church. My home life wasn't great, as I've said. But to give more context, my mom was raising me, my sister, and my sister's baby, my niece, who was unfortunately born addicted to heroin. My dad was... somewhere, but not in the picture.
I had a cheap bicycle and used to ride around town a lot. One day, I rode past this lady's house and saw that she had a dog. I don't know why, but I just went inside her yard and started playing with her dog. I was about eight or nine at the time. She invited me in for tea and cookies. She was a retired music teacher. She actually called my mom to let her know I was there, and my mom was absolutely livid, telling me how inappropriate that was. And yeah, maybe it was. But the old lady seemed to like me.
I ended up going back a few times, I guess I helped her around the house and in the garden sometimes. She was a widow and her son was living overseas. She tried to teach me how to play the piano. I never really got good at it, but it became something special to me. I sometimes go to concerts when I can, sometimes there are music concerts at my university.
So this specific even that I want to invite her to, really resonates with me. I don't know if it's the right thing or not. I guess we'll see.

1j4vczc,I (26M) am starting to feel attracted to my MtF (25) friend and am confused.,"Hello, it is my first time ever posting on reddit and english is not my native language so sorry if I am screwing stuff up.
Quick context: I am a 26 year old male with a partner of 5 year (28F) that I love very much together in our house with cats. My friend called ""V"" is a great person to be around, really soscial and funny. We met at university and were good friends from the moment we met and although life has lowered our time together, we still meet for DnD once a month at least and chat when time allows!
Anyway,last year V told our close group of friends that they are transitioning but we can still use male pronouns and everything around him for now. We all accepted it and told him that we are here if he needs help.A couple of months went by and he started the hormone treatment, grew out his hair and starting dressing and acting more feminine. I started to find it a bit interesting to witness the transformation and my GF talked with him about his feelings and some tips and tricks regarding clothing and make-up.
The first ""feeling"" came when he was going to a dress-up party where he asked my GF to help to dress as a proper women for the first time with a wig, make-up and everything. She was happy to help and went over to his place where he and his roommates live (all girls) to work her magic. All went well according to my GF's text and she send me a picture when he was done. He looked so good! Cute but also sexy and most importantly, happy! That is when I first felt ""something"" and I was a bit shocked, I kinda pushed it away as a reaction to seeing the guy I know for 7 years suddenly as a beautiful women.
The next feeling came later on the evening when I got a message from him (drunk) that was a picture of him blowing me a kiss and saying ""I love yooouuuu"" and some other stuff that he is happy to have me and my GF in his life. This gave me a butterfly in the stomach feeling but I thought it was just a corny message that some people send to friends when drunk (I remember plenty of instances where other friends told me they love me after a night of drinking as I am dropping them of at home and vice versa). I showed the message to my GF and she jokingly asked if I am going to leave her for him. I told here no because I really love her and this is just a random drunk text plus he mentioned her also in the text that followed so it was not only aimed at me.
That leaves me with the situation right now where I am 90% convinced that this is all just a temporary feeling and will blow over as they complete their transition and I move on with my GF in the meantime.
What the hell should I do if the other 10% turns out and I cannot stop thinking about him/her when he starts looking for surgery etc? I really love my GF and I also don't want to ruin a great friendship. Do just thug it out or try to talk with V about it? Thanks in advance",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 13:24:33 UTC,1,4,0.6,,,0,0
1j4v85a,I just need to vent my brain,"Preferably with something with caliber... But that's not an option so I'll type into the void instead.
I was at the dentist today, and she went on and on about how I need to get better with brushing my teeth or it's gonna get expensive. That it shouldn't be so hard since I got out of bed and got there... Yeah because I had an appointment? She asked me why it is so hard and I said it isn't hard, I just forget. ""But you don't forget to shower do you?"" Yeah, yeah I do. ""Do you forget to eat?"" Yup. Then she just started going on about how I have to fix this... Like I KNOW! I also need to fix getting the fucking dishes done... I desperately need to do laundry. I've been meaning to throw out this worn pillow for weeks, it's still on the darn floor. My desk was so cluttered with empty soda cans I grabbed a bag to fill and have it sitting by the desk... It's now full and my desk is getting cluttered with cans once more. I have homework due at Sunday I haven't even begun, one which is reading an entire book... I also really really need to clean out the backseat of my car... Oooh and my medication for my arthritis. I have it in the kitchen, I need to take it to my bed because it's an injection and I usually take it before I go to sleep... Haven't taken it in weeks before I keep forgetting to take one of the boxes.
And what do I do instead of getting anything I should down? Play videogames.
Like, I know I should do all these things, I know I should eat better, probably cook my food and not just heat up frozen dinners. I should take care of my health, I should take care of my hygiene and housework, I should... I should... I should ... But just seeing it I get so overwhelmed I rather put it away until it becomes a fricking mountain I can't deal with at all. I hate myself. I don't know what's wrong with me.
A ""friend"" said ""just get it done""... Mhm very helpful. You have all the tools you need. You don't need to run down into the next buildings basement and book the laundry room and then on that day haul everything back and forth. You have a dishwasher you can fill and let it do the work if you don't feel like standing and doing the dishes. You actually enjoy cooking, I hate it. I wish it was that easy to just get it done. It should be that easy to just get it done but it isn't and right now I just wanna go to sleep and hope I never wake up so I don't have to deal with this bullshit anymore.

1j4v78i,Confusion,"I M/18 and my girlfriend F/18 have been together for little over a year now. We started dating at boarding school so we saw each other EVERY SINGLE DAY, so we also argued a lot. After boarding school ended we moved back. This meant we would se each other a lot less because we live 2 hours apart. But that worked fine, seeing each other about 1-3 times a week instead. It is almost always me going to her place, waiting 2 hours. A few months back around mid October, kind of wanted to break it up because I didn't feel very happy in the relationship, but I said I would wait a little because we had a trip to Berlin which was super awesome and things were going great. Now it's been a while, still taking the train 2 hours to see her and I feel that the past few weeks my feelings for her has dwindled. I feel a lust for other woman, don't find my girlfriend as attractive anymore and very little need to see her. I don't look forward to seeing her which I hate because I wish I did
I have told her how I feel and we said we would give a little time and if it keeps going we should break up. The problem is I can't decide, one part of me is screaming stay with her because I love her but not the same way anymore but I still love her and at the same time I feel like the only solution is breaking up. I'm not sure if it's because I love the idea of her what is making me so confused

1j4v23r,Sometimes I go into toilets to be alone,"I feel so self conscious in public. As a Uni student, I stayed home almost the entire semester last year because I just hate to be in crowded lectures halls.
I feel so uncomfortable walking to the campus from the uni accommodations cause there's so many people walking the same way.
I haven't made many friends cause I can't talk to people, the only ones I have are through a group project and one that I knew earlier online.
I sometimes really wanna study somewhere not in my room, but I can't stand going to the libraries or cafes cause they're always so crowded. It feels horrible
The main point is this. Sometimes when I'm at uni, I will feel so vulnerable, so self conscious, that I'll go into a bathroom stall just to be alone for a moment. Not just bathrooms either. I'll hide anywhere I can. I was once waiting to take an exam, there were so many people in line and the invigilators were late setting up, so I walked through this door in the hall where j was waiting, into this random break room where I probably wasn't allowed to be, but I just couldn't stand there.
I spend a lot of time on how I look, how I dress, because I don't want to stand out. If I look sharp and nondescript, I'm that much closer to invisible. Or at least that's the rationale I've come up with, it's sort of a subconscious behaviour.
I can also barely leave my house without headphones. Maybe it's some sort of protection, some defense mechanism that disconnects me from the world around me.
I know my fears and anxieties are extremely exaggerated, logically there's no reason for me to be nervous. Maybe there's some underlying psychological disorder that's causing it, I do have ADHD and autism, but I can't afford therapy or any sort of treatment so I really just have to deal with it for now, until I graduate. But it mostly hurts because I know that it won't just get better with time, I need to do something about it, the future won't be brighter just because the present is so dark. But I'm trapped like this for now.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 13:08:19 UTC,5,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j4uzav,I lied about my experience in a videogame.,"I honestly debated sharing this for a while, but it's really bugging me. It seems dumb but I promise, it's a rough one, for me at least.
I started playing a game just for fun and to see what it was about, but I ran into a bit of a problem when first starting out. I understood the assignment really well for the first time playing but hated how belittled I was for my inexperience despite how quickly I caught on. So I fabricated a simple lie saying I used to play years ago but lost my account.
This wasn't really a problem for a while, didn't expect to make any long-term friends while playing so I just stuck with the lie, so much so that I partially believed it.
I then made a handful of amazing friends that I care deeply for and they care deeply for me. We've been a little group for about I'd say a year now. I feel so unbelievably bad lying to all of them like this even though it's the only thing I've lied about around them (I don't have the guts to lie to them so this really is the only thing). I feel like a terrible friend by lying about a game that we all built our friendship on but I'm too scared to back out of this considering how far in I am.
I feel like actually saying what I did will do me good rather than continuing to just shove the truth to the back of my brain and is why I came here of all places.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 13:03:56 UTC,3,8,0.72,,,0,0

1j4u79y,Sexually attracted to my friend who is the wife of another friend,"(Fake names)
My friend James introduced me to his wife Sarah when they first got together around a decade ago. I don't think Sarah liked me at all until a couple months ago when we started hanging out through a shared interest. To be honest, I'm not sure she likes me much now, and I think she only spends time with me when her friends are busy. I feel like James told her to be friendly to me because he knows I'm socially awkward and suffer from depression especially recently. Anyways, we have been bonding over the same hobby for the past couple months and something about her drives me wild at times man. When I first met her, I didn't think of her like this at all and would have said she was probably a little above average looking. After getting to know her as a person and seeing the way she carries herself, she has become extremely gorgeous to me.
I respect both of them too much to do anything, and I'm genuinely content with being friends with Sarah because she is a fantastic person like James. I've been minimizing contact with her recently though and it sucks because I know that I would never act on these feelings. The reason I haven't been talking to her as much is because I don't want James to feel like something would happen between us. I was spending much more time with Sarah than James because we are both into the same stuff right now.
I'm glad Sarah doesn't feel the same way toward me as I do her, but it sucks knowing that she wouldn't feel the same even had she never met James. I feel so guilty and ashamed for liking her.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 12:19:37 UTC,0,12,0.22,,,0,0
1j4u4pq,I lost my 20s to depression,"I lost my 20s to depression and struggling to put my life together. Everyday I wonder what did I do wrong. In my 20s, while fighting depression, I have always tried my best to put my life together.
* I never went on YOLO stuff like going on trips or oversea travels.
* I rarely if ever waste money on socialization.
* I very rarely eat out, watch movies, etc.
* The only fun I truly had was dedicating my effort to training jiujitsu (2-4 hours a day, 4-5 days a week), which I maintained for 3 years until COVID.
* I keep track of my finance.
* I always have some sort of active learning hobby to keep my mind away from depressive thoughts. Such as learning basic excel, learning basic personal finance, routine music practice, routine certificates studies.
* I keep missing out on opportunities due to my location (Sarawak Malaysia) and my lack of skills that can make potential employers overlook my location.
When I received a good job offer of a career I worked for, COVID happened. After that the job market was screwed. When I had my 1st job, I was underpaid and rewarded with performance punishment. My incomr was MYR1500 per month (USD340), and I learned waterfasting so that I could save 10% every month. After work, from 5.45 to 8pm I would study to get UI/UX Coursera.
After 9 months of this everyday, I had a mental breakdown and forgot everything I learned. I quit my job to join an apprenticeship program, but eventually it didn't pan out... due to my location.
I turned 30 late last year. Currently I'm developing a game (something I have been working on on the side for 2 years now). But the future is bleak. I'm still stuck in this third world town where opportunities don't really exist.

1j4tynm,"Everyone thinks I'm a domestic abuse victim. I'm not, I just literally walked head first into a door...","Basically, I'm a clutz!
I'm very grateful to doctors and nurses who care about their patient's overall wellbeing, not just about their injury. But when you're me, that can lead to some serious problems. Showing up to the hospital with a severe nosebleed, two puffy, black eyes and a bump on my forehead that puts comic books to shame, I absolutely understand they're worried. And especially when the explanation is ""I walked into a door"".
Here's the thing though: I ACTUALLY WALKED INTO A DOOR!!!
Not only that, I was wearing crocs. And yes, I know: ewww crocs! But my mum bought them for me and they're really practical when I just need to put some shoes on to run to the mailbox.
In case you're unfamiliar with crocs, they're like bouncy rubber balls when you wear them and hit your foot on, let's say, a door!
So here I am, in a bit of a rush, shoving my feet into said crocs and then attempting to run out the door. Only, I somehow misjudged the distance to or the size of the door? Maybe? Whatever the reason, when I pulled the door open while simultaneously rushing at it, my foot hit the corner of the door. So the door stopped instantly, but my body didn't, resulting in my face smacking straight into the side edge of the door. Impact no 1. As if that wasn't bad enough, my leading foot was between the door and doorframe, so when the door bounced off my back croc, it hit my front croc, bounced back and smacked me in the face again. Impact no 2. It then bounced into the front croc, and back again. Impact no 3. I'm pretty sure that's when my nose got squished. I'm not sure how many more times it happened, but it sounded like a machingun was going off! I was so disoriented, seeing double, blood flooding out of my nose, my eyes rapidly swelling shut, and it felt like my forehead was splitting down the middle.

Right after, he was arrested and charged in violation of CA penal code 288(A) and given a $100,000 bail amount.

But then, he looked at me and said, ""Nooo, the weirdest place was in the bathroom at Asda.""
I froze. What?
I stared at him, confused. ""We never had sex in a bathroom at Asda.""
He insisted we didback when he was living with his brother and I was staying with my aunt. He even painted the scene: our son was asleep, so we snuck off to the bathroom.
Only our son wasn't even born yet. I was pregnant at the time. And I am absolutely sure I would remember having sex in a supermarket bathroom. That kind of adrenaline rush would have stayed with me forever.
Yet, he kept insisting it happened.
And that's when it hit me.
Did he cheat on me and forget that the person he was with wasn't even me?
This was 10 or 11 years ago, but still, I would not have forgotten this. And I know this because I remember every place I've ever had sex in public, even from before I was with him. So this made absolutely no sense to me.
So yeah, there you have itthe truth off my chest.

And seeing how some people are roasting me in the comments for being with a cheater, saying my child deserves better, hoping he's not a doormat like his mom, and that I deserve this I can only imagine what the comments would look like if my grammar was bad!
As for those commenting about my child:
He doesn't know anything about this. He's never seen us argue, all he sees is what we let him see. Apart from the things I mentioned, we've had a very loving relationship the cheating 5 years ago I forgave and I dont regret that, we have been happy trust is still hard sometimes, but at the moment in the present he has not given me reasons to think that he has cheated or though about it. I understand what people are saying, that he might be abusive or mentally manipulating me but I dont really see it that way maybe when we argue but I don't think he does that on purpose or maybe I'm just blind .
Right now, I'm thinking this might be something he's confusing with a dream, or something like some people have said.
Thinking back, I have mentally blocked out a lot from that time, I had a very stressful and traumatic pregnancy, and it's not something I want to get into or talk about.
I posted this just to get it off my chest.
Please don't offend me in the comments that's just mean, and don't bring my son into it he has nothing to do with this!",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 11:10:46 UTC,5748,275,0.95,,,0,0
1j4t1hf,I am probably the 100th survivor of a serial predator.,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons, his initial is changed for safety, and I'll try not to include too many specific details, but this is a long one. Here goes:
I started dating D after meeting at a bar, and things were amazing at first, as they usually are with narcissistic abusers. After a short period, his mask started to slip. He would sext me about his far out fantasies, some weird but benign, others dark and twisted. Sometimes I said no, but often I played along because some of the things he was suggesting I was fine experimenting with or could see myself potentially liking. And he was crazy hot, and the most charming person I'd ever met. And I knew he had been a player, but I didn't mind. So had I, so it felt like a good match. I was falling in love with him and he (so he said) with me. We became official, and things immediately took a turn for the worse.
The first night he beat me up and raped me, I was on psychedelics that he encouraged me to take, and he convinced me afterwards that I had consented to the whole thing. That it was BDSM. That anything I didn't like was fine but wasn't his fault. (Mind you, BDSM requires specific, lucid, ongoing, and enthusiastic consent, and a safeword, which we did not have.) I think my brain chemistry was permanently changed that night because I sobbed in his arms and allowed myself to believe him. The gaslighting, heavy swings between silent treatment and intense attention, casual cruelty in our conversations, and lovebombing increased from there.
Later on, D coerced me into group sex within which I was sexually assaulted by a stranger multiple times at his direction, before he assaulted me, damaged property, and ran before the police were called. He convinced me again that he thought I had consented to everything. He masterfully gaslit and lied and manipulated me and my memories felt untrustworthy. He convinced me I was going to ruin his life if I pressed charges. Under the trauma bond that had formed that I mistook for love, he convinced me to rescind my statement to the police. And we ""made up"".
The last time I saw him was the worst night of my life and the last time he raped me. I had been drinking all night at his direction, and once we started, he did not stop. Not when I was choking and struggling under him, not when I was crying and begging him to stop, not when I went limp, not when I had lost a pint of blood, not when I passed out. I am lucky to be alive.
But in the morning, the trauma had taken most of my memories. I pretended I was okay, but he knew what he had done. When I realized I had to seek medical attention the next day, he told me I was overreacting and ignored my pleas for aftercare. I begged him for compassion and promised he'd done nothing wrong, but he refused. As the days passed, my memories started to return. As they did, I started to try to hold him accountable. But as I'm sure many of you know, narcissism does not allow for accountability. Every attempt of mine to break up with him was foiled, until he finally decided to ""break up"" with me.
My horrific memories continued to return to me, and so I went to the police. Anyone want to guess how that went?
When they closed my case citing insufficient evidence, I was devastated. But I felt more than anything that I needed to warn the next woman. I posted my experience anonymously, and a woman came forward that he had drugged and SA'd years prior. More second-hand stories started coming out of the woodwork. So I posted him again. My case was closed, but my experience was real, and I realized people needed to know he was going to do it again and had probably done it before.
Yeah, not probably. Definitely. Dozens of women in a weekend in my extended circle of mutuals, and more outside of that, started sharing their experiences of abuse at D's hand. Everything vile under the sunsexual harassment, druggings, assault, blackmail, theft, manipulation, coercion, violence, and rape. Over MANY years.
D is a true serial rapist, abuser, and predator. His disarming charm and looks and fake feminism and subsequent manipulation and gaslighting had not just worked on me, but friends and roommates and coworkers and romantic partners. It has been overwhelming, and heartbreaking, and sickening. But when I went to the cops, I thought I was alone. When I shared my experience, I thought I was alone. And now I know I'm the farthest thing from alone. And you bet litigation and a reopened case are incoming.
But I'm writing this post because I learned tonight about some of the things he did to another ex-girlfriend. Worse than he did to me, worse than you can imagine. For a lot longer. My body has been shaking non stop and I am livid after seeing photo evidence and hearing her story. Every time I think this whole situation can't get worse, it does.
I am so beyond angry at him. I am so disgusted with myself that I allowed him into my bed and into my lifethat I stayed after he showed me his true colors. My belief system is so deeply rocked to my core, that a human being can be this consistently evil and on top of that, not get caught for a decade. I am terrified that he is going to come after me for exposing him to the larger community. And I am furious at all of the people around him who had to have enabled his horrific behavior. His family members who know of his history of abusing women, his male friends who listened to female friends try to share their experiences and brushed them off or gaslit them. His roommates who participated in or witnessed his crimes and kept quiet. The fucking POLICE who have done nothing to keep my city safe from this man or take my reports seriously or compassionately, despite him having multiple prior arrests and restraining orders against him. And most of all heartbroken at all the women before me who felt so alone and like they couldn't come forward. And I feel guilty that I'm just a little bit angry at all of them too, because I wish just one of them had felt like I did, that I had to stop this from happening to the next girl. Because I was the next girl. And I'm forever changed.
I don't know where to go from here other than to a courtroom, but so much work lies ahead of me. Of us. I'm in therapy and taking each day as it comes. Several of the other survivors who've had years to heal are standing behind me and helping holding the pieces together, but it's hard. And after what I heard today, I feel broken.
But I'm also spiritually wound tighter than I ever have been. Maybe the universe somehow connected us to give him one last chance to learn empathy and be a good person and partner, and give me one last chance to step away from men who disrespect my boundaries the first time. And we both failed. But the result of those failures is broken cyclesI will never let a man disrespect me again for the rest of my life, and D will not be able to continue his pattern of abuse. Perhaps our paths crossed for me to be my own savior whilst being his undoing. All I know for sure is that I am not fucking alone anymore. None of us are alone anymore. And I'm hopeful that our power in numbers will deliver him the consequences he deserves.
Thank you for reading. Please, MEN, and women, and everyone in between, believe. women. when they come forward. Believe them the first time.

1j4soab,How Do You Heal After Your Own Mother Wishes You Weren't Here?,"I'm really sorry for posting something this heavy. I know it's a lot, and I hate to put this out there, but I just need to get it off my chest.
A couple of months ago, I had a conversation with my mother about how much I needed her love and care, both as a child and even now. I opened up to her, hoping she'd understand, but instead, she got angry, like I was attacking her just for expressing how I felt. The conversation spiraled, and out of desperation, I told her that I felt so unloved that I didn't want to be here anymore.
I thought maybejust maybeshe'd finally see how much I was hurting. But instead, she told me it would be better if I did it, that she wouldn't have to deal with an ""ungrateful brat"" anymore. I was so shocked I almost started crying, and then she added that if I was going to do it, I should make sure not to make a scene or end up on the newsbecause that would be an inconvenience for her. She even said she wanted to be there to make sure it looked like an accident.
That was the moment I knew I had to leave. And I did.
But I still don't know how to deal with what she said. I try to move on, but it keeps coming back. I have nightmares about it, and sometimes, I just sit there thinking about how my own mother could say something like that to me. It's messed up, and honestly, I don't know how to get past it. Some days, I just really wish I wasn't here at all.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 10:37:22 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j4sk2q,I (20m) am in love with my best friend (20f),"As the title says, I have fallen madly in love with my best friend. We've known each other for 2 years as we met at the start of college, and in our little friend group that consists of about 10ish people we are the closest. My passion for her has grown so much in the time that I've met her and gotten to know more about her. We have gone on many friendly dates to restaurants and coffee shops and we have made that a routine thing. We share so many interest like our music, taste in films, food, and fashion sense. We have even gotten matching tattoos together. Whenever either of us has something happen to us we immediately share it to each other. She has only been in two relationships and in both relationships she was only used for sex and her body. I have been in a similar situation where someone will be with me just for sex. But I don't care at all about her body, don't get me wrong she has an incredible one but it's not what I'm into. I'm into the way that she talks with me and the way that we share jokes. I know that If I was in a relationship and we never had any sex or I never even saw her naked I would still be incredibly in love with her because I'm in love with her soul and her being more than her physical body. I feel that I could give her anything she wants or needs in a relationship and I wanna tell her about my feelings, but I'm so afraid that if I do that I'll lose and if I do lose her than there's no point in me being in this existence.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 10:29:00 UTC,3,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j4sdte,"I (20F) just recently came out of a 2-year relationship, and it's only been a month since my ex and I broke up.","Now, my ex has moved on, and he's already seeing someone he claims is just a classmate. Meanwhile, I've recently started talking to an old friend. We grew up together, and we reconnected after I went to a fiesta with my friends. We drank together, and before I went home, I joined them for one more drink. He was there, along with some of my other childhood friends.
Out of nowhere, I started opening up to them when they asked about my ex. I told them we broke up, and from there, my conversations with this old friend started. It's not like we're talking 24/7, but I can sense that he has feelings for me. Have any of you experienced that feeling where you're with someone, and you start to feel like they like you?
Anyways, I enjoy his company. We've shared coffee, and last night we drank with some of our friends and then something happened between us, and when I woke up, I felt so badlike really sick. I regret it. It shouldn't have happened, but we were both so drunk.
Before I left, I remember him saying ""I love you,"" and that made me feel even worse. I don't like him in that way, and I'm still not healed from my past relationship.
Right now, I'm not responding to his messages because I don't know what to say. I feel like I should talk to him about what happened, but I can't seem to gather the courage.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 10:16:22 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0
1j4s9h6,"""So are you gonna be our new besties?"" The June 27th incident at Kings Island","Hey everyone,
For the second consecutive year, I stayed at Great Wolf Lodge from 6/23-6/27. I visited the park, Kings Island, on 6/25 & 6/27. In a perfect world, I'd love to tell you about everything I did, and the people I met. But unfortunately, the sense of joy, rejuvenation, and fulfillment I get by being there was tarnished by an incident that took place at the end of the trip, and at park closing on the 27th.
This post is as long as it is to make sure I cover all the details of what happened as specifically as I can. It's now been eight months since this took place, so I needed some time before I went public about this. What I hope to accomplish with this is to have a better understanding of the world from a unique perspective, and to use this as a learning tool to learn from someone else's misjudgements. I'm posting this with the complete acceptance, understanding that this story may bring some type of criticism in my direction, and honestly, to achieve some type of closure on this particular incident. With all that being said, I'll begin...
On the night of June 27th, I was in the Fast Lane Queue for ""Orion"" to get a Post-Fireworks Night Ride. That day, I was wearing a white Ross Chastain ""Gone Fishing"" Busch Light Car T-Shirt, Wrangler Jean Shorts, and All-Black Under Armour Men's Charged Rogue 4 Running Shoes. I was at the top of the steps and happened to introduce myself to two young ladies who were sitting against the fence in the station. To best describe it as many of you know, there's a 3-4 foot gap between the station and the stairs before you actually enter the station. If I was to guess, I originally thought these two females were in their early 20's, I'm 28 for context, but they ask me
""Are you gonna be our new besties???""
No girl has ever asked me a question like that. So I'm of the impression that they're attracted, to me, and assumed they're of legal age, so I jokingly responded
""Well, I'm gonna be leaving tonight, unless you had something else in mind""
And even if things worked out, I wouldn't have bothered because I have a 2 +/- Hour Drive in front of me back home to Louisville after I do this Night Ride. But the girls then look at each other very awkwardly and say something along the lines of
""Dude WE'RE 16!""
I profusely try to apologize, but they begin to overreact and make a scene in the station, escalating the situation, and start running down the steps of the normal queue. And I apologize to the greeter and to a ride attendant, because I didn't know that they were underage. As I'll explain later in more detail, that part of the situation, like all parts of this situation could've been resolved with an apology, and life could've went on. As this was misunderstanding.
Some may ask why I didn't just ask how old they were. I've been raised on the idea that asking women how old they are is inappropriate.
So I finished my ride which while it was spectacular, I'm kinda nervous about what happened beforehand as I head to my locker to retrieve my belongings. Mine was on the section closest to the On-Ride Photo Desk and I'm not able to open it, probably because the park is now closed, so the rental by default has expired. So while I'm about to get someone to help me get this locker opened, two teenage boys confront me very aggressively on the situation before the ride saying something in the realm of
""What are you doing touching up on these little girls!!! You should know better!!!""
""You wear that cross on your neck and do something like that?! How would god feel about that?""
*For context, I regularly wear either black or silver cross necklace. I've had many people make conversation about that.*
""I'm disappointed in you.""
""You're not going anywhere, until you apologize.""
They also asked if I was at Soak City earlier, which I was to check it out for the first time and look through some of the shops. But they claimed I made inappropriate physical contact with someone there to. Which I didn't.
I know that isn't exactly what these two gentlemen said, but it's what I remember as my anxiety ramped wondering how do I get outta this dilemma that just got handed to me on a silver platter. But a couple of things, I never groped these women. The park has security cameras everywhere, including in the coaster's stations, so there's proof that didn't happen, and I also attempted to explain to these two gentleman that I had no clue they were 16. Again, I thought they were in their early 20's, college age. But they weren't buying it as both told me
""BRO, YOU COULD TELL!""
Many women look older than they actually are. So you really can't sometimes.
But they both proceed to exercise public humiliation on me by shouting how I was, ""Touching up on little girls!"" to everyone who was leaving Area 72 that evening. Like they're the men from ""Dads Against Predators"" on Locals.
Finally, security steps in to figure out what was going on, and by the request of these young men. One guard originally begins to interview me, but then attends to the younger gentleman who initiated the confrontation, so another guard interviews me and I explain everything as detailed as I can, and as calm as I can l which in the moment, was pretty impossible to accomplish. I finally got my things outta my locker, then this guard escorts me to the front of the park to see what his supervisor or coworkers had to say on the matter, and they told me
""You're good to go sir, nothing else is gonna happen.""
""Next time when you're having small talk, just be more careful.""
So I walk the path back over to Great Wolf where my car was parked. I checked out from there that morning and was granted permission to keep my car parked there. But as I'm then at the North-End of the parking lot, in the small section that walks Southeast-to-Northwest, what appears to be a Black 2014 Honda Civic pulls up, and it's the teenagers again. The gentleman in the passenger side ask for my name, number, address, and zip-code. Which I like this whole time, cooperate and disclose it. And many of you may ask, why would you give your information to them? They aren't police or security. I thought that being honest, and cooperative would salvage my reputation in this situation. And what if they can tell that I'm lying. So after doing so, he says to me
""We just got banned for a month. This is my favorite place to go to. Have a good night, I love you.""
Then they take off into the night.
To be honest, I should've walked down Columbia Road instead of the walk path to avoid the possibility of further encounters. But at that point, I thought the teens left at that point. Or ask security to escort me to my car, if they're allowed to do that.
After filling up my car at the GoCo on Kings Mills Road, I began my drive home. I look over to my left on Southbound I-71 to look at the park one last time, despite it looking so spectacular in person at night, I was unable to enjoy it because of what all just happened.
Here's how this situation should've been resolved
If I were the girls, I'd peacefully, and politely inform me, ""Sorry to tell you, but we're actually 16.""
Then I'd have responded, ""My apologies, I didn't know that. I'll back off, I apologize.""
Then the girls should've said, ""You're fine. It's all good"". Then life would've moved on and the situation would've never escalated to the point it did.
But to begin with, if the girls never asked that question, none of this would have ever happened to begin with...
If I were either of the boys, I would have started with professionally and calmly said, ""Excuse me sir, you gotta minute to talk?""
And I would've said, ""Sure. No problem.""
They could've have offered to buy me a Dasani, then said, ""Do you know why we're wanting to speak with you??? Okay, there was an incident involving several young ladies in the station a few minutes ago, would you mind sharing your side of the story?""
And I would've done just that. So they have both sides of the story and develop a conclusion and they finished the meeting by stating, ""Okay, we believe you did make a mistake, you didn't know their age, just be more careful next time. Thank You for talking with us and have a good night.""
There's a reason for the saying, ""Cooler heads prevail."" You gotta assure everyone's calm in order to then get to the bottom of any situation. That never happened.
There also has to be a presumption of innocence established in the investigation process as well. That's why in the legal system, ""All suspects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law."" Which thanks to security for helping with this incident and siding with me on this.
On June 28th, one of the male parties in the incident made a post to this group that afternoon, which was a motive to making this post in response. I waited til' now to conduct this post so I made sure I could tell my side in the most detailed and comprehensive way possible. But prior to the post either being deleted, or taken down, I monitored it by reading all the comments throughout the time that post remained up. To start, I read that I was reported to Mason Police. I was waiting to see if either they would call me for an interview, I never did. I thought about calling them myself, but when talking to someone about the matter, they recommended I didn't. This individual also claimed in the comments
""I watched him do what he did.""
But in the post, he states
""2 girls came running down the stairs""
Which implies that he was either at the bottom of the stairs or still at ground-level. And in addition to the wall that divides the Fast-Lane queue to the regular queue after the show building, there would be no possibility for him to have seen the incident unfold. So it seems very contradicting.
Also, another user had stated
""the girls wouldn't of lied about something like that""
This where I channel my inner Alex Jones and become a tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist
In retrospect, hindsight is always 20/20, I believe the possibility that those girls asked me that question, ""Are you gonna be our new besties???"" to bait me. I'll even go a step further, that I'm of the belief that they might've been of legal age, but claimed they were 16 as a convenient excuse to cause a problem. I'm not saying that's the case, it's complete speculation. In today's society, select people love to cause and/or escalate issues to play the victim card because it gets them attention. On top of that, they also delivered misinformation by stating I had groped them. Like I mentioned earlier, there was a 4ft gap between us, that would've been impossible. And security cameras are everywhere, and if footage was pulled up, it shows I never did that. So they lied about that to artificially make the situation look worse to garner more attention and spark more outrage. This is why you have to hear both sides to the story, then develop the conclusion. Not just hear one side and ride with it. Again, what other reason would these two girls ask me that question?
In the minutes, hours, and days following, this has greatly & negatively affected my mental health as I've had many thoughts rush through my head. I thought maybe it was best I should wait a couple years before visiting again. I'm worried about the people around who witnessed what happened, how will they think of me? What's the ride attendants at Orion gonna think of me? What's gonna happen if these teens see me again? Are they gonna forget about what happened, or will they try to engage in some type of conflict? How will I be able to pick myself up from this? And am I sure I'll still be a positive asset to society? Thankfully, I didn't have to wait too long to answer that last question. On July 3rd, I visited Ark Encounter, and it felt therapeutic to be on I-71 again, then be around people again. While there, I'd happen to see a mom try taking a family photo, but she wouldn't be in it, so I'd ask
""Excuse me ma'am, if you wanna be in the shot, I'll take the photo.""
And that situation happened 4 or 5 times that day, and to see the sense of joy, appreciation, and thankfulness expressed by these families to me reassured that I was good person, and a positive asset to society.
I've talked to many people about this for advice and support. While at the Goco/Popeyes/Dunkin Donuts on Kings Mills Road to fill up, and I talked to the guy working there about this and mentioned it was teens just looking to cause issues. When I woke up Friday afternoon, I talked to my parents immediately about this, if I didn't, they'd notice something was bothering me. I also talked to select people at Work, on XBOX, and to other friends of mine, and everyone unanimously have said that I did nothing wrong, and agreed it was a misunderstanding. I wanna thank everyone who I've reached out to for support, as this has been a difficult time. I'm surprised everyone has sided with me on this, they didn't have to, but I'm grateful for helping me get through this.
I can only imagine the stress and anxiety women, especially attractive women feel in public. To go to any Zoo, Bar, Restaurant, Bowling Alley, Amusement Park, Movie Theater, etc. has to be sometimes unbearable. To always be looked at, or to have someone always making advances towards you has to feel vulnerable and invasive. With that in consideration, I do what's necessary to respect women's boundaries when out in public. So to even claim that I'm a Predator is absolutely inaccurate. As mentioned earlier, this was a misunderstanding. These girls asked a question that led me to assume they were attracted to me, and of age. I responded based off that, then they blew it out of proportion and caused a huge mess at the end of what was supposed to be another fun and memorable multi-day trip up there.
In conclusion, the last, absolute last things I'd want to do is make enemies inside the gates of Kings Island. Not within Mason, Ohio, not within Warren County, not within the Cincinnati Tri-State Area, and not within the State of Ohio period. And the other last thing I wanted is to be on the radar of the City of Mason Police Department. I imagine a day where I can call Mason, Ohio home, so I want to be on good terms with everyone I encounter. To the other parties involved if they read this post, I hope we can mutually apologize come to a better understanding of what took place so we can be on good terms with each other, achieve closure, and move forward on a positive note. I'm gonna be visiting the park again this year, so I don't want us to cross paths and have any further conflict or sense of animosity or discomfort. While I'm not wishing ill will on anyone, these four people possibly will be faced with a situation that's a misunderstanding as well. If so, I'd want their situation to be handled calmly and smoothened out as well and as quickly as possible so they don't face any hate or animosity from the opposing parties of whatever situation faces them. And I apologize to the two young men for getting banned. Y'all unfortunately, were denied the opportunity to see the Fourth of July Celebration fireworks display, and more valuable time to ride ""Orion"", ""The Beast"", or whatever y'all's favorite coaster might be. While I understand they were trying to stand up for what's right, it still wasn't the correct way to do so, and hopefully they learn from this as well. For me, I just use it as a learning experience to be extra careful on who I'm talking to, and not make decisions off assumptions. Which I apologize to the young ladies for doing so. I'm someone who's very respectful to people's boundaries, and wouldn't wanna make decisions about that makes someone feel uncomfortable. But I do hope they apologize for asking a question that expresses attraction, only to turnaround and cause a scene that could've been resolved with a simple apology. Nobody would've gotten banned, and security wouldn't have gotten involved. I'm gonna be presented with 1,000 different situations and scenarios, and I'll be fine in 925 of them. Nobody is perfect. Also, it's been important for me to allow time to heal the wounds as the situation shrinks farther in the past. I come to Kings Island for peace and serenity, not drama and distress. And this sadly, was drama and distress. I've met many people in my now four visits to the park and had wonderful converstations and engagements with those people, both fellow guests, and employees. It's very unfortunate this all happened, and was more heartbreaking that it happened at the very end of this trip I took. I refuse to allow that to be the last memory I have of the park this year.

1j4s0t1,Engagement,"Call me whatever you like, but I just found my boyfriend's receipt for our engagement ring. It was less than $500.
He told me he couldn't buy me anything for Christmas because he was saving up for the ring when he proposed. I know how much he makes, and the bills he contributes to. The ring was nowhere near that amount. He spent the bare minimum. This ring was an afterthought.
I told him what I wanted out of a proposal: please have my nails done, and please let my friends and/or family be around to see the moment.
Neither of those things were done.
I'm disappointed. I'm happy to be engaged but it's been almost a month since it's happened and I can't let it go.

I hate being a burden on people, most of the time I hide my pain. I am good at that up to a point. Probably most people who technically know me have no idea how sick I actually am while the people who really know me are unfortunately, more exposed to how bad it is for me.
Yesterday morning I was in PAIN, like absurd pain, like the worst pain I have ever felt. I've felt that exact pain exactly 3 other times in my life. All 3 times I was rushed to the ER under the assumption that my appendix was having kittens or something. No appendix issues were found and eventually, after about 12 hours of hell, the pain goes away. This time was no different, except this time I knew there was no reason to go to the hospital, at aprox 11 hours in it finally subsided and I was able to crash.
My best friend/roommate (M24) was in the house for the first half of this. Mind you I was moaning, scream crying and begging the universe for help most of the morning. I told him the about going to the hospital each time before and receiving no help and no answers. He seemed concerned but that was it. He didn't even check on me before leaving for the day. (I was supposed to be puppy sitting while he was at work.
My bf (M36) came over about two hours after the pain subsided. He was very informed about how the day had gone for me as I had been texting him all day while he was stuck at work and school. He barely acknowledged my condition when he came in, still glued to his phone even though I started bawling like a baby as soon as he came in. I know his day wasn't easy, I ended up massaging his arm, and even skipping the snuggs and cry session I had requested via text, to hold space for how he was doing emotionally. We went to bed. He did ask how my pain was and spent a moment checking for classic appendicitis symptoms. But he was a million miles away......
I know that I am always in pain and I don't want people to dote on me but I felt so invisible and neglected today I could almost blow away in the wind. I don't think anyone did anything wrong. My whole family does the same thing (remember I've been in pain my whole life). I'm just kind of devastated. I had one of the hardest most painful days of my life, and I did it alone, I still need to cry, I still need to be held.......",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 09:23:01 UTC,0,4,0.5,,,0,0
1j4rccj,My grandpa used thousands of dollars out of my grandmas account and then DIED.,"So recently my granfather died, He was a sweet guy as far as any of us knew him. He wasnt very active in recent years, in fact he was terribly sick for most of my (f20) life and id either see him at the hospital or on the couch barely breathing.
So tell me why my grandma (whos a bit of a oversharer) told me about the family drama aka my grandpa took out thousands of dollars in cash from their bank account. My grandma found out shortly before he died when she found a bag full of cash and had their kid (my father) investigate. They planned on having a family intervention and question him on where the money has gone but then he just died!
It wasnt a surprise for anyone that he died but like goddamn what could this old man use all that money for??
Like he would barely get out of bed he was so sick. I got his old car and its bittersweet, and im just so genuinely confused as to what he couldve blown all this money on and also terrified that there might be more in the car or other places.

1j4r7st,"Moved to Spain, Started a Business, and Got Fired. Now I'm Stuck Advice?","# How I Started a Bag Store and What Went Wrong
# loudspeaker Why I'm Writing This Post
I want to share my story about how I started a business from scratch, faced unexpected challenges, and now find myself at a crossroads. This isn't just about bagsit's about resilience, risks, and the struggle to keep going when everything seems to work against you.
I genuinely want to hear your thoughts because, honestly, I don't know what to do next.
# house Life Before Everything Changed
Before all of this, my family and I had stable jobs, and life was fairly predictable. But then, everything shifted. My parents lost their jobs, and I had to step up to support them. I also had to make the tough decision to send my wife and child abroad to ensure their safety while I stayed behind and worked.
I took a job as the head of security for a wealthy businessman. Every cent I made went to supporting my family. I lived on the bare minimum, just making sure I could keep going physically and mentally.
# handbag How the Idea of the Store Was Born
My mother, after months of being unable to work, started looking for a way to do something productive. She remembered the small bag-making business that my wife and I had started before the pandemic, which we had to shut down due to COVID-19.
She decided to try reviving it, and we applied for a small business grant. The process was slow, and after waiting nearly a year, we were approvedbut for much less money than we had originally planned for. We had to decide whether to take the risk and move forward or let the idea go.
# light_bulb Why We Decided to Start the Business Anyway
My mother had no prior experience in fashion or sewingshe had worked in an office her entire life. But she was determined to learn. I helped her enroll in **bag design and sewing courses**, and she began developing the first models.
Meanwhile, in my free time, I worked on setting up our **Etsy store**. We put everything we had into making this business work.
# airplane A New Opportunity and Another Setback
While all of this was happening, my employer decided to relocate to **Valencia, Spain**, and offered me a job there. It seemed like a great opportunity, so I moved my family and followed him.
Over several months, I:
* Helped relocate his family and others.
* Assisted in finding and purchasing a new business (a plywood factory for investment purposes).
But after everything was set up, he **fired me** without warning, leaving me unemployed in a foreign country with no backup plan.
# man_shrugging Where Are We Now?
Right now, my family and I are living in Spain, relying on **our last savings (enough for about 45 months)**. Meanwhile, our **Etsy store has not generated a single sale**, and my mother is struggling to keep up with rent for the workshop.
# red_question_mark What Are We Doing Wrong? I Need Your Advice!
* **Our bags are high-quality, handcrafted leather pieces.** We set the price range at **XY$**, but we haven't made a single sale.
* We tried advertising on **Etsy and Instagram**, but conversion is extremely low.
* Maybe we've chosen the wrong target audience, or our product descriptions aren't engaging enough?
magnifying_glass_tilted_right **Please check out our store and give honest feedback!** Maybe you'll see mistakes that we're not noticing? Any advice or critique would help us understand what needs to change to keep this business alive.
**I'm attaching the store link and a video of our production process. I'd be grateful for any input!** folded_hands",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 08:48:59 UTC,0,0,0.17,,,0,0

1j4qjzv,How to escape unhealthy mindset,"Sometimes I just want to choke myself to death.
Theoretically, I can't; it is the given nature of humans to respond to threats, so instead, I just smash objects and choke my pillow. I got angry and aggressive even with the slightest trigger, but I didn't want to hurt anyone around me, so I tried to keep my mouth shut and lock myself up whenever I felt crazy.
A little bit of background. I was terribly sucks at social interaction, and during work, I was feeling useless. My boss was kind as they explained to me that I have to show more passion and that they cannot offer to extend my contract, which I agree with. However, I was somehow irritated with some of my seniors' words, and I kept replaying those words in my head to the point that it hurt my chest and exploded my head.
Whenever I recall that conversation, I just slapped myself really hard multiple times, and I got addicted to that; I just stopped slapping because I knew I could not die, and dealing with a dizzy head after torturing myself was not a good idea.
I don't want to blame anyone, as it is my choice after all, but having these unhealthy behaviors has taken a toll on my mental health and affects my job hunting. Now I dream every night about people speaking ill of me.
As I am writing this, I no longer understand why I was having that kind of thought during my rant; most of the time after the burst out, my mind just blacked out and proceeded with anything I was doing previously like nothing ever happened. But thoughts like this keep coming randomly, and I'm afraid that I could eventually hurt myself or someone.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 07:58:36 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0

1j4qbra,Unexpected invitations bother me,"Let me explain
I get really bothered when I make plans or I am a part of plans where I am the driver and someone invites someone unexpectedly. Aka gives them a seat in my car without asking me.
For context my car seats 5 people including the driver, so 4 seats for passengers. Also, I'm the only one in my immediate friend group with a car.
Usually if my friends and I have plans, we're taking my car. I don't have an issue with that as we fit in my car and I'd rather do that than spend unnecessary money on an uber. If we're planning something as a group I make sure to communicate with my group and tell them who I've personally invited so that way no one's surprised. I get really bothered when I show up to pick people up and they have someone extra that they didn't tell me about. I get especially annoyed if it's someone I dont know and they just expect me to give a ride..
This really annoys me because:
1. Usually my car is full because as i said, im the only one in my immediate friend group with a car. So if im offering to give you a ride, thats not an invitation to invite other people. ESPECIALLY people i dont know. You dont know who else ive offered a ride to and its not your car to offer !!!!
2. To me it seems extremely rude and entitled. I dont care how close of friends we are, at least give me the heads up that you're bringing someone else. Im not a bitch, i wont say no just bc idk them or like bc it was unexpected. I just get extremely annoyed when you dont even give me the courtesy of asking???? Again its not your car to offer spots in. And if its a group plan, you dont know if im giving other people rides !! If you would have asked me ""hey, i invited x person, can you give them a ride too?"" I can have the chance to say ""oh sorry my car is full im sorry!""
But no, u just show up with them and then im in the awkward position of turning them away bc theres no space and then i look like a bitch
I just want the courtesy yk??? And ive communicated to my friends how it bothers me and how if they plan on inviting someone else and they are expecting ME to give them a ride, ASK ME !
I literally just let one of my friends know yesterday privately how much it bothered me and he said ok. He proceeded to do it again today so instead of waiting till we were in private, i just told him in front of his guest i said ""im sorry my car is full. I have to go pick up my friend so theres no extra seats. if you wouldve let me know then maybe i couldve saved her a seat but i didnt know she was coming."" And he claimed to ""not know"" that his guest was gonna come but he literally invited her -_-. And again I literally would not have had a problem saving her a seat!! He just NEVER told me he invited her so i offered rides to other people!!!! Wtf
This is rational right? Or am i just being mean. I definitely couldve worded it better bc in the end i did make his guest feel a bit bad but i was just so frustrated! Especially since i had JUST talked to him about this yesterday!!!!! It lowkey makes me feel taken advantage of like why cant u just give me the courtesy of telling me who u plan to bring into MY car. Im literally not even stingy with giving rides either, 95% of the time i say yes unless i absolutely cant. So WHY NOT JUST ASK ME. Cause now i look mean and like a bitch.

1j4q5vg,54 and struggling,"Hi. I when I was 12 I was playing in an arcade on the slot machines and a guy came up to me and started feeding my machine with cash. I went back every week and he paid whilst I played. This happended over a period which I cannot remember and then one day he started to stroke my penis. Nobody had ever touched me here before so naturally my body reacted and I got erect even though i was scared as hell.
I continued to go back for six months then one day he took me to a cafe on the pier and bought me dinner. Burger chips etc. He undid my zip on my trousers and got my cock out and jerked me off and I came my first ever ejaculation. I keep blaming myself because I kept going back to get jerked off and fed. My mom was single parent and dad moved away. I was left alone for hours when she was working.
I now realise I was groomed and sexually assaulted . I still have these feelings of excitement when I remember this first time which then turn immediately to disgust at myself for saying nothing and letting it continue.
I have had therapy when i was 16. Long story but I was addicted to the machines by now and another guy started doing the same and pay me 40 for the privilege. The money just went back on the machines.
This second guy groomed me so much I ended up going to his flat to see his spectrum computer and he continued there which turned to blowing me and paying me 40. The last time i went he raped me. I ran away after and stayed out late and the police were out looking for me. I was scared to go home as much bottom was so painful.
The police found me hiding under the pier and took me home. I told them and mum that I had realised I was late home and rather than face the music stayed out as I was scared of getting into trouble. So naturally I was in a vicious circle the later it became.
The accepted it and nothing was said about the assault. I don't remember how I dealt with the pain but my brain has blocked some stuff out.
FF three years and the police turned up at myself home and said I had been exposing my penis to the public. I seriously honestly have no recollection of this at all. They cautioned me and my mum shouted and screamed when they went asking why until I broke down after she said 'has someone hurt you"".
She got the police back and I made a statement. To this day I've never been told what happened the guy. Whethery they caught him or not but I never had to go to court. For years I thought they filed it nfa as I was just a dirty rent boy who deserved what he got. I feel let down by the police as I know now that I was a child and it was grooming secual assault and rape.
I am a gay man and have never been able to "" take it"" (sorry for the crudeness) due to the memory. I know it's not everything but I know I'm a disappointment for not being a real gay man. When I have these feelings of not being good enough for anyone or deserving of anything I struggle and want to run away. As i am a let down to others for not getting over it. I've been in a relationship for 28nyesrs and my partner he knows everything but I still regularly have these days of being not enoug, people pleasing and feeling like everyone would be better without me.
For some reason I just had my first nightmare in over 35 years and it started with the first day of being touched at 12 and ended with the rape and police. I woke up [to my disgust] with an erection which soon went down when i was awake. I feel sick and can't believer my body reacted in this way to a traumatic memory. I have felt guilty all these years that the guys who assaulted me made me erect and ejaculate but the therapist said it was just a natural reaction to being touched down there. And I've accepted it wasn't my fault. Until now. That dream has taken me back over 40 years and to wake up erect makes me wanna kill myself. What sick fuck am i? Or was it my 12 year old inner person that made me.erect. I am due at work in a cople of hours and can't face the world. I am disgusted with myself again after all the years of counselling and accepting i was a child and they we're adults and as such I took no blame whatsoever.
But this fucking nightmare has moved the goalposts. Why the fuck would I wake up sexually excited over something so traumatic?
The only thing I can think of is yesterday my partner and I and his sister found out their dad, my dad in law has secondary cancer and metastatic cancer which is obious a traumatic. Could this trigger earlier trauma? But the sick feeling of waking up with an erection makes me feel so low i can't tell anyone. I won't kill myself dw. I am a people pleaser and would never put my friends and family through that. I have cptsd as 8 years ago my best mate took his life and I found him. So I could never put others through what I have
So in not killing myself I am a failure to me twice. As I am pleasing others instead of me. I just wanna go back to the day before yesterday when I felt a normal person. Instead a funked up freak of nature.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 07:28:56 UTC,2,1,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING: SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j4oji3,"I'm growing sick of my mentally ill, su*cidal partner and I'm too scared to end things.","Headline says a lot.
I'm dating someone that is very, very openly suicidal and refuses to get help for it. Seems like no matter what I do nothing gets through to him about finding help, speaking with someone far more qualified than I am or even admitting he needs to get things under control before he puts himself in even worse health. I constantly have to hear him complaining about how everything is everyone else's fault, the world turned its back on him and how nothing matters since nothing goes right for him anyway.
It's wearing me down. Hard.
I try so hard to see things on the other side and keep suggesting that he sees someone about this because I can only do so much but now it's to the point where I want to slap the **shit** out of him and try to literally knock some sense into him before having him committed against his will so someone can drug him enough to where he's far less annoying. Only thing is I love him so much that I can't do anything but go along with it because i'm petrified of waking up one day after being honest with him and finding out he did himself in.
I have no one to talk to about this. My friends keep telling me to leave him and they see how tired I am from dating him and constantly trying to keep his spirits up. I know we're heading down that road if this keeps up, but I also know that if we do end things I'll always be dreading *that* phone call letting me know he took his own life. I also know that once this is over, i'll never date again because i'll never be able to open myself up to potentially dating another selfish, suicidal asshole who only thinks about themselves.
I also know that without him, i'll likely be so stressed and lonely i'll have a broken heart to deal with and that'll do me in. I'm finding my own therapist to talk to about all of this, but goddamn it I can't handle another night of him being brutally honest about wanting to die and I just sit here and quietly take hearing about it.
My love life hasn't ever been perfect but I was hoping *so badly* this would be the one relationship to finally break my streak of finding someone to be with that wasn't me clinging on to the first person who gave me some sort of genuine attention. I should have known finding love that would stick around was never meant for me. I don't even know why I bothered in this relationship, I should have known the happiest i've ever been in life with someone by my side would also be the most miserable i've ever been.
I don't know what else to do. Only thing I can think of is just staying the course and seeing what happens. Typing all this out helped but I know this time tomorrow morning i'll wake up and realize i'm still going to be with someone that refuses to help himself and it's just a matter of *when* not *if*.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 05:38:58 UTC,2,1,0.67,,CONTENT WARNING: SUICIDE/SELF HARM,0,0

I hated the lies, I hated the neglect, and HATED your mother that you always put above me, despite her being an abusive woman. I hate that you caused my spiral towards a mental breakdown that had me in a psych hold for two weeks. I know you hated when I left. I know you hated when I slept with your best friend just to hurt you. I know you hated me for hating you. I know how much you meant that final I love you when I finally left. After years of pain and lies I just couldn't do it anymore and just broke. Every I love you was a lie, every single memory of us was a lie. How could I just move on from that revelation? You never cared as much as I did. Not till I left. And yet, it's been 5 years, you have a real job, you are taking care of yourself, you've changed so much and fuck do you look so amazing. It's no secret my love life has sucked, as apparently so has yours. Why can I just go back to hating you. Why can't I just not care that you care. It's been 5 years. Is that enough time to heal and be friends?",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 05:33:37 UTC,2,4,0.6,,,0,0
1j4o5u0,I can't forgive my friend for how she treated me,"What she did hasn't had lasting financial or safety effects on me, but I just feel pissed that she had the thought to treat a human like that. I was meant to go to a concert with her and one of her friends. Everything was fine until a few hours before when she decided to started making long messages and voice notes about how everything was just going to crazy and chaos. I was informed last minute that her friend has problems being at concerts and around any people due to social anxiety. I said I understood as I had suffered with it (still do at times) and had only really gotten over it recently. And then it just gets worse and worse ""can't pick you up anymore"" ""my friend isn't calming down, she's been freaking out about this since we bought the tickets months ago."" ""We probably won't talk to you much you might just had to stand a hit away from us."" ""You can be there just do your own thing"" I told her to just tell me if I can't come and she told me it's probably best if I don't. 11 year friendship, just treated like an ant on the ground stepped in on and killed. I asked her why she didn't just tell me MONTHS ago if her friend was uncomfortable with me there. I could have made other plans or tried to message her friend, help her know that I won't judge her and she doesn't have to interact with me if she's uncomfortable. But I was left with 4 hours to get other plans. Thankfully sold my ticket last minute but lost lots of money from it. I got mad at her but I don't know if I feel sorry. A friend of mine that knows her too, but it's not like we'd ever all hung out or even mention eachother to eachother, said maybe I should have been more considerate and just left it because her sister had passed away a few years ago and she still struggles. I told her I understand that, I don't expect her to not ever be affected my that again. But I also told her that I won't be excusing her if she treats me badly. When I've grieved I've never used it as an excuse to treat people badly. I've heard other stories about her not treating people the best, and I feel like she now hides behind this and uses grief as her excuse. I never got an actual apology, just a ""idk what to say"". I'm not putting this up to grief, even if it was it doesn't excuse what she did. She had months of time to inform me that the situation may not have been appropriate, as her friend is uncomfortable around anyone new and had been ""anxious for months leading up to this"" (her words) I don't need the full diagnosis and pry into her friends life because I'm not entitled to that. But if I had just been told months before that she was feeling anxious about going to a a concert with an unfamiliar person, I could have seen if the friend wanted to meet in a quiet place with the mutual friend or meet over text. Or I could have made other plans. It's fine now, it's been a little bit of time since then. I don't talk to her much at all only if I have a question, but I don't forgive her for the reason that she treated a human like that.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 05:15:51 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j4o0dx,I broke up w/ him 2 months ago,"We've(F24) been together for a year and he(M25) was my first in everything. Everything just hurts and it's been 2 months since our break up. 2months I've been losing sleep but I'm still functional. He still wants us to be together but I'm keeping myself away because I know our relationship won't change and we just keep going on cycles of his outburst and me wanting him to understand my side. He always told me I was an exception because when his with me he tries to control his anger. He mentioned having anger issues. But one time when we got argument he left me alone and drove himself back home. I know it was my fault for making him mad but do I deserve being left alone and it was raining at that time. There are other circumstances but hey atleast he didn't lay his hands on me right. He says communicate with him but when I do why do it turns to an argument. I've tried breaking up with him few times but he has his ways to make me feel guilty and I'll always come back. I think about the good times we had everyday at the same time I had to say to myself I don't feel secure anymore in that relationship and I have to think of the my future. It was my bday today and he sent me a greeting then the convo went to him wanting to go back to our relationship. I had to slap myself and block him for good.
I just wanna rant. Maybe someone here has the same situation as me. I can't wait to feel like being me again. I just miss myself.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 05:06:32 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j4nzqe,I Lost my Job,"I went into work tonight like any other night (I work third shift), and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I was assigned to a work station like any other night, nobody was giving me weird looks or anything, just a normal night. Recently, I was given a warning for too many absences, and I acknowledged that, but I was under the impression that my last two absences were excuse because I brought in a note from a doctor. About a week after my last absence from work, my alarm didn't wake me up in time for work, and I ended up being thirty minutes late. At the time, nobody said anything, so I took that to mean that there were no problems. That was a week ago.
I know that I fucked up. They don't pay me to be absent, and there are plenty of people willing to take my job if I'm not performing well enough, and I can't perform well if I'm not there. I can't tell my family yet. It's me, my ex, and three step-sons. I am currently our only source of income because my ex is waiting to have her second pelvic fusion surgery. She will - in theory - be able to work after her second surgery, but in the meantime I'm the only one. We do get some assistance, but we are hanging by a thread at any given moment.
I'm scared, I'm angry at myself, and I feel numb at the same time. I'm typing this less than an hour after it happened, I don't think that it's sunk in yet. I will tell my family tomorrow, and I will also start applying for jobs tonight. I just feel like such a failure. What kind of 39 year old can't consistently do something as simple as show up to work when they're supposed to?
My instinct is to make excuses and point fingers, but I'm the one who is in charge of my actions. I'm trying to find the silver lining and use this is a learning experience, but it's hard.

1j4nzfg,"Spent the weekend with someone special, and I regret it","I (36f) went on a weekend trip with this guy (43m). He lived abroad most of his life so he doesn't know our tourist destinations that well. We went to this tiny town that everyone who lives here has been to multiple times, and because it was a long weekend, everything was fully booked, so our hotel was far away from the town's center.
I liked him for almost half a year, but I've known him for years, he is one of my favorite artists and he has a very niche IG account. We met in person last year and we were both awe struck about each other when we met, like I couldn't believe how handsome he was in person and he kept asking me to hug him, I could feel him smelling my hair.
I went to visit him while I was abroad in his city back in January, and when I saw him he totally tricked me into getting to his apartment and well... We ended up doing it. But I didn't want to catch feelings for him, so I decided not to visit him again while I was in his city.
He then decided to come visit here for the long weekend. He's pretty handsome and definitely draws female attention to him, and he always tells me about all the girls that approach him in public. I guess he wants to make me jealous? Anyway, I punch back and I tell him about the guys I date. Dumb little game, I know.
So, this weekend we went on this trip together, since he doesn't know his way around I had to be on top of the booking. I booked two separate bedrooms. My plan was to have a nice weekend with him and NOT GET ATTACHED, because tbh he's way too handsome and I don't think I could manage all the jealousy that comes with having someone like him as a partner.
The getaway went ok, We couldn't get our hands of each other, but my poor planning skills ruined some parts of the trip and he was noticably irritated, but didn't blame it on me. I ended up knowing him better, we had long talks, he was very sweet to me. He showed me some of his work unedited. We talked about our childhoods and all.
At some point he said something like ""I know that for you this is something superficial"" , and when I asked him what he meant he said that he knew I was there for the sex and that I only used guys for pleasure. I told him that I actually had admired him for years and that I wasn't at all interested in sleeping with him when we first met, I was just so glad to meet one of my favorite artists. And I did tell him I cared deeply about him, but I knew that I wasn't special for him at all either, and I had no reason to believe he wanted anything else than just having a good time with me, as he is surrounded by beautiful woman all the time, I was just the flavor of the week. He seemed a bit offended by that comment , he said he doesn't see girls that way and that he only opens up to someone special. We agreed that we both like each other and we both cafe for each other , so that the best thing would be to take advantage of the time together, and maybe do physical stuff while we still can when we have the chance, but remain good friends until we're old.
I don't know, it was a weird conversation and i can't shake the feeling that he was just trying to make me say that I was in love with him or something because of his narcissistic nature. I have shielded my heart from guys like him years ago because I know falling for them doesn't ever end well.
Anyway, at the end of the trip we couldn't get a bus back to our city and he got pretty mad. I felt awful and I wasn't looking forward to spend the next 3 hours next to him being mad. But he explained to me that it was just his survival skills, nothing personal. He went back to being all touchy feely and even told me he had referred to me as ""his wife"" to some lady who asked him who I was to him. I told him he was full of it, I knew he was just trying to manipulate me. He fell asleep on my lap for most of the trip , holding my hand while I caressed his hair. He drooled on my pants and he was so embarrassed haha so sweet.
And then.... Once we arrived and left the bus, he just asked me if I could get a bus to my place from where we were. Plain and cold. I said yeah , so he just turned around and said see ya then! No kiss, no hug, nothing. I called him out on it, he turned around, gave me a small peck kiss and then went away.
I was just in awe about how he could just shift from being so sweet to basically abandoning me there like as I was some stranger.
I think thats what really bothers me. We shared some good moments, and I opened up about my feelings for him. I told him that maybe we couldn't be good as a couple because neither one of us is willing to settle down, but that I did want him in my life as a friend as I admired him too much. And he agreed! But the way he left me there just made me feel like he never really cared.
And I am here now as a 36 yo woman crying like a teenager because I feel I lost someone I was really starting to care about.
I know I can't get his heart , I'm not special, I'm not as pretty , and I am old, so I don't even entertain the idea of him ever falling for me, and I know, I knew since we started this whole thing to prevent myself from getting hurt. but I did want to be able to maybe go out with him for coffee and talk about art for years. I wanted a friendship.
I'm so confused.
I guess I just wanted to write about it and get it off my chest so that it doesn't eat me anymore. I don't want to, and I also can't tell my friends because he is kind of famous in our circles (and one of my best friends told me he was a major player so I should stay away from him), and I'm kind of embarrassed of how it played out.
I miss him. I messaged him a few hours after I got home back from our trip, he just put a heart react on my message and that was it. I don't think I can push it anymore, I should wait for him to write me, and I'm dying thinking he might never write again. Ah well, I ended up being hurt despite all my efforts not to.

1j4njw2,"I'm helping someone and everyone tells me I'm a great person for that, but I don't really feel that way.","There is this girl I'm helping out because she was kicked out of her place. She is not my friend just an acquaintance of a good friend of mine. She is staying with me for a bit because I have the space. I also got her a job at the same warehouse I'm at. Everyone is telling me that it is such a nice thing to do and that I'm such a good person.
Honestly, I don't feel that way. I usually just respond with ""I'm just doing what I wish someone would do for me on that situation"". I don't really feel that way, I don't really care about it. The only reason some people at work know (my boss and a few coworkers in management) it's because I don't want rumors going around seeing us on the same car or getting in together.
I know I'm supposed to feel flattered about the compliments and all that, but it just feels awkward to me. There was a time I would be happy for all the good comments, but now it just feels hollow.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 04:39:19 UTC,1,2,1.0,,,0,0
1j4njl4,What is the actual contribution of entertainers and influencers to society?,"What is the actual contribution of entertainers and influencers to society?
Growing up, I always thought about what my contribution to society would be. I believed that a meaningful life should involve helping others in a tangible waywhether it's building bridges, being a doctor who treats patients, a teacher who educates, or even a wedding planner who helps people organize one of the most important days of their lives. Even a makeup artist contributes by helping people feel comfortable in their own skin through skillful techniques.
But when I look at idols, entertainers, and influencers, I can't help but wonder: What is their actual purpose beyond surface-level happiness? Sure, they make people feel entertained, maybe even inspired, but does that really compare to professions that create real change?
And yet, these are the people society worships the most. They get millions, live in luxury, and are treated like they've accomplished something greatwhile doctors, engineers, teachers, and everyday workers struggle for recognition or financial stability. It feels unfair that popularity is more valuable than actual contribution.
I know entertainment is a part of life, and I'm not saying it's useless. But on a deeper level, I wonder what even is their life purpose? If your whole job is just singing, dancing, or making videos, what's the end goal? It's not like they're solving world problems, creating lasting change, or advancing society.
Does anyone else ever think about this? Or am I just overanalyzing it?",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 04:38:48 UTC,1,3,1.0,,,0,0
1j4nhml,My grandma is mentally ill and i have no idea what to do,"tldr - got a call from a hospital stating that my grandma is in a catatonic state and is using the bathroom on herself in jail.
My (19F) grandma (58F) is severely mentally unstable. She can't hold a job due to her mental issues she is bipolar and i suspect maybe she might have schizophrenia. I noticed within the past year that she was going down a mental decline. In september things blew up. I get a call one day from her and she started yelling and screaming that somebody put a bomb in the trucks gas tank. She told me to take everyone's names to which i did so she would calm down. i was not taking her seriously because this has happened before just not to this extent. She immediately starts screaming ""Do you want me to die???"" So i took names. Which was consisted of people that didnt like her.
Her roommate who she does not get along with was pounding on the door and the cops were circling around her windows according to her. she ended up taking her barricade down that she had up and went to the hospital. She gets out the hospital and proceeds to go back to the hospital 3 days after getting released. Her roommate told us he got an eviction notice for her (it's his house). My mom (35F) tried to cool the situation down and we didn't hear about it again. Okay, then she gets out a second time. She goes back to her house, she calls me for a couple days and then its radio silent. Time passed and we went to see her and her roommate tells us she went to jail. Okay wtf happened. She dumped his urine containers for the hospital on him and broke a window.
November passes by. I haven't gotten a call from jail. I go put money on her card. Still nothing. I contacted the police multiple times to get in contact with her. ""You gotta call this department"" ""We will tell an officer"" Well fuck you because its been weeks and i haven't heard jack shit. One day in mid december i get a call. The jail transferred her to the hospital so now she is going to the psych ward. She takes the phone and we started talking and she told me that people died and how they died in jail and how the jail straight jacked her. Sent her to a psych ward. She calls me everyday and cries and screams at me to get her out and that they discharged her. She spends her birthday in jail and I wasnt allowed to see her. She gets out on new years eve. My mom and I know she is getting evicted but we don't know if she knows yet. I barely know whats going on. We go back to her house.
They greet each other and i catch their conversation and he tells her to get her stuff out. We take her back to our house. I give her my room and i stay by my boyfriends house. She stayed in bed for 3 days. Just sleeping. She ends up getting in contact with another one of her old roommates and he said she can stay with him. My grandma had gotten an injury 2 years ago and won a case for it, and was waiting to get her money. I have no idea how legal stuff and money work. She stays by friend for a couple days and then her roommate called me and told me she went to jail. This was 2 in the morning. She got out December 31st and went back to jail January 5th. I look up her charges and she had 4 counts of breaking a restraining order and unauthorized entry of a dwelling. Bond at $19,000. February passes. We have not heard anything and we got mail from her lawyer. We learn she was carrying $1,000 when she went to jail.
I just now get a call from another hospital. Nurse says she is discharged. Huh?? I call my mom and she doesnt want to go get her, same case with my uncle. And im trying to figure out what to do when the nurse calls again and proceeds to tell me there was a miscommunication between nurse and officer. Grandma was going back to jail. ""Why did they bring her back"" I asked. Nurse said she had an ankle monitor on and the officers left her. But turns out they came back for her. Wtf!!? ""Well, may I ask why she's there?"" The nurse tells me everything came out negative and that she didn't have paralysis or anything. Yeah well turns out my grandma has been in a catatonic state and was using the bathroom on herself. Nurse said it's not physical it's psychiatric. They took her back to jail Nobody seems to care. My mom is fed up with her and my uncle doesn't do a damn for her. Im so upset. What do I do? They changed her medicine and she broke. She isn't moving. She is using it on herself. What do I do?? What can I do? Im sorry for making such a long post and that everything is everywhere. Im so stressed. Is there a way to get in contact with her? Her lawyers? What do I even do.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 04:35:39 UTC,4,2,0.84,,,0,0
1j4ndms,My cousin abused me,"I guess my cousin abused me
Idk if this is the right sub. I found the confession sub tonight but the rules didn't seem right for this, but I kinda felt like talking about it.
I have never talked about this once in my life. Ever. This is so weird.
When I was 7 my 12-year old cousin asked if I wanted to practice kissing while my dad had put us down for a nap. (My dad putting us down for a nap at that age is also weird to me now as an adult but anyway, that's what happened)
Well basically what happened was it went a bit further but the way I remember it is her shutting me down after I was cool with it after. I don't want to get too into the details.
It's one of those things where I have never been upset with her about it at all. In my mind we were both children. Even as an adult, I wonder what happened to her? But I think I've also never really seen it as abuse or whatever. Is there a way to reconcile it without demonize the perpetrator? Because I don't think she deserves that.
I should probably saying this to a therapist and not Reddit but it's kind of one of those things I tend to feel like it out of my mind but obviously it's probably not.
Anyway. I'm honestly nervous posting something so vulnerable on the internet but it's a throwaway and I can delete so. But. I've never said this to a single soul.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 04:29:22 UTC,3,3,1.0,,,0,0

I'm not saying I didn't care about it before, but I'm more of someone who puts more importance in compatibility and personality than anything else.
Well, it's been months and it's finally hitting me how much he's struggling. He spent most (if not all) of his savings and had to leave his decent paying job because he took care of his family. Now, he's struggling to look for a better job and is stuck in his low paying job. I can't help but worry for our future.
Don't get me wrong. I don't want to break up with him. My partner's a great person and is trying his best to turn things around. I'm just scared because I don't know what the future holds, but I wish I didn't feel this way.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 04:26:43 UTC,1,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j4n9fx,Went to a bar with my friends and realized we were sitting opposite to a girl on a date with a guy I used to date,"To be honest, I'm just venting. I'm so indifferent to the whole situation. Also, I just want to share that I only wish him well and not trying to paint him as the bad guy. Just wanted to make some sense of the night.
The chances of it happening is just so little since he doesn't even live close to that neighborhood and it's not close to mine either. Somehow I ended up seeing him with another girl.
Immediately made me remember the last time we spent time together. To paint the picture, he kept rationalizing being not ready for monogamy with me. A lil context - he already talked about him only being/wanting to be in monogamy. He admitted to me that he was seeing other people while he was with me (context: we saw each other every other day-ish). Lastly, after trying to rationalize, he started talking about all things that his ex did to him that hurt him for an hour.
During that bit I didn't say a word and I just had my eyes down low, listening. He didn't even caring if I'm feeling anything in that moment. Not even checking in on me. Rambling about all details of why he called off the wedding for an hour. Which just reflects how unhealed he was.
He got up to use the washroom and mentioning returning and before he came back, my Uber was booked and already waiting for me.
I chose myself.
A bit more context - I'm not trying to paint him as the bad guy, he was nice to me but people can be flawed and unhealed. He was the one to start talking about future/plans/trips and we even started doing exercise together. He proudly showed me to his family and also was the one mentioning proudly that he's dating me
I admit though I'm happy for him to be going to dates, I felt a bit sad. Part of the sadness is some dysphoria. Seeing him with a cis girl made me feel gender dysphoria, I felt like I'm not as feminine as cis girls (which is partly true). Even thought that he must have left me because I'm trans - could be the truth but with a very little possibility, he's bi.
The past bunch of months, I have been thinking about it enjoying the happy return to singlehood and having nothing to do with dating.
I'm choosing peace of singlehood and enjoying company of the ones I love, giving them more time white_heart",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 04:22:44 UTC,6,5,1.0,,,0,0
1j4mzu2,My ex best friend tried to ruin my life because my brother rejected her 10 years ago. She won't stop.,"This started years ago now and I've pretty much let it go, but I never talked about it fully with people (out of trying to not pull people into it) when it was happening so here goes. Warning-It's long lol
I met this friend through another friend, and we quickly became close. We ended up working together as well (for my parents, another area of my life I needed to have boundaries but I was 19 and thought it would be fine), would hang out after work we called each other ""twin"" because we had a lot in common. We got hired for a creative project together as we were both into photography. We worked on personal creative projects together we were together CONSTANTLY.
We were teenagers, and as teenage girls often are, we were constantly talking about different guys we were interested in, and I found out she was interested in my brother. They went on a date and my brother very quickly realized they were not compatible. This is where I can pinpoint a change in our friendship.
She stopped asking me to hang out. I would ask her to hang out and she would be busy. She would constantly hang out with our mutual friends. At the time, I thought reaching out and asking if I had done anything wrong to warrant not being invited places I had previously been invited to was the right choice, and got told ""don't worry about it, everything is good."" I was getting married at the time and had already asked her to be my maid of honor, so I assumed that maybe it was a rough patch, I was stressed, etc. (tip: don't assume everything is fine, she's in all my wedding photos now lol)
The REAL switch to trying to ruin my life was after I got married. I have been photographing for years, and decided to try to pursue it as a business as my parent's business had closed. She HATED that because she did photography too, and suddenly any similarities we had were me ""copying her"". I posted a story on IG about prices, she posted ""the original is always better than the copy."" One of her friends (that I didn't know was her friend at the time) modeled for me, and she posted that ""people always try to undercut your business."" At one point, I posted something (I don't even remember what it was at this point) and she posted within 5 minutes and said ""Okay, she's obviously copying me right?""
Now, full transparency- I did not handle this well. I tried to talk it out with her, tried everything I knew, and she would smile to my face and tell me everything was okay and then continue to do this. I found myself looking at her posts constantly because she would never say what I had done to hurt her to my face but would post consistently, so I felt like at least I could try to piece together what had gone wrong (and also, if she felt I had been copying her, I wanted to make sure I didn't post anything similar to her because I genuinely just wanted it to stop.) We talked a couple times, tried to make amends, but she still would post about me often.
A couple years later, I did a photoshoot with another photographer modeling for me for a concept around a pregnancy loss. I have chronic health issues and so does this photographer, and I decided to center it around healing. It was a beautiful project. The DAY I posted about it, she posted a video on TikTok that said ""if you want to be me just say that."" I didn't follow her, but with her being a contact in my phone sometimes her videos would still pop up. That was it. After all the posts and all the years of just dealing with it, I was done. She had tried to isolate me from members of my husband's family, she had deleted texts and then posted screenshots of our ""conversations"" and I had just turned the other cheek but if she could somehow take a photoshoot about MY pregnancy loss and make it about her, I was done. I blocked her on everything. And then I started seeing friends of hers looking at my posts, so I blocked several of them as well.
I'm 28 now and have a wonderful life with my husband and our son. I do photography part time now so I can stay home and take care of him. I have talked to her once since, and I asked her why she did all of that. She told me that it was because she had a hard time with her dynamic with my brother and my family after working for my parents. I asked her specifically what I did, and all she said was that I was ""clingy and she wanted other friends"". I personally have let a lot of it go, but there's always little reminders of it because our circles are so intertwined and tonight I feel like it's okay to talk about to strangers on the internet because I never said anything to anyone else when it was happening except for my husband and a few friends, never did anything about it and just prayed she would stop.
So there's that. Just a big ol' ""get it off my chest"". The biggest thing I learned from it is friends that aren't willing to talk through it are not friends I want to have, and that sometimes you just need to block and walk.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 04:08:07 UTC,1053,17,0.99,,,0,0
1j4mmse,What could have been,"Just thinking about my terrible luck. Back around 2008-2009 I was a pizza delivery guy for a local spot. Some dude tipped me 10 bitcoin.

Probably whipped clean and sold or something, my life would have been so much better if that never happened. Crazy",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 03:47:31 UTC,1,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j4miml,My partner got sectioned and I don't know what to do,"Hello all idk where else to go and I don't even know if this is the right sub to do it but yeah let's just get right into it
I 20 NB am dating a 20 NB and we met on a dating app and kicked it off instantly had the same humour and even same fav artists and we planned to meet I traveled up to see them and we went on a date and got to know each other on a personal level and I've never felt the same so the next morning after waking up and cuddling I asked them to be my partner and they accepted and I was planning on going home that evening so after I got home we messaged every single day just yapping about everything
one day they didn't message very often a little context about me I worry vvvv easily like if a mate doesn't message me back I think they have been shot or something but that's not the point so I messaged them asking is everything alright and they sent a voice note explaining why they weren't responding at that's cuz they had a mental health check and they said to them you are being sectioned for those who don't know what that is basically mental health place were they keep track of you and what not and we did everything we could to make sure that they hospital didn't section them as they have work and uni and a life and yes they have mental health issues (I'm not going into them as it's TMI)
but 2 weeks ago I got a message while I was out saying ""Hey I'm gonna block the chat and hide out our messages if you don't hear from me I'm sorry"" and I knew that they were getting sectioned and I broke down in the middle of the street and I couldn't stop until I got home
Idk what to do I don't want to move on cuz they mean the world to me and I can't just forget them I haven't heard from them at all and I know they are safe but at the same time what they did was wrong and I miss them so much",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 03:41:04 UTC,2,2,0.75,,,0,0
1j4mdit,Im wanting to move out because of my mom.,"I (23 f) is wanting to move out because of my mom. I live with my parents while I go to college full-time and work part time.
Me and my dad have a great relationship while my mom is strained to say the lest, my mom is still treating like a child and getting severely angry when I do anything adult like. A few days ago me and my (22 m) boyfriend (of 2 months) went on a date and on the way back to my place, we had to pull over on the side of the road because a few cows escaping.
As we wait in the car, we just sat there talking and my mom sent me a text asking when I'm getting home and not even 5 minutes before I could answer her, she called me and spoke in a angry tone asking why I haven't moved from that spot (I forgot I gave her my GPS tracking).
I told her what happened and she got even more angry and pretty much demanded me to come home. The next morning as I was getting ready to leave I tried speaking to my mom and she just gave me the cold shoulder and the silence treatment (something she does all the time when she's upset at me or siblings and thinks it gets us to feel bad), my dad told me she thinks me and my boyfriend we're doing ""things"" and doesn't believe a thing I say because I'm turning into my sister (my sister is no contact with her).
My mom is still really not talking to me because I'm not giving in, my boyfriend is inviting me to live with him but I dont know if I'm being to butt hurt or not.
I'm sorry for the long post.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 03:33:20 UTC,1,2,0.67,,,0,0

1j4m2sm,My depression finally reached the breaking point. I had to ask my friend/landlord to take her pewpew out of the house.,"I've been coping with depression since I was 12. It's gotten to the point where I can expect a few depresso days a month before expecting it to lighten up again. But this time is different. My depression has rooted deeper with every passing week. It's lasted longer and has progressively gotten worse than it has in years. I finally had to ask my friend to take her pewpew out of the house. And yes, I am seeking help.

1j4l5th,Update,"A couple days ago i posted about a certain 2000s actor being my dad. me and my mom got into a huge arguement, and she came clean. he is my dad, i will still be doing a dna test just in case. i have NO intentions of speaking to this man what so ever. he already has a child of his own. opposite of me.
i dont want anything to do with him, i just needed comfort in who my dad was. and now that i have it, i dont need to speak about it or ever even bring it up again. this dna test i hope will bring me the truth. even tho its most likely my mom is telling the truth :(",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 02:30:34 UTC,4,8,1.0,,,0,0
1j4kufy,UPDATE: My cat keeps sniffing my butt and I'm over it,"See [original post](<URL>)here
My gyno visit was today but still no updates on Butt cancer or cancer up the coochie. My theory is that my cat is just a horny bastard. I was spending some time with her tonight and I noticed she kept trying to sniff my privates. I'm currently in my ""fertile window"" and I'm supposed to be ovulating. I think because Penny isn't fixed yet she can smell my hormones and it makes her go crazy. My next theory is that her dad was orange but other than that the only reason that could explain her behavior is that I synced hormone cycles with my cat. This was not on my bingo card",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 02:14:44 UTC,3,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j4ktte,Anyone else have a lying gambling addicted father?,"i don't even want to make this longer than it needs to be, my dad has been an in denial gambling addict for as long i've known him..
Ive tossed my airtag in his car a few times to see exactly where he goes after work, even though i know this is who he is and will never change because to him he has no problem, its painful and it just hurts my heart to know that this is my unfortunately my dad and my moms husband, id wish she never met him or would've left at the first sign of betrayal.
he doesn't get home till 8 pm most nights, however he actually gets off @ like 330 i know this because i can see when he's leaves his job.
he works a god state job making over 100k and will die leaving nothing to his 3 children, i swear i just want to be so successful and never give him a dime he was an absent shitty father to all 3 of his kids and a terrible husband to his wife. i don't want to be anything like him even though 50% of my dna comes from him. life pisses me off sometimes",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 02:13:53 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j4kkmx,I didn't want to rehome a cat,"This is not so much a post asking for advice as much as it is about being upset that I had to do it.
My girlfriend and I moved in together in Wisconsin last Sept. I have 2 cats, boy and girl who are siblings, GF has/had 1 girl cat. Her cat and my boy cat got along fine, but my girl cat kept bullying her. Trying to attack her while she's trying to eat, or trying to hit her while she's nearby.
Cut to, I had to move to WA for a new job since I got laid off. GF moved a few months later. We brought our cats over. The behavior continued, so we had my two cats in our bedroom and the girl cat had the rest of the house to herself. We tried a fresh re-introduction and it seemed to be getting better, but my girl cat started attacking her again. She peed on the carpets a few times, and then peed on a chair when we tried to move her so we could sit on it.
This never happened before when she was a single cat, when she just lived with my GF. She didn't have problems with people either, but I don't think she was happy with the other female cat.
She was not having a great time. We had to decide to rehome her and GF and I are distraught.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 02:01:23 UTC,1,2,0.67,,,0,0
1j4k76n,My lesbian coworker has given me hope for the world,"and myself, I guess.
Backstory, about five years ago, the woman that was my soulmate and best friend called off the engagement. It hurt, and sudden. Within two years she was dead. She'd been diagnosed with terminal cancer, didn't tell me and left because she didn't want me to deal with that, I found out from mutual friends years later after the funeral.
It hurt, confusing and I got real cynical about life. Relationships. All that. It was bad for a while, but I worked thru it.
Since then I've been mostly single. Sort of a loner. Dated, nothing serious. Closed myself off, from friends too. Life moves forward. Career takes off. My job requires a lot of moving.
Enter my lesbian friend, who is honestly funny and so good hearted that it's made the craziness of the world bearable. I'm a male. We became quick friends both being new and looking for things to do.
She's refilled my faith in humanity. She's got hobbies, independent ideas and cares about people she doesn't know. She has sympathy for people that hate her. She's willing to be the butt of the joke and then dish it out.
I want to make clear that this isn't about a secret love or desire to date her to get over my ex fiance. She's just a good person and friend. I just like her. She's helped me realize how much I've shut myself off from the world.
And she's reminded me of why it's so important to have connections and friends.
She's a bit of an introvert, and I'm too so we've been helping each other with that. Feels good, which I need in the world today.
She has a girl she's trying to get the courage to ask out. I'm trying to convince her to do it, like my friends did with my ex-fiance a long time ago. She deserves a shot at happiness.
But I wouldn't have thought that for myself six months ago. This excellent lesbian friend has helped me rediscover the part of me that loves human connection. And it means so much.
Since our friendship started, I feel the first genuine desire in years to try snd do things and date. To make friends and connect with others. To be part of the world, deeply and meaningfully.
I'm so thankful to her for being just such an awesome friend, by just being herself, she's helped me in so many ways she'll never know.
I think my ex-fiance would've liked her a lot.
And I hope all of you will have the chance to have a really great lesbian friend who will help give you faith in humanity too.
We need that.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 01:43:06 UTC,191,16,0.94,,Positive,0,0
1j4judy,I was the daughter they finally learned how to control.,"Everyone talks about the eldest daughter trauma the one who raised her siblings like a second mother, the one who carried the whole house on her back while nobody even asked if she was tired. But no one ever talks about the last daughter , the one everyone thinks had it easy. The one who was loved a little more, spoiled a little more, protected a little more but never really seen.
They say I was the lucky one, the child who walked on a path already cleared by others. I always knew when to be careful and when to stay silent because my sisters had already made the mistakes I wasn't allowed to make. Every fight had already been fought before I even reached that age. Every heartbreak came with a warning before I could fall too deep. They think I had it easy because I never had to struggle for my freedom. What they don't know is I never got the chance to fight for it either.
I was the daughter who grew up watching the cracks in the house but I was never allowed to acknowledge them. I was the one who learned how to laugh off the fights, how to pretend I didn't hear the shouting behind closed doors. I was the daughter who learned how to act dumb because if I smiled enough, if I played the little girl they wanted me to be, they'd believe they protected me from the ugliness of this house. What they never realized is I saw everything. I just stayed silent because youngest daughters aren't supposed to know what pain looks like.
Nobody ever asked how I felt. Nobody ever wondered if I was okay because the youngest ones are always supposed to be happy by default. I became the light of the house not because I wanted to but because someone had to be. The clown who made everyone laugh at the dinner table so they could forget how broken everything really was. The one who took up responsibilities without being asked peeling garlic in the kitchen, making tea for guests, finishing the little chores nobody wanted to do. Not because anyone told me to but because the guilt of letting my mother do it alone would eat me alive.
I was the obedient one , the daughter who never crossed the line. The one who said yes to everything, who stayed quiet when she wanted to scream, who shrunk herself down to fit into the version of me they wanted to see. My sisters got to rebel, got to be wild, got to disappoint the family but by the time it was my turn, my mother was already too tired. There was no space left for me to be difficult. I had to be the perfect daughter. The easy one. The one who never asked for too much.
Maybe that's why I feel so distant from my own mother. She had nothing left to give by the time I came along. I watched her have those long, deep conversations with my sisters conversations I never got to have. The only thing she gave me was rules. Maybe she thought if she was harder on me, she could save at least one daughter from turning out like the rest.
I was always loved. I was always taken care of. But not because of who I was because that's just what you're supposed to do with the youngest child. Love them, spoil them, protect them but never really see them.
Nobody ever wonders what happens when the child who made everyone laugh starts crying behind closed doors. Nobody wonders if the girl who had it easiest was silently drowning in the weight of trying to be perfect.
They called me lazy when I took two gap years not knowing I spent more time peeling vegetables with my mother than studying for my own future. They called me spoiled when I got everything I wanted not knowing I gave up dreams before I could even name them just to make life easier for everyone else. They called me the lucky one but how lucky can you be when your whole life is built around making sure nobody in the house feels like they failed you?
I was never the rebel but I don't think I ever wanted to be the perfect daughter either.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 01:25:32 UTC,88,34,0.86,,,0,0
