1j6sg52,MY DAD TOUCHED MY INAPPROPRIATELY WHEN I WAS A CHILD,"(my english is not good please adjust)
When I was 12,Actually i had a beautiful family, so I have been always grateful to God for my father and mother and I had a huge respect on my father but sometimes he use to be alcoholic but I didn't know that in that time. I loved my father more than anything and one day, usually me and my mother sleep on the bed and my dad and my brother sleeps on the floor, but on that day my dad was drunk , so he slept on the bed beside me and I was very asleep, in the midnight that's the time he put his hand inside my panties and touched the private partloudly_crying_face i was just 12..I don't know what's happening then i wokeup because of the uncomfortable feeling and I started to ask for mom...and my mom asked me what happened but I never told her. I don't know what to do! I have never shared this incident with anyone. Is being drunk can be a valid excuse for his actions? Is he was in the sense and knows what he was actually doing? Because I have never consumed alcohol so I'm so confused. Anyone tell me please. And do you know what's even more worse? My parents are divorced now and my mother abandoned us and me and brother are growing with my father. It's really traumatic to me but after that day he never reapeated that. I'm so confused. I cannot talk to him properly give me a solution.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 22:13:27 UTC,0,0,0.33,,,0,0
1j6sdqy,My girlfriend's mental health struggles are draining me,"Me (21M) and my girlfriend (22F) have been together for 4 months now. After the first 2 months I started to notice and understand better all the things she has to deal with in her head, bad experiences in past relationships that affected her deeply and left her with traumas that are now being reflected in me just because we are in a long distance relationship and we can't see each other 24/7 and know what the other is doing or know entirely what is happening to us. Although she never saw a specialist or therapist to treat these problems (which she admitted to me was out of fear or pride), I always try to explain to her that right now it is impossible for me to be devotedly aware of her every second of the day, with my career, my activities, my friends and my own life in general. Every day I talk to her to accompany her in the little free time I have during the day and when I return home exhausted I also make sure to communicate with her and ask her about her day and if she would like to talk about something with me, in which most of the time her answers are ""I have nothing interesting to tell"". There are also times when a harmless joke I make unleashes hell where she gets offended at me and I need to reassure her of how much she means to me and how much i really love her, I apologize for upsetting her with something I said, to which she (apparently) accepts my apologies and (also apparently) everything is resolved. Last night I even went out with my guy friends to a bar after a hard week and all day long I let her know who I was with and what our plans were for the night, to which she ended up responding, as a way of throwing it in my face, that I will never be able to understand her and solve all the damage she suffered with me with a simple forgiveness, and acussed me of not caring about her and not being able to see things the way she sees them. That made me feel like like I'm worth absolutely nothing, like all the sincerely unconditional love I give her when we're together isn't worth it even in the slightest, that all the moments in which I was there to listen to her and understand her also meant nothing. I need honest and direct opinions on this.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 22:10:19 UTC,3,6,0.81,,,0,0

1j6ruyf,My dog just died,"He was 3 years old. Just a regular morning, nothing out of the ordinary. Come noon he started vomiting. I call the doctor immediately and he tells me I have nothing to worry about. I called every one hour when his symptoms got worse and he told me not to worry. My dog couldnt move, and he told me that catatonia is normal when facing such an infection, and that he should be up and about in the morning. 30 minutes later I watched him choke in front of my bare eyes and there was nothing I could do. Me and my gf rushed him to the hospital immediately and disregarded the orders from the vet, but it was too late. I dont know what to do, I dont know how to move on. I feel so numb. So Im over here on Reddit for advice, how does one learn to cope with such a loss? What helped you fellow redditors overcome this feeling of hopelessness? Any advice is welcome, please help me",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 21:46:33 UTC,17,10,0.83,,,0,0
1j6roh8,"I'm a culturally assimilated Hispanic, and I see more people struggling because they aren't. Does assimilation really offer an advantage?","I've been thinking a lot about how cultural assimilation impacts opportunities, especially in the workplace. I was raised in a predominantly Caucasian church group in the Midwest/South, where my mom worked multiple jobs, and members of the church helped babysit me. Because of that environment, I never learned Spanish, and I became a native English speaker without an accent. My name and skin color make it obvious that I'm Hispanic, but everything else like my speech, my interests, even the way I present myself is very much in line with mainstream American culture.
I never really thought much about this until I started noticing a pattern in my jobs. I've had no issue moving up. I've always been recognized for my abilities, and promotions have come naturally. But people I know people who are just as educated and capable tell me they're being overlooked for management positions or even treated differently at work. Most of them have thick Hispanic accents, and many were raised in predominantly Hispanic communities, even if they were born here.
I live in a primarily Caucasian area, and it's become clear to me that how you present as Hispanic plays a massive role in workplace opportunities. Whitewashed Hispanics, whether they grew up like me or are half Hispanic with ""white"" first names, seem to have a much easier time getting ahead than first-generation or immigrant Hispanics who retain strong cultural ties.
I don't think this is talked about enough. People love to say that discrimination is just about race, but I think it's also about how comfortable people feel with you. If you fit the dominant culture and don't challenge their perception of what's ""normal,"" you get a pass. If you don't, you hit a wall.
Has anyone else noticed this?",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 21:38:14 UTC,1,2,0.6,,,0,0
1j6rl5a,I don't know what to do!! And I need advice,"I (27) father of three lives alone with my three children. Thanksgiving month of last year the mother and I got into a heated argument which led to a back and forth (physically) the most I did was push her to get some space to walk away, because I truly don't believe in hitting women( unless it's life or death). Before that even happened, two days prior to this she was already putting her hands on me which led to a big bruise on my back. And a long scar going from my neck down to my back. Once I pushed her away from me she instantly called the cops and said I was the one being belligerent and she wanted me removed from the house. The police arrive and she!! Yes she showed them the camera footage of what had been going on and ofc she was deemed the main aggressor and was taken to jail. Once she got out ""apparently"" she has a court order to stay off of the property and to have no contact with me. Her name is still on the lease so she helps out by paying her half of the rent and once a week will ask if the kids need anything( she has a friend that reaches out for her). She currently has no where to live but she stays with a friend and still has her job as a nurse and is in school during the day. She gave me the option of getting a hotel room to get the kids because it's going on four months since she has seen or talked to any of them. I thought the hotel option was a good idea and I even offered to pay for half the expenses. But it never happens because she either to busy with school and work. I would like too take her to court so she can at least help me by getting them and keeping them for a week. I have managed to do what I can with childcare and anything else the kids need so I can work my self and I have managed to do this alone. What do I need to do to get her to court so we can have our time with the kids individually? I understand she is in a situation but I shouldn't have to suffer because of it. I hope this doesn't sound bitter on my end but we are not together anymore so she is going to have to start riding her storms out alone now. Im not complaining about taking care of my kids because I love them dearly and I don't find anything manly about complaining about something you helped bring into this world but I need a break some times and I'm only asking for a week.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 21:34:05 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0
1j6r9ab,My one attempt at healthy communication ended horribly and I feel like the worst friend ever,"I was heavily bullied via social ostracism as a kid. It also didn't help that I am very likely autistic and I have a very hard time picking up on unspoken social cues. I also grew up in a bit of a turbulent environment where speaking my mind often ended in punishment. Therefore, my own communication habits are not the healthiest - I tend to bottle things up for months and then crash and bedrot for days on end when it all becomes too much. But I have a best friend who I finally felt comfortable attempting more immediate, healthy communication with, and it's blown up so badly that I'm almost wishing I'd just kept my mouth shut instead.
They've been getting really into a TV show for about 5 months now - which is great, and I'm truly happy for them. A lot of the time they'd send me voice notes about it, or we'd call and they'd end up talking about it to the point of apologizing for ""overtaking the conversation,"" and I'd always say they had nothing to be sorry for, because I love listening to my friends be happy about stuff. Genuinely, I do, and it was literally all fine up until last week.
After months of searching due to unemployment, I had a job interview lined up for the next day. Of course, I immediately texted my best friend, and they congratulated me and said they'd send me messages of encouragement before the interview. I thanked them, and then they immediately proceeded to talk about the show again. I didn't think much of it and listened as always, because I enjoy it.
The interview day comes the next day, and it's HECTIC - I was so busy that I was literally going from 5:30am to 5:30pm, and by the time I got home I was ready to crash. My interview was scheduled at 4, and they'd been texting me about the show prior to it, so I figured I'd get my messages soon. Well, long story short, they never came - I got home at about 5:30, immediately crashed and took a 2 hour nap, and then woke up to chat with them only to have another conversation about the show. Admittedly I didn't feel great about it, but I thought it was just the lack of food and sleep talking, so I brushed it off.
Over the next few days, though, I noticed that sometimes the things I'd send them would just get liked and immediately moved on from in favor of talking about the show - eventually I realized that this wasn't making me feel great, so I decided to ask them if we could maybe tone down the conversations about this show and explain how it made me feel. Sounds like a healthy way to communicate, right? Wrong.
As soon as I sent the message I realized how badly I fucked up. They were (rightfully) upset that I'd waited a week to tell them this and didn't give them the opportunity to correct themselves in the moment, and for that I apologized - I genuinely thought a week wasn't that much time, and it wasn't something I was even mad at, just mildly upset. But then the whole conversation kept spiraling, and I literally feel sick at the way I made them feel.
I thought that I was avoiding bottling it up and actually doing the right thing because I was communicating a relatively minor (on my end) issue early on, but it turns out that by not saying anything immediately, I've basically reinforced their worst fears about themself. They're now scared to talk too much to anyone about anything, and now any mention of the show makes them feel sick. They said they feel like a bad friend, and part of them feels lied to because I always said it was alright how much they talked about it - but it wasn't a lie. It really was alright, the job interview was literally the only incident that made me feel not great about it. I kept apologizing because I never wanted them to feel like that around me, but they're still really hurt and now we've been taking some space from each other for about four days now.
I feel sick. I feel like I ruined the one friendship where both of us felt safe to be ourselves. Even if we manage to move on from this, I know it'll never be the same, and it's all my fault - they'll never talk to me again without worrying that they're being ""too much,"" and that's the one thing I never wanted them to worry about with me, because I know what it's like to be ""too much"" for the people around you.
I wish I'd kept my stupid mouth shut. It was never even that big of a deal, I could've just dealt with it and bit my tongue, but of course the one time I feel like communicating is the right thing it just ruins everything. I hurt my best friend so bad and I didn't even mean to, and now there's nothing I can say or do to fix it. I thought I was finally doing things right, but it all just went wrong anyway, and now one of the people I care about the most is hurting because of me. The guilt is eating me alive, I've been crying ever since it all went down, and now I wish I'd never even said anything.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 21:19:11 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j6qxcs,I can't get over my ex,"I can't get over the guy I was in love with 3 god damn years ago and it makes me sick.
So I was never really in a relationship with this person, we actually never even hang out together. We met in 2022 and we had a friendship that you wish on everyone, but the friendship got stronger and so did our feelings. At first he started getting feelings, at the time it was not appropriate because I was still in a relationship. I broke things off so I could be with him, but when that happened he didn't have the same feelings anymore and everything went downhill. I'm not gonna explain everything that happened in those 6 months, but I can say that nothing went back to how it was.
Because I was still in love with him when he basically ghosted me at the time, I never got the closure I needed (I think). And I begged him to let me stay in his live as friends, and now that I'm hearing myself I sound so stupid. After everything that happened in those 6 months we kissed etc. for like 2 more times and that made it even worse to get over him.
Like I said we stayed friends and talk like 3 times a year (new years, birthdays and holidays). I even got a new amazing boyfriend whom I've been together with for almost 2 years, and who I really love and could see myself marrying one day. But I still think about him (the ex).
Last week he even responded on a story I posted on Snapchat and we exchanged maybe 10 sentences. I wake up the next day and he deleted me from snap. I would like to think his new gf made him do it, because it would honestly hurt more if he did it himself.
So now 1 week later and everyday I'm thinking about it and everything that happened almost 3 fk years ago.
So my question Reddit users is why can't I get over him? Why can't I get over the memories that we made? Why not after everything this person has put me through?
English is not my first language so I'm sorry for my grammar.
Side note, 1,5 years ago he moved to another city so I haven't seen him in 1 year. And I see him maybe once I year now. I was supposed to see him last week, but he couldn't come",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 21:03:59 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j6qs0c,"I miss the old internet, pre-Facebook","I was born in the very early 90's so I got to experience the internet from like ~2001 and on. I grew up as a teenager on the internet in the mid 2000-2010 and I fucking miss it.
Jumping on the home computer to go on the internet used to be like a little adventure. You never knew what you'd see. Sites like Newgrounds were full of creative, fun, and dirty content that you had to look over your shoulder to make sure mom wasn't coming up the stairs.
Best of all, people made creative content for fun/community/respect not just for money. Sure clickbait existed back then, but not EVERYTHING was a thinly veiled perverted attempt to extract money or data from you.
Best of all, the internet didn't follow you around everywhere. When you left the computer, you left the internet.

1j6qkav,I stood up to my father who treats me like garbage.,"Hello everyone. I am writing this in hopes to get it off my chest no matter how familiar or boring the subject may be.
I am a 24yo woman, I am a student, currently unemployed and I live with my boyfriend. I consider myself a normal person, nothing out of the ordinary in my life or in my character. I am healthy, i have hobbies, i have friends and normal healthy relationships, and nothing in my life is out of line.
I am giving this info because the story concerns my father's behaviour towards me basically since i was 11yo.
He has always been the provider for our family ( my mom, sister, dad and i ).
The problem in my story is his character and his behaviour towards everyone in his life ( i mean family and close ones ).
Since I was a little girl he has always used derogatory language with me and my mom. He has fits of rage every day and shouts at us and mostly her because i do not live there anymore. Name calling of all sorts for no reason.
I will give an example - once i was going out for a walk and i took a bottle of water with me (1L), small bottle nothing insane. He saw it and started screaming at me every offensive word you can think of. He said no person in his right mind takes water outside on a walk.
Another example - he screamed at my mom and the didn't speak to her a whole week because HE forgot his lunch on his way out. Apparently she needs to be there every second and remind him to even blink.
He is the same with my sister and his parents( my grandparents).
No one in my family has ever talked to him about this and they are enablers to his behaviour.
For the years that I spent living with them, when he would get home from work I would stay in my room and not even go to the bathroom for hours even if i needed to just because to get to the bathroom you have to go through the living room and that is where he watched tv and spent the evenings.
Over the years i developed severe anxiety, low self esteem, binge eating disorder and many more characteristics and conditions that make my life miserable.
The binge eating disorder came because all my life he would call me fat and huge and enormously big ( I have always been 50-55kg at 1.65cm height, i work out at the gym and have been a runner for a few years, so yeah I am slim and have even been very skinny for some time )
So, this person with his insane behaviour has long ago lost my respect and fondness of him. Although until now i have been silent.
Today, at dinner i couldn't take it anymore. For months i've been having dreams of him screaming at me and while asleep I felt the hatred in my heart. So today, he started to insult me again and I didn't stay silent this time. I told him that respect has to be earned and he doesn't have mine because of all the years of name calling and treating me like garbage. He was stunt and said that i don't have a father anymore. To be honest, i've felt like that since i was 11.
Even though it hurt him, he can't begin to imagine the pain i've been feeling for years.
I can't stop crying because of the words I said but I know I had to say them at some point in my life to free myself and defend myself.
I feel pity for him and nothing else. I am sorry that he is the way he is because it can only end badly for him.
I am proud I defended myself for the first time but I will always be in pain because he's been brought up to be the person he is. He is incapable of change and I am sorry for him.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 20:47:15 UTC,7,5,1.0,,,0,0
1j6qas5,I'm so tired of preachers using funerals as opportunities to convert people.,Basically title. My cousin lost his fight with cancer this week and the funeral was this morning. His side of the family is very religious and I tend to work best when religion and I give each other a wide berth. I understand that for religious people there is comfort in hearing scripture at a funeral and I am fine with some readings. Unfortunately the pastor for my cousins funeral saw it as an opportunity to give a full fire and brimstone sermon and a similar thing happened at my grand father's funeral last year. It was a full blown transphobic rant at my grandpas funeral. I'm tired of funerals in general and there's been too much death in my family the last few years so that's probably a contributing factor to my annoyance.

1j6pyo0,I witnessed domestic violence and didn't do anything about it,"I was walking home from school, this was the 90s so we were all just walking around freely for miles, and passed by the same neighborhoods I always passed. There was this one small house on the left side of the road and coming up on it, I could hear splitting noises like someone was being hit but I think I couldn't believe it until I actually got close enough. There was this guy, 20s maybe both of them, standing over his wife or girlfriend on the front lawn, she was lying down on her side and had her arm stretched out. Then as I walked by slowly, unable to stop for some reason, he started beating and slapping her and grabbing her by the hair and yanking her towards the house. He also kicked her multiple times. I think he might have called her Alicia. But the eerie thing was that she was surprisingly quiet about it, not like crazy screaming, but just like, please stop! You would think she'd be screaming and crying out for help or something. I remember that I was just walking in horror, the guy didn't seem to notice me or if he did, he didn't care. I couldn't stop and I couldn't stop looking at them. I think I was trying to figure out what street I was on but I had never thought to memorize the alley way streets so I didn't know. The whole scene moved in slow motion but I still remember the entire beating, the sounds, the sounds of grass scraping, the shape of his hands. Just broad daylight at 3pm on a weekday, front lawn, no one else on the street but them and me, springtime.
I ran home in tears and told my mom who just told me not to get involved. When I tried to tell her that I think he was going to kill her, she asked me what street and address this happened because if we report it, I'll have to know all these things. I had no idea, so again, she told me to mind my own business.
I was 10 or so when this happened and I'm in my 30s now. I still have the exact same fantasy memory of having gone back in time and instead of walking away and running away from the scene, I get in between them and save her somehow. If not save, but at least make such a fuss that someone calls the cops. It's always the same thing - that I don't care if I get hurt in the process, I would have done the brave thing. Instead of what I actually did... just run away in literal horror. I feel so haunted by this scene. I don't think I'll ever forget it for the rest of my life, honestly.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 20:19:25 UTC,9,10,0.85,,CONTENT WARNING: VIOLENCE/DEATH,0,0
1j6pwmy,"My sister invited our brother to her wedding, even though she knows how I feel about him","Recently my sister got engaged, and she asked me to be a part of her bridal party. Initially I was very excited to have a role in her wedding, kind of still am, but now I'm feeling iffy because she invited our brother, who I don't have a positive relationship with.
For context, I'm the youngest out of the three of us and we were raised by a single mother who worked a lot. Because of this, my sister took a lot of responsibility over us when our mother couldn't. She's like a second mother to me and my brother even though she shouldn't have been. My brother, on the other hand, was kind of a weirdo growing up. He dressed alternatively and had ""nerdy"" interests, something that younger-me at the time thought was really cool, and was all around awkward.
I was maybe 8 and he was 14 when he started getting curious with his body, and that eventually led to him sexually assaulting me. It didn't happen for long, thank god, but the experience left a disgusting stain on me. Eventually I realized that what had happened to me was wrong, and it wasn't until I was 13 that I finally had the chance and courage to talk to someone.
I was removed from my home and placed in a children's psych unit, and my case was being handled by a social worker. Of course, they informed my mother, who then told a few others, my sister included. I didn't know this at the time, but some of the adults around her pressured her into convincing me to recant my statement. So when she visited me, she asked me to do just that. I was obviously so betrayed and angry, she was my role model and the one person I relied on the most at the time. I can't recall the rest of our conversation, I just remember leaving the visitation area and completely losing it in my room.
But I was young, impressional, and ruminating a lot at this time, so I did end up recanting my statement. My case worker didn't agree with my decision but respected it anyway. For the sake of procedure, my case was still investigated, but without the victim's statement it fell through. It didn't erase anything that happened to me, but it felt like it did with how everyone else around me went about their lives like nothing happened. It was jarring and fucked with my head, and I slowly started believing that I made the whole thing up for attention. My memory wasn't the best, and it could've just been a messed up dream I had. I started feeling disgusted and I couldn't trust myself anymore, and I began spiraling.
Fastward to when I was 17, I was hospitalized for almost taking my life. For some reason, this was much more serious than before. I was finally put on medication and was put into a program for other at-risk teens. It was through group therapy I started thinking about getting closure for myself, so after a lot of mental and emotional preparation, I confronted my brother. At the last minute I decided to record the conversation without him knowing, and I actually got a confession. I went to my social worker, and after a few days he was removed from the house.
After that, I was both relieved and stressed by the events that came next. To be honest I didn't follow too closely with the court proceedings, I couldn't bring myself to care what happened to him, all I remember was being interviewed by SVU and getting monthly check ups by social services. But the whole ordeal was mentally and emotionally draining for me and my family. My mom couldn't believe it at first, and briefly experienced religious psychosis, but no one took it harder than my sister. I guess she felt guilty, because 1) such a serious thing happened between two of her siblings right under her nose, and 2) she didn't have my back when I first came forward about it. I don't blame her, or anyone really, for not noticing what was happening. I can't bring myself to blame anyone, no one wants to believe that someone you love is capable of something as horrible as sexual assault.
A few years have passed since then, and I've been working on improving my mental health. My sister was my rock throughout the process, the most understanding of me and my circumstances, and after a while I thought I had made peace with the whole situation, until her wedding. My sister's decision to invite our brother, after years of no-contact between the two of us, kind of blindsided me. Not because I didn't expect her to, but because she didn't tell me. Now here's the thing, I would never ask my sister to choose between me or our brother. I understand that she loves the both of us despite what had happened, so to ask her to do that wouldn't be fair. But I would've liked a heads-up. I had to ask her myself if he was coming, and I'm glad I did. The thought of walking into the venue and seeing him in the crowd without warning would've sent me into a panic.
And because of this I started to rethink my relationship with her. She's done a lot for me, and I'll go as far as to say that she has a bigger impact on me than our mother does. I want to give her some grace for this, but I still feel so uncomfortable with his presence. He's also still in good standing with our extended family, who don't know of the situation, so the possibility of them joking around and having fun with him without knowing what he's done doesn't sit right with me.
I most likely won't do anything regarding my sister's wedding because I don't want to ruin her big day, but it'll probably change the way I see her. Like I said, I won't ask her to choose between me or him, but that doesn't mean I can't. It's a scary realization that my relationship with my sister can change, I really don't want it to, but I can't ignore how she's willing to look past what our brother has done to me when I haven't. I want to start by having a proper conversation with her about this first though, after the wedding. I want to fully understand her side of the story and her perspective before making this big decision.
I honestly don't know what to expect or hope for, but I feel like if I don't do something then all the improvement I've made will come undone and I don't think I'll recover this time.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 20:16:48 UTC,286,94,0.97,,CONTENT WARNING: SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0
1j6pk4i,I recently found out my abusive brother might have a baby,"My (F20) oldest brother (OB, M31) is an abusive misogynist. He genuinely thinks that women - his girlfriend, his wife, his mom, doesn't matter - should be beaten and/or be physically intimidated when he has any (even the smallest) disagreement. He was kicked out of the military for beating his wife (he somehow got honorable discharge from what my mom says). My mom also has video evidence on OB practically dragging his girlfriends down the stairs in front of her children (my brother *only* went after single moms)
With that said, let's get into the main reason I'm scared for this child. I recently found out my OB is a child predator and that the reason OB was kicked out at ~14 (almost 15) wasn't because of no reason. It was because my mom walked in on us with our pants down in my closet when I was 4. 3 years later, OB got my name tattooed on his arm. I don't really remember it that well because I had pushed the memory deep down in the back of my mind because I thought it was my fault. I remember thinking ""all I have to do is push it all the way back, behind the wall, into my subconscious"" because I heard that's how other's got rid of the bad feelings or bad memories (I think it's because I heard that there was 2 sides of the brain). I remember thinking, ""Why didn't I just say 'no'?"".
It wasn't until years later (OB had moved back into our house) when I noticed weird things OB would do (like how I mentioned he only goes after single moms or moms who recently left an abusive relationship, only for them to leave OB because ""I never wanted my children to be put back into that situation, luckily the Girlfriend he practically dragged down the stairs has a new boyfriend who said ""I'll make sure he doesn't goes anywhere near my family again""). I would notice things like how OB treated me like OB would his girlfriends or how OB would stare at my chest or at me in a weird way like a dog would a squirrel (or almost like how they describe jaws eyes) but I thought I was just being crazy. Then OB offered my underaged friend alcohol if she got into his car and went on a drive with OB (to nowhere is particular).
After a couple of years, OB was kicked out again for trying to beat my dad for telling OB to stop yelling at my mom about how *OB* crashed his car while drunk and the entire time, the way OB was talking to her it sounded like he was trying to blame her or the mechanic who fixed his car (my mom said the next day OB went back to the mechanic and yelled at him, then OB got upset that *the best mechanic who worked there wouldn't fix his car and told him to go somewhere else*). And, then as soon as she raised her voice above him to get him to stop screaming and yelling, he immediately started the crocodile tears. The story OB told us was actually ridiculous, OB apparently hit a boulder in the middle of the road and swerved (?) off the road into a ditch.
My parents visited the crash site of where the supposed boulder was, and all they found were swerve marks to a ditch. As for the road, it looked completely fine for a road that had a boulder land on it a couple hour prior (we live in a part of America where the roads don't get that much maintenance and when we do, it's noticeable and definitely lasts longer than a day)
After a little while, the whole p diddy thing came out, and something about it made me snap, and I kept thinking about predators and how they are disgusting creatures. (At the time, I had recently bought some shrooms bars from a local store.) The more I thought of the p diddy situation, the more the memories of my own molestation started coming back. I started getting angry a lot, and eventually, I told my mom.
She said that when she found us, she didn't think anything had happened yet and that OB was just about to do something. I asked her why she didn't call the police because OB would have still attempted to molested a 4 year old child. She said it was because of my dad's crazy ex-wife.
Sometimes, I wish I could go back in time and stop it. I was littarly just playing with my toys before OB came home from school and immediately ran to me like I was present under a christmas tree. I still remember the conversation we had.
OB: (he said something along the lines of) ""we should take off our pants or something about a game"" (I wasn't really paying attention when he initially walked in because I was focused on my toys)
Me: ""But, why?""
OB: ""Because I want to show you something.""
Me: starts to take off pants
OB: ""If you kiss mine, I'll kiss yours""
Me: (senses something is off and starting to get scared): ""but why? I don't want to""
OB: ""it's not scary, see."" (does what you think he said he would, I genuinely feel sick thinking about it)
Then I geuss he heard my mom or he had locked the door.
OB: ""You need to get your pants on, she's not supposed to see us""
Then my mom walked in and stopped when she ws my still trying to button and zip up my pants
Mom: "".......... what.... what..the Fuck.... (then she started yelling at OB) WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU DOING TO HER (then, she grabbed him and pulled him out of the room)
I don't really remember much after that, but I do remember the couple of times I would think about it and get a disgusting feeling or like shame before I had successfully pushed it down. Now, I don't know what to do, it's not exactly like I can go to the police and get justice when it was a long time ago and there is no actual proof the court would listen to. My family has cut him off though, which is good because I was scared of what OB would do if OB moved in with my nana and papa (they're 80 and my aunts have mobility problems, the only person who would be able to defend them is my uncle, who isn't exactly the athletic type and is much older than OB)

1j6p60o,I don't like talking anymore,"I used to talk to myself a lot, especially when I was a kid. If I wasn't talking that meant something was wrong, but I'd usually go back to talking.
Something awful happened that was entirely my fault and since that point I don't speak much anymore. I don't want to. I only speak if I can't figure out how to stay silent. It's been like this for almost two weeks now. I don't see any signs I'll start talking like I used to again.
As I'm writing this I haven't spoken in nearly 24 hours. It's actually harder to speak now. I was quiet to begin with but it's gotten worse. To be completely honest I don't care about it all that much. People find others who talk to themselves to be weird or crazy anyways so honestly this is an improvement.
I wonder if I'll lose my voice completely and then I really can't talk anymore. That would be both interesting and scary. I wonder if that'll happen with my face too. I stopped looking at my reflection along with not talking. Idk why, I just did. I actually like it. Everything feels like a first person game.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 19:43:01 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j6p5vd,I want to give away my dog and it kills me,"Hello. I just came to get this off my chest because I can't take it anymore. English is not my first language.
Three years ago, I adopted a stray puppy. After having him at home for five days, I realized he had parvovirus, so I had to hospitalize him for ten days. It was a miracle that he survived, and after that, he had to stay home for two months without going outside, as recommended by the vet.
The first time I took him out, I noticed he was terrified of absolutely everythingnoises, cars, other animals, people, but especially men. It took a lot of effort to get him comfortable going on walks. We took it slowly, and after a year, I managed to take him to the dog park.
Now, my dog is three years old, and for the past three months, his condition has worsened. He only wants to go to the bathroom once a day, around midnight, when no one is on the street. I live in the city center, which is always busy and noisy (for various reasons I just can't afford to move to the country side). Every day is a struggle. He prefers to go inside the house to avoid going outside. He trembles and cries. If visitors come over, he hides and shakes the entire time. The only time he is happy is when it's just me, my partner, and him at home.
Seeing him like this breaks my heart, and on top of that, no one wants to take care of himnot even paid services or dog daycare centers because of his condition. I took him to a specialist ethologist, tried medications, relaxants, and behavioral exercises, but nothing has improved.
Sometimes, I think about giving him to someone with a huge field where he could run and be happy, but at the same time, I don't want to let him go. It feels wrongno one will take care of him like I do, no one will love him like I do. What if he misses me? What if he feels abandoned?
Every day, I suffer for him and blame myself for not being a better owner.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 19:42:50 UTC,7,9,0.77,,,0,0
1j6owam,Mourning Myself,"**Me and the Past: A Meeting with My Old Self**
I turned on my old device from 11 years ago and listened to my old voice recordings. I broke down crying. I miss myself. I used to be cheerful and innocent.
Now, I've been depressed for so long. I've lived through terrible things.
I keep picturing that girl from 11 years agothe one who used to sing in different languages, record rap songs, and create all kinds of things.
It feels like I lost her. I cried as if I lost a loved one. As if that girl died, and I'll never see her again.
I lost myself. I lost my teenage years.
I lost my laughter.
I lost my creativity.
I lost me.
I miss her.
I used to love myself, admire myself.
I was confident.
I was innocent.
I was creative.
And now? Panic attacks, anxiety, problems, responsibilities, endless worries.
I feel like I've been dead for a long time. Like I'm just wandering among the living in some kind of dream. I feel disconnected from life, like a lifeless soul drifting through a world that keeps moving.
Why do I feel like I died a long time ago, and I'm just living these years backstage, trying to figure out the cause of my death?
Why does my life now feel like an illusion, while my past felt real?
God, I'm so tired of myself. Why do I miss the past so much? Why do I long for my old self?
She was strong and kind, despite her young age.
The older I get, the more scared I become. And the more I need her.
She was wise, creative, confident. Her soul was light and gentle, like a breeze. Everyone loved her. She was mischievous, but even her mischief was innocent. Despite being quiet at times, she was still well-known because she left a soft, lasting impact. Even if she caused a little trouble, it was never harmfuljust the kind of mischief that made people laugh later.
I admire her. I love her. I miss her the same way I mourn the people I've lost in my life.
I'm grieving myself. Because I died.

1j6ol0l,The work I did for CPS still haunts/revisits me (10 years later).,"I worked for Child Protective Services in a metropolitan area of the US for 12 years. I did both long term case management and later investigations that led to the removals of children. With about a decade of time and reflection, I've come to realize the following:
- I was a young woman with lots of privilege who did not understand the lives or needs of the people over whose lives I made decisions for. This now causes me great pain.
- Turns out I was dissociating through most of it due to secondary trauma and moral injury. The ability to dissociate (although we just saw it as toughing through back then) was seen as showing that you were a great worker and could ""get shit done"".
- I wanted to do good in the world and I wanted to help children. And I did. But I also caused harm because I had too many cases, not enough supervision and no real self-awareness.
- It took years of therapy to understand and grieve the harm I had caused and the harm caused to me. I don't even remember the first few years of my children's lives because I was so dissociated. I often have to look at a photos to remember events with them.
- I still get flashbacks of things I was exposed to and am swapped with pain.
Sometimes it all comes back. Just this week, I was contacted by a former colleague and a child who was on my caseload many years ago.
- The colleague reminded me of a child death case we worked on. It was particularly searing because we both had children that were about the same age as the child who died.
- She also reminded me about the death of another colleague (through an aneurism) and the suicide of a couple others. Yes, our work had a death count.
- The girl, now an adult, reached out to me to say she is doing well and to thank me for helping her find an adoptive home.
It's a mixed bag. And these memories reinforce in me the idea that nothing in life is guaranteed and I'm just trying to do the best I can each day. I screw up and I repair where I can. I put kindness and compassion into everything I do, but that isn't always enough.

I'm a 29 female, never been married and no kids. I've been thinking a lot about my past relationships lately, and I have to admit, it's been a tough journey. My last serious relationship ended in a painful breakup, and it's taken me a while to process my emotions.
As I reflect on what went wrong, I realize that I was blind to some major red flags. I ignored my intuition and stayed in the relationship longer than I should have.
But despite the heartache, l've learned so much about myself and what I want in a relationship. I'm taking the time to focus on myself, my friendships, and my community.
I spend a lot of time getting to know God more. He has helped me through the years to achieve a forgiven heart and renewed my spirit of a fun filled life.

1j6nu3m,My former high school friend fucked her ex's dad,"My (23F) and my friend group had a very eventful senior year. We had a friend ""Charlie"" who had been dating this boy ""Max"" since freshman year. We met during 10th grade and they had already been dating a year so she had already met his family and such. She would make these comments like ""Max's dad is so hot"" or ""Max looks just like his dad and they're both so attractive"", it was kinda funny at first, then she said ""Max's dad said if we were the same age, we'd be dating"", and that's when we knew Max's dad was a creep but she kept dating the boy and we couldn't do anything.
Fast forward to senior year, Max decides he wants to date other people so they break up. Charlie was distraught, barely even speaking to us, dragging her feet around school, the usual teenage break up shit, til eventually they get back together. And this is where things got interesting for us.
Covid hits, we're out of school and hanging out at Charlie's when she tells us she slept with one of Max's family members but wouldn't specify who. We thought it could've been his younger brother who's 2 years younger than us, she said it wasn't him, we said his dad, she claimed she wouldn't say. We didn't have to wait long tho, Max somehow finds out, we still don't know how, that she in fact fucked his father and all hell broke loose.
His father denied and denied, Max and his brother stopped speaking to their father and Charlie, we never heard anything about his mom but I can only imagine she was drawing up divorce papers. Oh, and the reason she didn't wanna specify it was him? They had sex in January, her 18th birthday was February
We haven't talked to Charlie in years, but before she stopped talking to us, she made a comment in a text like ""My man is taking me on vacation"" and when we asked who her ""man"" was, she just sent a smiling emoji and basically never talked to us again. Recently, we discovered through FaceBook that apparently, Charlie and Max's dad are still together, Max and his brother don't talk him, he and his wife divorced and he hardly ever sees their youngest daughter who's maybe 8 now.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 18:43:49 UTC,1333,76,0.97,,,0,0

maybe people can tell. maybe i'm just that strange person who loved her dog more than most humans, and who became a little less human when he went.
he was funny, mischievous, sweet. awkward, too. he wouldn't know what to do with the way i've been crying over him. he was always terrible with tears. he would sit with me so i wouldn't be alone, but always at a distancewatching me, or sometimes even turning his back. i used to get mad about it, like, aren't most dogs supposed to be cuddly and affectionate? but it's funny too, because that's how i am when someone i love cries. i hover nearby, silent, unsure if my presence is enough. i wonder if he ever thought the same thing about me.
people say dogs take after their owners, and i take it as proof that he loved me the way i loved him. i tend to repeat this as gospel - he got better for a while when i came back. we played, we ran, he jumped up on the bed with me to curl up, he stole my sweets, even though he couldn't even stand a week before - and pretend it even slightly makes up for the knowledge of knowing i will never see him do these things again.
is the pain of shattered hope worth the way that hope felt? sometimes, yes. today, no. maybe, in some way i don't yet understand, he's still sitting at a distance, watching and loving me the way he always did, just out of my reach.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 18:13:46 UTC,8,6,1.0,,,0,0

Of course he is not owed sex, but wouldn't it also be appropriate to have a conversation about dating preferences and how they're often based on various forms of discrimination, like racism, classism, ableism and toxic masculinity?
Why isn't anyone advocating for people to question their dating preferences when so many of them are rooted in several forms of discrimination them themselves claim to be against?
Yes, if after further reflection you still feel you can't let go of your preferences, by all means chase them, even if they're not exactly based on positive traits, because you really don't owe anyone your affection or your private parts.
Just don't use that excuse to not have to do some introspection about your preferences, their roots and how that's affecting you and also keeping some great people from finding love.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 18:03:11 UTC,0,34,0.36,,,0,0
1j6mwea,I understand why people in the west operate on individualism TW: su*cide mention,"I always hear a lot of critique about how the western world is too individualist. Well, I feel like I completely understand why now. I'm in Canada for reference.
I have been at my current job almost 3 years now. I have been on contract that entire time. I've been fighting to get permanent but no positive movement yet. Anyway, the last position I got was a 2 year contract-which comes to an end this summer. I feel I've been a positive addition to the team. The team was short staffed (*is* short staffed, even now) and I was able to help out with the work load. I'm a quick learner and pretty efficient, and I've definitely shown that on our extremely busy days, or days where extremely short staffed (we often have people falling ill or someone is on vacation). With my contract end coming up I asked my boss if there was a future for me. I have also been looking for work-with no luck-in preparation.
Well, this week she told me the chances of me being kept on were slim to none. I cried at my lunch break. Hell, I had panic attacks and cried before all this. I have been trying to find work and it's rejection after rejection or just not hearing back at all. Even jobs I'm more than qualified for aren't responding.
What has really hurt and frustrated me, is the apathy of those around me. Friends, coworkers I thought liked me, even family to an extent, could all care less. ""Oh damn that sucks. Anyway.""
And I 100% understand why. Why would *anyone*, even people who like me, give two shits about me? They have their own partners, families, finances, etc. to worry about. People don't give two shits what happens to anyone around them when they have their own lives. Someone they know could go homeless and it'd just be a ""damn how tragic! They were a nice person. Anyway, what's for dinner?""
I've been bullied at jobs to the point of being suicidal. People saw-and looked the other way. Dont want to involve themselves. I've complained to bosses/supervisors about workplace bullies only to go ignored. I've been chastised for speaking up. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. No one cares-they can like you, but they're there to get their bag and go home.
I see this a lot in Canada with the housing crisis. People who own their homes have a ""fuck you, I got mine"" attitude. They don't care about the rest of us, especially younger folk, who will never be able to afford even a modest apartment. They got their house, they got their family, fuck everyone else. The homeless are just an inconvenience/nuisance to them.
I've tried in my life to have a community mindset with helping others, caring, I always would send fitting job postings to unemployed friends who were looking to try and help out, tried to be there for others. No more. Never again. Not a single person around me would give a fuck if I died tomorrow because understandably, they have their own shit to worry about. Only people I can see caring about me being gone are my mom and dad.
I have fought my entire life to try and be better. Grew up with abusive step parents. Didn't grow up wealthy. Pretty much everything I did after 18 was my own-rent, schooling (with help of loans, which I am also paying off solo), finding jobs, figuring shit out, etc.
I'm done. My hope for finding work in time before my contract ends is extremely low. Even with experience and schooling, companies dont want to hire, or they want to pay you minimum wage for skilled work. And if they can't get a canadian to go that low they'll find a TFW who will take below minimum wage (story for another time). Idk what will happen to me but I know that I will not care about anyone else again. Im gonna worry about me only. Good luck to everyone else.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 18:02:51 UTC,2,2,0.75,,,0,0

1j6mcdn,Ex Is Still With Her Rebound,"I (18M) dated a girl for a year and a half and broke up with her last year. This was a time before I was saved, so I engaged in fornication with her (she claimed she was saved as well), but I never had intercourse. We went through a lot of problems in the later half of the relationship, and had minimal contact after it ended. A week after she broke up with me, she dated a new person. Today I just found out that after nine months, she's still with the rebound.
I want nothing, absolutely nothing to do with this person. I want to make that abundantly clear. But the idea that after a 1.5 year relationship that she moved on so quickly and ended up having a successful relationship with someone else really does hurt me, considering that I myself haven't been so lucky to find someone. This might also be TMI, but I also think about how she lost her virginity to someone who wasn't me.
I feel like God wants me to focus on my walk with him as opposed to finding someone else, but it really does get lonely. And my ex is always in the back of my mind when it gets too quiet.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 17:38:27 UTC,0,5,0.46,,,0,0
1j6m88b,I feel so useless,"I (19M) am an outgoing person usually, happy to talk to anyone about anything. But I have a very big social problem.
Whenever a bad incident happens, especially in the family, for example fights, arguments, grief etc., I feel strong anxiety and I need to go to the furthest, loneliest point in the building so I do not participate in the incident, not even hear it. And I feel so useless that I cannot support the people around me that need my help or help deescalate conflicts, but I start shaking very bad , my brain goes numb and my only thought is to get as far as possible. My brain cannot process staying even near the area of the bad incident. And I feel like the worst human possible because my severe anxiety that gets triggered by this doesnt even let me go talk about it after the incident, not even hugging anybody. I just ignore it as good as I can.

1j6lzc5,I think adults unaccompanied by children that judge at Disney are ridiculous,"I have two toddlers. We live in Florida, so we take them Disney. Initially we wanted to wait until they were old enough, but it became hard to find places to go on vacation or long weekends that had facilities for children.
Today we were at one on the parks and at a slower ride intended for all ages (toddler friendly), when our youngest threw a tantrum (1.5M). It was close 30 minutes until nap time, and he's been teething. We decided to come celebrate my eldest's birthday (3M), and especially since the recent passing of my father left him very sad and aggressive toward others at daycare (he cried seeing photos of my dad and asking where he was).
We apologized to the two women next to us, as my youngest threw things on the ground near them. They started off saying that it's OK. Then they proceeded to let us know that they never came to the parks before a certain age, and that my kids would be better ""just by the pool or something."" Keep in mind, we are in the Disney Junior area. And that drowning is a common cause of death in young children, and I know at least three families that have experienced that loss. I tried to keep it nice and then I finally said ""you know, they usually do well with travel, they're just tired today."" And said goodbye.
Was biting my tongue the whole time and wanted to remind them that this is a ride meant for younger children, and not adults in their 20's-60's (the two women were mother and daughter). I never understand the idea ""children must be seen and not heard."" At a children's ride in a theme park that is centered and based on children's cartoons and film. I don't care if adults show to the parks, but it's insane that adults want to also keep children acting like children from children's spaces.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 17:21:54 UTC,0,17,0.41,,,0,0

1j6l8oo,Friendless in college,"I'm an introverted person and prefer small gatherings to large gettogethers. But ever since I've joined college, I've not been able to find a friend group. I was close friends with one of my roommates but since I have shifted to off campus accommodation, I've not seen much of her as I used to and she seems to have adjusted well without me. And my mental and physical health got fucked because of severe lack of sleep, partly because of stress and because of my other roommate refusing to switch off the lights. I have fully recovered from my sickness, but am still struggling despite my parents finding a place nearby to stay with me. It seems like nobody except my parents and school friends value me, and even they live such fulfilling lives and are not struggling to make social connections like me. I feel there is something wrong with me because friendly conversations with people in class never progress further into a full fledged friendships, it's as if I'm invisible in people's eyes until I talk to them, and then they go back to their friends and ignore me like usual. I know this isn't the worst situation to be crying about, but it feels awfully isolating. And I was so absorbed in my own mental health struggles that I forgot to check on my best friend, and I feel bad for that as well. But it felt like she had moved on frm our friendship as we hardly saw each other and she would not attend our weekly calls (with her and another of my best friends).

im 15 and my mum was sick for the entirety of last year. long story short, she lost a LOT of weight and she needs to put on weight. other then that shes fine, shes able to do stuff & she has energy but im still very very worried that if she loses weight she'll become critically ill. we've been to multiple doctors and theyve reassured her shes fine but she needs to put on weight, it still worries me. shes gained weight but shes gaining it veeeery slowly
the problem is that we had a cyclone recently & she was under a LOT of stress. we're not at home rn so she cant weigh herself but i am so so fucking stressed & i cant help but wonder if shes lost even more weight. i dont have a dad or any support, im just on my own.
it feels like everytime i make any progress or my life seems to get even slightly better it all comes crashing down again. its been like this for years & i am EXHAUSTED.
i really dont have the strength to do this anymore. this has been going on for an entire year & it feels like every day is blending together and it keeps getting worse and worse. it feels like im losing my mind. i just want her to be healthy & get better, im so so exhausted of this. its horrible but im so so worried shes just gonna drop dead. i dont know what to do anymore, i really dont",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 16:36:37 UTC,2,0,1.0,,,0,0

He wanted me first.Flash forward we have had so many ups and downs. Where he pulls away and disappears on me. I have asked him upfront if he's seeing or having sex with anyone else. He tells me each time that no. He just has a low sex drive. I promise you me and this man have only been intimate a handful of times. Mind you just last week he was posted here. Nothing bad was said about him. But it only confirmed my suspicions. That he was infact seeing other woman. Yet i can't let this man go. I know i need too. I know it's only hurting me. Well..Now I'm laying next to him as we speak. His back turned to me. After we have done the dead. So to speak i haven't been at his place for a little over 5 months.

1j6kd1t,I (M30) lost the love of my life (23F) and I'm about to kill myself,"I was in a long distance relationship with this girl, since last august. She took me at my worse, at the time I was alcoholic, had no job, had social anxiety over the roof. Was single for years since my first relationship cheated on me 20 times or more, since then, I couldn't trust any woman and I was a bit broken. But life was going on anyway.
During those months together. I've had multiple relapse of alcohol and would send dumbs drunk messages to her. Nothing to serious. But it happened quite a bit. Just forgave me and understood my alcoholism, if I definitely stopped drinking.
That what I did. For the last 15 days, I was sober. I didn't told her but it was really really harsh, sweating, mood swing, shaking. But I was determined to not disappoint her.
Last Sunday. She sent a friend of her to message me on Instagram. I told her I was in couple. But then, I liked a photo of her in bikini, and told her we could flirt.
She had few followers, only one photo, for me it was pretty much a fake and I was messing around.
I would never have gone said that if I knew it was someone real, nor gone any further.
I am french and here, I've been asking friends and most of them tell me it was dumb, and a bit disrespectful, but not cheating, that our love must go above this mistake.
For her, friends and family all tell her I'm disgusting, it's unforgivable, and she told me you can't repair a broken glass... She never forgave cheating, and won't.
She is now ghosting me, blocked me everywhere because I have been spamming her to talk to me at least. I didn't realised at that time it was cheating and I feel miserable.
I've been sleeping for weeks, I've had found a job that I left the day after she broke with me, I even booked a flight and then canceled it, losing money in the process.
It's been one weeks and I desperately need her help, she was the one goal of my life, the only one I've ever been able to love again, I feel like killing myself everyday and I am not even joking, I know it will go wrong for me, i physically cannot live my life without her, not for a mistake I didn't realised... I never ever cheat, and I would never ever, I guess our boundaries are different and it's a miscommunication.
I have nothing to ask, my chest is empty, my life is empty, I just wanna kill myself now, and I have no way to contact her to explain her my point of view...
TLDR : Sorry if I failed you, I don't know how much longer I can endure this. I love you more than anything. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry...
Edit : The worse part is she never let me a chance to explain myself, to even say goodbye, she just disappeared like I am nothing. I can't express how much pain I am going through right now, I just cant keep living this life without her.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 16:09:01 UTC,0,18,0.36,,CONTENT WARNING: SUICIDE/SELF HARM,0,0
1j6jf69,"Feeling like a second-tier friend, and I don't know what to do about it.","Okay, so I've been feeling some type of way about this for a hot minute, and I just need to rant. Idk if I'm overthinking or if I'm actually onto something, so here goes.
I have these two friends, right? They've been besties since nursery, and I joined them in 7th grade. And listen, I never had an issue with thatI knew their bond was stronger, and that was fine. But recently, it's been feeling like I'm just... there. Like, I'm included, but not really included, y'know?
One of them is dating this guy, and their relationship has been a damn rollercoaster. Long story short, dude was dramatic as hell, dumped her over some misunderstanding, then ran around spreading shit that made her look bad. Back then, our whole group was like, ""Nah, he's trash, you deserve better."" Fast forward a few months, and suddenly they're treating him like he's some god-tier boyfriend. Now he's ""so sweet,"" ""so caring,"" ""such a gentleman."" Like girl, be so for real.
Now, I'm also dating someone, and every time I bring him up, I get the driest reactions possible. ""Oh, he's nice."" Thanks??? That's it??? Meanwhile, they're out here writing a whole PhD thesis about how amazing her man is, even after he did her dirty?? The math is NOT mathing.
And it's not just that. Even when I ask them basic questions, they either leave me on seen or reply two days later with the most half-assed response ever. But somehow, they have the time to be active af on Instagram, sending me reels??? Calls? LMAO, those don't even exist anymore. And yeah, they've never been big on calling, but even when they promise they'll call, they never do. And before anyone says ""Maybe they're just busy with college?""nah, they have time for our other friends, just not me.
And yeah, I've tried bringing it up before. The problem? They'll act normal for like, a week, and then go right back to the same cycle. Atp, I don't even see the point in saying anything anymore.
Oh, and the cherry on top? I recently got a pink rose from my boyfriend, and I was so happy because I genuinely prefer pink roses over red ones. I shared it with them, and the reaction was so bland. Like, no hype, no excitementjust a casual ""Oh, that's nice."" I know if it were one of them, the energy would've been completely different.
Idk, am I tripping, or does this sound off to anyone else? Cuz it's kinda giving ""you're an option, not a priority"" energy, and I don't know how to feel about that.

1j6iwr6,"My life is never going to get better,neither am I.","PS:I apologize if some things don't make sense as english isn't my first language!!
I'm not sure that anything will genuinely get better.I feel as if I'm a rotting corpse.
I'm a 15 year old girl,it may sound childish and dramatic saying this at such a young age,but let me give a backstory.
I've had extreme trouble socialising my whole life.
I was a very sensitive child,people could barely speak to me or crack jokes with me without me starting to cry.Regardless,I did have a few friends as a child,but it wasn't the best experience.
I couldn't handle insults and staying with people for a longer period of time,I much preferred to stay home and do my own thing,so of course people found me weird.
The fact that I wasn't born beautiful didn't make this any better,""ugly"" was peoples favourite insult to use on me.
Once I started school,it became even worse.I still haven't learned to accommodate to people,but I was academically gifted,so people still came up to me,but mostly to help them with their work,aside from that I was bullied and I've never managed to stand up for myself.I would simply sit through all of that,I would say my prayers at night hoping it would eventually become better.
Eventually my mother said she will leave to a different city to find a better job,she didn't pay much attention to me in the first place,it was mostly my grandma taking care of me,so I though this was an opportunity to get closer to her and get a better school life, so I begged her to take me as well and said I could continue school there,but God little did I know it was going to get much worse.
I got bullied a thousand times worse at my new school,and at home there was nobody to comfort me this time.She got a boyfriend,who was and still is a horrible person.He sexually,physically and verbally abused me.She knew but couldn't care less as he had lots of money,plus she was already neglectful,so what could have I expected from her.
It was simply too much for me to handle,I started skipping school every single chance I got,if I got sent forcefully by my mom once the teachers started sending her messages,I would simply wait for an opportunity to run away.It somehow never got taken to court,for 4 years I was skipping as long as It was still possible to pass the year with such a big number of absences.Ive developed a sh addiction as well.I would burn,cut,scratch myself,whatever option was available at the moment.
I started causing a lot of trouble as well,I won't go into detail on this one,but it was mostly to have some form of control over my abusers, to make them feel as shitty as I did,so to say.Eventually they got tired of me and sent me to a psychiatrist which gave me some sertraline (I was 13 around this time) and the psychiatrist suggested to move to a new school.
They refused to check out another school and just sent me back to my old town.
Now that's where I am.I got back on track and I'm at the top of my class once again,but of course I am still given cruel treatment from my peers.
My other relatives are the only people who don't hate me.
I am at an extreme form of social alienation.I have no friends.Not even one (in real life) ,I spend all of my time online,drawing & reading books or drinking.
I am severely traumatised,I have severe OCD,anorexia,ARFID and Im in such deep derealization,I also have a history of psychosis and I am unable to get treatment.
(I've also gotten told I fit the criteria for BPD but due to my age there isn't a possibility to get diagnosed).I also have a ton of health issues.
And if I'm being honest,at this point I'm not even sure if I truly wish to get better or to make friends.I hate people and they hate me.
I don't speak much either,I only speak once it's necessary,I hate doing it anyway.
I do love spending my time daydreaming though,Im a maladaptive daydreamer and I spend up to 10 hours just daydreaming.I love daydreaming that I am a beautiful and kind girl living an adventurous life with lots of meaningful connections,because Irl I feel hopeless,I feel that I will be alone for the rest of my life.I have no dreams for the future and remembering the fact that I have school makes me wanna commit suicide,but I would never do this to my relatives or to my bestfriend.(though the urge to try once again is STRONG)
I sometimes wonder if Ive committed some terrible crimes in my past life and if this life is a punishment for that. </3
I have no clue why I have always gotten bullied either,but my best guess is that unattractive girls are seen as a societal embarrassment,plus the fact that I dressed and looked ""too weird"" for them.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 14:59:27 UTC,4,0,0.83,,,0,0

1j6i1fv,My gf violated me last night,"So, my girlfriend (32) and I (30M) have been together for almost a year now and everything is going really well. There have been Ups and Downs in our sex life in the past because of several health reasons, but recently we both feel like our sex really took off. I was kind of inexperienced before I met her so there are a lot of firsts for me.
A few weeks ago we started experimenting some more and talked about things we'd wanna try, and even watched some video footage of those things to get some ideas and stuff.
I told her that I'd experimented with butt play on myself in the past and I would like to try that during sex (not talking about pegging here). We ended up buying a whole bunch of toys and stuff for both of us including some buttplugs.
Last night we ended up really tipsy and horny so I suggested giving it a try.
We did... And at first it was really nice and hot. We both enjoyed it and had some fun UNTIL all of a sudden I felt the plug pop out. We stopped, and looked around everywhere but the plug was nowhere to be found. That was the moment we realized the (moderately big) plug, even though it had a wide base, got sucked up my butt and was in fact stuck there.
I straight up fucking panicked and my gf said she could see the terror in my face. I instantly felt sick and started sweating, felt like throwing up. So it was like, do we go to the ER or what do we do?! I preferred not becoming one of those embarrassing sex accident ER stories...
So we decided to try and get it out ourselves. I kneeled on my bathroom floor with my upper body leaning over my bathtub because I felt like I'll throw up.
And yeah... My girlfriend basically had to use half her hand trying to fish it out real deep up my butt. It hurt like shit and when it finally got out I was grossed out, felt violated, exhausted and traumatized. I ended up in fetal position in my bathroom with my girlfriend nearly crying for having to hurt me.
My butt still hurts today and was bleeding a bit this morning and I'm severely traumatized. Even though I'd love to keep trying this, I don't know if I'll ever be able to trust a plug again.
My girlfriend did an amazing job being there for me and preventing me from going into a full panic attack so we kinda bonded over this even more. All in all a very traumatic but kind of funny story, I wanted to share!",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 14:15:20 UTC,0,14,0.28,,Positive,0,0
1j6hwbu,"I miss my girlfriend, but I want to break up with her","I don't want to break up with her, but I feel like it's the only way we can go from here. I see a future with her but it all seems so far away and idealistic. I love her so much but I don't know, maybe we rushed into the relationship thing too much. It's hard being LDR.
Plus, I'm not getting what I need out of our relationship but I'm too afraid to tell her the things we need to work on because I don't want to add to the insane stress she's going through right now. I always preach for communication but it's so much harder when it's between me and my partner. I feel like we don't click anymore. There are always times we don't talk for days at a time because we prioritize academics and stuff. I've come to expect it because we both promised we'd prioritize academics above each other but yeah I believe our relationship may be a hindrance to her studies at this point. I know she loves me but it's just hard to see it, especially during the busiest days. Not even a ""good morning"" or one text for a couple days.
I miss her. I miss what we used to be. But I think at this point we might have come to a natural stopping point.

1j6h0tu,I am so glad I was able to escape obesity before I turned 30.,"I just turned 29 last week. Down to 155lbs
For the majority of my 20's, my weight never went below 250, even at 6'1, that's very bad. In 2022, at the height of the pandemic, I ballooned to 300+, which was a wakeup call to me. In 2023, I began my journey and the impetus was a trip to Vegas with my friends and we were all at a beach club watching a concert.
It was a looong journey, the whole process took 15 plus months, I started from 282, did a lot of cardio, in the middle of it all, used hydroxycut supplements to speed up the process.
I'll never forget the day in 2024, I looked at the scale and saw 170 lbs, and how light my body felt. I'm glad I was able to pull this off while I still have my youth.
Currently, I'm resting from exercises as per the doctor, taking a break from physical activity (I have to wait at least 4 to 6 months before I can go back to the grind), lying in my bed as I'm typing this. This is a lesson to myself that, moving forward, I have to make better decisions about my health.

1j6gvv6,my girlfriend makes me feel crazy,"this is a stupid throwaway vent, i just need to get this off my chest. i don't expect anyone to see this i just need to talk.
my (25M) girlfriend (24F) makes me feel like i'm crazy. any time i show a negative emotion, it's met with annoyance and frustration. or with a look of bewilderment like it came out of nowhere or there was no lead-up.
don't get me wrong. i love her, and i'm certain she loves me. we have been through some incredibly hard times and supported each other through them all.
but i can't help feeling like she doesn't care or want to consider how i'm feeling in a given situation. every time we argue (be it something big like family or small like a movie) she continuously hammers the fact that i'm getting defensive, or that it's not that deep. that i'm thinking too hard into things. i can't tell her she's wrong about something without her thinking i'm fully against her. she's hardly ever conceded a point unless i compromise with her that she is partly right.
i've brought this up with her several times, and there's never been any concession. any recognition of how what she says and how she says things might rub me the wrong way. she doesn't apologize or acknowledge what she says as pointed or hurtful. only discards it as not being what she meant. she tells me that i interpreted it wrong, and that i misunderstood her. she outlines what she meant in great detail. and sometimes i can tell that it's not the the truth. she'll go as far as telling me how badly it makes her feel that i interpreted what she said negatively.
i feel constantly contrary, or like i can't do anything but agree.
when she's angry, or annoyed, i need to act accordingly. i WANT to act accordingly. i want her to feel listened to, i want to sympathize with her feelings. i don't pinpoint where she is mistaken because ultimately the nitpicky parts don't matter, it matters how i made her feel. i don't ever want her to feel like something is in her head or not real, or like her feelings are wrong and something to dismiss.
if i brought this up with her again. she would try proving me wrong with things i've said that upset her. or tell me how much it hurts that i thought of her in this way.
i don't know where i'm getting at with this. i love our relationship. i love what we have and i don't want anything major about the way we interact with each other to change. i dont want her to walk on eggshells around me for fear of upsetting me like im a child that cant handle an argument. i can, i just can't handle it being one-sided, or with special rules i have to follow that she doesn't. i just want her to be kinder, or at least Fair. i guess idk.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 13:13:30 UTC,4,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j6gkb7,Obsessed with my best friends pornstar girlfriend.,"I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that my friend from high school is dating a pornstar. I mean, I've known him for years, and we've been through thick and thin together. But when I stumbled upon her videos, my mind was blown. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. She's doing some extremely hardcore stuff - I'm talking multiple giant cock gangbangs, and her body is just... wow. She has a gigantic ass that seems to be the center of attention in almost every scene.
At first, I felt a mix of emotions - shock, curiosity, and a little bit of jealousy, I won't lie. I've always thought of my friend as a bit of a shy guy, so it's hard to imagine him with someone who's so... outgoing. But as I watched more of her videos, I started to feel a twinge of concern. I mean, this is a whole different world that I'm not familiar with, and I worry about my friend getting hurt or caught up in something that's not good for him.
But at the same time, I have to admit that I'm also kind of fascinated. I've never seen anything like this before, and it's like my eyes are glued to the screen. I feel like I'm getting a glimpse into a secret world that most people don't know about, and it's both thrilling and terrifying.
I don't know how to process all of this, to be honest. Part of me wants to talk to my friend about it, to ask him if he's okay and if he knows what he's getting himself into. But another part of me is afraid of judgment, of being seen as a hypocrite or a voyeur. I mean, who am I to judge what he's doing or who he's dating?
All I know is that my mind is reeling, and I don't know how to reconcile my feelings about this. I guess all I can do is wait and see how things play out, and hope that my friend knows what he's doing.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 12:54:39 UTC,0,142,0.48,,,0,0
1j6g3oe,I blew up my wife's family yesterday.,"I have a trans son. They came out sometime back in 2014-2015. My wife's family has never been too keen on the idea, but we managed a lukewarm truce until they graduated high school. That ended last night. People started dogpiling my wife on a social media post, and once the attacks got personal, my name got drug in, cause I have had my angry eyes in over social media for a few months. And I snapped. They were abusing my wife for some dumb shit i posted to deal with my anger. So I told them all the truth. About how bullshit it was that we were constantly being gaslit into thinking they accept my son for who they are, but even after 7 years they still can't use their preferred name.
Of course, that self righteous anger rarely feels good the next day. Sure I felt vindicated, but my wife is devastated. Her family has abused her, her entire life, but to her, they are still family. I can't stand them, because they are those reformed drug addicts that now think they are better than everyone else. But she loves them, and she is devastated.
As much as i can't stand her family, I really regret telling them how I actually thought of them over this issue with my son. Because it won't fix anything. It's just gonna make shit worse, and the only person that is going to suffer is my wife.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 12:26:28 UTC,2285,210,0.87,,,0,0
1j6fs50,My girlfriend has been bullied by her dorm mates just because they think it's fun,"My girlfriend is the most innocent person I've ever known. She is so sweet and caring towards everyone. And always avoids trouble.
Last night, in their dorm, 7 girls started bullying her and making fun of her everything.
She texted me saying she was afraid and her hands were shaking. She insisted she did nothing wrong and doesn't know what's happening. I told her to keep ignoring them because they may be waiting for a reaction to start a huge argument and she is afraid of arguments.
They kept making fun and having inside jokes about her right in front of her untill 2 AM.
This morning i went to see her and she was broken. It's so painful for me to see her like this. She is crying like a baby and keeps saying she did nothing wrong to them.
We informed people in charge of the dorm and they said they will check it out! Which obviously means they will never take it seriously.
Last night I couldn't sleep well. I keep thinking of possible ways to take revenge. I don't want this to happen again. And I don't want her to give in without a fight.
How can i teach them a lesson?
We are arranging to change her room. She is moving out tonight.
I had an idea to write things on boards in classes the bully is going to be in and get her name on everyone's mouth.

1j6femf,I stole from my patients,"I used to work in a bougie Care Home several years ago.
This involved feeding elderly patients with dementia.
Well, dementia can make feeding quite difficult and a lot of the patients don't eat much. We had everything from quiche, steak to the best desserts.
Most of the time they would have a few spoons and be done.
Now I know where your mind is going with this smiling_face_with_tear.
So I used to feed my patient and enjoy some of the food once they were done. I would take 2 spoons and feed them from one side. Then I would eat from the other side.
The dementia meant they couldn't really say anything. And I would sit in a position to make sure I was not in view. I would offer food multiple times even if they declined as well. So I felt I was giving them my best. I was barely 18 and I'm so ashamed every time I think about it.
My hunger was stronger than my shame at the time. And the fact it was the same platelike what was I thinking loudly_crying_face
But honestly the food was sensational, I still think about that damn chef. It's not an excuse and I still have regrets.

1j6elyg,I thought my boyfriend's aunt in law was amazing until I realized she's a narcissist.,"I (29F) have been dating my boyfriend (33M) for 13 years and was really close to his Aunt-in-Law (Aunt Ana). She was like a sister, a friend, even a mother figure and I love her so much... But over time, my bf and I noticed she thrived on gossip, twisting stories, and stirring drama.
The Pattern of Manipulation:
1. Aunt Sarah constantly gossiped about other AIL(Aunt-In-Law) pitting them against each other.
2. She spread private conversations that my boyfriend and I had with her.
3. She was weirdly jealous when AIL Carla got a new car and ignored her.
4. She twisted the story to make the other AIL look bad so that my boyfriend and I would always be close to her instead of the other AIL.
I and my Bf finally saw her for who she really was a narcissist who thrives on stirring drama.
Now, we're done.
We were naive to believe everything Aunt Ana told us about other people. We keeping our distance, but the damage is done.
The worst part? I feel powerless. I know she's been badmouthing me, and I have no receipts to defend myself.

1j6dfpx,I'm struggling to sit by my dying dad,"TW: Cancer and terminal illness (fairly graphic)
I'm going to keep it really brief. My dad has cancer and is pretty much unresponsive now.
Just this morning he's started to make a gurgling rattle sound whilst breathing. His breathing is shallow and it's a loud sound, probably saliva built up in his throat because he can't swallow anymore.
I think it's likely he only has hours left but I can't be sure. I want to sit next to him and be with him when he passes but the sound is so horrible and I'm finding it too upsetting to hear it. I don't know what to do. I'm currently switching between the sofa a few meters away and right next to his bed every few minutes.

We had so much in common, we both made each other laugh, you get the gist. But all of a sudden he stopped talking to me. Mind you, he had stopped speaking to me in April 2024, and then randomly texted me from a new number in December or November? But nonetheless I was elated to have him as a friend again. Me and him have bonded over the few months that we were talking, and all of a sudden, he doesn't answer. I know you could be busy, people have a busy life and I'm not expectant of people to answer, but when you are free you could at least say that your busy y'know?
Now here's my biggest issue: I'm crushing on him badly. I thought I wasn't that affected and what not, I really did, but I literally think about him every day! AND I just had A DREAM ABOUT HIM! Which is crazy, because I've never dreamed the way I did, and now I don't know what to do. He's showed me attention and spoke to me in ways that I've never experienced and I don't wanna say I love him because I don't know what love feels like and honestly I've never seen it before between my parents if I'm being honest, so I pray its just a little crush??",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 09:13:17 UTC,0,4,0.5,,,0,0

It's one thing to lack an attention span, it's another thing to be genuinely unable to comprehend logic, and not even *know* I don't get it until other people point it out to me. People around me try to spare my feelings but I can see it in their faces that they know I'm at the absolute bottom of the class.
I'm genuinely so dumb and I don't know what's going to happen to me.

1j6d566,I'm going crazy for a very stupid reason,"My sister stole an earring of mine, I'm sure. A long, fringed earring with a rhinestone on the head that I could remove that I bought about three years ago. It was my absolute favorite, basically the only one I wore and I wore it everywhere, it was perfect for everything, I didn't even need another one.
I wore it to a party in December, and I clearly remember taking it off inside the house and putting it in my jewelry box. But when I went to wear it again, where was it? It doesn't make sense. I didn't lose that earring, I put it where it should have been, but someone took it, didn't tell me and to this day has never given it back to me.
I live with my mother, two sisters and my grandfather; and my aunt is the neighbor in the apartment across the hall, and she and her daughter have complete access to my house. I've already gone to everyone, calmly asked if they had taken it, if they had borrowed it and forgotten to return it; everyone said no.
But here's the thing: my older sister is a bitch. She comes into my room and takes my stuff. She's already finished my perfume, makeup, skincare, hair products - expensive stuff. She complains when I complain, she takes absolutely no care with anything. My whole life has been like this with her, and my whole life I've complained to my mother about it - but my mother just told me to keep my stuff away from her. It's kind of hard when we live in the same house, but it's okay.
She's already taken some of my jewelry and broken it. When I was a kid, she took three of my rings and returned them to me broken that same night, but I was a kid and the rings had cost 30 reais in total.
When I was 17, she took a pair of earrings that my aunt gave me for my 15th birthday, big earrings with stones, more expensive, but besides everything else, a gift, the same thing happened, they disappeared and one day, rummaging through her room, I found them broken; She didn't even bother to show it to me. This one caused me problems, but this woman had the nerve to tell me to my face ""I'm not going to buy another one, they're too expensive"" with the utmost disdain in the world, and my mother did nothing. I kept up the conversation for a while, telling her that she was an irresponsible idiot who had stolen my earrings, but it was no use, and at 17 years old, what was I going to do? Sue her for a pair of earrings? Alone, even more so, because my mother wouldn't help me.
Brother, this story about that earring that she broke has been cooking in me all these years and, along with everything I went through with her in my childhood, God, I hate this woman.
Now, the same thing happened. My earring disappeared and there was absolute silence. I know she has it, I know she took it. But it was in December, it's already March. I've asked her on separate occasions if she took my earring and she said no. I've already gone to her room and turned everything upside down looking for those earrings and I couldn't find them (I found other things of mine that I hadn't even noticed were not even with me anymore). I want to look in her bag, but she won't let me, she'll get stressed and throw them to my mother who will be on her side like she always is.
Brother, I'm going to go crazy because sometimes I stop and think about this piece of crap earring that I know she took. I know I didn't lose it, I know where I put it; if it had been my fault, if I had left it at the party where I wore it, if I had put it in my bag and it disappeared, if it had fallen on the street, I know I would have gotten over it by now; but no, it disappeared in my house, in the place where it should be, someone took it. The only person who has the nerve to steal it from me and act like the biggest sly person there is. Practically every week I end up staging fights and fights with her, demanding that she give me back the earrings that I know she stole, but she'll turn the story around and I'll leave like a crazy person because I've already looked in her room and nothing. And I swear that, for real, if I found that piece of shit earring with her I would sue her, now I would sue her. It costs a lot less than the earring she broke, but I don't care. I just want my earring, I just want that bitch to give me back what's mine because I know she has it.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 08:53:21 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j6d4je,Was I Just a Mistake to Her? (M/27 & F/23),"I (M/27) was in a relationship with (F/23) for 1 year. In the beginning, everything was beautifulshe made me feel loved, valued, and important. We had deep conversations, shared our dreams, and supported each other through tough times.
I did everything I could to make her happy. I even observed Roza (fasting) for her during Ramadan despite not being Muslim myself. I thought we had something real, something worth fighting for. But slowly, things changed.
She became distant, cold, and dismissive. Conversations turned into arguments, and it felt like I had to beg for her time and attention. She started blocking me randomly, only to unblock me when she wanted to talk. It felt like a cycle of manipulationpush and pull.
Our last conversation was painful. She told me outright that she wouldn't have texted me if I hadn't agreed with her. And when I told her I didn't want to compete in arguments anymore, she responded with,*""Text me over Insta DM if I feel like it, then blocking back.""*
That hurt. It made me feel like I was nothing to her, just an option she could pick up and discard at will. I've spent so much time wonderingwas I just a mistake to her? Did she ever love me, or was I just convenient at the time?

We've been together for 3 years now and she really helped me out of a dark place. After months of being together she moved in and slowly over time I've just became more and more disgusted by who she is and wants to be. She's lazy, very very overweight, and keeps moving towards this loser mindset.
She never cleans the house and constantly makes messes. If i finally get her to clean, its the laziest half assed clean up and she has an attitude the entire time she does it. She's made so many stains on our carpet, left drinks and food out, and leaves a mess in my car. She's been overweight our entire relationship and I've tried so many times to get her to lose weight and every time she throws a fit about it and makes it unbearable. I've pleaded to her about how i care about her health and i want her to live a long happy life, and she just doesn't seem to care. She has horrible friends who cheat on their bfs, were ex meth addicts, and all are going to go no where in life. I've always wanted to be something big and keep improving myself over time to reach those dreams and goals i have and she doesn't. The only thing she wants is to be a mom, thats it. No drive for a good job, good career, legacy just nothing besides the bare minimum.
Despite all of this i still love her. I'm frustrated with myself cause maybe i did something along the way to make her this way?

1j6crrw,I have a pregnancy fetish,"I am a male in my late 20s and am writing this post because I wanted to get something off my chest to get honest feedback from people. Good or bad. I have a pregnancy fetish. Essentially I find a big pregnant belly extremely attractive and the thought of the women's breasts, hips butt, getting bigger very attractive. It is purely objective/visual and I have had this ever since I was young. I have always felt very uncomfortable with having this fetish. Pregnancy is normally thought of as an amazing beautiful thing which to most people means 'baby' on the way. I also see it this way but separate to that I have this fetish as well. I worry that if someone hears pregnancy fetish that they will immediately think that this is some sicko thing for unborn babies or just not understand what the hell that kind of fetish is or what it means and immediately feel uncomfortable. Don't get me wrong, I'm not planning on openly telling people but as my peer group enters the 'having kids' stage of life I am feeling weird about it. I know that society has changed quite a lot but fetishes are still very taboo and make a lot of people uncomfortable. Sometimes I wish I didn't have the fetish just so I wouldn't have to deal with the mixed feeling. The only person who knows about it as an ex girlfriend of mine. I worry sometimes that she might tell people about it and I would feel very embarrassed and not know how to deal with it / friends looking at me differently.

1j6cqoq,"I feel stuck, lost, and exhausted, and I don't know what's happening to me","I'm a 17-year-old guy, and I've always been a hard workerenergetic, supportive, and the kind of person who lifts others up. But for the past eight months, I've felt like a completely different person.
(No one knows about this, and this is my first time venting or talking about it.)
Mid-2024, my parents had a huge fight. I thought, they argue all the time, it'll be fine, but this time was different. My mom fell into depression right in front of me. I took her to therapy, checked in on her daily, and tried to be there for her.
Then my dad shut down too. He locked himself in his office, barely ate, and was cold whenever I tried to talk. My dad is just like mewe hate sharing emotionsso I just sat with him in silence, hoping he'd feel less alone.
Watching the two strongest people I know fall apart broke something in me, but I held everything together. My routine was: wake up, check on my dad, school, gym, study, then spend hours with my mom. The only time I had to myself was 12-4 AM, and that's when I met a girl online. Our dumb late-night conversations were the only thing keeping me sane.
By September, my parents were worseand so was I. My grades were bad no matter how much I studied. And the girl who helped me escape started playing mind games, making things worse.
Then in October, my parents got better. They were laughing, eating together, and finally acting like themselves again. I thought life was turning around.
But a few days before my birthday, I got a phone call. One of my childhood best friends had died from cancer. That was my breaking point.
At his funeral, my brother cried. Everyone criedexcept me. At the grave, surrounded by people sobbing, I felt like an outcast. I wanted to cry. I should have cried. But I couldn't.
That night, I sat in the shower, eyes red as hell, trying so desperately to cry. But nothing. I just wanted to feel human again.
I held it together until February. That's when the girl told me she loved me. I said it back, and for the first time in months, I thought maybe life was finally giving me something good.
But now, for the past eight days, I've done nothing but eat, sleep, and doom-scroll. I haven't gone to the gym. I haven't studied. I haven't done anything. And I have an important test in three days. I'm stressed, but I don't even care.
And to make it worse, the girl who said she loved me is playing the same mind games again. I don't understand why. I thought I finally had something good, but now I just feel like an idiot.
I feel like everyone's life is moving forward except mine. I've been stuck since July, and I don't know how to fix it.
Nobody knows anything about this. It's just me, alone, going through all of this by myself.
I just feel lost, scared, and overwhelmed, so please, what's happening to me? What do I do?

1j6cle7,My mother died 6 days ago,"Y'all, I'm struggling. There's so much, and I'm not faultless. Mother & Daddy divorced before my 5th birthday. Mother ""let"" my older half-brother* live with his bio-dad once he turned 13. Mother also was diagnosed as bipolar in the 1960s and was treated far too long on lithium. I get this logically, but emotionally.,,I always lost out.
My mother & my aunt/:her sister have always found a common ground. They've had typical sister disagreements over the years*but* have always been each other's biggest advocates. Point is my mother was not a bad person.
Around my 5th grade year I tuned into fashion. I wanted what I liked, not her cutesy smocked dresses, etc. listen I am now as Southern as can beI have a ridiculous amount of monogrammed items and would/will happily support a smocked personalized/monogrammed adult dress! There's no shame in my game. Whatever I buy for my niece will have a matching auntie(or mom) part! ***
When my older half-brother was 12, he went to live with his father. After my older brother's death when I was 12 myself, I was sent to *my* father and his wife and my younger half-brothers. To this day, we are all full siblings in each other's eyes. My daddy raised my older brother, and his final wife helped raise us. This stepmom loves me and adopted me.
Today, on the anniversary of my husband's death, I learned that my bio mother passed away 6 days ago. Our last visit was very pleasant; neither of us drug up the past. However I am struggling with the fact that the hospital (where I used to work, and still love) did not notify me, my aunt, or the temporary Power of Attorney. I've been out of reach for a couple of years so a family friend stepped in as mPoA, knowing my mother's wishes. My aunt & I have consistently been listed in medical records as emergency contacts. No one from the hospital contacted my aunt, me, or the mPoA.
My mother's body has been unclaimed in the hospital morgue for 6 days. 6 days!!!
How am I supposed to feel?
TL;dr: my bio mom passed away 6 days ago in the hospital. They disregarded all emergency contacts listed and her temporary medical PoA in my absence. Her body has been unclaimed in the morgue for almost a week. They told my aunt on Monday that she had been discharged(blatant lie). There's a lot to unpack but she was my mother. We had a lovely visit before I left town 3 weeks ago. I'm so furious that her body has been ""unclaimed"" in the hospital morgue.
Note: I loved this healthcare system. I spent almost a decade of my career in their local hospital Admin. When I was very, very sick, this staff literally saved my life. I've been so loyal until this circumstance",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 08:11:51 UTC,6,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j6ch02,I don't know how to feel about my girlfriend,"I only come on here whenever I'm the most sad. It's quite depressing but I also don't have anyone to talk to about it. I truly don't know if I really love my girlfriend. We were just on call and she said she was gonna call me back but she went out to eat with her friends. Ever since she started school we've been texting less and seeing each other less and it almost just feels like we have our own lives. A month ago we hung out all the time and I was so happy being with her. Now she prefer to hangout with her friends or she's busy and we just don't have time for each other. She's a sweet girl but I don't feel much for her now. I want a girl I can have time for and be with. But she doesn't seem to really want to be with me. It doesn't even feel like a relationship. I barely see her, no romance or contact is going on. I crave so much just for us to not be able to do anything. I feel like I've lost interest in her and I don't want it to be that way cause I feel bad. But how can we be lovers when we aren't lovey dovey or we don't see each other or anything. It could just be a boring period right now but I just can't do it anymore. I need someone who I can be with that we will have time for each other and be with each other",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 08:03:07 UTC,1,6,1.0,,,0,0
1j6cd70,Is this considered S/A?,Well he slept over and I slept on the floor and gave him the bed . He woke me up at 5 am kissing all over me and wanting to be intimate. Before penetration I told him no and said it more than once . He did it anyways it hurt because there was no lube involved. Somehow I started to think it was ok and that since it was already in that it was already done. Afterwards I got up to use the bathroom and came to realization that I had said no and he still did it. I came back and cried into my pillows and blankets and he tried to act like he cared asking what was wrong. Tried to talk to me about it I told him I was mad at him and upset and he tried to apologize and even cried cuz I told him not to touch me. Anyways I've brushed it off but I keep thinking about how I told him no and how he took advantage of me in a way. I was barely even awake to begin with and was woken up at 5am for this. He said sorry and that his hormones took over. Idk what to think anymore about him .,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 07:55:27 UTC,1,10,0.57,,CONTENT WARNING: SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0
1j6c8nk,A man tried to get into my house today. I did everything wrong except lock the door,"It was just my almost 2 year old son and me in the house. Dogs were outside and I was at the kitchen table doing my makeup getting ready for work as I was supposed to leave in 2hrs. The doorbell rang and I ignored it for a couple minutes. It's not uncommon for solicitors to try and sell shit. I slowly walked up to my front door peephole and looked out. There was a man standing with his back to the door blocking most of my view and then a second man was out at my curb back also facing my door kinda looking around. I started to get nervous and slowly turned the lock on the front doorknob so he wouldn't hear I was on the other side.
Important to note: my mom's transmission went out last week so she's borrowing my car. No cars in the driveway or in front on the street. But the TV was on playing a kid show for my toddler so he wouldn't miss my presence as much while getting ready.
I watched him for a bit and decided he'd probably leave soon and started walking away. That's when I heard my glass door open. I thought I'd hear him knock next but instead I got to watch as my front door knob started jiggling like someone was trying to get in. And then I froze. Instead of getting my husband's gun to protect myself and my child I did nothing. I just froze. He fiddled with the door knob for a bit and then eventually walked away. I peeped out the kitchen window and watched as this dude met up with his buddy and then they started walking away.
I texted my husband instead of calling the police. He's the one that did. He told me to call them because they wanted to ask me questions, and so I did. Then when I tried to call my phone said I had to connect to a wifi or network to make a call. My bill is paid every month on the 2nd and I was connected to wifi. Just another thing that was going wrong. The police had to call me back and ask if I was ok to even talk to them. When the police did show up they said the guys were solicitors and it's illegal in the city to do that. We even have 2 no soliciting signs taped to the glass door. She said her partner found them up the street and was kicking them out of the neighborhood. Since there was no proof they tried to enter the house nothing could be done. The only thing they could do was drive up to the company and tell them that if they walk onto our property again they will have trespassing charges filed and the company will receive a citation.
At the end of it all I'm extremely shaken. I didn't do anything right except lock the door. I didn't tell them to go away. I didn't call 911. I didn't get a weapon. I just locked the door and then watched as they tried to get in, texted my husband, and then did what I was told. I cried for a long time after. I'm still not doing great. If I hadn't locked that door I really don't know what could've happened. If you've read this far thank you, I just really needed to get this off my chest and out.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 07:46:11 UTC,496,57,0.95,,,0,0
1j6c7jl,Closure with my ex,">Yes I once loved you and couldn't think of living without you, but that changed long before you thought. One month after the wedding it started. But I really tried to work through it and honor our vows. But the last years before we opened our marriage and went ENM I thought about your death more than once. I never thought about killing you but about you dying and freeing me from my vow. I resented you. And the last months I just plain hated you, everyone saw how bad you treated me allthough I sacrified everything for you I could. Only I didn't see it.
Then you found a new victim and toss me when I started speaking up.
>So no we will not stay friends. Not now, not in a year, never. I do not want to ever see or hear you again.
I am sorry for your new GF I warned her. I tried. She didn't listen you love bombed her like you did it with me in the beginning. She will come to her senses and hopefully get out without major mental and financial damage.
>I now finally see how live can be with a loving and responsible partner.
Part of this conversation happened in a dream.
I never had the chance for closure because I was always afraid he could do something and harm me legally/Financially. So until the divorce was final and I got the money from our apartment I played it friendly and civil. I intended to have this conversation when this was all done but we went NC before that because he tried to fight my new partner(now husband).
I do not see sense in telling him this now.
But I might wanna keep it, just in case he shows up again on my doorstep when his new GF dumps him.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 07:43:49 UTC,6,2,0.8,,,0,0
1j6br64,I'm just bad,"Nothing in my life has ever been hard. I grew up middle class in a developed country, I am just weak.
I never learned how to make friends, and now I have run out of people who feel sorry for me. I've been in one romantic relationship. When we broke up they said ""I wanted to love you but can't"" and I get that.
I have a job, technically a good job. But I can't afford to survive. I have 6 roommates and I don't have the skills to talk to any of them. I hide in my room and wait til no one's around before I use the bathroom or the kitchen and if anyone sees me I beat the shit out of myself. I know it's not fair for othet people to have to deal with me like this. It is abusive, and I don't want to live if being alive hurts people m
I'm on 3 different psych meds and waiting for an MRI to confirm whether I have MS or just migraines or am just a huge bitch. I can't afford these and I don't deserve them.
I used to take care of myself through long distance cycling but now I have trouble walking and I can't stay awake longer than maybe 8 or 9 hours at a time.
I'm going to ask my doctor to apply for Medical Assistance in Dying. I know what they will say; that I'm too young, that my condition isn't that bad, that I need to try more medications.
No medication is going to give me the skills I need to be a person. No pill can make me good.
I see the way the world is going and I don't want to be part of any of it. We are all stretched so thin and I don't want my pathetic ass to be nail in the coffin for the welfare state.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 07:11:37 UTC,3,3,1.0,,,0,0

1j6bfcq,Why I don't post pictures to social media and avoid socializing with others. Because of the fear they'll get my age wrong and trigger my OCD and Body Dysmorphia,"I am a 26 year old guy born in 1998. I'm going to sound crazy in this whole rant.
When I was 18 in 2016/2017, I became curious how others were perceiving me. I thought I looked young and still had the teenage look. As someone born in 1998, it wasn't my turn to be 20+ yet, I was still a teenager. Growing up, people born in the early 90's and mid 90's seemed to look more mature than me and I thought it was obvious that I was younger.
I began posting pictures of myself to Yahoo Answers and Facebook ""guess my age challenges"" and asked people to guess. **Every picture I posted, there was at least one person or a few people who guessed correctly that I was 18. That gave me validation** Yet I also heard 23, 24, 25 etc and that felt super weird at the time. I felt weirded out and uncomfortable because I just didn't understand how/why I was being perceived as much older if there were people who were guessing my age correctly. I remember feeling upset even if I heard 20. I suffer from OCD too and numbers are very triggering for me. They were adding on years to my life and that just made me feel very restless and I felt absolutely disgusted. I was like **Omg i'm still a teenager and I'm being seen as old??Do I have an abnormal appearance, what's wrong with my development.** But at the same time there were many people online who guessed correctly that I was 18. I remember one picture someone told me I looked like a teen and that she thought I was 14/15 but another person thought I was 23. Another picture, 4 people thought I was 15-19 yet another person thought I was 24. One picture someone guessed correctly I was 18 but another person said ""early 20s unless you have brilliant skincare regime"". I also uploaded a picture of myself with glasses once and someone thought I was 17 or 18 yet another person said 20-25. I was like 25!!?? And that haunted me for several years. I constantly kept having intrusive thoughts about these extreme perceptions and suffered so much. I even had to see a doctor and psychiatrist and took medication to try and stop the intrusive thoughts. I made a vow in September 2017 to stop posting.
In real life, many people thought I was a teen in school and asked me what grade I was in but at the same time some people thought I was past university age and doing my masters. It just felt super weird. This kept happening to me throughout university. People asking me what grade I was in (being shocked that I was university) and a few people who thought I was past university age. I will never forget September 2019. A guy born in 1992 told me that I looked younger than 21 to him and still looked like a teen but the day after that, a lady thought that I was older than my then 29 year old sister (1990) and kept saying she looked really young like 22ish and I wasn't even 22 then like wtf.
As mentioned earlier, I suffer from OCD and constantly had intrusive thoughts that I was filthy and disgusting because years were being added onto my life and I wondered what I was going to look like when I was actually 23-25. These numbers were disgusting in my mind. I also developed Body Dysmorphia and hated my appearance. I didn't mind being perceived as young but wondered what was it about my face that made me look old to others??? How could I look young and old at the same time?
Then when I was actually 23/24, 2 people asked me what grade I was in and a few days before I turned 25 in 2023, someone asked me if my school was closed for summer break. But then in January 2024, someone asked me if I was 25 and I was like omg have i looked 25 for the past decade?? Am I living in some sort of time warp??
Now I'm 26 and many people ask me if I'm a student of a postsecondary institute (uber drivers, restaurant/cafe owners, people helping me in stores etc) That's a common perception many people have of me. But I have a sneaking suspicion that history is going to repeat itself in a new context and that a new trend will form that I've got to be 30, or 30+ when I'm technically not even in my late 20s yet. This is why I don't post pictures online and avoid socializing with people. Because I'm afraid history is going to repeat itself again and that I'll suffer again. I'd much rather be alone than be around people who have the potential to make me uncomfortable in my own skin. I wasn't uncomfortable withy appearance until I became aware that some people have extreme perceptions of me. I also get really angry like why are most people so stupid and unable to read my face???
Sometimes I just wish I could stay locked up in a tower like Rapunzel away from the whole world so that no one can ever see my face again. I'm also pretending to be Evil Queen now as a coping mechanism.

1j6a28f,I found out why the Mormons stopped coming to my house,"I live in a multi family apartment complex with my lover, who stays at home most of the day when I'm at work. At one point, our door was getting knocked on twice, sometimes three times a day, multiple times a week. I hold no hostility towards Mormons, but it is kind of annoying being interrupted while cooking or working at 8pm. It was often enough that I noticed when it no longer happened.
We are very obviously a gay couple, so I figured at some point or another they put that together and stopped coming. I was wrong. Turns out my lover, who is (lovingly and in their own words) ""built like a brick shithouse"", answered the door fresh-out-the-shower wet and in one of my silk robes at some point in the middle of the day, and they have avoided the building since. I still see them in the neighborhood but never on our floor.
my lover just confessed this during couple's game night and I just started crying laughing. It's been months. They never told me because they were sure they had stretched my robe out in the shoulders and didn't want to upset me. I personally think they look great in tight clothes but I can understand why seeing a big, burly ginger man in a barely closed, ill fitting silk robe could get us put on a religious shit list. Maybe it's just a coincidence (and what lucky guys, either way. They never wear anything like that when I'm home.) but regardless it's so silly.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 05:20:16 UTC,11481,229,0.97,,,0,0
1j69ulf,I finally made a move on my best friend and it went terribly,"We have been coworkers for almost 10 years and best friends for over 5 years. I'll keep it vague because she uses reddit regularly. Annie (fake name) and i are both in our 30s, both single, we talk constantly- we are either texting through the day or voice noting each other while we are driving. Everyone at work thinks we are a couple and are constantly asking if something is going on, unfortunately nothing ever has.
I've been in love with her since I first met her. She's just so beautiful and smart and funny, there's nothing I don't love about her. She's a great mom too and I've been partially filling a void in her sons life of a male role model.
Anyway on to the incident. We were out for dinner after work. I had asked her out knowing I was going to finally confess my feelings, but she didn't know that was my intention, we get dinner regularly enough.
While eating we were gossiping about work and about a new project we are starting. It'll be us two and a guy called Craig (m 50s). Craig has asked me out multiple times to the point its definitely an ongoing joke. He knows I'm interested in women only and we have a great working relationship. Annie makes a comment about us having some late nights working coming up and I better watch out for Craig's advances, I joke that I guess everyone just wants to kiss me, she says not everyone. OK not a great start. I say well speaking of kissing and she cuts me off and just says ""please dont"".
I just said ok. We both got fairly quiet. Finished our dinner with some small talk and work chat. Went our separate ways and haven't spoken since. It's been 2 days. I'm just so sad and lonely without her. I miss her son. I want to talk to her so much, but I know I can't keep this situation going on or I'll lose my sanity. I'm going to look for a new job. Maybe actually start dating women. In time I hope I can be a real friend to her. I feel bereaved.

But he is just genuinely so boring.
Having an in depth conversation with him is impossible. I don't know why. He doesn't have any opinions on anything or plans about life either other than wanting to move out. He just kind of exists
He has some hobbies, like soccer or watching movies, but he can't really have in depth conversations about those either. Even when he is telling me about them he just says that x and y happened. Our conversations are mostly just him telling me what he ate that day, how his day at work was like and what his parents said to him and he wants us to talk every day.
We do have hobbies together, like roller skating and eating out, but is this really enough to keep a friendship afloat? I sure don't feel like it is, now that I have a job and responsibilities. In depth conversations are so important to me and talking to him feels grating at times
I know that he tries his best, but he's just like this and I don't think that there's a clear solution",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 04:45:43 UTC,3,3,1.0,,,0,0

1j68ybh,My Solo Day Experience Pure Freedom & Joy!,"Yesterday, my parents went out to attend a family function, leaving me alone at home. The first time my dad left me alone at night, I felt a little scared. After all, for a girl, spending the night alone in a big house isn't always easy. But this time, it was completely differentI felt calm, confident, and absolutely at peace.
What surprised me the most was that my parents didn't call me even once to check whether I had eaten or done my work. Not because they forgot, but because they know I am responsible enough to handle everything. Being the eldest daughter of the house, I have always been expected to take care of things on my own.
With 200 in hand from my dad, I first treated myself to chhole bhature. Later, I managed to earn 1000 by sending some rice, so now I had even more freedom to enjoy!
For lunch, I had paneer curry with rice, and at night, I went full feast modepizza and pasta while watching Tenali Rama on TV. No one to disturb, no distractionsjust me, my food, and my favorite show! After that, I enjoyed gulab jamun and ended the night with a cold Thums Up, making the day feel even better.
The best part? This time, I didn't feel scared at all. Sleeping alone, which once felt a little uneasy, now felt completely normal.
What I realized was something even bigger. Every night, when my family is around, I feel lonely. But when they weren't there, I understood that I don't actually need anyone to feel complete. If someone doesn't want to be with me, I can still live happily on my own. As the eldest daughter, I have often been ignored because of my younger brother. But now, I've finally understoodthere is nothing wrong with being alone.
This morning, I woke up, spent some time soaking in the warm sunlight on the terrace, and now I'm making myself a cup of tea. After this, I'll do some housework, and before my parents return, I'll prepare a meal for them.
Honestly, this experience made me realize that being alone doesn't mean being lonely. It's peaceful, freeing, and fun! No unnecessary stress, no chaosjust me, my time, and pure happiness.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 04:14:10 UTC,5,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j68vbh,The Wrong Guy,"Hey all,
I feel silly to be in this spot making this post but I just needed to get this off my chest.
I (23 M) started talking to Walter (49 M fake name) a few months ago. He found me on an app based around a certain fandom, which name I'll be leaving off, where we ended up connecting.
I knew he was older, and I know better. But he's so charming. And I just feel so silly because I can see the red flags but fuck is he so easy to talk to and he makes me so happy.
Walter is not well, he told me he has BPD. He's had to do two stays in mental hospital in the times I've known him. Well, today, we were talking, everything was normal. And then randomly, he texted me that he took a bunch of pills and that he was sitting outside of a hospital and I just started panicking. I mean, what the hell.
I feel like I should state, I too am mentally ill. I just have started making improvements to my quality of life, and I thought Walter was as well. We've been bonding over growing as individuals. Trying to keep each other up. Y'know. So I was really worried to see this turn today.
He said he was on the phone with the hotline. I asked him if I needed to call for help. I pleaded with him. I sent him audio messages because he tells me how cute I am. I pleaded. And he just said how cute I was, and asked me to say please like that when we meet.
He kept telling me how much he's going to miss me and sending me virtual hugs and just complimenting me.
I know. I know better. I know what's going on. I don't know why I'm still letting myself fall for him. He's just so smooth. He makes me feel safe. I feel like he understands me. He listens to me. I just. Is there. And I don't have many people there for me. And I know that's not a reason but just. Here is where I am in life. I didn't think I would find myself in this position but I haven't heard from him in 2 hours. He said he thinks he likes me. He brought back up when he asked me out, but I turned him down then. He's just a weird little guy that I think I'm starting to like.
It feels good to say that. I can't really explain this to people my friends my age. My best friend knows about him, but not that I like him or flirt with him back. I just don't know if they'd understand. I know what's happening, and honestly I'm okay with it right now. I probably deserve this happening to me. Because I put someone else through this before. I've been the suicidal guy making someone plead for me. I am not proud of that guy I was. And I am making these changes to my life and trying so hard to be better. But maybe before I get better I should go through what I did someone first.
Maybe it won't be bad. Maybe I'm worried over nothing. But he is truly sweet. Maybe it doesn't always have to turn bad.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 04:09:22 UTC,2,0,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING: SUICIDE/SELF HARM,0,0
1j68tj9,My mom is abusing me and I'm tired of it,"I'm 14 years old and have told two of my friends briefly about this but I feel like I'll annoy them if I speak about it more. I just want to get this off my chest and put my experience somewhere in hopes it'll make me feel better. I'm also posting this here because I don't want anyone to try and intervene, it'll just make everything worse. Content warning for violence as well, but suicide is mentioned first so I used that flair, sorry.
My mom is an okay mom most of the time, but she's very quick to anger and has total freakouts over small things that always result in herself threatening to kill herself, or saying she's going to kill herself. I have a little brother who is 13, and my mom is 45 with a history of suicidal thoughts and one attempt before we were born, which she told us about.
Whenever we get into huge fights, she usually takes my stuff and threatens to destroy/burn it (she never does), she never let's me talk and always screams over me, and then of course she threatens to kill herself and says it's because of me and my brother and she says we ruined her life. I can understand why she resents us to an extent, my brother and I are rape babies and we look like our dad. On the topic of him, he's an abusive rapist who was/is addicted to drugs, and who hasn't been in our lives since I was 3. He has gone off the radar for a few years and nobody knows where he is. My mom keeps threatening to send us back to him and has shown us her text in him multiple times telling him she's done with us and that he needs to come get us. He never has, obviously. The last few times we've gotten in fights I never even yelled once and just keep talking calmly because I heard that helps calm angry people down, it doesn't work she just keeps yelling, and there's even been a few times when I do raise my voice that she literally covers her ears and says ""lalalala"" like a toddler until I stop talking.
After she threatens this, she usually leaves the house and says she's never coming back and says we can live with our grandmother. She says either that she's gonna drive off a cliff, into a brick wall, etc etc, or that she'll just straight up abandon us and start a new life somewhere. Then she'll come back some time later and act like nothing happened, very rarely she'll apologize but if I ever try and bring up what she's done again when she's calm, she'll just get enraged again. I've tried talking to her about it through text only once when she was out of the house, sending her a lengthy few paragraphs about my concerns, but she responded back basically just shaming me, and when she came home she was angry and she said she showed the text to all of her friends, which are mostly my friends parents, and she said they don't like me anymore and I won't be able to hang out with any of my friends anymore. I started avoiding all of my friends and eventually began online school because of this, and now my mom claims all my friends and their parents miss me and they don't understand why I don't talk to them anymore. I don't know what to believe anymore.
When she isn't in these weird freak out modes she's an okay mom but she snaps at random stuff before flipping like a switch and being happy again. Just yesterday she was yelling and slamming around her computer because she couldn't upload her photos to Facebook, she's a photographer. A few people had just been over to fix our dryer about an hour earlier, which has been broken for months, so mid yelling at her computer she just got up and went to go text out the new dryer and then when it worked she was all smiles and apologized for yelling.
She also frequently tells me and my brother that we're the only thing keeping her alive and that she would probably kill herself without us, and she's told us multiple times that she doesn't own a gun because she's afraid that when we grow up and move out she'll kill herself because she has no one to rely on anymore. This scares me and I want to move away for college when I'm grown, I planned on leaving this household as soon as possible, but I don't really want to anymore because she keeps saying things like that. She says stuff like that and says she loves me and my brother, but then says the exact opposite when she gets really angry and says she wants to die because of us and she blames everything she's mad at on us ""stressing her out"". She's also gotten physical with me and my brother multiple times, like digging her nails into the back of my neck and holding my face into a pillow because I wouldn't give her my phone because she said she was gonna break it, chokeholding me and dragging me out of me room before locking me out of my room and tearing it apart because I hid my art tablet from her, and more. She's done stuff with my brother too and I'm ashamed to admit this but I don't know what because whenever she's mad at him I just hide in my room so I won't get punished for helping him. He does the same when she does that stuff with me. I only know she hurts him because I can hear it.
I don't want to call the police, I'm scared and I don't want to live with my grandma or in a foster home or anywhere else and I don't want to be separated from my brother and pets. She actually encourages me to call the police on her and says she'd rather go to jail than live with us. I just want to explain to her how her her actions hurt me and my brother and I want to get her to stop. There's been periods of times where everything has been fine for a while and my family is just a normal happy family and I cry sometimes thinking about how that's what my family could be like if my mom wasn't the way she was. I know I'm doing it to myself at this point by not calling the police but I'm just scared and keep hoping things will change.
Right now is one of those times where everything's fine, my mom is currently talking to my brother, offering to clean off the couch and sit and braid his hair while they watch the movie together. We're all acting like nothing's wrong. I just wish my family could be this way all the time.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 04:06:28 UTC,0,13,0.5,,CONTENT WARNING: SUICIDE/SELF HARM,0,0
1j68o9l,Feeling like dogshit,".
.
.
Next week marks a year since I was admitted to the psych ward for overdosing.
I tried texting the hotline but impulse took on faster than they could respond, unfortunately.
My partner doesn't love me like they used to and I don't blame them.
I put them through the horror of watching their significant other's life slip and be forced to carry the burden.
Despite the ordeal, told me they don't want to hear me suggest breaking up anymore.
They don't want to hear me suggest that they feel obligated to stick with me.
I don't tell them my feelings or worries anymore.
I try to just smile and be happy, keep everything behind closed doors again.
At this point, we're roommates that share a bed.
Wouldn't it be better if we split and stayed friends?
It saves everyone the headache.
I want to articulate my thoughts but they're caught in my throat, my fear.
I've been more open to some choice friends about my suicidality, that this is a frequent occurrence.
They want me to share my thoughts and know that they're with me but how can I?
How can I put another person through the burden that is my heart when I don't value it myself?
I grew up being told I look like every other person. That I am not unique.
I am never enough since another person can do it better, faster.
Everyone will mourn but it will come to pass, they can find a replacement.
And with hope, I'll be forgotten.
Sorry if this is messy.
I don't feel like I'm fully present right now because when worse comes to worse, I'll wake up and bottle this all up again.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 03:58:13 UTC,1,0,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING: SUICIDE/SELF HARM,0,0
1j68jjz,Just another confused and lost person.,"I usually don't post about this kinda stuff online or really talk about it out loud with anyone, to be honest; It's often just a page on a random notebook where I braindump anything and everything that crosses my mind at the moment when I feel like it's too much to handle.
Today is different. I decided to expose it exactly because I never did. Been trying different stuff to see if something changes, in hope that any change could chain more and eventually things get better.
I've always felt sort of an inadequacy around life, if that makes sense; A feeling that I never really belong anywhere or am passionate about anything. I'm currently 30 years old and so far I've been navigating passively. I wonder if there is such a thing as not really fit to being alive. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a cry for help and I'm not planning on hurting myself in any way; Also, I'm not trying to throw a pity party, I'm coming from a place of trying to figure this out logically.
Like I said, I'm currently 30. Turned 30 this year. I still live with my parents, am unemployed but am currently studying computer science at an university. Never really been into a relationship, but I do have some good friends and a loving familt, for the most part. Still, there is something wrong with me. I look around sometimes and hear shared experiences from other people about romantic adventures or success on their jobs and I feel like I want that. It's not jealousy, mind you, it's more of a self questioning as to where have I been if not doing all that stuff?
My current situation is my fault, and I understand it's not good and even then, I don't have the strength or willpower or whatever you may call it to change it. It's like part of me wants to experience the world and... I guess a good way to explain it is, I want to want to do stuff, but I don't know what or how to start.
Starting things is another problem of mine. I know what needs to be done and even so starting things is so difficult that it's insane. Normally that could be ruled out as being lazy or procastination but frankly, I've putting things off for 30 years, the problem has to be something else right? Currently, I know that I should be sitting down to work on programming projects to create portfolios and help me get employes but doing so is... hard. Not as in, programming is hard, it's not that. I'm also not scared of making mistakes, I embrace them as an opportunity of learning. It's a mix of not knowing where or how to start and perhaps a disbelief that it is going somewhere? I even thought at some point this might be related to me playing too much games or watching too many shows but even if I cut all that off, I still won't do what I need. I'll spend time laying in bed, overthinking, planning too much for stuff I never have the guts to get done.
I guess you could call me a leech, but I don't feel like it's the case. I don't take pride nor plan on taking advantage of my dad's kindness forever, but I just feel... lost? It's always been hard for me to set goals to achieve because I feel like I don't really have anything. I can feel content with so little and that's maybe the reason why I never try and get more. I don't consider myself ambitious: Having fancy stuff or being famous or helping people... None of that stuff really pushes me forward. And those are the common stuff that people want so how can I move forward without a good reason to?
There are things I'm interested in, yeah. Like learning languages. But also some stuff I'd love to try and have no money for right now like woodworking maybe, music and theater.
I still feel like a kid, frozen in time watching it go by and desperately trying to grow up but failing miserably. And although I umderstand there is no point in thinking too hard about my past mistakes that led here, I'm scared that I'm forever trapped in this loop of not being able to move on. I want to escape, but am not sure what I should do. Therapy would help I feel but I'll only be able to afford it when I manage to get a job. I'm hoping I'll manage to get my first internship this year and maybe talking to someone would help me figure things out. Sure, I have friends, but I don't feel like I have a safe space to be vulnerable with them or anyone else in my family.
I always thought, back then, that I would have this figured out by now. Sometimes I think all it's needed is a small change that gets other things in motion, so lately I've been trying to do that. Doing things differently, trying to experimenting new stuff. I recently created a routine to try and force myself to do stuff; It hasn't helped much so far because even if I write things down I end up forgetting to look at the list or just can't bring myself to do it but on good days, I actually get a small amount of stuff done.
I'm the kind of person who tries to understand and look for a purpose on everything and this here is kind pointless. This post went nowhere and is not going anywhere. Kinda like my life so far. It's funny to think that. But that's why I decided to do it. I'm not sure things will work out and despite hearing positive encouragement from my friends, still can't see much of a future for me but I'll keep doing what I can and trying my best, even if it's not the most optimal for a normal human being.
If you actually managed to read this far, my apologies for this mess. I wrote as the thougts came, no organization or anything.
I hope someday I understand myself and determine my purpose.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 03:50:28 UTC,3,0,0.72,,,0,0

1j682gi,I like love but dont want to love,"To be honest, I just wanted to write down how I been feeling since I broke up with my ex more than a year ago. I (18F) like and enjoy loving people, and I love loving things, have you heard ""Under Pressure"" by david bowie and queen? basically it represents my vision of love. And honestly i really hate how people now forget that love its the thing that moves the world, love for power, money, for people, etc. So i honestly really want to love someone and feel a unique connection even if it last just a week, i want to feel something real sometimes. But then I think about life, specifically in my country where I can only focus on having a decent career a d get money to pay the future bills.
I really like being single as I have to give explanations to no one when i go out or stuff like that, but sometimes feeling someone's body close to yours (not in a sexual way) its all you need.
Sorry if it makes no sense, english aint my first language downcast_face_with_sweat, and this is mostly a venting post. Im not sad nor want comfort as i dont think I need it yet i just wanted to express it.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 03:23:44 UTC,2,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j67ypz,I hate my husband,"Well i dont hate HATE him. I still respect my husband. He provides a lot, roof over me and our son's head, food on the table, water to drink.. yeah what am I complaining for right? I should always be grateful that im in this position, which i am. It's just there are things that still bothers me, that ruins my mood, sucking the soul out of me little by little, draining my life day by day, inch by inch. Idk if im just a whiny wife, but here are some things that messes w my head everyday:
1) He NEVER puts his coffee mugs in the sink after he used them, there's always hundreds of them outside where he smokes (i told him a million times to put it in the sink after he finish using it, i dont mind washing it, JUST PUT IT IN THE FUCKING SINK) but noopee, still compiling outside the house. Til this day, i let it be, there are still 4-5 mugs outside the house, not gonna touch it ever unless he brings it in. This is so sad for me, cus he knows i got a bad eczema on my hands, so everytime i wash BUTTLOADS of dishes, i have to wear gloves, wash the gloves, dry the gloves, also wash my hands bc rubber gloves makes me itchy a bit etcetc my main point is its hell and back on earth for me to do dishes, and he's not considerate of that. We once had a big fight bc when we're at our inlaws (his fam) he fucking WASHED HIS MUG??? Huh? Since when the fuck do u do that? So you care what your family says about you instead of caring about your eczema hands wife? Yea fuck you.
2) he rarely takes care of our son. I literally do everything. He only takes care of him if i told him to. Sometimes when i shower, i have to actually ask him 'can you watch him for a bit' he has this ugly smug face and said 'k' like um wtf? You're supposed to b excited?? He's your son??? You will b rarely seeing him cus you work offshore???? Get this, infront of his family, he acts so fatherly, playing with him, taking care of his diapers etc while me, if we're actually home, IM DOING ALL THE FUCKING STUFF, not him. He literally does shit IF i tell him to. He's never considerate of how tired i am 24/7. 90% of the time if I dont wanna see his smug face if i have to shower and no one is watching our son, i had to put our son in his crib and let him watch ms rachel on ipad, eventho it hurts me doing that cus im limiting his screen time. And what was my husband doing that time? PLAYING LEAGUE OF LEGENDS, and he'll be like 'sorry im in game, i cant quit' well fuck you. And also get this, when i found out that im pregnant and i wanted to abort it (cus i know im not ready) he was the ONE who strongly insisted to keep it cus he said he cant wait to be a dad. Well step the fuck up bro
3) idk if im wrong or just exaggerating but he prioritizes his family over me and my son. If there was a fire, he would save his 4 brothers and 5 sisters instead of his wife and son. He would go to the ends of the earth for them ( once he had to deliver something car oil at 6AM for his sister n her husband, 6AM??? Mf usually wakes up at 2pm ffs.
4) he has this obsession w fixing up old cars he would spend loads of money on it and w literally his blood, sweat, tears and his time. Yo i don't mind mf got a hobby, i got a hobby too, that's great for him, but wht abt when i need to shower???? Do i have to go outside to ask you to watch over our son again with your ugly smug face again?? to sum up he has 2 obsession, league of legends and his car. None of which you can bother him at all. My hobby is just gym. JUST GYM. FOR 1 HOUR. At which i can ONLY work out when my son takes his afternoon nap! I just want him to evenly schedule his hobby.. not to the point he doesn't have time for his son or me. Do u think he listens? Nah. Everytime i told him this he'll be like 'this is the only time i can do this, while im working at sea i cant do this stuff' im like HELLO? cars and games are forever?? Your wife and son could leave you or die anytime? wtf is his mindset mahn istg he's still acts like a teenager. I literally feel like i have 2 sons as of this time.
5) his dirty clothes and socks. Need i say more? I feel like almost every wife experienced this.
6) he spills his coffee and chocolate milk every where in the kitchen but never wipes it. (I once saw the mf VACUUMS his family's kitchen bc there was a spilled rice grains). Basically he's really sloppy.
There are more but that's the top of my head. Idk what I should do. Everytime i tell him whats been bothering me, we always have a huge fight and it always ends with (ok i promise i wont do it again) but he still does and its and endless cycle. I cant leave him bc I literally have no money to raise my son alone (AND my mom is getting old, so i have to take care of her too). So til now im just tolerating everything but it drains my energy so much but at the same time i put on a happy smile on my face for my son, i dont ever want my son to see depressed or angry.
Mind you, he used to b very sweet and thoughtful at the beginning of our dating life and marriage life. I thought he was the most amazing guy. I know he loves me and my son, but i dont think he loves me enough to change his ugly habits.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 03:18:02 UTC,2,24,0.56,,,0,0
1j67xvx,I don't have anywhere to sit in my own room.,"Like the title says.
My family is getting ready to move back to my home state. I am staying in the city we are in currently. I do have a place lined up. I started moving furniture and books to my new place.
We had the carpets cleaned today. My brother broke his bed when moving it a few days ago. So, while I was at class today my grandparents gave him MY bed. They took my chair (had a small hole in the arm from my cat) out of my room and threw it in the dumpster we have rented while packing the house. Without asking me.
I pay rent, my car insurance, and help with the utility bills. Iave a job, I'm almost 19, and in college. My brother is 23, doesn't pay rent, can't hold down a job for more than 6 months, went to one semester of college and dropped out, racked up $15,000 of credit card debt ""fixing"" his truck which still isn't running, and has never lived outside my grandparent's home.
I am exhausted from working my ass off. We had a family emergency, so my one support system, my mom (who is also my best friend), had to fly back to my home state to help out my great uncle and cousin. I don't have anyone right now and I don't know how to cope.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 03:16:42 UTC,3,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j67wme,I'm terrified to go wedding dress shopping,"I'm marking this as positive because I'm so excited but also terrified. I'm on mobile so forgive any weird formatting.
I'm 23, almost 24. I'm getting married march of 2026. Im scared of change and getting married and moving out of my parents house terrifies me. Dress shopping makes it so real. On top of that I want the tradition of him not seeing the dress. Because I'm working on weight loss and in the middle of a masters degree I have limited time to do everything I need to do so I'm starting early. I remember our first date. We met online and the first time he seen me he took a step back in awe of me. I can't wait to see that on my wedding day. But that means I have to hide this dress from him for so long.

1j67rm0,I overheard my boyfriend's brother talking to his mistress about leaving his pregnant wife,"I've been in a bit of a rut and when I finally decided to leave the damn house I went to my boyfriends little family gathering his mom was hosting. I'll skip to the damn point.
I was having drinks with my boyfriend and we both overheard a conversation between his brother and some woman on the phone. His brother was in the bathroom and his wife was talking to other family. So being the nosy assholes we are we listened.
Turns out his brother has been having an AFFAIR on his PREGNANT WIFE. We heard the woman tell him that she wanted him to divorce his wife for her but to wait until after his wife gives birth which is in a few months. Apparently she 'doesn't want him to stress his wife out into a miscarriage'. And that she still wants him to be in the child's life and she's be an 'amazing step mother'. What's worse is he agreed though I don't know if he'd actually go through with it or not.
What. The. Fuck. Is. Wrong. With. People.
She said she had 'morals' on the call. BULLSHIT! If she had any damn morals she wouldn't be sleeping with a married man especially with a pregnant wife! My boyfriend and I don't know wether to tell his wife or not. We don't really want to risk stress her out but idk. We are stumped. We never thought he'd be that kind of sick bastard. It makes me feel sick just thinking about it.
What the hell are we supposed to do?
EDIT: Just to make things a bit more clear shes high risk from what I'm aware of. She's 6 months so far. I don't know much about pregnancy or how stress can affect the fetus but I know she wants that kid. She's been trying for years to get pregnant and had a miscarriage in the past.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 03:07:03 UTC,443,131,0.98,,,0,0
1j67lmd,Feeling Like I Don't Belong in My Own Culture,"Growing up in a small town in England, I always felt like an outsider, even in my own family. I loved them, but I never truly felt like I belonged. When I moved to New Zealand at 16, I hoped things would change, but I found it even harder to make friends and felt even more misunderstood. That sense of not fitting in just followed me.
Over time, I started wishing I had been born into a different culturenot because I think life would've been better, but because something just never clicked with my own. I've always found my culture awkward and uninteresting, but when I met my first South American friend, something felt right. The more people I connected with from Chile, Peru, Brazil, and Colombia, the more I felt at home.
I know South America is incredibly diverse, and I don't mean to generalize, but I can't ignore the feeling. Maybe belonging isn't about where you're born, but where you feel understood.",TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 02:58:09 UTC,0,2,0.5,,,0,0
