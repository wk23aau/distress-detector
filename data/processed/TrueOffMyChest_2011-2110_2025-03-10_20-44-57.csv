1j7qpw7,does my friend sleep around?,a friend of mine was married in october a little over a year ago. i was never around much to actually observe his behavior around his female friends. but after tonight idk.... we were having a beer and his friend called him over a girl and she had extended the invite to me as well. i had never met the person. my friends wife would stay at home knowing where he was. but i think she may be very dense. so after multiple suspicious activities ive noticed but had no visual proof of anything. i saw him and her kissing on the lips for fun and she was all over him.. she was also very intoxicated and explained some history they had involving a 3 way. shortly later i was ready to go. he told me to leave and wait for him outside in my car that he will be right down. i totally disagreed with that and saidwe came in together and we are leaving together. if not have a nice walk. so he ends up taking the lift. now. should i tell his wife? we are not friends and i do not think much of her... but the first couple of times i shrugged it off not my life or problem.... now its almost all the time and no longer think its appropriate even if you dislike the person or not.. should i tell his close friends? tell his inlaws? tell his wife? but i would much rather stay out of this cluster,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 04:36:04 UTC,1,1,0.6,,,0,0
1j7ql05,a sudden realization,i just had an awesome week. it was 2 of my friends birthdays and mine so lots of celebrating clubbing socialization good food. it was probably the most social i have been since covid. as i was driving home after eating with friends i realised i wasnt really happy. im not even sure i id say i was content. comfortable probably. ive come to the conclusion that i dont really want anything i dont desire anything i dont have anything driving me forward. its scary and kinda comforting but it is seeping into every aspect of my life to the point i dont know how i feel about anything around me. im mostly just venting get the feelings into the void so its been said somewhere but if theres someone else who also feels this way. hi. youre not alone.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 04:27:50 UTC,1,0,0.67,,,0,0
1j7qk8h,living in fear as a female,im officially 21 and in the state of florida im allowed to carry a firearm. im a female and was raised by a single dad. at the age of 10 i learned about rape via the news. by the age of 16 i was taught how to prevent being drugged how to keep my eye out when walking alone. by the age of 18 i was given a rape whistle and a necklace that turns into a sharp blade. i got home a few hours ago from the shooting range so i know how to use my gun incase worst case happens. as i was cleaning it i was think society is fucked that us females have to be on such high alert. on my 21st birthday i went out with 2 older cousins. this guy who was clearly 40 kept hitting on me i lost track of my cup and had to ask the bartender for a new one cause between those minutes of me looking he couldve put something in my drink.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 04:26:36 UTC,31,34,0.73,,,0,0
1j7qk1x,im scared for our childrens future,i was tasked with helping my cousin with his homework today. hes only 10 and you can tell when talking to him hes legitimately as smart if not smarter than most of the family. his mom recently passed away so his older sister has custody of him. the boy is having trouble reading words like droid giggled meant etc. nobody seems to take the time to teach him and hes literally getting packets and homework assignments that they barely work on in school. hes in an inner city school and i have another cousin attending there too. its so sad how poor these kids education really is. this boy can hold a good conversation about most things and can understand what you teach him when he stops beating himself up over stuff and takes the time. because of this experience along with the other cousin of mine who goes to the same school ive really lost faith in our education systems and the future of our people and country. at his age i and even the kids who didnt like reading could easily read chapter books. these kids are incapable of doing that. also common core math is frustratingly annoying. they intentionally make things more confusing instead of simplifying and compartmentalizing everything,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 04:26:16 UTC,3,6,0.61,,,0,0
1j7qf3k,i caught my boyfriend masturbating to other women.,i know this doesnt seem like a big deal but my heart hurts. this weekend i was using his phone to look up a restaurant and i saw in his search historybar that he looked up at least 2 specific womens only fans leaked. and he clicked on multiple websites just to find these womens leaked images. i also thought to look at his twitter after finding this out and saw he looked them up there too. between these 2 women he clicked on at least 10 different websites to find these womens leaked photos. the funniest part is that me and these women look nothing alike. these women are beautiful dark hair dark eyes. while im a redhead with blue eyes. our bodies are completely different as well. i just feel ugly. he was saying all men do it but i dont believe that. it just hurts that he sought these women out hard to find pictures of them to pleasure himself to when weve been in a committed relationship. i know this is a controversial thing among people but ive always thought why do you feel the need to pleasure yourself to other women when you have me? and finding out these women look nothing like me just makes me feel not good enough and it makes me feel so ugly. he knows ive battled with weight and eating disorders and i feel like this is making it worse and it is torturing me. the worst part to me is he sought so hard for pictures of them when he went across multiple social media platforms to find them and pleasure himself and knowing they dont look like me and knowing hes in a committed relationship. how can i believe when he calls me beautiful yet pleasures himself to women that look nothing like me. edit his needs are being met someone told me i should mention this as well but i can assure you his needs are met with how much we go at it! also he doesnt like me masturbating to other men! so i dont masturbate to other men but he is masturbating to other women even though i dont like it. so im also upset about that because i followed his wishes but he doesnt follow mine!,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 04:18:16 UTC,15,237,0.53,,,0,0
1j7q7h2,my brother is a huge fucking asshole,he acts all high and mighty huge ego. he thinks that just because he has a job he doesnt have to do anything around the house. he made our own fucking grandma pick up his mess in our room just because he didnt wanna do it. i helped her of course because im nice but holy shit he really made an old woman pick up his garbage and there was a lot. i tried telling him to do literally anything but the asshole he is he threatened to slap and best me up. this has happened multiple times and honestly should i just keep getting at him until he does hit me? id rather call the police than deal with this bullshit. the house and especially me would be better off without him.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 04:05:36 UTC,12,4,0.82,,content warning violencedeath,0,0
1j7q25e,setting boundaries no friends,i 25f have lately ive been on this journey of choosing myselfreally learning how to respect my own feelings and speak up. and ever since i started doing that ive noticed ive been losing people i once considered close friends. im realizing some folks didnt actually love methey just loved what i did for them or how quiet i was when they crossed lines. i once told a friend something made me uncomfortable and just asked her not to bring it up around me. she completely stopped talking to me after that. then a friend ive known for 12 years asked me to reschedule my own birthday plans so i could go to someone elses party instead. that honestly made me feel like an option not a friend. i know nobody owes me anything and i dont expect people to revolve their lives around me. but ive come to realize that some people only respect boundaries when they benefit from them. and now that im finally honoring mine its become a problem for them.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 03:57:33 UTC,11,3,0.81,,,0,0
1j7pz5c,i think i may be too traumatized to be lovable,as im typing this im thinking about a boy i met today who was so sweet and charming and thoughtful. but the entire time i was with him all i could think was hes going to be so disappointed if this goes any further. i am the survivor of sa and abuse from my first boyfriend. i was very young the relationship started when i was 15. it lasted two years and it affects me every day. on top of that i have faced things like stalking and grooming. i am 25 now. as a result trusting is very hard for me. i often feel like i never really had a chance at learning about myself my body and my place in my relationships that wasnt about being controlled or hurt. ive had very little experience since that first relationship. i am scared to date now as a single adult because i know myself. i dont feel safe being physical with partners unless im doing something for them. i dont know what to do when they want to do something for me and i panic. likewise im scared i will never be able to break out of my get small do whatever they want mindset that i kept myself in. i often compare myself to those shelter dogs with the signs that say abused rescue barks at men. i am in therapy and ive made amazing progress. i just dont know what to do to tackle this part. i cant decide if i should take a risk but be communicative or learn how to love myself in my solitude.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 03:52:46 UTC,1,0,0.6,,content warning sexual assault,0,0
1j7puxd,i dont want to be alive anymore,im not going to end my life but i have lost my will to live for the most part other than i guess my will to live long enough to see if this gets better. i left a not so great relationship three years ago and no one has touched me since. i read a novel two months ago featuring a lot of caretaking scenes between partners and while i hadnt been lonely before and felt proud of my independence ive been terribly lonely all of a sudden. youd think i have great friendships and maybe i do but i spend most of my time after work alone and im starting to dread weekends knowing ill mostly be on my own. id love to share my life with someone and thought i was regaining a lot of confidence but ive started to become vicious to myself. this is probably a distortion but i cant really imagine people missing me in a substantial way if i were gone. im not really foundational to anyones life as far as i know. i keep thinking people would feel sad someone young died and maybe question if they couldve done something but i cant imagine my loss feeling like a void to anyone. i dont know what happened the last month or two. i want my life to get better or to feel more at peace with the one ive been given but i cant stop thinking about death almost all the time now i keep bursting into tears at work when im out the second i get home. i feel like an alien like i forgot how to connect with and relate to other people.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 03:46:03 UTC,3,1,0.62,,,0,0

1j7pm91,i dont think my boyfriend will ever love me.,not putting ages but im a woman dating a man for that context. we both told each other prior to us even being official that we dont really know what it means to be in love but based on everything i have read i believe i am in love. we have been together for a short time but have known each other for a long time. i dont believe he will ever love me and theres an internal dichotomy of i am okay with unrequited love because we make a good partnership and he is sweet and considerate to me and what is wrong with me why am i not enough what if one day he realizes he can do better and leaves me. i worry a lot when were together lately that hes thinking of someone else a past love maybe someone hes still in love or obsessed with. i of course cannot ask him because it would kill me if the answer is yes he is thinking about someone else and wishes i was her instead. i already know that hes never really had feelings towards me which is leading to my skepticism so far. i can take him at face value now when he says he likes me but it didnt come easy and doesnt come without a voice in the back of my mind saying its not true. i found out tonight that basically im coming on too strong i guess with verbal affection i miss you things like that and i worry that turns him off from me. i worry that it makes him not want to be with me. i worry that it makes him think im desperate which he did essentially accuse me of a few weekends ago. but i worry that it pushes him away from me. he likes physical reassurances that i want to be with him physical affection and intimacy and i need the inverse to feel secure. and i can tell hes making an effort i think he can tell im making an effort. but i worry ive pushed things too far by being too verbally affectionate. im worried hes thinking of breaking up with me. this weekend i have been considering telling him i love him and its okay if he doesnt return the feeling but now i cant. i try very hard to be present and suppress my fears and insecurities when were together but im sure its noticeable at times still. there are women from his past i know he had a thing for and i feel so uncomfortable when he talks about them i dont know if hes noticed that and he doesnt do it often but it is very painful. i wonder if he wishes i was one of them instead of who i am. he has denied it but i do still think a huge reason hes with me is my body. i know hes been attracted to me physically all these years and so i worry that that is the main draw to me the main thing that makes him want to stick around. i worry another reason is because were getting older and we both feel like were missing life milestones and we could be each others solution for that. i am so insecure and scared and worried in this relationship but i have wanted it for over 10 years more than 10 years have i had a crush on him. so i am okay with the fact he will never love me. but i do need to cry about it sometimes.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 03:32:05 UTC,2,1,0.63,,,0,0
1j7pkns,i ended my relationship due to financial infidelity,i recently broke off a 5 year relationship one year engagement because of financial infidelity. im 30 years old 20k in cc debt 100k owed in loans 25k owed in student loans and i was too embarrassed to ever tell my partner the truth. covid struggling with mental health lifestyle creep all contributed to overspending not utilizing credit cards correctly and trying to be something im not in front of everyone in my life for the past 3 years. essentially and everyone in my circle thinks im well off when im actually a lying coward. the guilt and anxiety of the debt got so bad that i ended my long term relationship. my partner makes 45k and i make 3 times their salary so planning our wedding was nauseating as i knew there was no way we can afford it as my partner has been depending on me for financial support. little did they know we are so poor and im in so much debt that it would crush me to continue our relationship and go through with a wedding with this gigantic mess. they dont deserve it and they deserve better than me. im so embarrassed. but i realize that ending the relationship and working towards paying down debt aggressively was the only way i can move forward without feeling more like a piece of shit than i already do. right now they still dont know the truth and they are probably so confused hurt and angry right now because the relationship seemingly ended out of nowhere. but im only trying to protect them and i hate myself that i let this drag on for as long as it did. i only hope that the damage and hurt im saving them from will outweigh the damage and hurt ive already caused. for now im just relieved that the love of my life is now safe from me my lies and my debt. i love you and im sorry i wasnt able to be a better person for you. thank you for all these years.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 03:29:37 UTC,31,31,0.73,,,0,0
1j7pfwv,i need to talk about this. cheated on 4 times in one year,okay i dont even know where to start. our relationship has always been weird. we are definitely more open to talking about very tabo out there topics. but i wont be honest i lost trust a year ago. maybe i like to be hurt idk. i 23f have been with my partner 22f for over a year now. the first time this happened we here friends to the public but together in private. it she was in the bathroom at a club with another girl. she told me after i asked 3 times. and it also took me asking so many times what happened and is there anything else for her to finally admits it. then the second time was the exact same thing at the club but she was drinking that night and i saw it all happen. the third time i went away for to work in a different city for my job for two weeks and the girl she was seeing texted me the ss of there messages. it was so bad one of them said i could cheat on her and she wouldnt even know. when i confronted her she lied to my face. like she always does. and even went as far as saying that these are photoshopped. she denied and lied and always played the victim. saying she was forced and felt like she had too. and then blame me for things that made no sense what so ever. the third time was recent. she went out with new friends she met online. she told me there names it was all good she said she was going over to hang out and play games. she dont come back to her house until 530 am. 1 have her location. i knew in my gut something happened. when i told her it feels off like you cheated because you came back so late she brushed it off like it was nothing. ill break it down how this one went. i called her to talk about it she told me they kissed once and thats it. i was very upset. then we talked more about it that night. she told me they held hands that this girl listened to her and heard her. she had a tendency to completely blow up at me in arguments so l dont always tend to listen when shes yelling at me. then she said she wanted and open relationship with this girl has her gf and me in the side. i then saw her two days later. she told me in person they kissed max 3 time and she had her arm over her. i once again had to ask 10000 times to get this info. and i asked her 1000000 more times are you sure there is nothing else. i then asked her to get me food and water because i wasnt feeling good. i looked through her phone i know i shouldnt have but i did. i say the most disturbing texts of my life. they were very inappropriate with each other and have been texting like this for a week now. very lovey texts too all day and night. calling me her friend and saying shes with her friend aka me! telling her jokes was saying but as if it was coming from my partner to this girl. telling her shes skinny and pretty. l am a comfortable weight i like my size i also work out and enjoy building muscle and strength not slimming figure. i confronted her and he lied again. right after lying to my face and telling me there wasnt more. i lost it and read the entire texts with her sitting in the ground in my room. now shes all sweet with me. shes at my house watching my dog while i visit my dad i had already planned this trip and thats why she was at my house in the first place. i go back to my house tomorrow where she will be.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 03:22:24 UTC,0,10,0.36,,,0,0

1j7orsw,every time i read a a reddit story about nice guys and relationships i remember my high school experience and i feel guilty and embarrassed.,whenever i read through best of reddit or any of the various relationships subs i see guys who are basically the nice guy who only befriend women they want to date. it basically always sends my mind careening back to obsess about how or if i was a nice guy in high school. i pined for a girl all through high school. my graduating class was 465 kids but we were in all the honorsadvanced classes and did debateforensicsscholars bowlmock trial together as well. there was basically a group of about 2535 people who did all the honors stuff and we were basically a high school within the school. anyway if this now woman even bothers to remember me she probably views me as the quintessential nice guy and honestly i am so embarrassedguilty about it that my neruodivergernt mind cant ever let it fully go. like i said i made friends with this girl when we were sophomores our high school was 101112 and she already had a boyfriend. i really was not trying to be that guy but i think everyone in our class and i later found out several of our teachers knew i had feelings for her. i am certain she did. junior year she breaks up with her boyfriend and has a new one before i even knew. our senior year there was a really tragic situation and the person she was seeing passed away. now i am not such an ah as to immediately make a move or anything but by the spring i got the idea she basically wanted me to ask her out. so i did. however earlier in the year before the event that resulted in her being single i asked another girl from the group of ap students to prom. this girl had then written me a letter explaining that she hadnt expected to be asked at all and was flattered and would accept as long as i understood it was completely platonic. i said i understood and that was fine. now i dont know what other people would have done but it never crossed my mind to try and back out of taking the first girl i had asked. we had another friend who was kind of looking for a date and the two of the ended up going together. the monday after prom she dumped me for him. so we dated for like all of 3 weeks. i did some dumb stuff. i wrote a cringey please dont break up letter. i tried to be more outgoing with our friend group and it came across as weird and try hard. i asked out another girl who i thought was cute but had nothing in common with and got rejected and told to my face that i should just wait till college because any girl in our high school would know they were a rebound and that nobody would not be interested. now what really sucked was that we got to go to national tournaments for both mock trial and debateforensics together. so i had basically two school funded pseudo vacations with my ex and without her boyfriend and while i had a good time it was also really rough for my 18 year old self. it was just impossible to fit myself back into the just a friend box. i still had strong feelings she knew that and i hope i didnt make her miserable. while going to fetch her and the girls she was sharing a hotel room with at the forensics national tournament i heard her talking about me through the door saying that i was too intense and that was part of why she broke up with me. that has stuck with me my entire life my wife loves how intense i can be so things worked out. while at the mock trial national tournament one evening our coachchaperone pulled me aside and just asked how i was doing. as we talked i ended up breaking down and crying. thats also where i found out that yes the teachers all knew as well and yes they did have opinions on student relationships. anyway i look back now and clearly yes this stuff did affect me. it contributed to who i am today but at the same time it seems dumb because we only dated for less than a month. but for me there was also friendship with her knowing she had me as a backupfallback if she ever wanted. that probably seems really incelmisogynistic but i willingly put myself there and she couldnt possibly have been unaware. it was clearly super unhealthy for me unfair to her and that is why i look back and feel guilty and embarrassed. the fact i am now 41 and can still remember and write about all of this shows that it for sure impacted me but like i said when i think back on it i pretty much figure she must think i amwas the sort of nice guy who befriends women exclusively to try and date them. i feel a fair amount of guilt over this not the least of which is in part because i have been married for 15 years to the most beautiful amazing woman i could imagine. yet any time i read a story on reddit with a guy complaining about who women they know date or women talking about why do guys act like this i am basically catapult to thinking about how immature i was.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 02:45:54 UTC,1,2,0.54,,,0,0

1j7onmz,nsfw friend told me he is cheating due to appearance of his fiances genitalia.,so the other day a close male friend of mine told me he is sending his fiance on an expensive solo paid vacation. i inquired why he wasnt going with her and he informed me in so many words because he has needs and that he has his own hotel booked with the sole intention of cheatingunfaithfulness. why? because apparently her genitalia is offensive and disgusting to him and he cant perform oral sex on her. he told me he must perform oral sex to be fulfilled in life and he just has to. i asked him why he wasnt just being honest with her and he said it was because it would crush her. i said if oral sex is that important to you then you guys need to break up. he refused to break up saying he loved her and they had built a life together and then he wouldnt have anyone to help him with his special needs daughter. and he is adamant he will not get caught unless i say something to his fiance. i inquired about lights out blindfolds etc. he absolutely refused and says her stuff is beyond disgusting. let me be clear. he is not a prize in any way. without him paying for the privilege i dont see any random woman near him just randomly accepting oral sex from him. so im not sure if this will happen. but its definitely put me in a weird situation because i am friends with both of them. i dont want to get involved but i feel this is really awful for him to do. its changed how i look at him completely. i never would have thought him capable of something like this. just needed to get this out of my brain. i feel so bad for her. edit wow. i did not expect this to blow up like that. i will try to clarify some of the questions ive received. 1 yes i also wish this was fake. it isnt. 2 they are not married. they are engaged. the special needs child is not theirs. the biological mother of the child lives in another state. 3 for those asking why im friends with someone why does anyone have friends? nobody is perfect and everyone makes mistakes. but ive been friends with him for a decade. longer than ive known his fiance who i met through him. hes been a really wonderful friend. and hes never mentioned or thought or indicated any kind of behavior like this to me until this just happened yesterday and i was completely shocked and struggling to process it. that is why i said what i said in the original post. my vision of him has shattered. i am not sure yet how i am going to proceed. 4 those asking for information about her genitalia i really do not have the answers you are seeking. i asked about smell or scent or taste and he was adamant it was strictly because of appearance. the only description i got which left me very confused was that it looks like a pokemon. he also did mention that she has a disorder i forgot the name of where the hair follicles of your pubic hair turns slightly ulcerous and the hair follicles become infected. he said this also disgusts him because apparently its open wounds. i asked all the questions you guys are asking. why isnt she on medication or treatment for the condition. labiaplasty. etc. the short and unfortunate answer is lack of funds and lack of health insurance for both parties. we live in a very poor area of a very red state. and yes i told him he should have paid for her healthcare instead of a vacation. 5 i am certain he is not gay. 6 for those of you that have reached out privately to confirm if i am someone you know and if this story is about your partner i want to say how sorry i am and how sad i am that this is happening to other people. i cant even imagine.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 02:39:55 UTC,3916,399,0.96,,,0,0

1j7nu40,about to give up on everything ..,i 14 female am a straighta student i do art i play music i have my youtube channel i can cook and i can do most of the house chores. after doing all these things no one seems to believe in my abilities. this morning i had my phone in timelapse and i was recording myself studying as motivation but my father came into my room took my mobile and scolded me saying i wasnt studying. when i tried to show him the timelapse of me studying he said he didnt want to look at it and that i should go and study. this isnt even the first time this has happened but today i just cried for 20 minutes nonstop. i dont know why it hurt so much worse today but it did. when i make art my family always finds a flaw in it. when i cook there always has to be something wrong. when i tell my parents my future plans they shrug it off and say you need to work for that dream just saying it wont get you there but i am working towards it i work towards it day and night. when i get good grades its never enough i have cried on every one of my exam results days. if no one believes and sees my efforts it is the same as not putting any effort. i have worked hard day and night for my future but no one sees it. so i have decided to not try anymore to not push myself.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 01:57:16 UTC,1,5,0.56,,,0,0
1j7nn6g,i hate love...,i dont feel any hatred towards anyone but when i see couples in public on tv books. i also hate love songs. once again i dont hate the people themselves or anything if anything its cute its just i want that too... i think i could be lovable to someone but i never really have been apart from that one 18 year old i edated when i was 14 if that counts. heh ive never kissed anyone held hands or cuddled with anyone and thats what i want. with some one i love deeply and they love me back. theres also the fact that dating is much more difficult to me since i can only ever really be interested in someone if were close friends first plus i have different veiws towards sex essentially im only interested in it with someone im iove with and i have no feelings towards any other people because thats all i need. i want someone to feel the same way as me and that feels almost impossible.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 01:47:32 UTC,1,2,0.57,,,0,0
1j7njo7,went to antisocial to supersocial in a month,its funny how things change right? i went from being a person that avoided all types of human connections and didnt know how to be myself and feel great interacting at that time to now being someone who does not fear who she is most of the time at least way better than never ever and loves to chat with people and makes friends easily. it has became now a part of my day talking and connecting with people it doesnt matter who it just needs to be someone whos willing to share and talk it can be bad now if i dont get any sort of talk in the day and i think i put too much expectation in these connections since i start to lose interest on the person when i think we dont have anything else to talk about even if the person is nice makes me feel sad not knowing how to continue things up. funny how things can give a 360 in just a second ha antisocial to very social in a month unbelievable. or i just started being myself again after a while finally,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 01:42:37 UTC,3,4,0.72,,positive,0,0
1j7ngez,i m23 just kinda feel sad about relationships and i think im starting to see romantic relationships with women as interchangeable and i dont want to be like that,dating is miserable and it feels like every person im with seemingly has no clue of what they want and my actions have almost zero impact long term on the success of the relationship because every woman i date ends up falling into a spiral of self sabotage or the ones that are already emotionally independent arent interested. i feel like at this point my desire for a relationship has evolved to the stage where any woman insofar as shes around my age and not a bad a person is alright enough for me. as long as she loves me ill be whatever man i need to be and shes can be whatever kind of woman she is. obviously this is toxic and nonsense but i cannot for the life of me shake my perception of things. the minimum bar for me is extremely low and im not even in a bad position. average looking a regular irl social group good career ambitions and in school for them etc. but in every situation all i can think of is the long term position i need to be in and how much time im wasting not doing and saying whatever i can to most efficiently get to that position a long term irl relationship.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 01:37:45 UTC,0,1,0.5,,,0,0

1j7n8o7,im done with being religious,hey everyone. first time posting on reddit thanks to the click for giving me enough confidence to post. i was baptized had my first holy communion and i am an altar server in the catholic church. now that im old enough i have started confirmation classes. however i am not happy with this. i am an altpunk kid that identifies as trans bi and greyasexual. with my bright blue and red halfandhalf dyed hair and odd fashion sense i stick out like a sore thumb. i feel like i was forced into this just to make my mom and grandmother happy. i have expressed my discomfort in catholic beliefs for over a year now but it feels like nobody is listening to me. i dont feel anything when i attempt to pray. it feels like god isnt listening. i dont feel loved and i dont feel light from him. ive walked out of confirmation class crying more times than i can count. i feel out of place and uncomfortable at church events and retreats. i dont feel a connection to anything that is said at masses. today was the final straw. there was confession instead of class. my mom and i were sitting together listening to the process for confession and we were given a few questions as food for thought. i really didnt like the questions especially the ones about my relationship with god. i started crying again as i hated the fact that i just didnt see it the way others did. i managed to go up and get my confession over with but after i still felt nothing. my mom sighed handed me some tissues and we stepped out and talked for a bit. instead the discussion being consoling it just felt like she was making up excuses to get me to stay in catholicism. i told her that i felt nothing connection and that this is making me unhappy. we ended up leaving. she didnt speak to me about it on the car ride home. she only talked about other random things to try to lighten the tension i didnt want to hear it. it feels like shes ignoring me. i dont know what to do. sorry for the long ramble but i just needed to let this out. any advice or kind words are appreciated. note i am not targeting anyone who is religious. religion can be great and can bring people together. if you have found comfort in religion stick with that comfort.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 01:26:32 UTC,6,3,0.76,,,0,0

1j7mx83,witnessed a personal tragedy today. i feel really bad for her.,her husband died today. she had been faithfully taking care of him for a while now. his body was lying in the middle of their small stuffy overheated living room. she had been doing cpr on him following the 911 operators instructions. hed been sick for a long time. agent orange lung cancer from his time in vietnam. even so she was not prepared for his passing in any way. shes one of those women that is unable to function on her own. she always depended on her husband to tell her what to do. while we were waiting on the coroner to arrive several of us were in the crowded living room trying to comfort the new widow. the conversation drifted through various death and healthrelated subjects all of it floating past the dead person on the floor like he wasnt even there and he really wasnt. there was no sense of a person under that white sheet. their two small dogs both gave off a sense of a soul that awareness of being just like the living people in the room did. that personshaped lump under the sheet could have been rolled up bedclothes for all the awareness it gave off. he his soul his essence the thing that made him him was no longer there. it really brought home to me that the physical body is not really the person. its just what people see. its the soul the part of a person you cant see that makes you you. a family friend came to take her and her two little dogs to his house. shes lost grieving and woefully unprepared now adrift without her longtime safe harbor. shes in her late 70s. i doubt if shell live there in that house alone. shell probably sell the place. i wonder if she will forever see her husband lying on that tiny living room floor first as she was desperately doing cpr on him and then as the emts draped that white sheet over him covering his face. hes gone now everyone told her. hes not suffering anymore. and he did suffer for years always struggling to get enough air into his lungs even while breathing pure oxygen. so its her and the two little dogs now. her family friend will have to emotionally carry her through the next days and weeks of the funeral social security va death certificates all the financial insurance and vehicle paperwork they failed to set up ahead of time in order to avoid just such a situation as this. i guess it can be understood that one or both of them just couldnt bear to think about the end for him even though it was staring them squarely in the face. it is an awfully hard thing to think about and accept. she did all she could to care for him knowing how it would eventually end while desperately denying it. now shes broken. i dont think with her dependent personality that she will ever fully recover. i truly hope though moving forward that she invests as much care and loving into herself as she did her husband. she has severely neglected herself her health appearance everything in favor of caring for him. i hope she realizes its her turn now to care for and love herself. life goes on. that fact may be the hardest part of any of this for her.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 01:10:18 UTC,593,31,0.97,,,0,0

1j7m4go,he didnt stop when i was shaking,the content warning is because im not sure if it is that but if it is i dont want to trigger anyone. for context theres a guy 20m i 18f have been talking to and hooking up with for a little while now. we met up friday night and had discussed going a bit rougher and what that entailed and i was really looking forward to it. he also brought some drinks for us. we were drinking a bit and went for one round then drank some more. i was sipping mine over the night and hadnt noticed until later but he had around three beers. the second time we went he was struggling to get it up because of the alcohol and i gave him head to help. he slapped my face while i was which we had talked about but i was hesitant so i wasnt expecting it i could feel it through my entire skull but didnt stop or say anything. the whole time before this he was gentle when i gave him head because of my gag reflex but he started pushing it a bit not too much though and i could pull away. i think he was getting frustrated that he couldnt get off at this point and flipped me onto by back i was on a bed he was standing next to. he said he was going to finish on my face. i didnt say anything but the idea of that is so disgusting and i was fearful i guess. he would switch between jerking off and using my mouth forcefully at this point and my whole body was kind of heaving when i gagged. i was shaking a bit even my jaw was trembling. at one point my jaw trembled a bit more obviously and he laughed a bit i think at that. i dont think he could tell that i was uncomfortable and right after this he leaned over my face to try to finish on my chest instead. i was still shaking and at this point crying a bit my eyes were already a bit wet from gagging. he couldnt see me crying though. all i could think was that i felt horrible and i wanted to go home. he eventually gave up but noticed at that point that something was up. i wasnt looking at him or saying anything and he asked if he pushed too far. i still wasnt saying anything and i was crying. he hugged me and i cried a bit heavily but quietly not sure if he noticed. he told me that if i wasnt comfortable i need to tell him to stop right away. we showered after and i was still shaken. we went to bed right after and the next morning we had fun like usual. hes a good guy and prioritizes me getting off and things like that. i dont blame him for what happened or didnt until i asked a guy friend if he would stop if someone was shaking and he said yes like its obvious. im wondering if maybe the alcohol could have caused him to not notice or what? and i understand that even if you consent but dont really want it it still feels horrible and thats why even two days after i feel sick to my stomach thinking about it. i just dont know how to stop thinking about it. edit thank you everyone for commenting! i will definitely be talking with him more indepth about boundaries safewords and physical stops too. a few other things he is not my boyfriend this is a strictly fwb situation and neither of us want a relationship. i dont think what happened was assault i just felt horrible during it but i understand that hes not at fault. the reason i made this post was i was trying to classify what happened to try to feel better and understand it was a miscommunication for sure and i feel a lot better about it.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 00:30:16 UTC,0,27,0.5,,,0,0

1j7l8u4,one choice can blow up your life.,i 27f got engaged 6 months ago to my now ex fiancé lets call him ross 30m. however that month was hell with my grandma who i was extremely close to dying. i wasnt dealing with it i was just ignoring the pain and saying i was fine. well about 3 weeks after we got engaged and my grandma dying i had drinks with a friend 27f. what started off as just a drink or two quickly turned to shots and not remembering even leaving the lounge. now most of this is from what i have been told by the friend her husband and my ex fiancé. friends husband lets call him craig had to come and pick us up and took us back to their place. my fiancé had his son and we lived about a hour away from the friends and where we got drinks so he was not able to come get me. the friend and i apparently crashed in their bed with craig having to wake me up when ross called. now this is where stories have changed. at first ross and i were told that my friend and craig started doing stuff in the same bed i was in and i woke up and joined in. whereas recently they have started to say i started everything. the only memory that i have during any of this is thinking what the fuck am i doing and i then proceeded to run out of the room. according to my ex fiancé i then called him and was trying to seduce him over the phone. this is when i apparently told him what happened and he said i sounded excited. my next memory is being on the phone with him and him yelling at me that i had called him just to tell him i cheated on him. we apparently talked a little longer and then hung up. and that night is the night my life fell apart. since that night we have tried to make it work but as you can tell he is now my ex fiancé. he continues to holds resentment towards me and the friends on what happened. i would also like to say that they are no longer friends either after that and the friend texting me telling me that she was the martyr in my relationship. well now that everything has ended and stuff has come to light i am struggling. craig was sober through the whole night and the friend while originally saying she didnt remember anything is now saying that she remembers all of it. i am the only one that doesnt remember leaving the lounge or anything at their house besides that one thought and the one line from the phone call. i am feeling very used and taken advantage of because sober or even buzzed i would have never hooked up with anyone but my fiancé. together we have experimented but it was together. i am so unsure of how to feel about that night. now i am not looking for advice sympathy or really anything i just thought it might help if i write this all down. and maybe someone can learn from my story that just because you think you can trust people to protect you that may not be the case and one night can take the life your building away. if there are questions ill do my best to answer them in the comments. thanks for reading.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 23:47:34 UTC,4,2,0.63,,,0,0
1j7ks9r,i knowingly manipulate my friends and feel ashamed.,i dont really know how to start this or end it or what im really trying to say so please excuse any ramblingunnecessary information. im a 22 year old female who had little to no experience having friends throughout high school. in elementary school i had a fairly large circle of friends but around the time puberty hit and i became more self aware i realized that my peers found me weird. i was pretty much exclusively friends with guys and i was basically a full head taller than anyone around me including my male friends. i was pretty bad at actually holding a conversation i still am and my interests strayed from even my small group of friends. middle school came and that was fine i still had my group of friends. but in classes where i wasnt sitting with them or we had differing lunch periods i was basically silent. i was too nervous to make any attempt to talk to those around me or try out social skills. high school was terrible. at first i had the same lunch period as my friends but then my table slowly filled with other people until my seat was seized by other people and my friends made no attempt to save me a spot. it felt like i was unable to speak anymore. i had a surgery that took me out of school for 6 weeks and by the time i came back i was basically a stranger. i unironically tried to live high school like a shadow keeping my mouth shut except to participate in classes that required it and to participate in group projects. i didnt really consider myself as having friends until i joined this group on discord. the people in it have changed and weve hopped servers a few times but the central people have stayed the same. the most relevant are fake names although im not worried theyll find this cas nb 22 ian m 22 and james m 23. these people form the core of my friend group. i dont really know when it started. i think i was about 19. i had been feeling depressed for a few weeks and self harming was basically my exclusive way of relieving stress. i was questioning my worth even as a human being fantasizing about ways to remove myself from this world. i guess i started questioning if my larger friend group even wanted me around since i was so easily discarded by the one i had since childhood. i didnt disclose my depression didnt mention self harm didnt share that i wanted to die. i wanted them to feel bad for me so i accused them of not valuing me as a friend and then to them disappeared off the platform for two weeks. the next time i checked discord i had paragraphs of apologies and worried messages basically begging me to come back. it felt euphoric. even people outside the circle that i consider my closest friends were messaging me wondering when id be back. at the time i dont think i even realize i was being manipulative. but i definitely got hooked on the euphoria of their reaction. the feeling of being wanted. ive spent the last 3 years doing basically the same thing. not at the same level. i would guilt trip them for hanging out with other friends. if they said something mean to me i would sulk for days until they apologized even if it was my fault. i give them the cold shoulder if they do something that displeases me even to a minor degree. i push their buttons until they snap to see what they let me get away with. if im angry they get quiet and relent to anything i say or do. even then they always come back. recently cas has been hanging out with two different groups of friends more than us. they keep getting involved in new communities related to their interests and being an important part of other peoples groups. the time they spend with me and the others has dwindled so significantly that ive become a twisted amount of jealous. ive been thinking of ways to convince them to cut those people off. ways to convince them that the others arent worth their time or that theyre bad people. i actively want to isolate them from the other groups so that their only choice is us. i want to make them feel bad for thinking that they should devote attention to anything else. i got on anti depressants a month ago and started attending therapy. the combination is opening my eyes to the things that i do. i am disgusted with myself. i am afraid that im going to go to far and theyre going to realize what i do and cut me off. i deserve it. i want to be better for them but as i am now im probably more comparable to cancer on the group than a friend. i think im afraid that its too late. i dont know. i dont really want pity. im even disgusted that i feel pity for myself when i put myself in this situation. even now i dont know if i can be a better person but im too deep into anti depressants to think that i should just remove myself from this world. i just needed to tell someone.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 23:25:12 UTC,3,2,0.68,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0
1j7kq3p,i bought my wife a new shirt because the store wouldnt accept a refund,i am a horrible secret keeper so im posting here to just get it out. my wife and i attended a convention. we dont typically do a lot of extra curricular things due to budget constraints but we decided to splurge and bought some cute matching shirts. they were prewrapped so we didnt look at them until we got home and went to wash them about 3 days after the convention. mine was ok but hers had a giant stain on it. i reached out to the vendor about getting a replacement or a refund and they said reasonably that too much time has passed since the convention to be able to prove that we didnt stain it. i didnt have the heart to tell her that they said no so i secretly went onto their website and ordered a new one for her. it arrived today and i told her they sent a replacement. they are asia based so the shipping was 2x cost the shirt itself but seeing her so excited id do it again. best 100 ive spent. edit wow i didnt expect anyone to read this never mind having it blow up!! thank you for all the words of love!,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 23:22:18 UTC,2221,29,0.99,,,0,0
1j7knzm,my ex still makes me insecure i just want to move on,i hate that he still makes me insecure and question myself even now so i needed to vent. this post is about me f my ex m and will. were all in our early 20s and this all mostly happened long distance since both my ex and will live a couple of hours drive from me. the timeline of everything is a bit complicated but ill do my best to explain. my relationship with my ex was shitty. i let myself be pressured into an open relationship because i was too afraid to lose him and i was honestly dumb. he used to be my friend and i though more he led me to belive we had the same ideals about things like relationships. this went on for a while untill he mentioned having a girlfriend. i was hurt thinking i had misunderstood everything but i wanted to do the right thing and asked if she was fine with how we talked and if maybe we needed to take a step back. he claimed it was fine that they had talked about me a lot that she knew everything about how we talked and had no problems with it. i believed him probably because i wanted to so we kept talking as usual even if i eliminated every possible hint on my end. even if i was sad about my unreciprocated crush i started working on getting rid of my feelings for him. it was not a good period. i am very sensitive to rejection and was stuck between wanting to end the friendship for peace of mind and not wanting to lose someone i cared about. then he came back. while we were on a phone call he said something pretty explicit and i gave in. i know i was wrong for it but i just assumed he had broken up with his girlfriend. he had talked about her only one other time and just to complain about how they were having trouble because his libido was higher than hers. i know ew but rosecolored glasses were still doing their work. so i flirted back and we started saying some explicit stuff too which never happened before that moment. he was also asking for pictures and being pushy when i told him i wasnt comfortable yet. this went on for a week before it occurred to me that maybe i should ask about his ex. well they were still together. he told me he loved her and she knew he was polyamorous so he decided he would talk to her. anyway he talked to her. radio silence for a week followed. first he had to talk to her and suddently felt bad talking to me and later he was always too tired from that conversation to tell me anything. finally i pressured him enough to tell me that his girlfriend anne wanted to think about things but we could still be friends as usual. that week of silence had made me so scared of losing him that i agreed and six months of hell started. he would flirt then ignore me then get mad at me for being upset. i would have breakdowns ask him to just end everything and he would guilt me by saying he and anne were working so hard on all of this and i was just going to make it all useless which was unfair to them. after those six month i finally decided to end it. it was hardhe made me feel crazy and like i had used him. he managed to basically twist everything in him ending things with me but still gracing me with his presence in my life. after another month he called. he told me that even if i had hurt him a lot he understood why i was feeling so anxious and that anne had finally agreed to us having a poly relationship where he would date both her and me. like the idiot i am i agreed. i talked to anne to make sure it was alright we set boundaries and we gave it a try. skip to another six months later and things are not good. anne broke up with my ex and he became depressed. he would do nothing all day only call me to get him to get out of bed or for sx stuff. he wanted to go to uni but said it was too hard so he looked for a jobbut he was not committing to that either. he also started getting very upset for things i did or did not choose to do. he got mad at me for gifting a drawing im a small artist to a friendsomething i have done countless times for countless people him included. another time he got mad because a client i had done a commission for gave me a small extra as a thanks because he was disrespecting my boundary he got mad at me for asking him to please use theythem pronouns while talking about my best friend of eight years. he gave me the silent treatment for going to a concert with the same friendone i had booked before we were even officially together and had plans to go to before this whole situation even started. skip again to the last two weeks of the relationship and we have plans of going to a convention. will a mutual friend is going to be there too. my ex is supposed to join me on fridaywe have tickets for saturday. thursday will arrived in my town and since we had never met in person he asked me to join him and a group of friends for dinner. i figured its a good way to meet since we would not be alone. my ex knew said he had no problems with it so i went. its important to note that my ex wanted to keep our relationship a secret even though i had asked him to share it with friends will included. at this dinner will was nothing but kind maybe a bit too affectionate for a friend but i honestly did not pay much attention to it. i am not good at telling when people have feelings for me and wills an outgoing guy so i thought it was just that. the next day my ex arrived and i hosted him. that night one of the two major events that led me to the breakup happened. tw for sa i was sleeping and my ex woke me up for sx by touching me inappropriately. i tell im to stop because im tired. he pouts and i ask him whats wrong. he tells me i missed you a lot and you just want to sleep. i repeat im tired and really excited for the next day and im sorry but im really too sleepy to be in the mood. hes still upset but agrees and we go back to sleep. this happens again. at least another two times but i dont really know because i still need a few minutes to understand stuff once ive been woken up. im starting to feel unsafe. the next day i wake up with a bad stomach and back pain. he jokes that maybe he did something to me in my sleep. i am disgusted and want to get out of bed. he hugs me to keeps me there and it takes me a while to manage to even just get up. and then the slowest morning of my life starts. i wanted to get dressed make breakfast for both of us and then go to the convention by 1030 am. by 11 am i was in tears i do cry a lot when im stressed begging my ex to just let me get readyand to get ready himselfbecause i had paid a lot for the ticket and it was important to me to be there. im also someone who manages anxiety by having plans and having someone just ignoring an agreed upon plan without comunicating makes me stressed. he knew this. we finally got on the train and i was upset. he was mad at me for being upset and we argued. he told me he thought it was better to get there later but knew i would get worked up if he told me so he didnt want to deal with me. instead he just took things slow so that i had to adapt to his pace and it was the better like that. i was so shocked about what he was saying for the first time i felt like he was the crazy one and not me. i tried to make him see why that was wrong. i said remember when you got to an event you really cared about 30 minutes late and were sad? this is the same for me. like hes some toddler who needs to learn empathy. he agreed it was the same but still refused to apologize so i let it go to enjoy the convention. i was on edge all day constantly thinking about what i would do if something bad happened even though i wasnt sure why i felt that way. we met will and finally told him we were a couple to be honest he had to ask because my ex did not want me to say it he just agreed to hold my hand and not lie if he asks. the rest of my exs stay went normally. he left and a couple of days later will called me to tell me he had feelings for me. he made it clear he didnt expect anything from me planned to take as many steps back as needed and that my ex already knew. i honestly did not expect it because i had never done anything for him. with both my first and second boyfriends the one in this story we got close after i supported them through a rough period but i had never done that for will. that also made me think a lotmy ex had a very transactional mindset. he never did anything just for nothing and i didnt like that about him. but he had convinced me it was normal that i was just a peoplepleaser. i am but not as detached from reality as he made me out to be. he would always list things he did for me like consoling me when i was stressed and things i didnt do for him like not being good enough at listening him rant about his life because i dont understand his struggles enought to comfort him and im not logical enough for giving advice apparently. i decided to take a few days to process my feelings and focus on my relationship with my ex figuring out how to deal with everything even if right then i did not feel close to him at all. then the straw that broke the camels back came. as stupid as it seems it was a drawingjust a dumb character that will had made standing close to my dumb character and hugging them. i had done this many times. i love drawing peoples characters with mine. i do it for friends even for mutuals and strangers on the internet just because i enjoy it. its something i love doing and people usally like receiving them so its a winwin. i had been working on it before wills confession it was done and i posted it like i do for any other drawing i finish. i really did not see it as important i had done countless similar drawings and i was also trying to keep a regular posting schedule so that my account would get more interactions and i could maybe get commissions. one day first thing in the morning my ex texted me a screenshot of it. i was finally happy after a while but this ruined my day. and i was also going to touch myself but i dont want to anymore first ew second good maybe do something else with your day i couldnt take it anymore. i messaged anne and we finally shared everything about him. we had never done that before because he didnt want us to always claiming to be a private person and saying it was unfair to talk about our relationship. but all his gaslighting came out. we shared stories feelings we had both experienced but that he had convinced us were just in our headsthe same things i just described in this post things i thought were just me being too sensitive timelines that didnt add up... i was sad for about a day but mostly i was angry. that night i called him confronted him and then broke up with him. he played dumb kept saying he knew nothing about it and i should have talked about it. but he never apologized for what he did. just for what i felt he did. i was disgusted and furious. later that night while i was crying myself to sleep will called and i told him what had happened. he was so kind and caringhe comforted me helped me calm down and validated my feelings. i fell asleep with him on the phone. i know this was long but i needed to explain why i moved on so fast. i dont love my ex at all from the moment i texted anne. it was like a switch flipped. i went from loving him to feeling nothing but hate and disgust in about two hours. and i admit that will was part of why i broke upnot because i wanted to be with him but because he showed me what genuine affection feels like. i never told will i had feelings for him before breaking up but i did tell him he was a good person and that i liked him in general. in the weeks that followed will and i started dating. at first we planned to just talk and be very close friends until i felt 100 over the anger and hurt but it just happened. he took a train at 5 am to be with me when my cat was diagnosed with cancer. he hugged me made me watch a movie to take my mind off of it shared stories about his old cat that had the same illness and told me to cherish every moment i had with her. in that moment i knew he was the person i wanted to be with. that was the kind of care and emotional maturity i had always looked for in a partner. of course there was more but that was an important moment for me so we officially started dating shortly after. for those wondering my cat is still okay. shes a fighter. even though the tumor cant be operated on were making sure she has the best possible quality of life with the help of our vet. shes had a great 14 years so far and we want to keep it that way. she and her brother are getting lots of cuddles and treats. so i know this was long and messy but the point is my ex has been going around asking about me and will and i hate that he gets to think of himself as the victim. i may have made mistakes but his actions were malicious. i also really regret letting all of that happen. i used to think i knew how to spot a toxic partner but i let him do his thing without noticing. i just wanted to vent. thank you for bearing with me and sorry for any mistakes.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 23:19:30 UTC,4,4,0.68,,content warning sexual assault,0,0
1j7knoh,reconnecting with someone but im so sensitive to their teasing comments,not really looking for any advice on this i just need to vent as i dont feel its a big enough deal to bring it up to them grinning_face_with_sweat ive recently been talking to someone i lost touch with ages ago. we used to be extremely close and always teased each other jokingly. but since reconnecting with them ive just been feeling a lot more sensitive to their comments? it feels silly as i know they dont mean anything bad by their words but i just find myself wondering if they even really like me as a person or if theyre judging me. couple of examples i have pet cats and this friend knows i love them. theyve never liked cats which is fine. they sent over a funny video of a cat but that somehow devolved into them telling me how much they hate cats and talking about how they also thought cats made their owners bitches etc... i just tried to brush it off and joke back defending my stance on cats a little bit. this isnt the first time ive had to hear about someones grievances with cats but its just such a conversation killer for me. like cool you hate the animals i happen to really like. i am so glad you have given me this reminder lol. the other thing that bothered me a bit was just a comment that made me feel like they thought i was immature. i said something like oh this slaps and they immediately said dont say that youre 31. its such a small thing but i guess ive always been a bit anxious about seeming mature enough to people so it did sting a bit. i imagine a lot of this is just my own anxieties getting the best of me as well as the fact that its been so long that were almost strangers in a lot of ways. i guess i dont really know what they think do me anymore. if you made it this far thanks for reading! grinning_face_with_sweat,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 23:19:06 UTC,1,0,0.67,,,0,0
1j7kg52,the saddest part of not getting unconditional love from your parents is that youre not getting it anywhere else,i have a few friends who are very close to their parents and they know their parents love them and are their 1 biggest fan no matter what they do. its very fascinating to witness and simultaneously upsetting because i cant help but compare it to my own situation. my parents have never been the affectionate loving type but i didnt realize just how little they cared for me until i moved out of the family home before marriage. coming from a very conservative muslim culture this is looked down on because people assume you are living away from your family as a single woman to do haram forbidden activities in the religion. however i just wanted to have my own space and be independent thats all. my parents did not take it well my mother told me i was selfish and deserve everything bad in life for abandoning them. this was over a year ago and the relationship is still quite strained. ive called a few times since and my mother was super rude and irritated like i was bothering her for calling her. so i stopped and i havent spoken to my family in a few months. im not sure how you can claim to love your child and practically disown them for wanting to live their own lives. so i know now i am not loved by them. its really sad to not receive unconditional love from your parents because you will never get unconditional love anywhere else. not from friends not even from your spouse. you will forever feel unloved and worthless. most relationships are fickle and very conditional. you family is meant to be your rock. but i have none. sometimes i wonder why i am even in this world.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 23:09:14 UTC,185,23,1.0,,,0,0
1j7kduf,i befriended a teacher when i was 14 and almost ruined his life,ive only told maybe 2 people for my entire life about this but its been weighing on me recently. i feel like i need to just shout to the void about it. i28m befriended one of my teachers when i was 14. at the time he was 35. for more background i was f at the time now ftm. he was my middle school teacher and when i switched schools i added him on facebook. it wasnt until around my freshman year of high school that we really started to talk. at first i basically harassed him sending him messages daily until he started to reply and it became conversational. after about a year we began messaging each other daily. it was never anything inappropriate we mainly talked about games music art daily life etc. normal friendly type conversation. we never hung out or met up or anything. the only time i saw him after he was my teacher was one time at a school event. i lived in an abusive home and was a very lonely kid. i always figured he sensed that and that i just neededwanted someone to talk to who actually cared. he became what i still consider to be my best friend at the time. i eventually started to have feelings for him because of this. i still remember telling him how i felt and him saying something along the lines of im very flattered but thats not appropriate. the conversation dwindled a bit after that but some time passed and we picked back up our daily conversations. one morning i woke up to see my father on my computer snooping through my messages with this former teacher. i freaked out and told him this. we ended up exchanging numbers and started texting because of this. a while went by a few months if i remember right we continued our friendship and daily conversations. something happened and my parents took my phone i cant exactly remember why they took it. i went to lunch with a friend one day and when i got home both of my parents were there and i knew something was wrong they divorced and hated each other. they confronted me about my teacher and is friendship saying they knew everything. my father had texted him through my phone telling him to cease contact and threatening to report him to the school board if he ever tried talking to me again. i was heartbroken hearing this and knowing id never speak to him again. my parents claim he was grooming me but i never felt that way. he felt more like a dad or an uncle and treated me almost as his kid. plus as mentioned before i basically harassed this man into talking to me. i always got the feeling he just kind of felt bad for me especially looking back on our conversations and this situation as an adult. i never spoke with him again after that. it was somewhat of a traumatic experience for me but only because someone i really cared about just suddenly vanished from my life and i felt as though i had nearly ruined his life because i was a lonely kid. the loss i experienced changed me as a person and the way i view all relationships. i still think of him often. i want to reach out and ask him how he is and tell him how sorry i am for putting him in such a bad situation. its just been so long and i dont want to dredge up the past especially when im sure it was also traumatic for him. i dont know how to move on when it ended so abruptly and so badly. i have dreams of running into him on the street and getting my opportunity to tell him im sorry and hear how he dealt with things afterward.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 23:06:16 UTC,472,63,0.91,,,0,0
1j7k0kz,my mom keeps talking to strangers online.,some back ground she never has any money for the things she needs! constantly asking for money for ubers to get to the doctors door dash and food for lunch. she has called multiple ambulance this year and each time they kick her out the hospital because theres nothing wrong with her! the last she went she called cause she thought she was having a stroke but texted me to bring her tablet to the hospital. when i got to the hospital i told her people who are actually sick dont care about having their tablets. this caused her to snap at me about not caring about her. today she left her tablet open in my dads office they are divorced but live together for now and i saw her messages with her online boyfriend. hes talking about visiting her and theyre saying i love you but shes never met this man! its always the same damn story too military man has a young child and they are stationed aboard. can she be that gullible to keep believing it?? i get it. she an adult 56 but my mom does not seem mentally sound. she has lost countless bank accounts talking to these online boyfriends! she once gave one 700 to invest in his business and he ghosted her all while demanding my dad help her pay for medication. shes constantly falling which is her throwing herself to the ground. she did it in front of my cousin once and she my cousin said she didnt want to come over anymore because my mother was irritating. she is the reason one of my sisters rarely comes around and my other sister is nc with her! everything is everyone elses fault! im so frustrated because shes not understanding the urgency! my dad is not staying in this apartment and finally moving on with his life while her credit is in the shitter! shes barely at work! she spends most of her money on door dash and shitty shit from temu! im trying to have empathy for her because of how she was raised but the constant lying calling out of work not helping clean or cook or buy groceries and being almost allergic to accountability is weighting on me.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 22:49:29 UTC,1,1,0.6,,,0,0
1j7jwdn,i love my dog but i dont like her,my husband wanted a dog and i had never had one before. ive had plenty of pets in the past cats rabbits and fish and i loved each one of them deeply. so we decided to get a dog. he did the work of finding the exact dog he wanted and we drove three hours to adopt her. even though he took on most of the feeding exercising playing and training she bonded to me. the bond feels like an obsession. when im around my husband doesnt exist to her. she never wants to be more than three feet away from me and often shes touching me. when i need a break i go into the bedroom and shut the door. she just sits outside waiting. i can put her in the office with my fiancé on the other side of the house and then go to the bedroom and shut the door. but she waits at the office door whining and whimpering. my husband tries to interact with her but she doesnt care. she just wants me. and i cant handle this level of attention. you can take her outside but if she knows im inside she wont leave the door. if i leave she panics. a few minutes later she calms down and does her own thing. she never bothers my husband this much. ive heard mothers talk about feeling touched out with toddlers and thats exactly how i feel with my dog. the difference is i dont think shell ever grow past this stage. shes a dog. weve worked with trainers to help her become more independent but it doesnt seem to work. im thankful that theres more nuance in the adopt dont shop movement. sometimes it might actually be better to get a dog from an ethical breeder as shelter dogs can come with their own set of challenges. my dog has trauma and that trauma will stay with her for life. it shows up in our relationship where were in a sort of quasicodependence. its frustrating because shes fine when im not around. my husband can take her places and shes as happy as can be. if im not home shes completely relaxed. its only when im around that she becomes obsessed with me. i dont get to experience the playful silly dog everyone else sees because in my presence shes consumed with me. my husband takes her to his brothers farm and he sends me videos of her. it breaks my heart because i want to see that happy playful dog too. i want a dog i can sit outside with playing with toys and rolling in the dirt without her needing to touch my leg at all times. but i never get that dog. i love her so much but her constant affection drowns me. i look forward to when she goes to the farm because i get to be home without her on top of me. i dont love my job but i dread going home because at least at work i get some alone time. i love my dog but i dont like being around her.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 22:44:06 UTC,25,21,0.81,,,0,0

1j7j16a,i have had intrusive thoughts to cheat on just about every partner ive ever had and have followed through in the past.,throwaway for obvious reasons. ive made my mistakes in life having entirely followed these urges in my past with previous partners. its something i am deeply ashamed of and could never do again. but the thoughts linger and remain. oftentimes itll result in me becoming increasingly anxious. sometimes i worry that someday karma is going to swing back around and my fiancee will one day cheat on me perhaps that persistent anxiety is the true retribution. id like to seek therapy but it isnt feasible for me at the moment. i think that some amount of it has to do with abandonment issues. i think my brain convinced itself that having more than one person would always leave me with someone if anybody had abandoned me again in quite an unhealthy coping mechanism for everyone involved. who knows. maybe one day ill conquer these demons.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 22:05:17 UTC,1,0,0.55,,,0,0
1j7izp6,today i was that karen that people vent about when theyre just trying to do their job and i feel so embarrassed,i really need to take this off my chest because today i fcked up multiple times and i feel extremely embarrassed. maybe i am in my head but im definitely somewhere in the wrong. ok so my day started fine with me taking a ride to the airport. the driver a super nice guy from pakistan shared with me that he is fasting and he will only get to have water or something to eat after 6pm. so what do i do? i get all excited about pakistani food and ask him to tell me what are his favorite dishes from his hometown. then i proceed to describe in excruciating detail all my favorite dishes from my country. recipes mouthwatering ingredients the whole thing. by the time i realized that he must be starving it was 4pm after all i was already rambling for about an hour already. i apologized immediately and he was super nice about it but this doesnt make me less of an idiot. so after this great success fast forward to a few hours later i am on the plane seated near the back squeezed into the middle seat. we are about to depart the plane is on the move and i realize that my seatbelt gets loose without me lifting the little lever thingy. i ask for assistance and the flight attendant tells me dont worry the seatbelt will work later. so i ask him how is this possible...? thinking that i really dont do well during flights that i used to get panic attacks that i managed to control after a lot of therapy and ltltomg i am about to fly and if something happens i will break my neck crashing on the roof of the plane!!!gtgt. he sighs then tells me he will replace the belt and goes away. comes back after a minute or so and he says that the plane needs to depart and that there is no time they will need to move me. there is quickly some commotion all the flight attendants make some signals to each other and they find me a free row at the front. so i thank them profoundly i apologize for the last minute chaos that i caused and go to my new princess seat but the window with extra legroom that i didnt pay for. i sit down i put the seatbelt on.... and i realize that the new seatbelt also gets loose if i push the metal thing! i test it out a little bit and then it hits me. if i just pull the belt it stays locked. if i put my finger under the metallic thing and push slightly it gets loose. so that means that i did all this.... for no reason. i close my eyes and start thinking that it cant be that im so inconsiderate today. and how embarrassing. meanwhile im doing my breathing exercises trying to relax. there is turbulence today and my mouth is dry i cant handle it anymore. i open my eyes and soon as i see the flight attendant handing out chocolates i ask for some water. she says i will check if we still have and im thinking oh wow how strange! it cant be that they dont have at least one bottle. quickly she comes back hads me one and finally i drink some water. finally i can try to relax im thinking. then i realize must have dropped the chocolate she gave me. i start looking around and then i look to my left and i freeze. on the seat next to me there is yet another water bottle that the flight attendants must have left for me while i was trying to breathe iiiiin hooooold exhaaale the plane is safe the plane is safe the plane is safe. so thats it. this is another successful day. i am sitting here patiently writing this to distract myself and i think i will post as soon as we land. thank you for listening to my rambling dear reader lt3,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 22:03:29 UTC,0,9,0.47,,,0,0

1j7ik5i,7layer carrot cake the shame. not death but pretty similar to a death sentence.,the way life taught me about sex. not my mom or dad or a sex ed teacher. but life. lets keep in mind that as humans we have an innate instinct to procreate. my dad used to babysit me while my mom would go to work. he would put asian music videos on in the living room and i would sing and dance to the songs all day long. i was 4. i was a sociable outspoken singing daddys girl and i loved people because they would dote on me. what im really trying to say here is at 4 i could recognize humans and human beings. my dad took me over to his buddys house. his buddy had two sons. one was about 7 and the other son was about 4 as well. while he and his buddies were hanging out downstairs the older boy 7 showed me a book his dad had of naked people in all sorts of sexual positions kind of like a kama sutra. he proceeded to usher me into a closet and took off all my clothes. my dad found me naked in the closet and helped me put all my clothes back on and we went home. at around 5 years old i woke up one morning and looked around. my little brother was sleeping in a separate bed in the same room as me. as you know and as i have mentioned above i loved watching tv because of the music videos and because of barney and other things i would watch on tv. so this somber morning i woke up walked to my parents room and they were sleeping and i didnt want to wake them up. i walked back to my room where my brother was sleeping. we had a tv in our room and laying around on the floor were a vhs tapes. so i picked one up and popped it in. it was a porn tape. i remembered the naked people from the book that one kid had showed me and this porn tape had the same people. naked and actively doing things. i somehow knew it was bad. so i turned down the volume and i watched the whole thing instead of taking out the vhs. lets just say curiosity killed the cat and i was the very curious kitten. then around the same year at 5 years old i was molested by my uncle. he was living in the same house as us in the basement. it happened to my memory one time and one time only. i knew what had happened to me the moment it happened. i knew something bad had happened to me and i knew what sex was but i just didnt know the exact words for what everything was. that is my 7layor carrot cake story. not exactly 7 layers but it just seems that bad things of a sexual nature kept making its way into my very short life and i came out on the other side too knowing and too knowledgable way too soon. every day i wish i had had the chance to be innocent and to be trusting of others and of people. i wish i had the chance to be a happygolucky kid unburdened. but i was denied that. i grew up with no friends at all because of the amount of guilt i felt. the fact i understood sex at such a young age and being molested it was like an awkward secret i just kept inside. but secrets weight on you. even if you dont think they do. its a physical manifestation and i was not the beautiful child i always wished i was. i was dark and small and always was a little heavier than other girls. because of all those reasons i still have no friends i have never made a friend. i still have extremely low selfesteem paired with a high body count. im just not normal. it feels this way at all times. i always stick to myself and i never look anyone in the eye. the shame. i also want to note to anybody that was raised around too many males. just dont. its not safe for any parent with a small female child to be around that many menmales all at once and even if you trust them i would say you should always have a considerable amount of doubt and remove your child from danger or harm.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 21:44:50 UTC,2,0,0.61,,content warning sexual assault,0,0

1j7gwdo,my ex friend is getting married and i cannot stop feeling sad because of my own delusion.,if28 and my former friend g f30 meet during our first term in university we both came from the same area and went to the same school at one point. we clicked and became really good friends from there. i was an insecure 19 year old at that time and she was outgoing and active in our version of sorority. i was invited to outings that i actually enjoyed and began to build up some confidence. we both had our share of mental problems understood each other but after taking diffrent courses we stopped meeting as regularly but she always said that i was one of her closest friends. in 2020 i became sick. really heavy burnout crohn dieses and bulimia that made me unable to stay in town. i moved back home and slowly began to rebuild my life and health. now in 2025 i am still sick but way better and have control of my mental problems. during the last five years i wrote to g every time i went to the university city asking to meet up and if i could i set the dates of my travel after her schedule to make sure we could meetits a 5h drive. every time she said she would love to and if she was available we booked a date and time. but almost always something happened or she double booked that she remembered 1 day to 1h before. during these five years we have meet up twice and i have probably asked her around 10 times since i usually go twice a year. she never wrote to me when she visited her parents or asked me when i was going down next time which i realise now was a clear sign that i ignored. i once wrote and asked her if she didnt want to meet up it was okey and i would understand time changes people and friendship does not always last. she denied it and said she very much wanted to meet up and i accepted the answer. telling me how horrible of a friend she is and how sorry she is. two years ago i had a major breakdown when g cancelled on me again. i had been so excited and when she cancelled i was heartbroken. walking is my coping strategy especially with heavy emotions even after 10km i did not stop crying. i was living with another friend for that weekend and i fully broke down in the end and told her everything. they had never suspected anything cause i always spoke so well off her. she apparently told my other friends who all are mad on my behalf. g sent me a snap in may 2024 with the caption in exactly one year we are getting married with a picture on her fiancé. i congratulated her but i had no idea about their engagement before that. i decided to one last try and asked her of a time during the summer we could meet up with my vacation weeks in mind. she responded and we decided a week were she was free for details to be determined later. as it approached i wrote 1 week before and told her the days no response. when i finally was at the hotell i wrote again and told her how long i was there and times when i was booked. my friends were a bit angry at me for trying again but i said that this will be the last time. one day after i came home from the trip she responded with how sorry she was for not answering. i had enough and told her how i felt through the years i was nice and civile even said i should have brought it up earlier and not just unload it all now even asked my friends to read before sending. g answered and told me she understood why i felt like that i ended it with that if she wanted to meet she would have to text or call me now cause i was tired of this being so one sided. guess what not heard from her since. now i see pictures from the wedding preparations like the baccalaureate and dress fitting and i feel so sad. probably i had a delusion hope deep inside that i would get an invite and that she would text me. this quenching the last hope of ever being friends again and telling me how little i meant and what friends mattered to her. my friends supports my feelings even my boyfriend but i just feel like i never meant anything. if they are real friends they will make time for you i know but in my head i go through all those memories and just wonder if i could have done anything different. been a better friend written more called or if i just was the burden i always was scared of being also wishing i not been so delusional and naive. sorry for the long postred_heart,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 20:31:38 UTC,3,3,0.64,,,0,0

1j7fwtg,i feel left out by my girlfriend,hello guys. i really have to get this off my shoulders so i decided to make this post on here. already appreciate you guys for reading it. so i am m22 and my gf is the same age we are together since three years now and everything did go well for the most part. the thing is i am an absolute introvert and probably suffer from social anxiety. i hate to go to places where a lot of people are i cannot eat when a lot of people are around me and i just get exhausted and overwhelmed so fast. this makes my life really hard tbh and its even harder because i cant understand why i feel that way. like i was grown up in a great lovingly household have a good job and i am basically just a normal guy who should not complain about his life. however my gf knows all those things and we talk about it and all she also tells me shes there for me and just tries to help me out as much as she can. and then there was this situation yesterday it was the 20th birthday of her brother who is also a really close friend of mine and he was throwing a party with approximately 40 people. and what can i say i felt like absolute shit the whole week my anxiety hit rock bottom and i felt like i couldnt handle it. the night before the party i had a fucking panic attack while falling asleep. so i was talking to my gf talking about how i feel and how i am getting the worst anxiety ever and so on.. she then tried to make me feel less anxious she told me she is there for me the whole evening she wont let me be alone and stuff and idk just trying to pick me up. thats also one thing like i feel giga weak in those situations why cant i handle such things shouldnt i be the one protecting her? however i am also really insecure about myself. the party was on saturday 1900 in a bar. my heart was racing all day. i tried to calm myself down with playing some video games some csgo and some league but nothing really helped. so at around 1830 i left home and was driving to the party. you can imagine how i felt. when i arrived we were in a group of maybe 5 people i really didnt know many people there maybe like 3 or 4. then i went to the wc to calm down a bit and when i cam back my gf was grouping with her friend the other people i knew where also with their other friends and suddenly i find myself standing in this bar alone trying to talk to some people i didnt even know just to make it less akward. it was my personal hell. however i couldnt just go to my gf and her friends because i would have felt ultra weird when being the only guy there coming out of nowhere. i would have appreciated it so much if she would have came up the me and just would be on my site. but she didnt. she didnt the whole evening. like in 8 hours she wasnt coming up to me once. one time she was looking at me she wanted to ask me if everything was okay by signaling it i was shaking my head and telling her no nothing is ok and then she turned around and did go somewhere else. like why? i dont understand that. i feel like the biggest loser on this earth my feelings are ultra hurt and i cant stop thinking about it. i could have never done it like this if roles were switched. maybe i am overreacting but honestly i dont think so. like why do i even tell her how i felt like shit because of this party. should i have just came up to her and her friends? idk. i still think it would have been easier for her to come pick me up then for me to go to them. especially when she knows how i felt. idk this evening made me just feel like absolute shit i feel hurt as hell i could literally start to cry right now. why do i have to be such an insecure and anti social person i just dont get it. however now i am here sitting at my pc listening to music and writing this down. idk if anybody will even read this but if so sorry if my english is not the yellow from the egg but i tried my best. have a nice sunday evening,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 19:48:09 UTC,0,1,0.33,,,0,0

1j7fpko,im preparing a surprise for my bf,my boyfriends phone broke about a week and a half ago so weve barely been able to talk and its been tough on both of us. a few days ago i came up with an idea to make things a little easier for him when he finally gets his phone back. every day ive been sending him a message on whatsapp telling him about my daywhat happened how i felt how much i miss him and anything else that comes to mind. along with each message i send a selfie so he can see what i looked like at that moment. its not the most elaborate surprise but i think hell be really happy when he finally gets his phone back and sees everything. right now we can only talk through playstation groups and we cant even see each other so i hope this makes him feel a little closer to me. a part of me is so excited to see his reaction but another part of me keeps wanting to add more days before he gets his phone back. either way i just cant wait to see and hear him again. whether hes tired pouting excited or just being himself hes always so cute and i miss him so much.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 19:39:43 UTC,21,43,0.83,,positive,0,0
1j7foz6,my mom cares more about public opinión than my wellbeing...,i am currently in family therapy and in one of the sessions where we were talking about my sa and how it affected us both and our relationship we discovered that i needed some closure. this meant that i would have to talk to a family member from my moms side to tell her what happened. my mom ended up confessing that she would much rather keep the family in peace and still have a relationship with them then be with me and support me when i do talk to that aunt. since then i havent been able to calm my anxiety i feel like shit every day i have been in a state of derealization that is driving me crazy. since my dad left when i was 3 i have always put my moms needs and feelings before mine sadly all i have learned during these sessions is that i am not the daughter she wants that i am always wrong and that she literally cant name 1 good thing about me. it is super confusing because she hasnt stopped helping me pay for uni she still helps me buy new clothes for my new job but yet again she wont hesitate to tall me how mean or inconsiderate i am. i am honestly exhausted i wanted to better our relationship i am the one who started with the idea of family therapy but it has become one of the worst decisions of my life. i appologize for any mistakes englis is my second lenguage i wonder if this has ever happened to anyone is it normal for single mothers to hate thir childern? am i actually the worst like she says?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 19:38:59 UTC,3,4,0.72,,content warning sexual assault,0,0

1j7fegc,i guess life isnt really for me,ive seriously been trying to find a less nihilist way to look at life but its the only thing that makes sense to me. any form of meaning like a passionhobby religion or living for the little moments feels very pointless because objectively speaking it is pointless in the long run. besides ive always felt very useless. like im not truly good at anything no matter how much time i devote to it. ive been fucking up everything to be honest with you. i even dropped out of college a year ago because i was just doing terribly. i think im just really dumb. even if i passed what the fuck is the point? ill still work my ass off majority of my life for no reason whatsoever. ive never really shared my views on life with anyone besides my therapists so i just wanna leave something behind before going through with it. i know its irrational but i guess being irrational is just a part of being a human and any living creature now that i think about it. i wish you better luck.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 19:26:30 UTC,2,2,0.76,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0
1j7fdqt,my exgirlfriend gaslit me while relationship while cheating on me found out on my birthday,my m24 now exf26 girlfriend started dating in march last year. i had just come out of a toxic situationship where i take part blame. i was a bad communicator im sure i still am but i gained some communication skills. i really liked her found my now ex 3 weeks later. i knew it would be a rebound but it helped so much. especially considering this girl had been my crush since 8 years ago when i had first started working with her. we had so much fun early on trips going out eating out. it started to feel less like a rebound and something of a real relationship. unfortunately it came to her moving out of her moms house. she needed a place to go and me with my somewhat trust issues was scared to let her move in with her friends which were one girl and two guys. she had been known to get around but i trusted her more than most people did and had hope. she was very kind had many mental issues but nothing i couldnt stand i had grown up with childhood trauma and this seemed like nothing. so me with my trust issues and wanting to move out of my moms house as well took her offer of renting a place together. it seemed fun and i had just started a career job so it seemed like a good time. found out very quickly it would not be. see my ex well call fiona had severe insecurities and drinking issues not to mention drug addiction. i had known to some extent but not to this severity. the first week we moved in i wanted to have a get together party for our first place together. turns out fiona hates having people in her space. she was very quiet the whole night and near the end she stormed off to the room where id get yelled at when i head to bed. she scream at me in bed as i had work the next morning i told her sorry and wed talk about it tomorrow. she got up and stormed out the room. i was just happy for the quiet until i hear her screaming my name and yelling help! help! i storm out seeing her wrist covered in blood with it spilling all over the floors. i help her best i can she didnt hit an artery so it soon stopped but left a nasty scar. after this night most nights especially when we went out i would get no rest being accused of cheating or just not giving her enough love. over the next few months one of our mutual friends decided a surprise birthday party for her. i honestly wasnt thinking to hard about it i just thought maybe itd make her happy forgetting she didnt like people in her space. same thing happened. she was upset the whole night stayed in the bedrooms and never came out. through out the night you could hear her screams saying get out of my house! in the most embarrassing way possible. her sister was there and tried to calm her down the whole night which did not work. i eventually got everyone out because the music was barely covering it up. i went to bed again. same thing yelling at me. she got up stormed out. i was worried but thought that it was a one time thing. nope i instantly hear my name being screamed. this time much worse. i come out to see the cut is even deeper attempt to stop the bleeding but it just wont. i call 911 while making a makeshift tourniquet to try and stop it. the paramedics get her after the police which was someone i knew. i told them about how she was saying before that she wanted to die. i didnt think this was an attempt but a callout. i took her to the hospital after the medics said she didnt need the ambulance after patching her up. stayed up all night at the hospital dropped her off at home then went to work. i was miserable. i couldnt stand this anymore. i didnt want to break the lease but at the same time i also still cared for this girl. i felt bad. i needed a way out that night was my chance but you just couldnt leave her alone she cried and begged me. so we continued our relationship. a few months later same thing yelling at me and saying i dont give her enough affirmations and accusing me of deleting snapchats and sneaking people in when shes off at work. which led to a night that she destroyed my tv in the living room put holes in the walls and screamed at me in my face. i was done i left to stay at my friends house. told her to leave wed figure out the situation after. the day after she said she needed time to move and wanted to talk. i went over and we talked the whole night. she promised shed get therapy and help. and i felt so terrible i truly loved this girl but it was such a toxic relationship. i gave her one last chance. we decided to stick together agreeing to talk things out more. see i still have my trust issues and being accused of things makes me curious why its that in particular. i memorized her password months ago but never really felt the need to look through her phone. i had it just in case. but i was working one night straight shift. she went out with her friends. acted very strange to me and i just felt something was off. i come home at 7am find her dead asleep. couldnt even wake her up to give her a kiss. she had left her phone on my side of the bed. i felt the urge to look through it. went through it for hours. finding hidden messages in messenger of her taking to her ex saying how she thinks about him everyday and that she needs him. other messages to her other ex on snapchat came across it by chance because it had been cleared and muted. it was of last night being very flirty and him leaving hearts and her pictures with her hearting back. her saying i miss you and then a phone call about 6 minutes lasting. i called this number i asked him to be straight up if shes cheating. he sounded dumbfounded but said she wasnt and that they were just friends that use to date. but i found pictures dating only right before we started dating that they were kissing and all over eachother. i woke her up absolutely heated. ngl this was probably the angriest ive ever been. i told her what i had seen. she of course denied it. eventually admitting that it was cheating but they never had sex. which i absolutely think is a lie. but i said it was over and she took it so easily. she nodded and called her mom got her stuff in the car then laughing about a joke she made saying shes tired of constantly moving. all while i sit and wait for her to leave. also if i didnt mention this happened all on my birthday. she leaves not answering any of my questions like why? how could you do this? since then ive been sitting here she still left a few things and needs a truck to come pick them up. she just texted me that shes coming today to pick them up. i still feel like shit but can hold my emotions together.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 19:25:36 UTC,0,4,0.5,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0

1j7f4bn,i am the result of my dads selfishness,its 1 in the morning right now and i really need to get something off my chest back when my dad was in his 20s he got married happily and had 1 son and 1 daughter on the way. they used to be financially stable and was able to live pretty comfortably. not rich but comfortable. but one day my dad decided to travel to a big city to find a better job this is where the problem starts. he met my mom and fell hard for her. as soon as he met my mom he filed a divorce letter to his ex wife who was pregnant at that time. he left his wife just to be with my mom also abandoning his 2 children. my mom didnt know this at the time and thought he was just a nice person. eventually she did eventually find out about the family that he left behind when they were engaged however because the wedding is so close she didnt wanna cancel the wedding and decided to go through with it. bad decision imo but whatever my dad and mom managed to run a very successful business. like upper class stuff. they got married and had me. 20m. ive always thought that i had a very spoiled life. being able to afford things most people would kill for and even going to an expensive private school. my dad did not pay a single penny for child support. it was my mom who sends his ex wife money. keep in mind i was kept in the dark about this until my parents eventually divorced when i was 1314 for reasons i dont feel comfortable explaining. i was eventually told that i have half siblings from my dads previous marriage. and whats worse is learning that they are financially struggling all because of my dad abandoning his own family just to have me. and now? he did the same with me. i havent seen my dad in months now and we are living with less money than we had. i feel guilty. the fact that i was born into a family where i was fed with a silver spoon while not knowing the financial struggles my half siblings are in. if my dad was not an asshole i wouldntve existed by now. to add salt to the wound. my dad remarried and tried conceiving a baby through ivf. i was so fucking pissed hearing that. he abandoned my 2 older half siblings to have me and now hes abandoning me for an ivf baby? my mom says that despite all of this i should still love my father as hes your father afterall but i just cant. i really... really... cant....,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 19:14:17 UTC,13,4,0.83,,,0,0
1j7f2kc,unsure about my trauma,so i just made this account because there is something that has been troubling me for a while now. and i obviously didnt wish to use my original account to post it. in my dating years i had 3 accidental pregnancies and obviously i couldnt keep them so i went ahead with aborting them. i understood that it was not the ideal decision and a lot of people would have opinions on it but it was the only right decision for me at that time. now it has been some years since this has happened and im very happy with my partner today but there are days when this sadness comes back about those three incidents . this sadness gets triggered by anything randomly. for instance a friend decides to use birth protection and i dont know why i wake up thinking about that time when i had to do what i did. another time i could not go through the series which was depicting in some detail about a couple dealing with the abortion and the decision making around it . while the abortion itself is a horrible experience to go through the last one that i had was extremely painful and terrible due to some situations . my partner has been extremely supportive about this throughout the years but i find it difficult to not feel like a burden when all of a sudden one morning i am in a bad mood and they dont understand exactly how and why i am feeling like that. so i guess im just dumping my feelings here because im not really sure what to do with them. i dont want to burden my partner who already has a lot of pressure from work in everywhere else and i cant seem to make this sadness go away.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 19:12:06 UTC,1,10,0.6,,content warning violencedeath,0,0
1j7esqz,there might actually be something wrong with my mom,i 22f dont have the best relationship with my mom 47f. i lied to her as a child about grades and chores but what kid doesnt? and now she doesnt trust me or anything i say anymore which i can admit is fair and have been doing the work to not lie to her anymore because i was terrified of her as a kid. ill most likely delete later and just need some sort of insight from other parents or people that have had people like this in their lives. me and my mom still live under the same roof but im genuinely thinking of getting out of here because i dont know how much more i can take. we had an argument a few days ago because i was trying to explain a situation that happened and she immediately started with saying i always have an answer and an excuse for everything. i tell her that it genuinely hurts she still thinks im lying to her and im trying to reassure her that im not. she resorts to mocking me about how my feelings were hurt. she then accused me of gaslighting her which i literally would never do and i had tears streaming down my face because it was clear she didnt want to listen to anything i was saying. and shes been passive aggressive towards me for the past couple days. i dont know if i want to try and talk to her again because i dont want to be at the brunt of another one of her episodes or if i should just cut my losses and just finding a way to move out. if theres actually something up with her or me that im not seeing then please tell me so. also i should have prefaced that a lot of our conversations end up with her yelling at me and making me apologize when she could just leave me alone.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 19:00:33 UTC,1,0,0.99,,,0,0

1j7enot,im actively ruining my life,the title might sound a bit melodramatic. selfsabotage is something ive been aware of for a long time. as soon as things start to get even slightly better i sabotage myself and fall back into a hole deeper each time. i complain about it as if its not my own fault. but in the end im doing this to myself. im ashamed of this behavior because its illogical and honestly it just sounds sick. for a long time now ive been hurting myself intentionally sinking deeper and deeper. i dont see any reason to stop. of course things will get difficult with the summer coming and swimming will be mandatory in the 11th grade. but the scars are already there and maybe i wont even make it to 11th grade. i cant magic away the scars and i feel pretty neutral about them. and if someone asks me about it i lie and say that im trying to stop. but why should i? i know how this behavior could end up killing me but maybe thats okay. if someone asks me if everything is okay i say that im trying id love to say that im fine but im terrible at lying. but ive already given up. yes im starting to become riskier doing dumber things. things that could kill me. i isolate myself and spend my days doing meaningless stuff. its terrifying. in my head there are different voicesthe analyzing rational one and the disturbed one. it feels like i cant stop myself anymore. like im just watching as i ruin my life. i wish i could drink my problems away but thatd be cruel as my best friends father died due to his alcohlicism.peace out or whatever long story short im sabotaging myself.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 18:54:33 UTC,0,3,0.4,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0
1j7emh1,i f19 think i have feelings for my new friend f19,to start off this isnt a girl crush or anything. ive been a lesbian since the womb so im definitely not confused. i met a girl chloe in one of my college classes when the semester started in february. when we met i thought she was really pretty. we were both in a committed relationship with different ppl when i met her so i didnt think much of it. we became friends as the semester went on and she introduced me to her friend group. weve spent a lot of time together this past month and chloes a really great person. me and my most recent ex broke up a week ago and it was hard. we were together for a year but we had issues so i broke it off. after telling chloe abt the break up shes been inviting me out more and ive hung out w her everyday since then. whenever were together i feel like we have a connection. im wondering if this feeling is just a way of coping from the break up or if i have unfortunately developed a crush on a girl that is in a relationship with another girl. if i do conclude that these feelings are real i would never act on it. id never be disrespectful like that but i just wanted to get it off my chest.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 18:53:07 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j7ee5a,im a content creator known by many as a woman but im starting to realize im a trans man.,5 years of content creation now. i guess my most impressive metric is 50000 youtube subs. i am not massive but i have a community that i could never leave behind. i also have another job sometimes people assume once i say im a content creator that its my only source of income. i think people overestimate the money content creators make. even with 50000 subs your barely be making enough for rent and maybe food. im known for being the woman of my streaming group which is predominantly men. i get targeted with a lot of femaleoriented questions during streams sometimes sexist jokes but usually stuff like hey x youre a girl so is it true women feel x on their period? just as an example. i started streaming when i was 19. im 24 now. in these last five years ive learned a lot about myself. including that i have simply never truly felt like a woman. its always felt like a costume and a role. ive reached more self awareness and understanding of myself and i know for certain i am not a woman. mentally at least. i dont know what to do. i know the most important thing is to thine own self be true. but i kinda wish i could transition and continue to play the role ive had in my group. part of me revels in the thought of just being one of the dudes but i know it would never be that easy. i know it will be awkward. i know that i will be misgendered and mocked. i know that there will be people in my community who are supportive but i know there will be many who are not. i am losing my whole identity as a person and as a member of my group. i am scared to change the dynamic of our streaming group. i am scared to admit i am trans and find out that there may be people in my streaming group or my community who will not take this reveal kindly. i am scared of all the jokes and commentary that will be made. i am just scared uncertain and shaky. my husband has been a rock at this time but im even afraid of losing him in transitioning. thanks for listening.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 18:42:51 UTC,0,4,0.33,,,0,0

1j7d1qk,how to tell someone their boyfriend is on dating apps?,i came across a guy on apps i had gone on one date with him a few years ago but a girl i used to briefly work with has been posting him on her instagram for his birthday valentines etc. the first time i saw him was on facebook dating and it doesnt show anything about being active so i thought it couldve been an old profile. this was on valentines day and she posted him on her story. a few weeks later she posted on her story for his birthday. and today i saw him on tinder with his profile showing active and that he liked me. nothing on his profiles says in an open relationship or nonmonogamous. i took screenshots but should i tell her or send her these? i dont really know her well at all but i feel bad knowing this if theyre likely still together confused_face how do i start that conversation?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 17:44:48 UTC,1,4,1.0,,,0,0

1j7cxzj,i was dumped yesterday but i had been thinking about the breakup for a year it hurts so much,i 25f was in a relationship 25m for almost 2 years. it started off very very well very dreamy and romantic where i told my friends that i had found the guy i had been looking for all this while etc etc. 2 months after our first date i lost my job and i realised how emotionally unavailable he was because all he cared about was his job and his work stress he didnt know how to empathise with me or support me or help me out for context the city we live and work in is his hometown but i thought probably my expectations are a bit much because we are so early in the relationship. but i have known since aug 2023 that this isnt right for me. i am going to bulletise the problems spending time despite living in the same city he only saw me once a week frisat which i initially found weird but adjusted around it. however because he is an insane workaholic we didnt do anything special just stayed in. there were no date nights. when we went out on date nights i planned all of them i initiated them and i convinced him. i wanted to spend more time with him see him more but that he told was not possible because it messes with his routines. a lot of his habits and ideas of how we should be were straight up selfish inconsiderate and disreputable tbh. a twisted definition of ambition different definitions of meaning of life he has a well paying reputable steady job but he wants to start his own thing so that he is doing something meaningful in life. what that means for us is insane working hours no downtime no quality time no matter how much i tried to adjust. when breaking up he said the kind of relationship i want works for people who have job stability and dont want to do much outside of that and i disagree so much. all i wanted was someone to spend my weekends with have that quality time. isnt that the bare minimum? also if he cant do this how will he ever be in a relationship? for me i am super ambitious and have built a career in a foreign country from the ground up but for me ambition means being good at job and liking it enough to login every morning to do a good job. meaning of life doesnt come from the job as i work for the paycheck but meaning comes from travel experiences relationships and friendships. his routine he was obsessed with his routines. wake up at 6 sleep at 10 gym at 7am work 89 kinda guy. which is ok routines are good but what that meant was he only saw me fridays and called me daily 93010 he didnt call me initially at all and we foughjt a lot to get here. anything outside of that was not possible. this didnt emotionally sit right with me because i couldnt trust depend rely on him. in fact when we were breaking up he told me he calculated ???? the amount of time he spends with me or talking to me and thats about 12hweek which is not possible for him right now. what this translated in my head was i am not worth the 12hweek his spending habits he lives at home with his parents earns a lot more than me and saves and invests all that he earns to an obsessive degree. he has enough to retire rn and i respect that. but what that meant for us was he was extremely stingy and calculative. we split stuff but he just wasnt happy spending on date nights dinners gifts. heck he even calculated the transport cost from his home to mine. he even liked to lecture me about how i should spend money when i already live below my means because i have a loan. he also said that he is saving enough for the both of us but that never gave me confidence because i saw that as an attack on my independence i cant live on the money he has earned or saved because it is not mine he will always reinforce that and i will have a lesser of a say in how we spend that money. he definitely wanted a prenup if we were to marry which i dont mind but his general attitude towards money and being too calculative wasnt reassuring basically these were longstanding problems which i identified very early on in the relationship and communicated why i find them problematic. however after each time i communicated he gave me something new to cling my hope on to and i hoped things would get better because i genuinely wanted this to work. they never got better we kept on arguing until yesterday when he asked the question and i agreed i felt a bit blindsided tbh because he never told me he is thinking about it too. i guess there are 2 lessons for me 1. to be in a relationship and live in the present and not with the persons potential and what it could be 2. to not be so obsessed with the idea of relationships and building a life and the feeling of home with someone that i keep putting up with shit having said all of this the feeling of loss is immense and i still miss him and have been bawling my eyes out when it was me who had been considering breaking up for the past year and i know in my heart he is not the one for me.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 17:40:16 UTC,2,0,0.76,,,0,0

1j7cir2,18 m amp f. for the past year ive suffered mentally cause my gf wouldnt initiate intimate contact with me.,this is a bit odd and by intimate i mean a bit more than just touching. for a year ive felt like ive initiated every kiss every makeout. were not sexually active yet but have been dating for almost 3 years now. and we were fairly physical before but now the extent of her initiating anything is holding hands or resting her head on my shoulder. i love even that. makes me melt. makes me feel wanted. but then i realize at the end of the day that i initiated every kiss. we make out once in a couple months when i initiate. ive asked her about it. multiple times. is something bothering her does she want some support is this not something she wants in a relationship. every time the answer is that she wants it and that shell initiate but then its like she forgets about it. i remember the time shed hold me look me in the eyes and kiss me. i remember the times shed take the slower non supervised elevator to kiss me in. i remember when shed ask me to come over when she was alone to make out. nothing. for a year nothing. i dont even ask her anymore cause at that point it feels like im forcing her or making it out to be a major fault. i cant even tell whats wrong. whats changed. every time i ask her its a different thing. shes not feeling it shes lost her sex drive but then a month later she said that wasnt the issue theres shit going on in her family. and its fucking killing me inside. ive started to cook up an actual fantasy in my head. fantasies of being intimate with her someday have turned into a fantasy of a girl in the future who actually physically expresses love for me. i have shit in my life too and a kiss from her makes all that go away. i just feel broken at this point. for 3 years almost ive worked with this girl and i genuinely love every inch of her but somehow this issue itches at the inside of my head and makes me miserable. and ive tried talking to her but it makes no difference. we reach an agreement and she changed things for a day and then she just reverts to the way things used to be.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 17:21:41 UTC,1,8,0.57,,,0,0

1j7ce4s,grieving biking season,for the past 2 years ive been smoking weed almost daily. i recently went through a lot of changes and in that i quit smoking and started taking supervised urine tests. among other things i knew that taking these tests meant i couldnt take my drivers license for at least a few months and that was okay with me. what i didnt know is that it meant i couldnt drive at all until these tests were finished which is 6 months even tho i am clean. my doctor failed to tell me or i failed to remember that i cant use the license for my motorcycle that i already have. i recently met a guy who made my passion for driving motorcycles light up again. i was so ready to get back on the bike bring it out of the garage change out the oil and have it in pristine condition. i was so excited to spent a summer on two wheels while getting my life back on track and this time with someone to share the joy with. in some ways it was part of my motivation for staying clean and having it ripped away in the span of a few google searches made it that much harder. i feel so angry and stupid. i feel like i should have known and i feel like it was obvious. yet i thought in some magical way that i could keep my excisting licence just not take another drivers test. i was so ready for the freedom of driving to work and going on road trips. or just driving to the store without relying on commute or friends or having to walk for 15 minutes. i know it really isnt the end of the world but the next 5 months is gonna be that much more challenging knowing i could have been on a bike if i hadnt admitted to my doctor that i smoked weed. im gonna call the doctors office tomorrow to see if im correct in thinking i cant drive my motorcycle but im scared of getting my hopes up. id rather sit with knowing ill get told i cant drive than be let down again tomorrow. but on the other side of things i probably wouldnt have quit if it wasnt for having to do this at some point either way. it just sucks that ill be done with these tests in september at the very end of the season.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 17:15:58 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j7bpwd,my 20f dad 54m refuses to pay for my sister 18f tuition because he has no money,so when we were in highschool my dad made us quit any extracurricular activities to make extra money and help pay bills and save for our college and just put into saving for us. thats what he told us. but he would take whatever we made and only give us 20 of spending money every pay period. we gave him thousands that went towards the bills and college funds and even built a house back in our home country for when our parents retire. to add to that we have gotten many scholarships so the majority of our schools were paid for. my sister in question lost her job and has been having a hard time finding another one. my dad used her funds to pay for the first half of her tuition but refused to pay for the second half. the cost is 4k. he said he has no money but yet he just bought a new bmw worth 25 to 30k. keep in mind we have 3 extra cars that need about 500 worth if fixing for him to drive just fine! when my mom was trying to talk to him about helping pay for my sisters college tuition he told her to ask us the siblings to help. since i have money saved i was able to help pay for her tuition but before i did i wanted to confirm with him first that he couldnt pay for it. he said he wouldnt answer that question and brushed me away. when i tried to get more from him he started yelling at me calling me disrespectful. this is an ongoing thing with him. whenever we try to talk back he calls us disrespectful. when he is with his friends he brags about how smart educated and respectful his children are but then in private he belittles us sends money to strangers and constantly puts others first before his own family. i guess we are all sick of it and i want to write this out because i dont know if somebody can see his side of things and tell me what i am missing here. yes we can move out but the economy is so bad and he knows that so whenever he gets mad he tells us that we can just leave knowing that we cant support ourselves. he gets about 1500 extra in rent from us every month from 3 of us but not from 2 of us cause my sister lost her job and my other sister just started her college as well shes 17f. she worked very hard and brought about 60k of yearly tuition down to 7k with scholarships and is staying in the dorms. my dad has now refused to pay that even though my sister has worked throughout highschool to make that money. when we argue about money he stirs the conversation away from the main point and starts going on longggg rants about this certain bill and that certain bill and whenever we cut him off so he can get to the point he calls us disrespectful and tells us to get out of his room. we know he purposely does this so he can get out of a conversation. and even when he says he never has the money he is constantly sending money to random people and we feel like he is flexing it. i remember i had to stay at school while my classmates got to go on a fieldtrip cause he didnt want to oay the 5 fee. and then he bought a 20 hat for a funeral he went once! he likes to be constantly looked at and its so embarrassing when we have to go out. and my mom is constantly arguing with him on our behalf. its tiring and i feel for my mom who has to deal with his tantrums most of the time.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 16:46:45 UTC,2,2,0.76,,,0,0

1j7bepy,advice for res or even inpatient,ok so this is advice for how to survive these places. they are helpful but in a weird way but it sucks and its traumatizing. but its very isolated and weirdly desensitized so in there you arent effecting anyone you have personal attachments to. so first official tip just make it to your release date and you will be just fine. next a lot of people coming in to these places may have drug issues or self harm. when i was in the ones i went to i was too. and i was put in a terrible place with people on stimulants and benzos along with a very odd amount of persistence and survival methods you will likely turn to snorting cheeked meds drinking hand sanitizer and god knows what else. so go in with at least a little safety net. bring yourself alcohol wipes an extra sock and then a condom if you are afab and havent had any surgeries or anything like that then this can work for transportation but the condom has other uses too. not for sex. please dont have sex oh my god. just jerk off or something everyone there is fighting literal demons. you do not want to end up in bed with them i know that sounds stupid but two people going through a mental health mess will have a very weird and toxic dynamic. i should also say that people are going to be judgmental. they are judging themselves so they are also projecting it. so i just dont think you should form attachments or like preconceptions. you should talk to them though it will really help to hear about someones life the closest you ever can. it makes you feel less alone. and its incredible to know youve seen these people be horrible and they the same for you and you will never see each other again and they know the most and least about you.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 16:33:10 UTC,2,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j7b4sy,i spent years in love with my grandma,three years ago i met a girl online and we hit it off instantly. we texted every single day flirted shamelessly and honestly? it was one of the best connections ive ever had. we never did video calls though so neither of us knew what the other looked like. were both introverts so it never crossed our minds to facetime weird i know but thats introvert life for you. despite that we developed a crush on each other but we decided to remain flirty friends who sometimes roleplay sexy things because were both not relationship people and and longdistance relationships are a hard pass for us. so we just kept texting and gaming together. since i didnt know how she looks like my brain started creating an idealized version of her and i imagined her like this alluring confident intense and mysterious femme fatale. one day this girl disappeared without saying anything. poof gone she deactivated all her gaming socials. she was always quite depressive so my mind started to jump to the worst conclusions i was very worried. and i endlessly tried looking for her everywhere but i only knew her name and country so i got nowhere. i eventually gave up looking for her but she always remained haunting me in the back of my mind because of the way she had disappeared and the fact that i didnt know what happened to her. so i kept thinking about her throughout the 2 remaining years replaying our last conversations to look for cues and all of that led me to dead ends. it was frustrating. and it was like a mystery that i needed to solve. alexa play oh whooo is sheee? so one day i decided that enough is enough. i was going to find her and i was going to get my answers even if i have to become the fbi myself. i believe in manifestation and law of attraction so i spent a whole night visualizing me finding her personal socials the socials we had each other added were not personal socials it was gaming socials so i wanted to find either her instagram or facebook. and it worked! next day i went full fbi detective mode. i said the only information i had about her was her name and country so i used those leads and somehow i managed to stumble upon her real full name! i think this was the manifestation and law of attraction at play or some kind of witchcraft i dunno. it turned out that the name she had given me was a fake one but thats understandable so i dont hold it against her. whatever. with her real name in hand i found out where she went to school where she went to college and of course her personal socials. so i opened up her facebook and instagram filled with anticipation because finally i would be able to put a face to the ghost whod haunted me for 2 whole years! and when i laid my eyes on her there she was... the sheer reflection of my grandma when young! no really. like not kind of not a little resemblance i mean copypaste ctrlc ctrlv a perfect genetic duplicate of my grandma in her youth. ...i had spent years chasing this mystery woman only for my brain to go wait a minute is that grandma? i was fucking in love with my grandma! for years! years of mystery longing idealization gone in a second. my attraction to her? instantly killed. biggest turn off of my life. all the sexy things she had ever told me were no longer sexy and i just couldnt picture us physically together anymore... we used to roleplay fear play scenarios and now the fear play turned into fear for a different reason. like instead of im going to hunt you down and devour you being hot now its giving eat your vegetables sweetheart and im just sitting there like noooooo the magic is gone. this is the kind of thing that would send freud into overdrive. tell me how does this make you feel? like screaming freud. it makes me feel like screaming. my brain had built up this intense mysterious alluring figure and then boom! grandma vibes! and i ended up in some kind of weird family reunion yay! this is for real one of the biggest plot twists of my life. i basically turned 3 years of longing into a detective saga with a twist ending and instead of crying im laughing about it. at this point im just happy because i can finally close this chapter but at the same time i feel shallow for losing attraction towards her immediately after seeing her. oh well not everyone can be attracted to their grandma.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 16:21:03 UTC,0,1,0.5,,,0,0
