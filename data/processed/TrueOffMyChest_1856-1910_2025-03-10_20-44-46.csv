1j3bpsl,My wife had an affair when my mum died and blames me for the relationship breakdown,Hi all I 30m started posting some of these incidents in AITAH but it soon became clear that in some of these cases she very clearly is TAH and theres no point in even asking So Ive come here just to list all the effed up things that have happened to me in the final months of 2024 I anticipate this will be very long have fun So for some context In late 2023 my wife and I bought a house and I was spending a lot of time for a couple of months working on the house almost every evening and weekend I could spare During this time my wife started going out with some new friends including this guy J Randomly one evening she looks a bit funny and says to me I dont trust myself around him I hear this my heart sinks a bit but I feel like we have a strong relationship and I tell her I trust you not to do anything stupid just be sensible about what time and how you spend time with him She liked this and we moved on but I decided to keep an eye on the situation She started spending more and more time with him and these new friends going out and getting drunk while I was working late on the house It was starting to make me uncomfortable and eventually I said so I didnt ask for anything I just expressed my feelings She said she understood but theyre just friends and theres nothing to be worried about They keep hanging out until one day his partner a woman married to another man forbade him from speaking to my wife because she was jealous So he ghosted my wife and she got really upset It hurt me to see how upset she was for two reasons 1 My wife is upset thats upsetting 2 Shes so upset it feels weird and shes acting like a breakup She asked me to proof read a message she wanted to send and I read a bit and had to put it down I said this is a breakup message I refuse to do this She remained adamant they were just friends and nothing more I accused her of having an emotional affair again she denied it and was adamant they were just friends and that I need to get over this Some weeks later J comes back on the scene having broken up with his previous gf My wife says shes going to talk to him but be very boundaried I tell her that Im uncomfortable with all of this if shes going to see him she should be careful A week or two later she comes stumbling in at 5am I ask where shes been and she explains that she has been out with J went back to his place at around 2am and they played guitar I was hurt and upset this was the antithesis of everything we discussed I said you cant do that to which my wife took great offense accusing me of controlling her and being misogynistic To be clear I never forbade her from seeing him I never tried to tell her what to do beyond please be careful and dont do anything silly and please respect me That time I said you cant do that was the first and only time I specifically said what she could and couldnt do And to me its obvious I wasnt controlling her I was just not saying the quiet part out loud which is you cant do that unless you want to ruin our relationship She is adamant nothing happened and weirdly I believe her The issue for me is that she did the opposite of what we both agreed she disrespected me and my feelings and she is putting our relationship in jeopardy To her the issue is that I tried to control her by being upset and that Im putting restrictions on her She pointed out shes a grown ass woman and she can spend time with her friends if she wants to My being upset about it is a mode of control and I need to stop In principle I have no problem with her seeing her friends but this guy makes me uncomfortable So that all happened we were on the rocks she is clearly having an emotional affair at the very least but adamantly refuses to acknowledge it Im trying desperately to find a way to move forward and recover our relationship if we can Then October 2024 My mum died suddenly I wont go too much into it but it happened very sudden shocking it sucks My dad died when I was young so a lonely time as well This is where my wifes behaviour started to seriously turn Im going to list the major events as I remember them in the order they happened I will also try to list areas where I was less than perfect but to be perfectly honest I dont think there are many Like really I have to keep checking myself surely it wasnt all so one sided surely I contributed meaningfully to this Just doesnt seem to be the case Anyway here goes The day after my mum died we are at the pub with a friend we are talking about it all My friend asks my wife how shes doing and she says Im worried everyone is going to forget that my mum died For context her mum passed away 34 years ago from a long contracted period of illness It spanned over COVID and lock down I lived in their house with them over all of lockdown and helped look after her mum watching her die and taking care of her for over a year My wife had been dealing with this tragic and difficult loss for some time so I had some sympathy to her reaction But bottom line its a shitty thing to say to your partner who lost their mum one day ago that youre concerned youre not going to get as much attention any more That my loss will overshadow hers It speaks volumes and sets up what is to come A day later she says shes going to go and see this J guy I mentioned above The one Im really uncomfortable with I made it very clear that I am uncomfortable with this and now is not the time to be testing me like this I know hes just your friend and theres nothing actually happening Im an idiot but this does upset me and I dont need to deal with this right now Id appreciate it if she didnt go She said she understood but not to worry this is the last time shes going to see him really Their relationship has petered out more or less so it will just be the occasional coffee which is all shes going for Oh and they had plans to go see a jazz band in a few weeks time but shell cancel that on account of the funeral Shes barely going to see him so dont worry I said it was fine I saw it as if shes being truthful then I can accept the cost of one more uncomfortable period if the payoff is they really do just leave each other alone for a while She went and came back a couple hours later no big deal So the following week we had a spa trip booked I bought it for her for Christmas We decided to still go in spite of everything because why not I need it It was great Had a lovely time reconnected I was able to relax and destress a bit But on the last day were in a hot tub together sharing a cocktail and shes on her phone Shes messaging J and arranging to meet the next day I took offense and said I thought you werent seeing eachother any more Its just to study Im falling behind on my thesis So the next day she gets up early and leaves we agree shell be back at lunch Im very unhappy about all of this and just basically sulk all morning I leave my phone upstairs and try to get on with my day as best I can waiting for her to come home and talk about it 3pm comes and goes I take a nap 5PM comes and goes I check my phone a couple messages and a couple missed calls Apparently she decided to stay out for lunch and asked if it was ok When I didnt reply she decided to stay out for dinner and drinks too She didnt get home until after I went to bed I spent the whole evening feeling miserable and hurt I dont need this She comes home and I confront her asking if she thought any of that was ok Turns out its all my fault because I didnt reply to her and my lack of immediate response was me emotionally blackmailing her to come home It really wasnt I just didnt want to have my phone on me and was expecting her to be home at the agreed time Maybe a little silly and selfish in my part Maybe But Im grieving and shes already pushed my boundaries I needed some alone time to deal with it I had no idea I was emotionally blackmailing her So anyway she stays out all day with the person that makes me uncomfortable days after my mum died days after she promised she wouldnt and Im the asshole for not keeping my phone on me in case she decided to change her mind Great A week goes by and its the day before were due to leave for my home town ready for the funeral in a few days She asks me if we can hold off going for one extra day so she can go to this jazz thing with J I say wtf you said that wasnt happening Thats why you saw him earlier because you werent doing this She says she knows but she really wants to go I confront her and say I really dont feel like Im your top priority No youre not my top priority Please elaborate Well I just dont see it as a hierarchy Everyones in a circle around me and youre all equal priority You J etc Right but Im your husband and my mum just died Does that not put me ahead of anyone else No Looking dead in my eyes No Fine Go to your jazz thing idgaf She says might as well the damage is already done by me even asking right Yeah The damage is already done I cant believe what she said to me so cold so heartless so unempathetic so selfish Btw this woman is a qualified therapist let that sink in Hope you dont get her as your therapist good lord So she fucks off the next day and I delay my departure for her social plans I contemplated going down without her but the ensuing drama and questions from family would not be worth it It was my mums funeral after all not my marriages The funeral goes fine the week is fine She doesnt say or do anything shitty I focus on the funeral and family and everything and mostly not think about the fireball train wreck that is now my marriage On the drive home my wife decides to tell me that she thinks her ex boyfriend from school days is the one that got away Im dumbfounded because 1 What a thing to fucking say as I drive us home from burying my mother 2 Its just patently untrue So completely ludicrous that Im not even bothered by the notion that she might be serious It is at this point that it dawns on me that she may be hurting me on purpose The next day we are having coffee and she says to me I never wanted this house I never wanted this dog and I dont want kids Lets be clear I did not push her to get the house or the dog If anything she pushed for both of them but it was pretty mutual She is now tearing up the entire foundation of our marriage She is lighting fire to the entire future plans we had The house and dog that I poured my heart and soul into for her for us She never wanted apparently Just brutal Savage She acted shocked when I started crying I didnt expect it to upset you this much Incredible The next day I go to my friends place and just cry on her for hours I am in a complete state Its all too much overwhelming awful and just confusing Why is she being so mean I wondered if she hated me then I thought maybe shes trying to get me to break up with her Shes clearly having an affair of some variety My mum just died Maybe she just doesnt want to be the person to break up with their partner when their mum died Especially a partner who cared for her dying mother And especially because she was having an affair Shed be seen as such an asshole so rather than just admitting everything and being an asshole she decided to torture me until I pulled the plug myself Not her fault then is it Anyway that thought occurred to me But Im in no state to decide the fate of my marriage Im grieving Im distraught Im reeling from the various harrowing incidents listed above Barely enough time to process one before another comes along It may seem obvious to you and me now but at the time I just couldnt see clearly what was happening or exactly why My friend gave me some advice that I didnt need to decide anything right now that settled me Took some pressure off At around this point my perception of time gets a bit funny Mixture of grief and brain fuckery So now Im pissed at her I dont trust her I feel badly hurt She says shes going out with J again I say I dont care Resigned to this shitty behaviour unable to reason with her unable to discuss it unable to make the call and leave She comes back at 4 in the morning high AF they had taken MDMA together The oxytocin drug Under the influence of this drug he confessed his feelings for her She was totally shocked by this and said it was all a little uncomfortable Ok I said Whatever The next day were driving somewhere and I really cant remember what she said but it just set me off I think it was something along the lines of I dont know why youre so upset with me I was furious I was worn down I was mistreated For the first time I raised my voice I was shouting at her Listing all of these shitty instances that were cutting me up whilst I grieved I raised my hand clenched my fist and brought it down on the steering wheel in anger It made a dull bang noise This was the start of a new narrative from my wife The scary aggressive husband narrative The perfect excuse in her eyes to leave me without raising questions about her betrayal and complete lack of empathy Youre scary she said I was cowering in the passenger seat she said Youre just like my aggressive father she said I tried defending myself but please remember I was in a complete mess mentally and emotionally I started to believe her Maybe I did lose control maybe I am one of those guys Maybe I threatened her I thought that yes it was an outburst but no it wasnt threatening Im not a big scary person Im just a human being that has been deeply hurt and wounded when theyre at their most vulnerable But maybe thats not a good enough excuse Maybe I crossed a line She sowed the seeds of doubt in my vulnerable mind I started doubting my memory of events did I black out for a moment and do something really scary She told me that I was potentially abusive To be clear shes not accusing me of being abusive shes accusing me of maybe becoming abusive in the future And she cant take that risk Im not safe to have children with you know the children she said she didnt want before I ever shouted I believed her What a monster I was How could I be so terrible I never thought I was like this No wonder she was having an affair for the last several weeks I shouted at her and hit my hand on the steering wheel in frustration She lent into it but not too far She was manipulating me telling me its ok You just need to go to therapy and sort yourself out As long as Im going along with her narrative shes all ok my side If I ever doubt her Im terrible and hurtful and potentially abusive She decided it was time to end things she had the get out of jail free card she wanted She didnt leave me for another man and emotionally abused me when my mum died she saved herself from an potentially abusive relationship My greatest crime was hitting a steering wheel One of the last things she said to me She spoke with a friend of hers who had broken up with her partner of 8 years had two wild years and then they got back together for several years I asked what she meant by wild years just connecting with lots of people So she turns to me and says I think were a lot like them you know I wanted to say I bet she didnt abuse her partner I bet she didnt hurt him when his mum died I bet she didnt manipulate him into believing he was abusive And the sheer audacity of sitting there and looking to me to approve of her fucking a bunch of people for two years before I take her back I said nothing she nudged me Desperate for me to implicitly condone her actions and behaviours by giving even the slightest inkling that I might take her back when shes done fucking around I turned away and left I was done Not two days after our official break up she declared herself in a relationship with J But to her family she accused me of being aggressive and scary and forcing her to leave She denies having had an affair pretending that her and J are not an item She goes to my friends and asks them to meet her new partner J Again implicitly asking them to condone her actions by meeting this J guy My friends all refuse and begin to cut contact with her Theyve seen what shes done They knew what she was doing to me before I did They wont tolerate her BS I love my friends My wifes sister knows everything she heard it all from my wifes point of view and STILL she took my side Then she heard what I had to say boy was she pissed She told her whole family the truth my wife tried to convince them that her sister was a liar That she didnt understand Shes pregnant btw My wife just tried to turn her family against her pregnant younger sister In her attempts to not be seen as a terrible heartless B that would abandon her husband when he needed her most she turned herself into an even worse monster An abuser according to some A liar a manipulated a nasty piece of work Sometimes you meet your destiny on the path to avoid it Im 2 months free I dont want to let another human being close to me like that again but maybe that will change with time My therapist and my wifes sister whos also a qualified therapist both said that she has been emotionally abusive to me Coercive controlling behaviour I dont know about that but I know Ive been treated unfairly Thanks for reading this far I hope it was entertaining X,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04

1j3bnhi,Realised my family dont respect me now Im heartbroken and dont know what to do,Hello Reddit long time reader but finally posting for the first time so please be kind also this is on mobile so Im sorry if my grammar and format arent very good Trigger Warning as this might be a hard read for some and contains talk of abuse My 29 life story isnt a happy one lots of loss abuse and loneliness Abit of background Im the middle of 3 kids an older sister and a younger brother were all close in age and didnt get along at all as kids but did become closer as we got older or so I thought My Dad died when I was young and this had a massive negative impact on my family but especially my mum who became a partially functional alcoholic with lots of mental health issues which she has never gone to or considered therapy for She also has dated alot of abusive and weird partners over the years so I grew up in a violent and toxic environment she has not had a successful long term relationship since my Dads death I am autistic and have afew mental health problems myself but I have been in and out of therapy for a long time and have done alot of work to try to better myself and work on my flaws I have chronic illnesses and chronic pain from degenerative issues which make day to day living hard I dont want to sound all woe is me but unfortunately this is just me being honest about whats happened and still happening to me I absolutely LOVE animals I have grown up around all sort of animalspets and honestly I love them more than people they love unconditionally and my soul pet was there throughout all Ive suffered in life always there to love and comfort me in my time of need Ive never felt more loved in my life than the love I felt from them and Ill always cherish my 10 years with them They unfortunately passed away 2 years ago and I still struggle with the loss today Ive lost a fair few animals over the years and grief is nothing new to me but its never any less painful each time I was bullied relentlessly through out my educational years and even in the workplace Im abit different and maybe a lil weird but I will never understand why Ive been bullied the way I have I always try to be kind and caring to people and will always have someones back but sadly its never reciprocated and I have faced my bullies alone All this and I still strive to be a good and kind person as for me kindness is my default and I never want to or intend to hurt anyone Thanks to all the bullying I have alot of selfesteem and self worth issues that I deal with but will always try and make others feel good about themselves Ive suffered through multiple physically and emotionally abusive relationships in my life Im not perfect but have never treated any of my partners the way I have been treated Ive been put down called names financially abused hit and raped by past partners and was sexually assaulted by a family friend Ive never received any justice for whats happened to me and sadly theyve all gotten away with it My mum has been abusive to me and my sister growing up shes the typical toxic narcissistic gaslighting and body shaming mother who hates all but one of her kids my EDs started primarily thanks to her and her fatphobia which has inflicted lasting damage on me and my siblings Shes hit me verbally abused me and been physically violent to me from ages 8 upwards she never acknowledges her actions and has literally never said sorry or apologized to me EVER Its almost like she is physically incapable of saying sorry to me specifically Shes thrown me out the house multiple times and gaslights herself into saying that I moved out which just isnt true the last straw was throwing me out with nowhere to go and I had to figure out everything on my own Ive lived independently ever since and even when Ive been homeless theres no way Id ever put myself through living with her ever again I am Queer and Trans she has not shown any respect for my identity or just me as a person Ive been out as trans for 4 years and it was pretty obvious in my teen years that I was not comfortable with my assigned birth gender Shes not homophobic but is not supportive of trans identities at all and has been very open about her lack of respect for it which has been devastating to my identity and my mental health Ive done so much to help her and financially support her over the years and thanks to therapy Ive realized how bad it is and have cut her out my life for good My sister has 2 kids I absolutely adore them and would do anything for them their dad has been in and out of their lives so I have helped alot with raising them and I love them like theyre my own I do NOT want children myself I thought I did growing up but as Ive gotten older Ive realised that I would not be a good parent and would not want to bring children into the world with a parent thats messed up no child deserves that I moved away from my home town about 4 years ago to get away from the small town racism and homophobia it was not possible for me to be who I am in that place and have been happier where I live now Unfortunately this has had a negative impact on my relationship with my siblings they make minimal to 0 effort to see me and its always me travelling to them and considering Im disabled and they arent seems abit unfair to me I am very different from them and have different beliefs than them too this has put a strain on our relationships our political beliefs are not the same and sadly theyre quite closed minded and disrespectful towards foreign womens and transqueer rights They say the apple doesnt fall far from the tree but I fell and rolled off a cliff away from them and their beliefs So now Im faced with a dilemma back away and barely or never see my sisters kids again allowing them to be raised in this environment or sit and allow my family to continue to disrespect me my identity and my beliefs Its heartbreaking cus I have just 1 friend who understands loves and respects me I have no one else and spending most of my life being and feeling alone is taking its toll I try so hard to make friends and find partners but I always end up alone Feeling alienated from my family is awful as family means so much to me but I clearly dont matter to them in the same way Sorry this was long but I just needed to scream something into the internet void about how I feel as I cant talk to my family about things as it just causes arguments Thank you for reading,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 14:12:26 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j3b9mq,My friend of college is annoying,In august from last year i started college i made some friends in the week before classes began and then when we got our classroom that group split and so me and another girl that was part of the original friend group made another friend group in the classroom everything was fine until we finish that semester and the group split again ik i stop talking to this girl for some reasons and the only one in the group that was left was a guy the think is he has becoming extremely annoying as the days pass by weve been in the new semester only 3 weeks and i cant stand it anymore he makes always the same jokes that are not even funny Im a lesbian and he used to joke a lot about my sexuality which it doesnt affect me its just boring now and makes a lot of inappropriate comments a lot of the time not sexual just attacking some minorities which i dont think is funny i will never cut him off bc as i said before its the only one friend that i have in college and its already been rough for me but i seriously think sometimes Ill be better alone yesterday i didnt laugh at his jokes which i usually do for compromise and he told me that i was acting weird which i was and it always has to become a topic and some days he just sends really long messages about how my friendship its been so good to him and i legitimately feel bad bc I dont feel the same hes just a person that i happened to know he also cant stop talking and has said that to me many times and its really exhausting for me bc i hate speaking all day and this only ends with my social battery in like the first 2 hours of the day however i will never say anything to him bc i think he will make it a whole thing and after everything that the group has been through its the last think i need but Im just so tired,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 13:54:09 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j3b7oq,I 35F think I have to distance myself from my best friend and Im heartbroken over it,This happened over the passed weekend and I feel like Im digging myself out of a ditch I didnt even realize I was in It started with a lunch date with my best friend just gonna use BFF because I cant be 100 sure she doesnt use reddit and one of her daughters She had promised a lunch date to me for my birthday last month but between her kids getting sick and then her and her husband getting sick we had to push the date back a while I had no problem with that since myself and my husband have been putting out fires figuratively were governmentfederal workers at work with all the latest shenanigans happening in the government The lunch date started out great getting hugs from them her daughter saying that she misses myself and my husband their kids call us aunt and uncle and catching up with how their household is doing Just before this lunch date my BFF asked me to talk to her second oldest about possibly getting a job at where I work as he had a phone interview and was super nervous about what to sayask Now the kid is 19 so obviously he wont start off anywhere high up and he would have to wait for a security clearance background check to go through anyways but I gave him all the information I could about the culture down in the shipyard where he would be working and what he should ask and what he should steer clear from in his answers My BFF knows I started in the shipyard as a janitor and knows that I had a great reputation around everyone I worked with so my name carries a little bit of weight as a hard worker down there Context before his interview My BFF admitted to not knowing how to help her son out because she had been out of the workforce as a stay at home mom for nearly 20 years So she didnt know how to prep him for his first formal interview Hence why she called me But at the lunch date the first thing she says about the interview is that she was trying to answer the questions for her son because she was standing right next to him And then made it a point to tell the interviewer that she was well informed of the interview process because she interviews people in real estate now I was caught off guard by this sudden admission from her and just kinda stared at her knowing full well that she just speared her sons chances of getting into the company But I didnt want to say anything negative about her or her process in front of her daughter so I bit my lip and said that hopefully hell get a call back Then we met up at their house over the weekend for drinks and a late dinner because BFFs husband has been saying he wants to hang out with my husband And it dawned on my husband and myself that no matter what we said to them they would never actually listen to us Once the kids scattered to their rooms and play areas my husband brought up the fact that hes stressed about losing his new job with the federal government because of the probationary period hes still in Hes a manager and has been working long days to overhaul his department and get them back up to code and has been getting praises from way higher up people and has been invited to DC to speak about the changes that have to occur But from their reactions you would think he was a toddler coming up to our best friends with his latest Macaroni noodle art The two of them just gave a sympathetic grunt and BFFs husband just said Yeah sucks for you dude And then proceeded to say how he was so busy with his job that he couldnt work his side gig in real estate any more on the clock And the worst offender was when my husband was talking about a certain email he had to respond to that everyone in the government has been criticizing Because the individual asking for the information is not read into any of the programs and therefore cannot ask for the information that he wants to see And all BFFs husband could say was Well he has a security clearance with NASA or something like that so he can ask for it Full Blown Brainwashed We left the house after finishing up the movie we were watching and as soon as we got in the car we lost it Security clearances do not work like that Need to Know does not work like that and sharing sensitive information DOES NOT WORK LIKE THAT The scariest part for us is that BFFs husband knows this because hes also federal The passed few days this was all my husband and myself could talk about how we werent taken seriously how theyve never listened to us and how we have made excuses for them the entire time My husband has been involved with the federal government for longer than BFFs husband has been but because Im the youngest of the group they think that he is too Hes 45 And that above it all we were faced with the only outcome of distancing ourselves from our friends or who we thought were our friends And what is killing me the most is that we are invested in their kids lives too My husband has tried to help the 2 oldest to try and get them into safeish positions in the military hes a veteran and has a lot of connections but they didnt take it I have tried to give advice to the daughters about relationships but was ridiculed by BFFs husband for meddling in their lives We have tried so hard to help but have never been heard So when BFF and her husband would vent to us about these issues we just tried to help them with we stayed silent Because they didnt want solutions from us clearly Im just so gutted that now all I can do is look back at all my interactions with her and suddenly see them for what they were Anytime I made a new dessert that her husband and kids loved she had to make it next time and tell me not to make or bring anything cuz The kids werent crazy about that dessert and probably wouldnt eat it When she was suddenly getting botox lip injections and getting her arms and legs done after I had my own surgery to fix the muscles in my stomach she would say Ill give you my botox doctor and he can add to your lips and get rid of your forehead scar I do have a large scar on my forehead from chicken pox and poison ivy as a 7 year old but Ive learned to embrace it and love it after years of bullying for it Then recently with the job interview questions for her son why is what I am and good at a threat to her I just feel lost and sick when I think about this stuff and hate that after 5 some years of friendship myself and my husband no longer have best friends,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 13:51:31 UTC,2,3,0.67,,,0,0

just kept growing What started as a laidback trustworthy workplace with great pay eventually expanded into multiple buildings and became the towns biggest employer Then after a major buyout billions of dollars started flowing through and everything changed Now you cant step into one of the two gas stations or small handful of stores without seeing someone wearing the company shirt they hand out But when outside corporate interests took over they started bringing in their own people handing out management positions to friends and running the place like a private club And once a company gets big enough in a small town theres no accountability What used to be a solid job turned into something straight out of an HBO drama The usual corporate nonsense got worsefudging time cards sexism favoritism and adjusting drug test results after major accidents But it doesnt stop there Were talking covering up assaults extreme drug use highranking executives not saying how high just in case cheating and keeping mistresses in plain sight in the giant glass HR building and fullblown criminal activity One of the companys truck drivers had a history of drinking on the job and multiple DUIs One day he drank before his shift and ended up ending a motorcyclist After what I can only assume was a ton of money changing hands it was swept under the rug No company name in the news just one vague article about a truck driver In a town this size that should have been the biggest headline of the year Instead Nothing When you work here long enough you start to feel like they could make you disappear if you did something they didnt like Im not some highranking executiveIm just a few steps above entrylevel still working on the factory floor But over time Ive pieced things togetherbetween constantly signing paperwork agreeing to their policies overhearing the right conversations and befriending a supervisor who introduced me to a highranking corporate employee who was a little too trusting with their secrets I still consider these people friends but the work environment is toxic and after enough time it starts to mess with your sanity We work 12hour shifts and if you think workplace screaming matches are rare try several a night The corporate systems they claim improve production dont actually work which throws everything into chaos Meanwhile the building managerwhos supposed to oversee operations regularly sleeps for half the shift hides in a janitors closet and watches movies But if we stray from their broken systems Its not pretty You can get written up for not wearing gloves while using a tape measure and speaking up about only getting one 10minute break in a 12hour shift is a quick way to get fired no questions asked And before you ask Why dont you just leavewell the pay was really good then and its REALLY good now and in a small town with almost no other highpaying jobs thats not an easy decision I want to highlight two specific incidents that really set the tone for what kind of company this is I have plenty more stories Id be willing to share if anyone is interested First not long ago an employeewho to be fair was very good at their jobhad a serious problem with anger and violent outbursts Whether there was something personal going on I dont know but theres no excuse for the level they took it to Were talking constant verbal abuse to all of his peers throwing heavy and sharp objects and even threatening to end multiple coworkerswhile openly keeping a weapon in his vehicle The companys solution Slap a No weapons sticker on the door and call it a day One time during a rage fit over a production issue he threw a metal holder containing a sharp industrial blade It hit a coworkerfortunately the injury wasnt severe but it was serious enough that it should have led to real consequences Instead behind closed doors the injured employee was convinced to stay quiet promised that action would be taken Nothing happened That same injured employee weeks later asked for a break after eight hours of nonstop hard labor and hinted that he might speak up about what had happened to him if he didnt at least get a few minutes to eat The next day He was fired The guy who threw the blade Still works here no consequences And the man who was fired One of the hardestworking most respectable guys Ive ever met This one really gets to me Now lets talk about one of the biggest food specific product not named companies in the country My company is pretty much the sole provider of all product for them and theres a strict rule in place a specific banned chemical cannot be used in any productionnot just in their products but in any product we run period To keep the contract we get frequent audits When that happens A fullscale coverup goes into motion That banned chemical is hidden on the highest warehouse shelves fake labels are created and paperwork mentioning it is thrown out and replaced after Employees in charge of this are explicitly told to make sure nothing with the chemicals name is left visible If this information ever got out I can guarantee that contract would be terminated immediately The deeper you go in corporate manufacturing the more you realizeethics are a PR stunt safety is a technicality and coverups are just business as usual Sorry for the long read but if you made it this far I seriously appreciate it Just had to get some of this off my chest,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 13:29:34 UTC,640,43,0.98,,,0,0
1j3ahkl,Being a teacher makes me hate everything,Im a teacherlibrarian at an elementary school in my tenth year and it has become increasingly apparent that this is not the job for me Despite not wanting to be another statistic in the world of education I need to get out before I completely lose it Reading and libraries used to be my life I would spend countless hours reading books and browsing through the stacks in libraries Whenever I traveled my first stop was always the library Growing up no one ever doubted that Id become a librarian Life took some twists and turns along the way but I finally finally made it back to the libraries I love Now I fucking HATE IT Along with anything else that used to give me joy in life I used to love to go hiking shopping working out just be out and about for no reason at all but now all I do is crawl into bed and sleep until the next morning And calling it sleep is very generous Running on about four hours of sleep has become standard and dont think that the lack of sleep contributing to my overall feelings about life has gone over my head Problem is that nightmares about going back to work wake me up and fretting over the students for several hours after makes sleep a luxury for me Im sick of spending the majority of my day managing behaviors Im sick of trying to find engaging lessons for the students to absolutely not be able to handle it Im sick of the constant NOISE the SCREAMING and the VIOLENCE Why is violence the first thing these kids turn to Im sick of these kids leaving the library and the books in pieces acting as though they havent had me since kindergarten and know how the library is supposed to be kept Im sick of the students acting like its their first goddamn day on Earth Im sick of hearing the phrase Im sorry and just watching them do it again five minutes later I told one girl that her apology had less meaning than a pigs fart and I dont even feel bad saying that Im sick of their entitlement and how they think they deserve to take every piece of me without giving a modicum of respect in return Im sick of getting excited and emotional over a book I bought the students thinking that theyll like it just for them to roll their eyes Its like these kids have only two settings mean little bastards or asleep I used to be a creative I used to spend my free time drawing painting knitting and writing Boy how I loved to write I looked at some old Google docs of my stories and I miss that girl the one who could spin worlds out of nothing and create endearing and courageous characters But that girl is dead I couldnt write even if you pointed a gun to my head These goddamn energy sucking vampires disguised as children left me bereft of any emotion willpower or desire to do anything I cant even distract myself in the company of other people The single life has plagued me for over two years and I want to get into dating but Im such a miserable person that I dont think its fair to subject someone to the unpleasant experience of being in my presence I barely want to be in my own company The only other people I occasionally hang out with are other teachers so our primary form of entertainment is drinking and trauma dumping I dont even like reading anymore Reading For a librarian I pick up a book and it reminds me of school a straight up hell and thats enough to turn me off The thought of having to do this for another twenty years drives me to despair Can you believe I used to win teaching awards I used to be a good teacher I dont know where I went wrong Like the only thing that is keeping me here is my dog and shes 13 years old But with a lot of spunk Once shes gone I wont know what to do with myself So like I dont know what my aim is with this The jobs here are pay a fucking joke and I already feel like a failure enough that losing my house will definitely send me over the edge So here I am day after day spending the better part of my life with people I hate,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 13:14:19 UTC,16,16,0.91,,,0,0

she never asked for me to be her mother I told myself I would push through and hope for a better future I despised her Her cries sounded like nails on a chalk board and I would end up crying after taking care of her I still reminded myself she never asked for me to be her mother I had to push through My post partum depression progressed I never got treatment because of fear I feared she would be taken away from me because of how we were living Section 8 a messy house not having enough food for both of us I always gave her my meals what little there was I went from 150 to 114 in a very short amount of time I was hungry tired overwhelmed but she never asked for me to be her mother Her father came back into our lives when she was around 14 months It felt like my saving grace Maybe we could be a little family and have a home full of love and laughter He was a drunk I was still alone with my daughter and now I had the heavy burden of having someone in my house that could help but chose not to 2 months later I fell pregnant again I was horrified when I found out I couldnt restart everything again I kept her because of a previous miscarriage I felt it wasnt right for me to be ungrateful I had a rough pregnancy I was very depressed and had a turbulent relationship He left me constantly during my pregnancy He said cruel things It only got worse when I had to go on maternity leave I was called lazy and a bad mother for not working up until I gave birth My daughter was born 10lbs 1oz I was exhausted and I hurt severely My second daughter was born and everything was so easy I connected with her immediately She was such a happy baby She never cried just to cry She only cried when she needed something When I took care of her needs there was no crying She was happy and content at such a young age I realized this is what motherhood was supposed to feel like It wasnt supposed to feel like a burden I wasnt supposed to secretly despise my child I wasnt supposed to be angry at a helpless newborn Havjng my second really changed me I was so much more nice to my first I still found her annoying most of the time but I felt I loved her for the first time It was short lived unfortunately The post partum depression returned when my youngest was 78 months She was still the apple of my eye but I turned my hatred to my oldest again That was the moment I realized I needed to consider adoption How could a mother hate her child As the months went on I found myself not giving affection towards her I would ignore her tantrums and yell at her for them I would tell her no when she asked if I could hold her I stopped kissing her forehead or cheeks She wasnt an easy child since birth but it got so much worse as she aged I laid in bed next to her and admitted to myself I hate my own child I hated her as I would hate a person who has done wrong by me for years The night finally came I had enough I had been trying to put her to bed for an hour Hearing screaming being kicked having my hair pulled I snapped I pinched her Hard Multiple times until she fell asleep Then once more after she fell asleep The same punishment my mother would do to me I was turning into my mother The person I promised myself I would never be like I had the most rude awakening that night and cried for hours after she went to bed I took her to the CPS office the following morning and told them I couldnt be her mother anymore That was all I said I left her in the waiting room I didnt hug her I didnt kiss her I just left It ate at me for years and still does I was the only person she knew in her life I knew her finding a loving family was better than having a mother like me I moved a few states away 2 days after I didnt want to be found I didnt want any possibility of them trying to return her to me because I knew I did this for her own good It was the only genuine loving gesture I had to offer her since she was born They never reached out or tried to find me as far as I knew I still carry the guilt and shame I still cry for her How confused and scared she must have been to never see her mother again Why couldnt I be the mother she deserved 2 12 years of thinking the bare minimum was the most love she would ever receive Im glad I gave her up Not for me but for her I searched through multiple schools near my old town a few days ago I found her I took the information I had and found her as well as her adoptive family on Facebook She has an amazing life She looks radiant in every picture I found of her Shes absolutely gorgeous I know I couldnt have given her that life I hope this was a selfless act not selfish I hope she doesnt remember me I married and had one more daughter Im so in love with my 2 other children which brings a perpetual guilt to my life I wish I couldve been her mother I still mourn her I havent allowed myself to feel negatively about giving her up only for the way I treated her It was for her She never asked to have a mother like me so I gave her to a mother that could love her the way she deserved,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 06:48:08 UTC,58,144,0.59,,,0,0

1j33mak,My marriage ended after 25 yrs,Im doing this on my phone so excuse the formatting And also excuse the rambling Upto 2023 my marriage was on good footing But then my physical and mental health took a nose dive I lost interest in sex and I couldnt explain why to my husband because I didnt know why My migraines were coming at 67 a week yes almost daily and lasting 612 hrs long and I was having issues with bleeding most of the time I have several other medical obstacles and I am considered disabled by social security I closed off thinking my husband didnt want to hear about my petty complaints Housework became his responsibility as well as cooking dinner on top of working full time I cant work due to my physical and mental health He was overwhelmed and asked if I could cook dinners again I did for about two weeks and then I couldnt because my migraines were making it hard to smell food let alone eating it My day basically was laying in bed all day listening to audiobooks to try to get my mind off the pain of the migraines Then at the end of May I had a needle biopsy of my thyroid come back abnormal most likely cancerous and that made me spiral more Thats when I got a text from an angry husband telling me that my husband was seeing his wife This happened within a few days of finding out I needed to get my thyroid out It was not a good week to say the least I immediately confronted my husband with the text and he confessed it true I thought it was only an emotional affair but he said it became physical back in April when he went on a Writers retreat with several people or so I thought It turns out it was just her and my husband I completely lost it and was sobbing in his arms This was not his first affair I asked him to break it off and go into counseling with me but he said no He cared for her and didnt want to lose or hurt her This was a major blow to me I had been seeing a therapist for a while but she retired So a week before I found out about my thyroid I started seeing a new counselor On my second appointment with her was a mess I told my counselor about my thyroid and of my husband cheating We had just celebrated our 25th anniversary before I had found out I started having suicidal thoughts and told her about them I even had a plan to carry out the suicide involving ODing on one of my meds She urged me to get a lockbox for that med and give the keys to my husband He still loves me but was not in love with me anymore He our 15 yr old son and I talked about the drug issue and it was decided for my safety that either my son or my husband would portion out the days worth of med about an hour before I was due to take it We didnt tell our son the exact reason why it needed to be controlled because we didnt want to alarm him I was spiraling down fast at this point I stopped going to my water aerobics class and became a recluse I didnt want to see anyone It was hard for me to focus on conversation so I lost interest in talking at all I was seeing my counselor weekly and my prescriber of my antidepressants and antipsychotics monthly That time is somewhat fuzzy in my head August comes around and they took out half my thyroid Turns out I had Medullary thyroid cancer in that half So they needed to remove the entire thyroid the other half was taken out in October That side was clean thank goodness They had caught it before it could spread outside my thyroid My husband started driving to see his AP on a biweekly basis We didnt tell anyone not even our son for a while We tried to keep things normalish as to not upset him My husband and I decided to remain friends at least and he wanted a divorce We broke the news to our son in December about us splitting up but he was the only one to know My parents arent the most forgiving people so we wanted to keep the news from them for as long as possible My relationship with my father is rocky at best My counselor and I were talking on a weekly basis at this point trying to reason with me that killing myself isnt the answer I knew I didnt want to die because of our son but that was the only reason I could even rely on Everything was just falling apart around me My husband moved out of our bedroom in December so I was sleeping alone And crying myself to sleep almost every night We would talk about his day in general and about our son but that was about it When my depression would spike and I was feeling very suicidal at one point I tried to find the key to the medicine safe he would talk me down I still dont know if that was a good thing or bad thing AP lives 8 hours from us So every other weekend he would drive to see her she filed for divorce a week before they met IRL in April and in her state you have to be physically separated for a year before the divorce is finalized her ex is an a and kept harassing me and my husband So a year after I found out May 24 my husband says he wants to move in with AP so he needs to get a job there I tell him I cannot stand to stay living in our townhouse as it has too many memories He suggested I look for another apartment that our son and I can live in after he moves We did just that He started working his new job the week after we moved to a flat July24 just before we moved we had to put down one of our cats she was fading and we didnt think shed survive the move plus she couldnt walk or use the litter box on her own Moving seemed to help my mental state Im not having as many panic attacks or psychosiss hearing voices that arent there Im able to do some of the housework myself cooking vacuuming keeping the kitchen wiped down my bedroom and my bathroom Our son now 16 does his own room his bathroom the dishes the trash and the kitty stuff like feed the cat and keep the litter clean We are currently working on a dissolution on our marriage Since we dont have much just a car really and our son there isnt too much to split We are on the same page about spousal and child support in the state I live in if youre married more than 25 yrs I get 30 of his income for the rest of our lives or until I marry again and child support until our son is 18 Our son and I get to see my stbx every 34 weeks for a weekend Its painful to be separated from him but it also hurts to see him I know I failed persevering_face and its mostly my fault our marriage ended Its been like this for about 6 months He wants me to start seeing other people but after the 2nd betrayal of trust by him I dont know if I can trust anyone anymore And I need trust to get close to someone else Thanks for listening Edit thank you all for your kind words A lot of them made me cry,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 05:23:01 UTC,353,89,0.95,,,0,0

making sure that me and my siblings are living comfortably Due to my upbringing being quite positive and never having felt impoverished I always thought of myself as normal and at times even rich It was only during the past few years of maturity that I realised that my parents truly kept the family afloat While I always wanted to give back to my family I was assumed to become the poorest among my siblings We say this in jest so it was totally fine My siblings were the businesstypes and theyve saved up enough money to be far richer than me while I am still doing my PhD hence underpaid Due to my academic degrees Ive travelled quite a lot especially within Europe travel between countries is super cheap Each country I stepped into I always hoped that I could bring my family with me I never thought that this would be a possibility because my family lives oceans away and again I am a PhD student Fast forward to last year I was scanning through LinkedIn and found an AIrelated job which completely fits my profile I have a unique set of skills from my previous MSc and my current PhD which made me uniquely fit for this job they literally should have just put my name on the job ad lol Due to being related to AI and the unique nature of my specialty the job paid extremely well Additionally it was a completely freelance and remote job I applied and got in and made my way from being a normal worker to becoming one of the heads of the team even getting facetoface with the huge AI companies yes those ones I was paid weekly and within the first week I was able to comfortably buy the latest iPhone and an ok desk setup during the second week I am quite a simple guy who really just wanted a good phone and desk so the next few weeks the money was just gathering in my account Anyway my graduation from my European MSc was coming up it got delayed and I really wanted to bring my parents With no hesitation I invited my parents to the graduation all expenses paid My mother also asked if my siblings can also tag along At this point I did not have enough money for everyone but I said they can come Somehow along the way my siblings also had all their expenses paid by me Haha I worked my ass off while my mother planned the trip We ended up with a planned trip across 6 countries in 3 weeks Honestly I did not expect it to be as intense but I still said yes My mother really wanted to visit those countries And how could I even say no if my mother keeps showing me her planned outfits beret included There isnt enough space to list down all the things we did but here are some of the heartwarming ones gtMy father was never the type to express his emotions well and whenever we used to have our local trips he was mostly unimpressed For the first time I saw him taking photos of a landmark Eiffel Tower and he was quite lovey dovey with my mother especially in Paris They were so cute gtMy siblings and I had extremely deep conversations in Amsterdam About our lives our family How proud we were of each other and also reminiscing some of our childhood memories and that and look where we are now moment We never really talked to each other in such profound ways and I am so glad we had those conversations gtOur last stop was in Amsterdam my family had to take the train to the airport while I had to take the train back to the UK In the most dramatic way we found ourselves on adjacent platforms which meant we were waiting at the same bench for our trains Im fucking crying now Their train was about to arrive on the platform so we said our goodbyes We were not the type to hug so I just awkwardly said good bye to each of them while waving my hand My mother was surprised and asked me for a hug instead imagine her saying it in a stereotypical spoiled brats voice lol We did This was the first hug we had since Ive become an adult damn the onions They went inside the train and kept looking at me I HATED seeing them on the train I did not want them to leave and return to their normal lives back home Tears starting to form on my eyes and I had to look away I know it was truly dramatic And the timing was perfect because their train ran on that instant and mine came to my platform I miss them The work was a short term one so it stopped around mid of last year but it is starting up again I barely had any savings but I have no regrets I wish I can bring them here

1j30kev,I was in the NCA Dalles crisis,Im a cheerleader on a special needs team I will be censoring the names due to privately Where about to go to warm us taking a team picture before we go I was happy at realizing where my spot was as last time I was worried I was in the wrong spot but my coach thought it was ok suddenly a buch of cheerleaders started screaming and running passed us at the time I assumed they way excited to get to warmups and was about to say why there where so happy being confusedamused three things happened however one of the cheer dads shouted at us to run and I realized that not only was EVERYONE running but they where all terrorfied and I realized something was very wrong I panicked I was trying to get in the middle of the crowd hoping to shelter me ran to a secrutly guard I also started to slow down both because I was looking for people on my cheer team and was also in shock Thankfully another team member found me and told me to go with her lets call her 1 she was being really rational so I was following her thought I felt a bit silly since shes a teen We also found three more 2 3 and 4 We where directed to go up to to a place that was more dirty think a warehouse where found our coach she was talking on a phone I never seen her so scared Mind you shes normally a very tough cheer coach she was crying while talking on her phone later found out it was a her dad saying that she had to find someone since she cant run later found out it was another team member who has cerebral palsy and a bad knee They where directing us to go over a this thing its kind of like a cliff inside of a basement if that makes any sense sorry not sure how to get call it where all trying to get coachs attention eventally I gotten louder and touched her arm and told her to over there and we all did with some help down Once where walking we where told to grab hands I grabbed the woman next to me thinking she was a member of my cheer team though she was not she laughed and told me it was fine things gotten calmer was thinking it all over and maybe even as 1 said that it was a misunderstanding and there wasnt any gunfire some people where crying and I told her them it was going to be ok But then people started screaming and running again I also heard what i thought was gunfire sounding like pop pop pop we ran back again I lost the hand of the cheerleader and grabbed 2s hand instead she started crying and saying that she didnt know what was going on I felt really bad for because while where both autistic shes higher support needs then me in my head I was thinking there was an mass shooter in here though I didnt want to tell her that since it would freak her out even more so I didnt say anything she also asked if it was going to be ok and I told her yes to ease her which seemed to help I paniced again and tried to jump over this fence like thing but I wasnt good enough so i gave up and ran way along with some others During the chaos we lost sight of our cheer coach and her assistant coach Also durning all of crisis I had a couple of thoughts in my head admitly I was thinking of want to post to trueoffmychest but I was also wondering on why on earth a mass shooter came and shot up cheerleaders like did he had some vendetta against them I was also thinking maybe it was like 2017 Las Vegas shooting and there was no reason he just wanted to shoot up a place yes I was aware that we just didnt know the motive but that was the shooting that came up I was praying to God that my dad and my other cheermembers where not dead especialy one of them since she was in a wheelchair I didnt know where she was and she couldnt move as fast as 1 in her wheelchair not her fault 1 is just really fast she also couldnt run I felt bad for my dad since I know he was proctive over me and I left my phone with him we wont allowed to take with us for warmups so i thought he was terrofried and upset that he couldnt even contect me to make sure i was ok when things where calmer I was also thinking of jokes to make in the group me such as worst thing i thought at first we might lose worst thing now literal gun statistic and in mist of chaos 3 still makes friends she likes to make friends with everyone and while where walking she started to chat with other cheerleaders Once we got outside things again started to get calm and I again started to think it was going to be ok but again they started to scream and run and I think i heard the popping sound again where all run down towards the bottem of the bridge to shelter us I sprained my ankle a couple of days earlier so it was hard to run on half of hill especially with holding 2s hand once I got to the bottem I accidently step into mud in my daze I thought I liked my shoes but it was ok thinking I was wearing my normal shoes instead of the cheer ones they again directed towards up to hill and to the fence at first I didnt want to go thinking it was safer down here since I wanted shelter 2 kept on tuggin on my arm to go up I did eventally trusting them so we ran up again a cheerleader fall down into mud I didnt want to go down to hold her up thinking it was unsafescary but I did yelled at to get help she did to my hapiness once we got up there things where calm and thankfully remained calm ever since 3 at this point was crying and the cheerleaders she was talking to her contiuned to ask her questions to keep her distrated I jouned in I hugged 3 to help her and she hugged back I also hugged another cheerleader who was also crying I saw the women that fell in the mud and she was fine so I didnt talk to her but was happy she wasnt dead again At one point I started to zone out thinking of all the event today 1 noticed and told me not to go someplace else as she needs me here I told her ok and I wasnt daydreaming she was doing breathing excerise to calm herself down We where again directed towards to walk over a bridge once we got to the other side we set by some buildings again we talked to other cheerleaders and coaches I again tried to comfort another cheerleader who was crying along with her friends one of the coachess offered to call our parents though she could ony calltext 3s mom since I didnt know my parents phone numbers 1 always had her phone with her since she hide it lol over time 1s 4s dads came every time I heard screaming of people calling for their family member I gotten nervous because at that time I assoalted screamingrunning and gunfire though i did think we where safe since if there was a mass shooter we where no longer by the NCA building also I looked over there and saw what appeared to be I asked on her the other cheerleaders where ok and they said I was too worried to ask about my dad I was still prying for them instead my head Eventally my dade I told my dad I was happy he came later 1s mom came we sat and talked about the entire thing the helicopter that I saw that I eventally told them my jokes again I did say to earleir cheerleaders and coaches my dad confirmed that the heliopter that I saw circuring around was connected to the corrent issue orginally I just thought it was normal helicopter I was wrong about being a police helopter it was news helicopter there was an active news story so we talked about that apparantly two cheer parents got into a fight and there thought they pulled out guns I ended up saying nothing says rationality like gunfire though officaly my dad and 1s mom says that was no gunfire I felt like the parnets would be banned for life and I felt bad for the daughtes because they got punished for something their parents did the phones where also going off with a warning about avoing the place and ther was a cheer perfomance that had inturpted for they can be evacuated my dad also said how people where being trumped and he saw one cheerleader with her leg bent I asked if she was alive and he said yes but crying I asked her if she was going to get it amputed and he said no it wasnt that bad The youngest cheermember came we all comfoted her since she was hugging later found out she was crying for hours My dad 2 want to our moms we came togather along with 5 it was a long walk and my back and ankle where really hurting I have very slight Lumbar scoliosis there was a misnderstanding and we had to walk back 2s mom meet as half way for she can hug 2 We made it back 5 and i hugged and she was crying my mom hugged me and wanted to take a picture I asked if this was for something like our familys group text or the prayer team she said yes I think I said if it was called Im not dead photo and she laughed and agreeed later found out was for the group message though maybe also the prayer team as she today said she made it On the our way there we read the news story and how they thought there was no gunfire but there was a genera agreemtn that they was gunfire since more then one of us heard it thankfully no one dead My mom said even it was no gunfire it was real to us I agreed with this I got mad when I found out some people online thought it was funny the fear was very real and most of the people there are either teenegers ND or maybe even both and even with that its safer to get out then risk it not being realsince more then one of us heard it thankfully no one dead When I got home I did more reaserch we talked about in the car but I wanted to read for myself there where dads and got in a fight the offical statemnt was that the poles being pushed it was sounded like gunfire I also heard other things while reading around like one dad having a seizure is what sounded like gunfire or the music in the cheer routine mixed up with the fight sounded like gunfire Im netural but the general consensus is still among the cheer group was that it was gunfire since again we heard it and my dad said he heard it even outside Where at a pool for parents could have a meeting about it and we talked more NSA was going to be put in houstin next year and 5 thinks it would be from now on our coach doesnt want to come back to NSA andinto there is more secrutiy which was pretty surpsing to me since it where want every cheer season even whiel I was in Mexico for my brothers wedding she pushed NCA to march instead of skipping it lol 5 also says our coach wants us to have the wrist bindsblack marker lighting saying our phone number theres even as statement around the group of her changing the no phone role but thats not confirmed 5 also thinks she broke her big toe because while everyone was running someone stepted on her toe and it was really bruised there was more sayings on the group panic running but I had no issue with that myself so it was kind of shocking on the phone thing I later told my mom about it she said she wants me to memorlized her and dads phone number as she didnt realize I didnt know it We also talked about the cheerleading compention most everyone ended up complenting on sunday instead except for the special needs teams which was canlled though even if we didnt our coach said wouldnt complete anyway since again gun panic the first day we wont in first place so the first day team ended up winning she and her coach assasiant was fighting it since she didnt think it was fair because neither them or us gotten the second day she even said even if our team won she wouldnt accept the reward for this very reason We had a group party plannedwe where worried we might have to cancell if everyon was too upset but thanfully we didnt and it was fun,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 02:38:02 UTC,1,0,0.99,,,0,0
1j30jik,I cant fall out love of my best friend and its killing me,Some clarification before English is not my first language so I apologize beforehand if theres something you didnt understand Feel free to ask if thats the case For some context first Me 23M and my best friend 21F lets call her Nicky are friends since first year in college We started getting along better in second year and later I started catching feelings for her Last year I couldnt resist and decided to invite her out surprisingly she said yes We got through the talking stage and laid out some emotional things and said beautiful things to each other Unafortunately when we finally got to our first date she told me that she was actually confused and looking for something different than I am Obviously I was crushed I was so over the moon with her and thought it was going well It took me some time to recover from that but finally we got to be friends again which made me happy because aside from all romantic feelings Im very fond of her or whatever you say when you love someone but not romantically lol Now the main issue here is that some weeks ago I realized I still have feelings for her and its getting really strong every day and Im 110 sure she only sees me as a friend Still some part of me has some kind of hope but even though I feel bad because I promised her to be a good friend with no other interest between and Im failing at that Every time I think about her I smile and Im a profesional daydreamer so that happens very often I cant imagine myself with anyone else but with her shes just wonderful I like everything about her Shes charismatic funny smart compassionate empathetic and I can keep going So now Im lost about what to do because if I tell her I know that its gonna ruin the friendship but I cant keep my feelings hidden anymore its killing me Also I have no idea if she knows or not Im aware my behaviour towards her may have changed and Im being more affectionate but in words not physical But I dont know if she can tell or not also because were talking via text and havent hung out since like a week ago,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 02:36:42 UTC,0,2,0.33,,,0,0
