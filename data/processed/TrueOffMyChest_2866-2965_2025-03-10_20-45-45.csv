1j88tbg,Im a working masters student and Im exhausted,Even as a parttime student I feel completely exhausted I feel terrible for being jealous of people who are welloff enough to be able to do this without a job as I would do the same if I could afford it My schedule is awful I work 6 days a week Job classes and internship Im rarely at home I barely get 7 hours of sleep Im cripplingly lonely and cant make any lasting connections with people because Im just so exhausted from my schedule I cant study productively because Im exhausted from work But Im so passionate about what Im researching and its the only thing keeping me going Even when I suffer academically because I cant visit tutors in office hours because I have work or because I cant spend as much time researching working on an assignment as I would like I know people have it so much worse I know some people are doing the degree fulltime and working But I cant imagine doing this all over again once September comes around next year I dont know what Im going to do Im losing my mind Idk if I want advice just to yell my thoughts into the void Does it get better,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 20:41:03 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j88jdy,i feel like I dont have a right to be upset but I am,So a bit of background information which is needed for this all to make sense My first proper relationship was when I 17F was 13 with a boy the same age as me and for this to make sense in my head Ill make a fake name Leon Leon and I started dating the week before I turned 14 and had been intimate within a month baring in mind this was my FIRST relationship and probably his 10th Within 3 months of us dating he was cheating on me with other girls and it wasnt just like 14 year old cheating it was like sending intimate pictures of himself to these girls Obviously me being like head over heels first relationship I was easily influenced into thinking that this was okay We were so toxic and my mental health got so low I wasnt allowed to leave the house he would break up with me when I went to my friends house who was a girl and I am straight he would pressure me into doing things I didnt want to do I obviously thought this was all part of relationships as my parents live together and barely speak to eachother so Ive never really experienced what normal love is like We dated for a bit over a year and this was a constant When we finally broke up he was straight to another girl Obviously being a heart broken 15 year old I was going out with my friends to get over this I went to meet my friend and ended up at her friends house who were boys I posted a photo of us on BeRealface_with_tears_of_joy and he sent me threats saying he will leak personal photos of me and then got these girls who he knew I was TERRIFIED of as they used to bully me to make me never want to go to school again with my anxiety and stress at such a high I did stop going to school and only went in every now and again and to take my GCSEs During that 2 years we had been on and off getting back together would be intimate would message for months saying how much we missed and loved eachother then he would get with another girl and then come back everytime it didnt work with her For the last couple of months of school I became super close with this group of girls fake names Grace Mary Laura Laura I have known since I was born like we were basically sisters Would go on holiday together we like did everything together and we had finally become close again Mary I was so close to like we got close so quickly and were inseparable Then Grace we were also really close and we had so much fun with eachother and we knew the ins and out about eachother that we wouldnt tell the other girls I would tell her things about my ex and about how much I wished I could get back with him because of how much I loved him and shed always listen in full confidence and we would trust eachother with everything Literally 2 days before prom they had this party that I wasnt invited to but my ex was Obviously I was upset but it wasnt them that planned it so it wasnt their fault We were getting our nails done for prom and they then were talking all party like what they were going to wear where theyre spending the night and that obviously upset me and hurt as they were doing it so blatantly in my face because I wasnt going bearing in mind I still wasnt at school full time so they could easily talk about it when I wasnt there That night I ended up in hospital and not one of them checked up on me they werent at the party it was the day before but my ex did which obviously made me feel AWFUL as he does not care that much about me The next day they went to the party blah blah and then it was prom We went together and had a good time until the after party when one of our mutuals told me he was hammered that they were talking about how I was faking being in hospital and that I was basically just an attention seeking wh0re Obviously I have literal documents and stuff of all the medication and treatment I had to have that night so I was not faking and if I was doing it for attention I wouldve done it so blantantly to make them feel bad and I never even mentioned it to them I left it and then 2 days later we went on a leavers trip to a theme park all was fine again and I had an amazing time until the bus ride home when they didnt save a seat for me we were an inside group of 4 but had a larger girl group of about 10 so I had to sit by myself They then were shouting about planning anotjer party but the main girl saying it was Laura I just sat back and let them do this hoping they would invite me but that never happened I looked like a fool 2 days later the party was going to happen and it was in a heatwave and we have a lake about 45 mins away from where I lived and we all planned to go together I called Mary and I told her how the girls who bullied me was going to be there and she reassured me that everything was going to be fine My grandma had to drive me to the lake and I was waiting for the girls and when they got there I messaged Mary and Laura asking to meet them and then they just flat out left me I was stranded in this town with people who hated me My grandma had left and I was just sat balling my eyes out and I was so embarrassed I just blocked them all and got picked up luckily The minute I blocked them I was so happy I literally did not care at all that I had no friends anymore I started working at the local primary and fell in love with it My life has been on such a high since June 2024 But I found out yesterday again being no contact with them all including my ex since June and hearing nothing about them Grace is dating Leon I really just dont know how to feel Ive been so happy recently and for the whole of the day I just havent been able to feel anything Working today was the first time I just wished I wasnt there and I just wanted to curl up in a ball and cry Im not sad about it but it just feels like a bit of a kick My family are just telling me to be the bigger person and I am but it almost feels like Im not allowed to be upset about it I just dont know how to feel rn and any advice would be so so appreciated I just feel a bit lost and now I dont know what Im supposed to do The thought of them together makes me feel ill and I know in a couple months Im going to have to see them at this local festival I work at and Im terrified because I know it will just upset me and I wont have work to distract me as it will be during the summer holidays Please let me know what I should do,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 20:29:31 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j880m4,True Story for English Project,A few years ago in 2019 I went over to a friends house to complete a project While there I noticed she had some cats roaming around her yard and she mentioned that her family also had a few dogs The dogs were medium sized and the cats were of normal weight and stature and I assumed that when the weather became extreme they would be brought inside for safety and comfort I barely spared them a glance trusting that they were cared for At the time I didnt think much of it Animals are a part of human life and in the lowincome neighborhood that my friend lived in it was common for pets to live in backyards or spend a lot of time outside She clearly seemed to love her cats even though they were not inside the house and it would be rude for me to question how things were done in her family In some Florida neighborhoods it is common for dogs and cats to spend their days outside the continuously warm environment with the occasional rain is perfect weather for those who cant afford to have more occupants in already small houses It was two years of being friends that led to our first sleepover That was when I started noticing a few odd things in my friends household For instance her family had recently found a kitten on the side of the road and had taken it in At first I thought it was a heartwarming act of kindness They allowed the kitten to sleep in their beds cuddle with them and receive affection However as soon as the kitten grew older they just put it back outside to fend for itself It struck me as odd but I dismissed it thinking perhaps they just didnt want a fullgrown cat inside This happened with several cats and they just found a new kitten a few months ago I didnt like it but it wasnt exactly illegal The straw that broke the camels back was in 2023 It was an extremely hot summer the hottest itd been in years I went over to her house per usual but this time with another friend We decided that before wed come in wed say hello to her dogs Usually she would tell us that the dogs werent important and would always steer us away But this time we wanted to play with them The dogs were confined in an unbearably small cageabout the size of a wheelbarrow The space was far too cramped for even one dog let alone three They had no shelter from the relentless 100degree heat and there was no shade to offer them any respite The food bowl was empty devoid of any evidence of kibble meat or any form of sustenance The water they did have was dirty contaminated with feces and entirely undrinkable Feces were scattered all around the cage indicating that they had been living in these conditions for a long time As soon as they saw us the dogs started panting and wagging their tails shaking with excitement at the sight of people They were desperate for attention for care for relief from their miserable existence It was heartbreaking No animal should have to endure such neglect These dogs werent just sufferingthey were being denied basic necessities space clean water food and protection from the elements My friends reaction to our concern was even more shocking When confronted about the state of the dogs she simply walked away without a word There was no explanation no sign of guilt or concern It was as if she didnt see anything wrong with what we had witnessed I was horrified I knew I could not ignore what I had seen This was not just a matter of differing opinions on pet carethis was neglect Leaving animals in these conditions without food clean water or shelter is not only cruel but could be considered animal abuse under the law This experience changed the way I felt about her from then on I had reported it to animal control but they did nothing and her family ended up moving the dogs into the garage a humid stuffy garage without windows to open and let air in but bigger than a wheelbarrow so progress is progress Animal control did not take the dogs away as I expected but instead gave a warning This is one of those stories with no real happy ending Some people dont deserve the love animals give so freely And sometimes walking away from a friendship is the only right thing to do We still keep in contact after all she was my best friend But every time I see her face Im reminded of those moments and it doesnt feel good,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 20:07:53 UTC,2,0,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING ANIMAL ABUSE,0,0

1j85zmb,Why did my ex fake a nosebleed using smashed up berries,Throwaway account This happened about 6 years ago and it still haunts me to this day It was my at the time boyfriends prom night and i was planning to go as well We werent going together but i graduated from the same high school the year prior and was going with my old classmates as a reunion thing My boyfriend had been acting weird all day It felt like he was trying to keep me from going to the event He kept saying things like oh but you really dont have to come if you dont want to but i was like no dude im not going for you i just wanna see my friends I went anyway and had a fun time but i barely saw him all night We did plan to go home together so we met up to take a taxi to his place Apparently he had been sitting in a car with his friends for hours so i asked him if he did any drugs i dont really care and he knows that but he said no During our taxi ride home he was so distant and it was like he was completely ignoring my presence He seemed sober so this really confused and hurt me since i had no clue why he was acting this way We went to bed i was still very confused and i tried talking to him and asking if he was okay and what was going on He didnt even bother responding so i started crying but he was still ignoring me pretending to sleep Heres where it gets really weird After a while he got up to go to the bathroom He was gone for a while so i went to check up on him When i opened the bathroom door i didnt know what to expect but it was definitely not this He was standing there holding a bunch of toilet paper with smashed red fruit on it I looked in the toilet smashed red fruit I looked in the sink smashed red fruit He said i got a nosebleed BUT IT WAS SO CLEARLY RED FRUIT like it was slightly pink and i could see the seeds and fibers and everything It was strawberry or raspberries or something It looked like he had chewed it for a second and spat it out everywhere It also didnt look like vomit since it looked like pure fruit but i still asked him if he ate red fruits and threw up but he said in the most normal and calm tone no i didnt eat any fruit today what do you mean I just have a nosebleed I kept asking what was going on but he kept playing it off and saying i should go to bed I was exhausted at this point so just went to sleep The next day and the following weeks i asked him so many times what was actually going on and he kept switching between just having a nosebleed to straight up denying anything ever happened He also denied ever acting weird or distant He made me feel like i was going crazy To be fair we did break up a year later cause he was a manipulator a liar and lowkey abusive but i still just want to know what was going on Ive told this story to so many friends and everyone is equally confused and intrigued If anyone has any insight or theory i would love to hear it lol Also if anyone wonders i was sober during the events and he seemed too but not 100 sure Im not in contact with him anymore but sometimes im tempted to ask him again lmao Any ideas,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 18:42:32 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j85hv5,I am a man I got sexually assaulted She twisted it and accused me everyone only believed her,Its been a few years since this happened I had to quit college and end my studies because of it I have mostly pretended it never happened but Ive recently been looking back and processing it and I need to talk to someone about it I dont have anyone to talk to about this so I decided to come here Many years ago I was 17 and had just started college I befriended a girl lets call her Emma Emma started dating this Bisexual girl lets call her Jenny and once she came into the picture the three of us formed a friend group We were a good friend group for a while and had lots of fun hanging out and studying together Still at some point Emmas and Jennys relationship started to go really sour Jenny had BPD and their relationship had started to become really unstable They had arguments almost daily even at our college And during these times I became the therapist whenever I individually met them they would rant to me about each other And Jenny and I really bonded and became good friends since she actually listened to my rants too The day it happened the school had organized a disco party Emma was working and had to get home get ready and head straight to the party So Jenny had invited me to hang out at her place before the party get ready together hang out and then head over to meet Emma at the party We were just hanging around typical college kid age things and everything was light hearted But suddenly things got really weird she started talking about sexual things asking me about my kinks and fetishes asking me about all sorts of sexual questions and it somehow evolved to her taking out her computer and showing me the kind of porn she watches and yes when I say showing I mean putting on the actual videos of her favourite porn and asking me to show mine From there it kept escalating into much weirder sexual things after the porn she started talking about Emma and telling me what they do in bed then she pulled out her phone and started showing me nudes of Emma without Emmas permission or knowledge of it The next part which I feel extremely uncomfortable thinking about and trying to forget Her parents were downstairs eating dinner after showing me a bunch of nudes of Emma without her permission she opened the door and at that point her parents could probably hear whatever we were talking about Then she sat down next to me started talking about how much she misses being with a guy put her hands inside my pants and Sexually Assaulted me while making remarks about how much she liked feeling me Eventually her parents started to come upstairs She stopped and at that point I said I had to go and went home skipping the party I didnt want any of that I only saw her as a friend and I didnt consent I justfroze Many people have asked me when I tell this why I didnt stop her and said to me that I Consented by not stopping around the part she started showing porn or Emmas nudes But I was dissociating the whole time I cant really explain it but I was in shock the entire time Afterwards the next day when I came to college she had told Emma at the party that she cheated on her told her I had made a move on her and she reciprocated it This broke our friend group entirely and I was left alone with no friends It all went completely sideways when a mutual asked me about what happened to our group and once I told her the story she asked me Isnt that sexual assault and thats when it hit me what it really was to which I said yes Not too long later that person talked to Jenny about it Jenny told her a completely different story that she was the victim of SA and I was the one who did it she twisted the whole story in a way where she told people I did all the things she did that night the kink questions porn begging to see nudes of Emma and then I assaulted her No matter how much I told the truth No one listened they all believed her It didnt take long for the whole school to believe her and paint me as a sexual predator I became an outcast and everyone treated me like a monster It led me really close to suicide and I dropped out of school and have never gone back not long after I dropped out I developed very heavy substance abuse and have been struggling with it until recently I am sober for around 9 months now I really dont know how I feel about posting this but I genuinely just needed to tell my story I just needed to vent Im sorry if this is too much I hope you all have a good day,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 18:23:02 UTC,423,32,0.96,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j847qz,Is it considered sexual assault,I was on a second date with a guy who I liked We had met before once it was fun and we had hooked up but didnt have sex because I am a virgin and I had clearly told him I am not ready for sex This time he didnt give me the same fun vibe but I wanted to hookup with him again because it was fun the previous time and honestly I was trying to let loose a little since I have usually been very uptight when it comes to dating I went to his house after and ofc things escalated I accept that I showed equal interest unlike last time and I was teasing him and flirting with him and kissing him But this time it was more about him and he didnt seem that interested in kissing me again and again like the first time He slightly persuaded me to give him a blow job which I really didnt want to but after one point I couldnt say no But I wasnt able to and I kept gagging and i remember telling him i cant He then got in between my legs and I told him that I wasnt ready for sex He reassured me that he wasnt going to do anything and he was just teasing me I remember telling him multiple times that I didnt want to have sex and I wasnt ready I trusted him and let him slightly penetrate me without going in But then he kept pushing in further It was hurting and again i tried stopping him but not very firmly He asked me if he could just feel me from the inside but would not thrust I dont think I said anything to that But eventually we did end up having sex And in fact he kept asking me to help guide him which I did as well So now its a very blurry line for me because I said no and I told him that I wasnt ready but then I also gave him a helping hand and also didnt say no while we were actually having sex The next morning also I didnt say anything and I in fact kept kissing him But later after coming home and finally processing i confronted him on text and called his upbringing into question He lashed out at me and said that I could have stopped it at any time and he just wasnt the one who was into it Another thing to note with be that he didnt show me any comfort or affection or asked me how I was feeling after sex In fact he didnt communicate with me at all He tried to cuddle me once but I got up and went outside to process things after which he didnt hug me properly even once or tried to cuddle me We slept separately the entire night and i felt so vulnerable and sad I never expected my first time to be like this Now I am just confused and sad and regretful at this point Also he did not use a condom and it was much later that I realised and when I told him he said he will pull out which he did I asked him in the morning if I needed to take the morning after pill and he said no But I ended up taking one anyway after reaching home,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 17:30:18 UTC,0,12,0.5,,,0,0

1j82bj4,Ive been collecting teeth my whole life and I practice dentistry as a hobby,When I was younger I used to steal my siblings teeth that they placed under their pillow for the tooth fairy idk why I did it but once I had a few teeth in my collection I found it very exhilarating In 5th grade my parents got called into the school because they found out that I was using my lunch money to pay kids to remove their loose teeth I successfully extracted 4 teeth before being caught I was in trouble but it was also a moment of oh a silly entrepreneur boy thing I kinda got a pass The teacher even joked that perhaps I have career in dentistry In middle school I got caught again the elementary school was attached to our middle school and I was convincing the much younger kids to give up their loose teeth Id give them snacks or candy as a trade and they were happy to oblige I was in much more trouble this time and my parents made me attend therapy I played it off as an interest into wanting to become a dentist but really there was something about taking a tooth and keeping it that was so exciting By this time I was building quite the collection My parents never learned that I actually kept the collection of teeth And now theyre both dead anyways In highschool I slowed down quite a bit I focused mostly on my studies Freshman year was rough I witnessed a fistfight that left another student with a tooth that was almost knocked down a lateral incisor 23 on the bottom it was kinda just hanging there The guy was in my class and we were acquainted so I went to help him When I saw how loose it was I just reached in and grabbed it It just came right out Everyone was shocked and I ran pretty cringe moment and everyone treated me like a weirdo after that By junior year they seemed to forget I even had some dates I subconsciously would target women in sports or heavy party girls because they tended to either lose teeth quicker or have dental issues It worked in my favor on more than one occasion After highschool I worked on going towards dental school but quickly realized it wasnt for me The science behind it just didnt interest me I really just wanted to perform extractions I had no care about restoration So I kinda just floated around working odd jobs I collected a lot of dental tools that I would use on friends and family and women I would date Today I have 97 teeth total About 49 of them are baby teeth Most of which I have taken when I was younger Some were from the children of the women Ive dated When they have a sore tooth it saves a lot to just do the extraction ourselves and we turn it into an adventure game with the kids The rest are adult teeth Ive collected over the last decade The majority of these I obtained consensually I plan to continue dentistry as a hobby My dream would be to open up a clinic in maybe Africa or India or something where I do extractions for free That way Im helping out but also enjoying myself at the same time,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 16:12:48 UTC,1,8,0.57,,,0,0

1j80if4,Scared but cant stop losing weight,I started off at 575 150lb which is BMI 23 Now Im still the same height but 121lbs which is a BMI of 187 My goal weight is 115lbs which is BMI 177 I think Im anorexic I started skipping lunch because I wanted to lose weight faster It worked but it was too fast to the point where I caused my family to be suspicious of me In order to mitigate suspicion I planned to minimize the skipping of my meals but as time got nearer and nearer to meal time I realized that I was disgusted by the thought of having to eat by the sensation of being full So today I bought someone a free lunch while I ate nothing when the original plan was for me to eat a normal meal Ive never been down BMI 185 before which is the criteria for being underweight Going past the threshold seems almost scary But at the same time I just cant stop losing weight Eating feels tiring I have to constantly work my mouth just to finish a meal Most of the times Im already full when Ive only eaten half of my meal and going further is tiring I want to avoid that uncomfortable experience hence the continued skipping of lunches I also have no appetite and couldnt even get hungry despite 14 hours of fasting I dont know what to do Im not sure if I could even maintain my weight if I hit 115lbs Im still a minor so I cant see a therapist by my own No one knows about my eating disorder,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 14:56:02 UTC,5,4,1.0,,,0,0
1j80bit,Toxic friend still in my life dont know if I should end it,So this is rantstorytime about a toxic friend who is still in my life and Im unable to remove her Lets call her Sara So I met Sara in the 1st year of my college through my exroommate Lets call her Jane Jane and Sara were in the same class so one day she came to visit Janes room where I lived too She immediately started talking to me very excitedly and telling about herself and asked for my Insta acct probably because me and her both are from the same religion Jane isnt So then we started hanging out often all three of us and she also started meeting my other friends from college etc Sara lives with her brother theyre both studying here Fast forward a few months and thats when it started getting unhealthy She started acting very possessive and would get upset over me hanging out with other friends without inviting her or posting stories etc She would even get jealous when I went out with Jane or posted stories with her she was my roommate ofc we would have fun together and be close When a few times me and Jane have fought she would always come and tell me things like yeah she is like that lets go out etc instead of trying to reconcile us I think she enjoyed it when I would have disagreements with my other friends Apart from the possessive nature she is very cheap in money matters Whenever we would go out to eat or have tea or anything she almost never paid And if she ever did she would ask me to send half of it She would use this trick where she wouldnt order anything and if I did she would eat from it And if said to pay she would say that she didnt even order anything or she just tasted my food If we ever made plans for the movies or any other activity she would beforehand say I dont have any money expecting any of us to say we will cover her and if no one said that and we went without her she gets upset She then once caused such a big misunderstanding between me and Jane that we didnt speak to each other for 6 months and started living separately We have started talking again now but live alone and not together Jane still doesnt speak to Sara and probably wont ever which I think is good for her She also has this habit where she would just take my stuff My parents live abroad and they would send me chocolates or some food items available abroad suppose they have sent 2 packets she would just come pick up one and say Im taking this Now I am a person who cant say no to someone like this when they ask me for some food item or something I dont know I try but I just cant bring myself to it She then started asking for my other things too which are not 2 packs or just anything Like she once saw my aloe vera gel and said oh I want it what will you do of it or even my plates and cups hair brush anything she would just say oh I am taking this I have not given any of those to her I have told her that no I need it but she would still insist it was very tough for me to have those arguments She once even asked for a gift that was given to me by my fiancé his apple earphones and said oh I need these I said no he gave them to me why would I let you take it and guess what she was upset about it But she wouldnt stop There are so many such incidents One that has stuck with me is when I brought chocolates for her from abroad and I asked her to give me one from the pack and she straight up refused saying they were hers I was baffled that how could she refuse me chocolates that I brought her It was so cheap So these are all small things and in the past few months some pretty serious and big things she has done which are 1st She absolutely ruined my birthday So my fiancé Lives in another country had planned a celebration at a fancy restaurant with all my friends as a surprise for me He reached out to Jane to help prepare for the surprise as he couldnt manage effectively from so far away When Sara found out that he reached out to Jane and not her she got mad and upset about it that why she wasnt asked and also cause she and Jane dont speak to each other She made a fuss about it and on my birthday in the restaurant she sat there making a faces didnt eat anything at all wasnt talking to anyone and also whispering comments to someone either about me or Jane I asked her several times whats wrong and she just said nothings wrong and continued behaving like that Everyone saw that it was affecting my and everyone elses mood so they kept asking her to cheer up but she didnt She didnt even eat a single bite of the birthday cake also constantly made faces didnt smile for once the entire time and left The next day I confronted her about it and she said she is sorry and she was upset why she wasnt chosen by me I said my fiancé planned it all and I didnt know about it but she said I probably knew how could I not know I told her that she ruined my day and she texted me Im so sorry with the hands folded emoji making it a sarcastic mean sorry 2nd This incident happened a few days ago and has really made me think that I have had my last straw now and this is getting so so toxic So she had borrowed money from me which she was supposed to return last month When I asked her for it she said she doesnt have it and sent me a small amount and said she will send me the rest later I said okay Now a month has passed and Im really broke right now and need some money So I texted her asking her to send me the rest of the money she said to me again that she doesnt have any money I said why not even I dont have money and I need it please ask your parents to send It or do whtever but please give me my money at least give me half back as I am in need of money right now But she just said that I dont have money I will give it when I have it I asked her when will that be and she said 45 months Thats when my college comes to an end and I will be literally leaving the country thats when she wants to pay me back Its also not a huge amount which she cant arrange out of nowhere she also has had time of several months but is still not returning my money I argued with her for around half an hour over text asking her to give my money back now as I need it now and not months later I even gave solution that she can pay me little by little each month at least but she plainly said no I dont have to all of it I dont know how to get the money now AND CHERRY ON THE CAKE IS ever since I asked her the money back she is UPSET with me For asking my own money back When I need it She didnt say shes upset but she isnt sending me any reels as she used to stopped reacting to mine doesnt send snaps which all she does when she is upset I just dont understand where she gets the AUDACITY to be upset here I should be the one upset as she is not giving the money back I feel like this is literally the last straw Theres so many more things she has done but I cant write all of them down here or this will be too long NOW I KNOW WHOEVER READS THIS WILL ASK ME WHY I HAVENT ENDED THE FRIENDSHIP now that is because we have been friends for the past three years and my whole family my fiancé my inlaws they all know her and they ask about her frequently and ask if weve been hanging out and how is she and everything and Ill be passing out college in the next three months and after that Ill be moving to another country and probably wont see her anymore maybe once in a blue moon in a lot of years but we wont be meeting again I think so So I just wanted to avoid any drama since the past six months I have been thinking that I should just let it go because its just a few months and I dont want to create the drama and I dont want the fuss of explaining all the family members of why I dont speak to her anymore and all that but I think this is just getting so much out of hand Even now she is still in my life thinking that its just three more months and itll all be done but I dont know anymore if I should end it now or wait All this time Ive been such a good friend even after she has done all of this I continue doing things for her I continue trying to help her whenever she needs I lent her the money after she did all that fuss on my birthday And yet she is like this This is very very toxic,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 14:47:34 UTC,2,3,1.0,,,0,0

1j7ybiz,Living with my abusive sister,My whole childhood was a blur due to all of the abuse I had to endure from my sister It all started around when I was in kindergarten and she was in 6th grade I remember her holding me down in my mothers closet punching me in the face repeatedly She would hold my head underwater when we went to the pool until I almost went unconscious She would chase me and my mom around the house with any weapon she could find and she ended up stabbing me with a knife in the stomach at some point This and more all went on for years until she moved out after she graduated high school in 2020 At some time between 1st3rd grade I was SAd by her She would make me watch pay gorn with her then she would make me kiss her also lick her chest and her downstairs She would make me and my disabled little sister shower with her and one time she also made my little sister lick her I spoke to my cousin about this and similar happened to them They also witnessed my sisters abuse on many occasions Fast forward to today I am 17 my sister is 23 and she moved in with me my mom and my little sister after the hurricanes along with her fiancéeF22 and their son2 They originally were just evacuating but they decided that they werent going back They were supposed to move out within a month but it has now been 6 months They reside in my little sisters room so she now shares a room with my mom The whole house is being taken over and Im tired of biting my tongue Last week I was about to take a shower and I noticed a pretty big mess my nephew made There were crushed eggshells spread all over the carpet along with stickers and price tags my mom runs an antique business I asked my sister to clean it up and I go take a shower I had just gotten out and there were even more messes that were made There were crushed eggshells are still there I go to the kitchen and there were magnets covering the floor which were also in the dining room The cats water had been dumped out and there were three towels in the garbage I asked my sister what had happened shes sitting on the couch on her phone She says something along the lines of my son was just playing I asked her to clean it up and she said Ill do it later The thing is she either never cleans or she does it half assed So I texted my mom pictures and basically told her that these messes were made my sister isnt cleaning it and Im not gonna be the one responsible for it My mom calls my sister and she immediately starts yelling at me saying WHY WOULD YOU TELL MOM MY SONS MAKING A MESS DONT TALK ABOUT MY SON LIKE THAT I tell her that its not her son I understand hes a toddler but she has to be responsible for that My mom calls me and I go to leave to my room I noticed my sister following me and out of the corner of my eye I see her threaten to punch me I turn around and say girl dont even then she punches me in the face and we tackle each other to the ground My mom was on the phone the whole time and was telling her to get out of the house She wouldnt leave and kept arguing with me saying stuff about how nobody helps her and she will never talk to us again but the thing is she has lived in three peoples houses rent free including ours She asks everybody for money and they send her money Our family has helped her so much and she is so ungrateful and entitled My mom gets home from work and tells her that she needs to get a hotel for a few days before they can come back and have a conversation about this all Three days pass and it was the most relaxing three days of my life I deep cleaned the house and discovered how much damage she has caused to our house holes in the wall paint splattered on everything just everything being nasty The day has come that they come back My sister has to work so she drops off her fiancé and their son first I talk to her about everything and we seem to be on the same page she witnessed my sister hit me and argue with me Time passes and everyone is home now We tried to talk but my sister wasnt engaging and was just staring off into space At this point no one is mad anymore we just want to work through this bump in the road but my sister oh no she was pissed She denied everything and acted like she didnt do anything wrong and kept asking for proof of everything that we talked to her about even though everyone knows what happened She leaves and goes to their room I leave and go to my room but I can hear my sister talking to her fiancé about everything through the wall and she acted like she had no clue about anything She said she didnt see my sister punch me and was just telling my sister what she wanted to hear This pisses me off so I tell my mom whats going on and we go to their room to stop the twisting of the story My sister had nothing but hateful things to say to me but what really got me was that she said I never have her back when I say I do I really have had her back so many times there are so many things that I have never told another soul because she asked me to I tell her that and shes still denying and lying I figured that the only way I can prove to her that I in fact did have her back and to get it through to her that she needs to stop lying and be accountable for her actions was to tell her darkest secrets I started tame and told my mom the reasoning why my sister got jumped a few years back My sister acts oblivious I as her if she wants me to keep going She says she doesnt care so I tell her fiancé about how she cheated on her with a man less that a year ago Of course she denies it but I had proof I pull up text messages of her describing everything when it happened and she still tried to deny it She and her fiancé start arguing which causes my sister to run away She would do this all the time growing up if she got caught doing something bad she would run away but she would come back an hour later but keep in mind this is a 23 year old adult were talking about We found her sitting on the street talking to a random man and we bring her back home She keeps threatening to off herself which is another tactic she used as kids At home she starts arguing with my mom and I saying that everyone hates her and that I ruined her life and I only said that out of spite I told her exactly why I did it but shes not having it because when she makes up a story in her head she will stick to it Me and her fiancé go to the gas station to blow off some steam and we talked the whole time She talked about how my sister would try to do nasty stuff to her but she didnt want to because she had a gut feeling that she was cheating and she was right She also said that when she didnt want to do anything my sister would try to force herself into her Her saying this triggered my memory of the SA that happened when I was a kid I told her about it and she said she believed me We get home and I figured I should probably tell my mom about the SA I had hidden this from everyone because my sister always threatened me and by the time she was no longer a threat to me I had blocked out that memory This whole situation just resurfaced everything My mom was horrified and at this point no one knows what to do but my sister needs to get out of the house She has no one to go to because she ruined everyones trust She has no money because she cant save for shit We decide to sleep on it because at this point its like 1 am I couldnt sleep for the life of me but the next day this all continues The fiancé repeated everything I told her to my sister and of course she is denying everything and calling me a liar who is just out to get her Not only that but her fiancé is denying everything that she told me such as my sister forcing herself onto her Their stories for everything keep changing but mine has stayed the same for everyone All day my sister was talking shit about me Its so bad that I cant even be in my own room because I can hear them talking through the wall As of now Im sleeping on the floor in my moms room If Im not in the same room as my mom they will talk shit to her Despite all of this my mom believes me and my one story along with all of the proof I have I havent been this enraged since I lived with my sister as a kid It feels like Im living with squatters from the worst roommate show I have zero privacy and I cant breathe without someone making something up about me I dont know what to do this is still going on as of right now Im currently on spring break so we have time to deal with this but we dont know how and if theyre still here by the

1j7yaxt,Just an old memory I wanted to share,When I was no older than 7 my family and I used to go eat at this place quite frequently It was relatively cheap and food was decent We lived in a city with quite some homeless people and oftentimes a few of them were hanging around waiting for money Anyway this one time we were eating and started hearing this commotion We went to check what was up and it was a homeless guy being quite upset at the counter He had saved up some money to buy himself a meal but was a few euros short and staff had thrown out the food he was going to buy It was a buffet style diner He was so upset and I felt so bad I asked my parents to get him a new plate We didnt have a lot of money but my parents still agreed My mother and I went back and told the staff we would buy him a new plate Turns out it had been the last portion of that specific dish and they had just thrown it out So of course he became very upset again In the end we bought him another meal and he thanked us profusely We didnt sit with him though which I hope we had My father didnt speak the language and my mother is deaf so it probably wouldve been very awkward anyway Anyway its not a sensational story I just sometimes get reminded of it and then get upset for a few minutes I really wish wed sat with him He was probably in need of some company and just someone to talk to He had saved up for probably days to get this one dish he really wanted and he never got it I hope he was able to get out of that situation and eat that dish another time,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 13:13:52 UTC,1,0,0.67,,,0,0
1j7y9vs,To every brother who crossed the line who took advantage I have a question for you,Maybe you were young Maybe you didnt know better Maybe no one told you that some lines should never be crossed But what about now Are you still a minor Do you still believe that being younger at the time means you were automatically forgiven Let me be clearNo you are not forgiven When I was 17 my 15yearold cousin tried to touch me while I was sleeping His mom knew He got yelled at Everyone else moved on I didnt I still remember that day how scared he made me Every detail My aunt never talks about it I tried to forget but I cant I realized I wont be okay until he says sorry To my face He needs to say What I did was wrong Im ashamed I think about it every day How could I do that to my own sister Watching him laugh and carry on like nothing ever happened it infuriates me I dont want him to suffer but he doesnt get to erase the past not when hes grown and fully aware of what he did The worst part He even speaks about morality about respecting women as if hes never betrayed those very principles And I know Im not alone in this Many of you havent forgotten either Its a nightmare Seeing him makes me sick His words are like a joke I want to scream to tell everyone the truth about what he did Because of him Im still afraid of men I flinch at even the gentlest touch even from friends I sleep alone I cant bring myself to say yes to a date no matter how kind the guy is because deep down I know I have nothing left to give I dont feel normal anymore Im exhausted by the questions Why do you only have female friends Why do you act so distant around men Do you hate them Are you a lesbian Maybe I am But even if I were it would still be better than living in fear of men I want to confront him to demand answers but I hesitate Hes still family Maybe he wants to forget maybe he carries his own guilt and yet a part of me wonders what if speaking up hurts him So I ask this now to every brother who has made his sisters life a living hell Do you truly regret what you did Are you ashamed Have you ever wanted to face your sister and ask for her forgiveness Do you even seek to be forgiven Is the person you are today real or just a mask you wear If your sister confronted you how would you respond How would it make you feel Do you like us carry this weight and long to set it down I just want to know how do you all feel after everything Because I feel devastated Even after all these years I still cant forget I wonder is there even a single man in this world who has sincerely apologized for this Who has taken responsibility helped his sister heal and given her a chance to live a normal life again I want to believe that no one is beyond change that people can choose to be better if they truly try Is that too much to hope for If any of this resonates with you then please apologize to your sisters Understand that we still carry this weight even when we smiled even when we pretended to have moved on for the sake of the family,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 13:12:21 UTC,0,0,0.33,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j7y6y5,My Ex got engaged Im upset about it and I feel horrible for being so,So I 25m had been close friends with my ex 25f about 10 years since early high school We just hit it off we were different people but we just understood each other and got along really well Not long after high school we realised we had feelings for each other and that we wanted more than friends and we decided to give it a try We dated for about 6 months and it just felt natural probably since we had been close for a long time She is a strongly religious individual as is her family and that was never an issue for me and she had assured me that although I wasnt as religious Im a raised Catholic but not to the extent this wasnt a dealbreaker It was part of our friendship to tease each other about our levels of faith That is until she broke up with me via phone call whilst I was visiting family saying that she needed someone who could share her religious beliefs with Naturally I was heartbroken and when I returned home we spoke and she reaffirmed this further We broke up and that was that Across the next 3 years I learned to move on initially my mental and emotional state was rough but I learned to improve myself I could say proudly that I wasnt the wreck I was afterwards I found out about 6 months ago that she was dating someone else and had been for about a year small town everyone knows everything At the time I was really happy for her despite everything she was still my friend for a big chunk of my life and I ended up messaging her and telling her that That is until earlier tonight while stalking on Facebook I saw that she had gotten engaged to this guy and all I felt was sadness and jealousy like someone had turned back the clock 3 years on my emotions feeling like rubbish that it wasnt me with her still Immediately after that I felt so guilty like a horrible human being for feeling this way I have no right to we both moved on with our lives I dont even want to message her again let alone want to be with her again Im just so disappointed in myself that all the hard work I had done across 3 years has gone down the drain,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 13:08:19 UTC,9,1,0.74,,,0,0
1j7xxzs,I feel guilty eating anything,I F26 constantly feel guilty about eating anything I count every single calorie and honestly its exhausting Im from a Southeast Asian country where most of my peers are naturally small and skinny Even if they eat a lot they either dont gain weight like I do or lose it effortlessly At 58 and 150 lbs I dont think Im that heavy Yes Im on the heavier side compared to the people around me but I carry most of my weight in my chest which only makes me look even fuller On top of that Im considered tall for a woman here so I always feel like a giant Peoplefriends strangers family freely comment on my height and weight and not in a good way My family especially constantly gives me unsolicited diet advice tells me Ive eaten enough and makes jokes about my body But the worst part is my mom Shes obsessed with having a perfectlooking daughter and to her that just means being pretty and skinny My academic achievements my promising careernone of it matters To them Im just the fat one Because of this Im always forcing myself to choose the healthier option trying to burn off every calorie I consume I religiously log everything into MyFitnessPal and limit myself to 10001500 calories a day on top of working out But no matter how much I restrict myself my weight wont drop anymore Its frustrating I just want my mind to quiet down so I can enjoy a meal but I feel like Im not even enjoying my life anymore People still see me as the giant friend or the oversized girl in the family and no matter what I do the comments never stop If I ever defend myself I get dismissed as being salty because Im fat I love food I love cooking and baking But Ive realized that Ive been trapped in this toxic cycle of diet culture for almost 13 years And after all this time people still wont stop commenting on my body Its made me start hating the things I once loved I hate my reflection I hate the small portions I force myself to eat just to fuel my body And sometimes when the guilt gets too overwhelming I purgenot even after binge eating just after a regular meal Ive even told my mom about it when she criticizes my weight but she just stares at me and says I must be lying because Im not losing any weight i tried brushing everything off and thinking as long as im eating healthy and my body is healthy then its okay but this is every single day and some days it gets to meand is mentally stuck in there I dont know what to do anymore This is mentally draining and I just feel stuck If you have any thoughts and or advice Id appreciate hearing them,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 12:55:30 UTC,2,1,0.67,,,0,0

1j7xplq,When Life Gives You Lemons You Get a Mountain of Debt and a Late Diagnosis,I grew up with my mother who was a single parent She had chosen to leave my father due to his alcohol and pill addiction Shortly before I was born she was granted disability pension because she was born with a spinal defect that made her physically disabled In addition she had repeatedly been to the psychiatric emergency room in the 1970s likely due to being placed in foster care as she was born out of wedlock Today I know that I had undiagnosed ADHD that hindered my schooling but this was not noticed by either the school or child and adolescent psychiatry Despite having countless interactions with the school child psychiatry and social services to find a sustainable way for my mother and me to live together without harming each other Today I have met social workers who are surprised that I placed myself in foster care when they hear what I went through as a child and they say that things would have been handled differently today After struggling hard in elementary school to get into the high school program I wanted my life was turned upside down when I found out that my father was sober and had been for a few years and that he hoped word would reach me that he wanted to contact me So just as I was about to start high school I suddenly had a father again and we were to try to establish a relationship despite barely having seen each other since I was two years old At the same time as I was getting to know my father it became untenable for me to continue living at home with my mother and together with social services my move away from home with the help of social services was being prepared at the age of 17 Shortly after the decision had been made and I had moved in with my girlfriend and her family in a state of panic my first major setback arrived My father passed away in his home and I had to take care of going through and packing up his home as well as his workplace while also having my room at my mothers and the half of the household goods she had saved for me during my upbringing so that I would have something resembling a home when I moved out My uncle took care of my fathers hunting weapons and his car but the rest was left for 17yearold me to handle contacting private individuals and authorities and announcing his passing Not to mention the feat of improvising a funeral without any idea of what my fathers taste or preferences were and any wishes he might have had for the ceremony I still remember that I actually had a fever at his funeral We fast forward a few years to when I surprised my mother our relationship improved immediately once I moved out by taking her to be in the audience of her favorite TV show Thats when an idea was born in my head TVfilm thats what I want to do I came home and started researching how to get into the industry and saw that there were some educational programs I could apply for But to get into these I first needed to complete my high school studies So I did and then I applied to various programs until after 23 years I finally got into one The problem with the program was that it was over 200 km roughly 125 miles from my hometown and I prepared to move to the location by myself to start my studies But it turned out that my partner chose to join me in the move Meanwhile my mother had gradually worsened and at that time it was nice to get away from her gradual decline Her memory was getting worse and worse The program I had been accepted into was a twoyear program with the first year focusing on theory and most of the second year dedicated to practical training But before we were to go out on internships we had a short film to complete first On the second to last day of filming our short film my second major setback arrived and at that time I didnt know it would last for a long time During filming one of our actors collapsed and passed away during the ambulance ride to the hospital I was responsible for the sound during filming and had four different microphones running which captured the sounds the person made before they fell to the floor and we rushed to begin CPR while waiting for the ambulance By some miracle and some trick filming we managed to finish filming and could focus on the internship period The problem was that 90 of media production takes place in the capital so a move to an already overcrowded city was the next step After much searching I found a place to live or so I thought It turned out to be a scam and when I confronted the person and said I didnt want a lot of things ordered in my name I was threatened with murder the continuation of earlier mentioned setback I managed to shake it off and made it to the capital and started my internships But when things were running smoothly and the engine was at its hottest the setbacks decided to hit hard As an unpaid intern trying to break into the industry it was natural to say yes to everything to be the one who fixed everything Especially if you had gotten an internship at the same production where I had previously taken my mother After a few weeks the situation saying yes to all and everything and at the same time having an undiagnosed NDdisorder became untenable and the supervisors chose to terminate my internship I became so unwell that I sought help at the psychiatric emergency room where they determined that I was burned out from what had happened I then chose to move back to my partner to lick my wounds and recover But barely a week passed before my sister called and informed me that my mother had collapsed and been taken by ambulance to the intensive care unit Because her medication including blood thinners had been discontinued she suffered multiple blood clots which ultimately led to her death While we were at the hospital and watching over her knowing that she didnt have much time left my partner chose to declare that 11 years together was enough and that she didnt think she could or wanted to continue This was said when we were only a few meters from my dying mother Once my mother passed away it was almost Christmas and we rushed to arrange a funeral to get it done before the year ended At the same time a process began to divide our 11year life together I started looking for a new place to live and six months after my mother passed away I moved and a year of rehabilitation and sick leave to recover began When I slowly started to feel ready again I got a media job in the new location and began to feel that I could spread my wings again and actually aim for the capital again So I did I got a longterm temporary position and there I was informed that even though it was a temporary position it was for a function that was needed Monday to Friday day in and day out as long as the channel was broadcasting This temporary position and this promise came five months before reports started coming in about people getting sick in China with symptoms like persistent cough and high fever Eight months after I had started the temporary position my service was terminated in favor of the permanent employees in the company After arguing with the authorities to get my unemployment benefits which felt like half the country was doing at the same time I found an ad for a position 220 km ca 137 miles north of the capital and I packed up my belongings and left I took a chance and hoped it would work out this time I arrived and managed to work through the probationary period before COVID19 hit with a new wave of illnesses and people were afraid to hire permanently which resulted in me being unemployed again now in a much smaller location Now misfortune also began to take a toll on my finances and I needed to take my first loan A few more months passed and a new opportunity opened up at the company I had worked for before the pandemic but this time 490 km ca 305 miles south Again I packed up my life and moved south This time everything felt good I felt satisfied and my new boss and team were happy with me But then came the date when my probationary period was to turn into permanent employment My boss checked with my colleagues and found that they were happy with me but that I sometimes disappeared when I finished my tasks and that I sometimes had difficulty reading social situations This became the basis for their decision not to continue my employment and the same thing happened again Later it was determined that I have ADHDI and that the bosss decision was therefore discrimination based on disability Life repeat it self and I moved again and this time it was a move of 200 km ca 125 miles and to make that move even possible and to cover previous expenses I had to take a loan of approximately 20000 USD or about 18000 EUR Once there I got a job where I stayed for two years before I realized there was no room for me evolving and I had to make the choice to go back to school this time focusing on ITnetworksservers This time I had just turned 36 when I started studying again and I was the second oldest in the class and felt like a fossil compared to my classmates However this time I had worked and pushed through an NPF Neuropsychiatric Disability assessment and now have a diagnosis of ADHD inattentive version and I know that with that I have the right to help in my daily life both in schoolwork and privately Today the debt is down to about 15000 USD or about 13500 EUR and I see a glimmer of light on the horizon But at the same time I know what it has cost me to get here and that it will take time to reach the metaphorical tunnel But I also feel an immense frustration that no one has taken the responsibility they should have I know very well that I cant do anything about the situation today but despite that I cant help but retrospectively grieve that my ADHD was not discovered and diagnosed earlier Who knows Then I might have completed my high school studies and gotten into higher education earlier and actually had a few years in the job market and stayed in the boat when the metaphorical waves came Sure I would have certainly gotten soaked and at times felt close to going overboard but I wouldnt have fallen into the water like a mitten at the slightest ripple of waves as I did in reality So besides feeling deprived of everything that people usually do in their twenties like traveling working as an au pair and partying I havent had the opportunity to experience all of that And now Ive met a partner who has already done everything they want to do as a young adult and who is well established in the job market and who shortly after we met was able to buy their first apartment And here I stand feeling stupid unfinished and late to the game in general when it comes to life Add to that that my partner wants to start a family soon and I who had hoped that after my education I would hopefully get a job and then do a fortyyearolds version of what I missed in my twenties no then Ill instead have to start a family and instead of spending money on vinyl records I now may have to focus on buy teething toys and baby bottles and instead of planning and comparing trips Ill instead sit and compare preschools and then when one is found start planning for the enrollment of the child It feels like Im being deprived of life and part of me feels incredibly selfish while the other sees it more evolutionary and I realize that I have it better than for example a praying mantis male who if hes not in the game dies after reproduction is completed The question is just exactly how big the difference is,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 12:43:04 UTC,2,1,0.67,,,0,0

1j7xb3h,I went to school with a little girl who was abused and I think about her every day,TW Abuse and SA content When I 20f was around 7 years old a new girl moved to my school We ended up being in the same grade and class together She wasnt overly talkative or outgoing but she was super sweet and friendly We ended up getting closer and I found out she had two siblings one younger and one older and that she just lived with her mom and her moms boyfriend She stopped coming to school often after the first year and when she did show up she would hide herself in sweaters even if it was super hot outside I didnt really notice anything out of the different because I was a kid but I think the teachers started noticing because they had mentioned it to higher staff and her mom ended up withdrawing them from school When I was around 10 news came out that the three kids were getting physically and mentally abused by their mother and her boyfriend there was even accusations of SA towards the one girl I knew from the mothers boyfriend I remember reading that he had committed murder and was on the run and that he was two provinces away from where he committed the crime They ended up catching on the where he was when he was with my friends mom and him and the mom decided to bail and move somewhere far They left the kids behind and luckily their father caught on and came and got them after years of not seeing them The poor kids were alone in the house for 2 months before being able to reach out the kids said they were too scared to leave home even though their mom and her boyfriend were gone This is the shorter end of the story but this happened just over 10 years ago and I think about it every day I hope she and her siblings are doing well,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 12:20:44 UTC,11,0,0.88,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j7v7kp,I had one of the most disturbing dreams of my life,I had a really disturbing dream last night and I feel like it carries a strong meaning It was incredibly vivid and I felt an overwhelming sense of guilt and horror throughout The dream I was sleeping in a hammock in the hall of my apartment building in my hometown when an old woman and her friends surrounded me claiming that she had left her jewelryone necklace and three ringson my hammock While I was still halfasleep I found the jewelry but she kept grabbing at me searching for it I hid the pieces because I wanted to keep them Later I ended up returning only the necklace which was worthless at the buildings front desk but I kept the rings for myself This threw me into a huge moral dilemma Then I spent what felt like an eternity waiting for my food delivery When I finally went to pick it up I found the delivery guy lying on the ground in a pool of blood his legs completely crushed Cars kept driving over him as if he wasnt even there There were two other bodies crushed beyond recognition one of them a child I was with David my childhood best friend a doctor and Sophie my best friend one year behind me in med school David went to help the injured Meanwhile Leo a former friend I used to do reckless things with appeared but he only walked beside me We greeted each other exchanged glances like we had things to catch up on but we didnt actually talk As I walked back to my apartment still holding the rings in my mouth I decided to give them to the front desk guy But when I got there the usual porter was gonethis one was heavily tattooed someone I didnt recognize Instead of taking the jewelry he encouraged me to keep the rings and spend all the money on cocaine He handed the rings back to me Then I got home and my familybut it wasnt my real family it was The Sopranoswalked in Their presence made me feel emboldened to keep the jewelry I put the rings on my fingers But then the old woman appeared again This time she confronted me directly and took the rings from me The entire dream was extremely vivid I felt a crushing sense of guilt and the violence of the crushed bodies was horrifyingI could smell the blood and flesh mixed with rain and I could hear the families crying in the distance At some pointeither in this dream or another oneI also remember seeing my father It was from a time before he was bedridden before everything went downhill He died when I was 19 after a 3 year long battle with cancer Context that might be relevant Im a last year medical student and a maybe recovering polyaddict Im like a week totally clean from everything except nicotine ketamine and weed were the last drugs I used maybe three weeks clean of a mild to moderate opiate habit Coke isnt really my thing but I had a conversation about my addiction with my roommate and cant stop reflecting about my use ever since David is my childhood best friend now a doctor Sophie is my best friend one year behind me in med school Leo was my main companion for reckless behavior including drugs For whatever reason he suddenly cut me and another friend off but recently started sending memes like nothing happened For the first time Im considering cutting him off completely Im currently watching The Sopranos This was one of the heaviest dreams Ive ever had and I cant shake the feeling that it means something important Immediately after I woke up I felt the urge to register it I was calm just felt like an uncomfortable dream but as soon as I started reading ChatGPTs output on its meaning I had a legit anxiety attack Ive had like 5 LEGIT attacks in my life and this one was textbook Hyperventilation and a physical urge to cry even though I wasnt feeling really emotional This hit me hard man It reeks of psychoanalysis so much its comical,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 10:03:57 UTC,3,0,0.72,,,0,0
1j7uunf,UPDATE My 21F boss 50M is in love with me and idk what to do,This is an update to a post I made back in October its the only other post on this account if you want to read that first I just wanted to thank everyone who responded and helped me realize it wasnt my fault All the kind words have been incredibly helpful Its been 5 months so buckle up because theres a lot to say this isnt exactly the update Im sure most of you hoped to get Its definitely not the one I thought Id get I havent received justice I probably never will In my last post I mentioned how I wasnt sure how my employers would react if I were to tell them I was assaulted Since then unfortunately another employee I work for was harassed and after months the harasser was fired Now I know theyd take it seriously but the difference is that I dont have proof I did kinda end up telling G He had asked me to work with Z and at first I agreed but after almost having a panic attack just thinking about being near him I finally got the courage to say that I didnt want to work with Z I didnt go into detail but G changed my schedule so that I wouldnt have to A couple of days after everything I was on instagram and clicked on one of those suggested accounts based on your contacts and stuff It was his poetry account and he had just posted a poem where he wrote all about me rejecting him and how people should feel bad that I didnt reciprocate his feelings but he conveniently left out the part where he assaulted me He committed a crime and then went and wrote poetry about it and posted it for people to read which is crazy I find this funny now but at the time it wasnt lol Some of my memory from that day has come back but its still mostly blocked out Its hard knowing that I might not ever know exactly what happened Even if Im not sure I want to I used up like all of my sick days after we came back for the spring semester because the thought of going back to work with that man made me physically sick Thankfully I mainly have only seen him in passing while Im working This is my last year working as a teacher I want to make it clear that Im not quitting because of him Ive been involved with this program for over a decade as both a student and an instructor and I feel like its time to close this chapter of my life I fully believe I would have come to this conclusion even if nothing had happened Im young and still trying to figure out what I want to do in life I want to take the opportunity to try out other passions of mine Im currently in the process of opening a theatre company with some friends and hope to have our first production in the fall This has been a dream of mine for years and I never thought Id actually get to do it Honestly for a moment I considered stepping away from theatre in all together It felt like he had tainted the thing I loved most Theatre was my first love and he ruined it He took the place where my happiest memories happened and made them bitter In the 5 months its been since everything happened Ive realized thats bullshit I have spent over a decade building a legacy in that department Ive broken and set records Ive advocated and I led recruiting I worked to prove to my community that the program and its students were more than just some underfunded extracurricular w kids who wanted an easy class I helped prove that they were talented and mattered The last thing I want is for my kids to think that theres one less person who cares about them because I left quietly or that their passions arent something worth pursuing because I gave up on mine He took a lot from me that day but Im not going to let him have this The 10 year old that dreamed of doing what Im doing now deserves better than that The girl that was trapped in that room when it happened deserves better than that I deserve better than that Ive hit the anger stage Im normally a very empathetic person and try to justify every bad thing a person does to me not great ik but w him I just get so angry when I see him and for once I cant think of a single reason why I shouldnt be Of course its all justified by the fact that hes starting to lash out in his own way A couple of days ago I was at a competition with my kids and I had my sister come up to me panicking because while I was helping unload equipment from our trailer he was talking to the contest manager to get my name removed from the program which meant I couldnt help them We were down 4 crew members and needed all the help we could get G had to get after him because wtf What was the point of that Later while I was helping them assemble their set they have to set up in lt7 minutes or get disqualified he pulls me aside and tells me just so you know we can be disqualified and not allowed to compete anymore if you touch anything else Dont forget youre just our assistant In a condescending voice This upset me because Ive been taking part in this competition for half of my life I know the rules I even studied the damn rulebook when I first got hired I told him actually if you look at the program for tomorrow Im listed as a director and directors are permitted to assist their students with the assembly of the set as long as students put up 70 of it Which is 100 true He didnt like my answer so I had to drag G away from where he was helping and have him say the same thing I did He was just wasting our time Its like he wanted the kids to get disqualified I explained that he was listed as just an assistant so I needed him to let me do my job because he didnt even have anything to do with our production other than suddenly showing up the day of contest to yell at the kids and stress them out he yelled at them for not moving fast enough when unloading the set even though we had arrived early to make sure we could take our time Like I said everything he does pisses me off for good reason I was definitely rude and me pulling rank is annoying but he could at least speak to me like Im adult deserving of respect rather than treating me like a child who has no idea what theyre doing I dont understand why he wants to punish me and my kids because he doesnt know how to respect boundaries and not cheat on his wife I from an area where its very conservative amp religious so It feels like the odds of someone believing me are low but I did tell my sister I knew if anyone was going to understand me it was her I was there for her when she was assaulted and its felt like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders having her by my side Im hoping to start therapy soon and begin working on how to cope with whats happened I dont know whats in store for me in terms of trying to heal and what Im going to do once I finally quit but Im sure its going to be really

1j7ungd,A letter to the girl I loved the most but never met,Throwaway account for obvious reasons This message has been sitting in my drafts for a really long time I could never find the courage to actually send it to her I dont think I can even today So here I am sending this out in the void hoping that one day it reaches her somehow After checking out her WhatsApp DP for one last time I finally decided to delete her contact as I prepare myself to let go and move on with my life From strangers to friends and now back to strangers only this time with bittersweet memories of eachother Hey I have been really thinking about everything that happened recently and I honestly dont think I can continue like this anymore I know we already discussed this before but I hadnt fully processed my emotions at that time I really care about you a lot and love you beyond words can express but this onesided attachment is going to take a huge emotional toll on me I also really hated your nonchalant behavior that day and the way you were acting so cold towards me and pushing me away like you suddenly decided your feelings have changed and we cant fit into each others lives whereas just a few days back you were telling me how you would wrap yourself around me and wouldnt let me leave the bed and all like all such moments meant absolutely nothing to you Something which I never told you last year on 31st I was so fed up by everything that had happened between us in those last few days that I just kept drinking and drinking until I finally lost consciousness right there in the club My friends had to literally put me in a wheelchair and take me back to the hotel room At times they couldnt even feel my pulse and for a moment everyone thought I was a goner The only thing I remember before passing out is wanting to talk to you on call because I just wanted to hear your voice one last time I truly believe God gave me this second chance at life for a reason and I am going to make the most out of it With everything going on especially with you moving to UK this year we would be emotionally distanced even further and eventually things are going to fade away and we both know it It is the start of a new chapter in your life soon and for me too as I will have to learn to live without you Our lives are just pulling us in different directions at this point You were right We have very different personalities backgrounds values and our future goals dont align either That is a gap which is difficult to bridge I really respect your feelings and boundaries and I have finally come to accept the unfortunate reality that things have changed between us now I dont want either of us to continue holding on to something halfheartedly I truly believe that destiny brought us together and meeting you was a part of my journey I am really grateful to you because I never knew I was capable of loving someone so much and that too without expectations until I met you What we shared was real and meaningful and I will always cherish those memories After all we shared a bond that has lasted for almost a decade without ever physically meeting each other But despite all this things never really took off which is why I think maybe we were never actually meant to be together but only to be a part of each others journeys I will really miss you Janhavi I will miss our chats and vc and how I was always able to be myself around you I will miss waiting for your text for days and months every time we had a fight how my day used to light up after seeing your text first thing in the morning how my heart used to melt after hearing your sweet voice how I used to play your voice notes again and again every time I missed you how I struggled to keep up because you talk so fast how I used to secretly steal glances at you when we were on vc how my heart used to skip a beat after randomly receiving your text in the middle of the night how I used to play my favorite songs to you on Spotify to convey my deeper feelings how you used to always come back to me after every fight and we would start talking again like nothing happened how you used to secretly install Kik on your moms phone every night to chat with me and I used to stay awake waiting for you sometimes even till morning how you made chocolates on my birthday and then ate them yourself on vc how we used to send each other those disaster selfies how you used to fall asleep on vc while talking and I used to continue admiring you sleeping how Sab Tera is still my favorite song even today because it was the one you sang to me how we had Maggi at 3 AM on vc and you made fun of me for having a cupcake with it and so many more such cute memories that I cant even possibly list them all here but these memories will always be a part of me and I will carry them with me forever It was pure innocent love at its best My life somehow always felt complete with you and stupid me always believed you were the one and that you were my soulmate and that one day I would definitely marry you Its funny because I cant even tell you how many times I have rehearsed this whole scene in my head about how I would propose you But I was wrong In the end it was all in my head and you already had someone else in your life all these years I dont blame you though and neither do I hold any grudge against you because of it You will always be a huge part of my life regardless and someone who helped me understand love much more deeply and helped me grow as a person I will always be thankful to you for that I only regret that I never got to meet you in real life But then again I still believe you are an angel and it wasnt just your username and thats why I could never meet you You came into my life for a reason but now is the time for me to let go If it is meant to be I am sure God will bring our paths together once again maybe in this lifetime or the next But until then this is where we must both go our separate ways I wish you all the happiness in life and hope you can forgive me if I have ever hurt you in any way Good vibes only Goodbye my favorite stranger PS I am sorry for deleting our Spotify playlist yet

1j7tujn,Parents sat me and my little brother down for a talk and now my whole world is falling apart Update,Hello I know its been forever since my original post I honestly dont even know how to start this off Since my original post was 2 months ago I figured an update was probably needed since I left so much in the dark Over these 2 months my dad has moved out and is living somewhere else me and my brother go over there after school and hang out until our mom can pick us up They still act cordial in front of me and Tyler but they have so much built up tension its concerning But on new years or like at 1ish on January 1st I tried to talk to my dad since he and tyler my little brother got into an argument about lighting off fireworks I had gone downstairs since I thought I could talk to my dad and get his side of the story and just talk since he is my dad But he had been drinking way way more than I have ever seen my dad drink before So when I went to talk to him things took a sideways turn My dad had ended up saying some words and the words he said still really fucking hurt What he said to me really cut deep he told me I hate my life Im stuck in a shitty job a shitty marriage I have a son who treats his mom like shit and then you I have a daughter who is a piece of shit When I found out I was going to have a daughter as my first kid I was so excited I thought i would have a daughter who loved to fish hunt and ve hardworking instead I got a fucking snowflake of a daughter who doesnt like anytbing is a worthless lazy piece of shit who expect her parents to bend over backwards for her I got a daughter who doesnt give a fuck and is just nothing but a bitch That cut so fucking deep and I hear those words in the back of my mind so much And I havent even really had a chance to really process the whole split with my parents Because right after I was told my mom told me that I had to ve strong for my brother since this is really hard for him So I had to grow up and swallow the fact that my parents are taking a break So I tried to turn to my boyfriend now ex for comfort and support Instead I got a couple comforting words and hum telling me its going to ve okay then he proceeded to tell me about his problems and how he got shot in the knee if anyone wants the story on this shit please let me know because at this point I need to talk because I cant afford a therapist and Im going to explode if I dont let this shit out I havent gotten a break since this whole problem at Christmas I get a Christmas present of my parents splitting I start the new year with my dad telling me he hates me Later I finally have enough with my toxic boyfriend and decide to leave him and the police end up getting involved literally the only good thing about any of this shit is that I currently have a new boyfriend who is loving and supportive and doesnt gaslight verbally and mentally abuse me and will actually listen to me and all my problems And I had my 15th in February as well If anyone wants more context I have much more but its currently 219 in the morning and I havent gotten a good nights sleep in about a week and a half Thank you to anyone and everyone who takes the time to read this mess of words I hope you all have an amazing daynight,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 08:19:15 UTC,751,29,0.95,,,0,0

1j7t010,I ruminate about my past sexual partners,I 24F have been with my current boyfriend for six months I lost my virginity when I was 18 to my then boyfriend whom I loved very much However it took us 6 months of trying because he had ED he was a porn addict I think We had sex maybe 10 times jn the year we were together but we did other things Throughout our relationship I did some things I wasnt comfortable with just to appease him to not appear an unexperienced and undesirable virgin It was a toxic relationship that traumatized me and I took his inability to perform personally I thought I was broken and ugly A year later I got into another relationship that fixed my issues with sex made me feel normal and desirable hot beautiful but we werent a good fit so I broke it off I then got SAd by my first boyfriends best friend which ruined me I was a normal girl before So in total not counting the rape I had 5 partners before my current boyfriend and a few 23 almosts My problem was I found a guy we dated a few months then it turned out they had ED so we couldnt go all the way I would then rush into sex with the next guy to prove to myself that I can have sex like a normal person and try to build a relationship from there obviously its not how it works I would also wait quite a while between partners a year 6 months a year and a half so I always felt disconnected anxious stressed This is the first time I feel normal I wished to have a normal relationship and now I do But I feel dirty and used I hate myself for not knowing better for not coping better for finding sex empowering and cool He knows and thinks I have little experience he is very non judgmental I have flashbacks of things Ive done pictures Ive sent just my first bf no one has or should have material of me unless it was against my will but I still worry some could be brought up Its nothing out of the ordinary I guess its just that I was pressured and not myself I have no regrets about the experiences I chose for myself but about the ones I was pressured into I dont know how to stop judging myself for this,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 07:13:11 UTC,0,2,0.5,,,0,0
1j7syzk,Ive been parenting since I was 8,Heres my dumb story maybe someone will read it Ive never told anyone And Im feeling lonely as hell When I was 2 my mom had my little sister People tell me I was very withdrawn that once my sister came around I almost stopped crying completely and that is was creepy I got older most of my memories that I remember I was always by myself Getting myself ready for school walking myself to the bus stop half a mile away in the dark For kindergarten When I was 7 my mom had my little brother After that I dont have many memories of her outside her room I watched him and my sister for a few hours when he was a newborn As he got older she left me in charge of him more and more often By the time I was 8 I took care of my siblings from wake up to bedtime most days if I was home Mom never left her room anymore pr sometimes she would be gone for a few days to a week summertimes or weekends I was their parent I held them fed them parented them When my sister started school that year it stressed me out that my brother would be home alone And I would get physically ill from the stress and worry It helped because I would be sick but still at home for my brother Thankfully though he was always ok when I got home In fact I was pretty sure that mom was out of her room while we were at school But as soon as we came home she was in her room and our brother was playing alone in our room As we got older I was expected to keep up the house If it wasnt it pristine condition I would get punished Better not to go into detail but there were physical punishments and mental punishments the worst For example if my mom ate something at midnight I would get in trouble that the kitchen wasnt cleaned the next morning I took care of my siblings cooked all the meals cleaned the house and deep cleaned weekly yet I was somehow alwasy yelled at punished grounded In case anyone is wondering where my dad is Gone usually He would be home once a month and those were my best memories then he was gone for work but later I found out he would use this time to drink himself into hospitals That was my life from 10 to 15 We moved around a lot too so I couldnt keep any friends especially because I developed severe social anxiety from some of moms mental punishments My mom loved to make me grounded whenever I actually had any plans After turning down any new friends invitation 3 times in a row they usually stopped calling me My sister was becoming a mess She was a feisty girl alwasy fighting and looking for trouble but also lonely and looking for friends to fill the hole that I just could not fill no matter how hard I tried Her problems came from severe bullying and she tried so hard to make friends At the time I would stress and yell at her try to stop her from sneaking out stop her from texting boys I would get into fights with her all the time just to eat now Im looking back and I wish I just hugged her and was there for her instead Shes moved out as soon as she turned 17 no contact with anyone but me and our brother She has lots of friends now My brother was the most creative and smartest kid ever He was reading drawing and playing mine craft lol before 5 years old But he was emotionally unstable because he only had me as an example of how to act I tried to parent him but its hard when you didnt have a parent yourself He became violent and would harm himself as a kid until I took parenting classes at 16 and was able to help him get better Now hes the sweetest kid I swear Hes still super smart and wants to become a computer engineer At 15 to 17 I found a good stable job that paid well I babysat and did odd jobs since I was 10 because I needed money for clothes but now I worked part time went to school took a college class school paid for each term parented my siblings to the best of my ability managed the house but my siblings did their share now still cooked all the meals took my siblings to all their events bought all their clothes and food caring for my mentally unstable grandmotherlong story and also my parents who decdecid I was old enough to become a mediator for their fights Still get physically and mentally abused by my mother too I had panic attacks every week sometimes up to 3 times a week I would have nosebleeds I would never cry or process my emotions and it caught up to me now At 17 I met him My now ex husband He was alwasy an asshole but I saw him as some sort of savior back then This 21 year old man Not going to even go into that My sister didnt and still doesnt like him He asked me to marry him when I was still 17 and I was too scared to say no We got married when I was 18 a year of being together It was stupid He got me pregnant just as I started college I found out only now he poked a fucjing hole in a condom After having our child his behavior got worse and it got to the point he started threatening to beat me and stuff So that was my life from 18 to 21 It took me that long to get the courage to leave So here I am about to turn 22 soon hiding in my new apartment with my daughter and my brother My brother now 14 acts like hes protecting me and I dont even have the heart to tell him that hes staying with me because he has nowhere to go either My parents dont take care of him I count him as my own anyway Like sucks But Ive got my 2 kids with me If youve read this

1j7qybi,My husband cheated on me and I decided to stay But now I just want another man to notice me,I understand I am a bad person I know that I am no better than my husband but I just cannot handle the lack of validation and love anymore I 23F got married last summer to my husband 25M who proposed to me after two years together A month later I found out hed been sexting girls on an anonymous website He had a whole separate email set up for these accounts he had There were hundreds of messages He cried claimed it was an addiction he was struggling with since he was young I was devastated I had never felt so much pain before in my life I still have flashbacks to that day dryheaving and sobbing after finding out the love of my life was off fantasizing about fucking moms and older women while avoiding having sex with me I always considered him the exception to men a devoted man who could never hurt me He swore hed never hurt me He knew I had family trauma related to cheating my dad cheated on my mom my entire upbringing and yet he still made that decision I made the decision to stay I think because of shame I really did think there was something wrong with me to have caused him to turn his back on me But also we come from a very religious very cultural community It isnt easy being divorced But I havent been the same since Its been almost eight months and although Ive gotten good at masking it I have not moved from that pit that Ive dug myself into I go to work as usual I hang out with my friends do what needs to be done My husband has to leave for work for months at a time so hes currently gone That leaves me a lot of time to sulk around in my thoughts Hes really trying to be a better person I just never really know what hes up to So I feel emotionally detached in a way I would have never imagined possible with him What kills me most is that Ive started developing a weird desire to be acknowledged Not by my husband by other men I want somebody to look at me see beauty and intellect like he used to when we first met I want someone to fall in love with me all over again And God I just crave a relationship where I dont even have to think about cheating I know a lot of people will tell me my marriage is doomed and that Im a shit person too And I know that may all be true but this is my reality currently I havent been able to speak to anyone about this ever and so Im here to vent I am trying to start therapy again something my husband is against mind you But I am doing it behind his back because I deem it necessary but that process is taking a while EDIT Those of you who keep messaging me with the intent of starting an affair or taking advantage of my vulnerability please think before you shoot me a message Women are allowed to talk about a situation like this and not still somehow be reduced to a form of sexual gratification I am not using this post to beg for attention I am simply getting it off of my chest looking for advice perhaps Its 2025 understand that there is nuance,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 04:50:28 UTC,114,42,0.87,,,0,0
1j7qxvt,I want to contact someone from my past but am scared of being rejected,I 23f havent spoken to an old friend of mine in almost six years and have some unresolved feelings regarding him We met in middle school and became friends pretty quickly It was never the type of friendship where I hung out with him outside of school or knew his favorite color or anything yet I always felt pretty close to him and there was never a quiet moment During middle school everything was pretty smooth sailing However in the beginning of high school we started having more minor arguments At the time I couldnt pinpoint my intense emotions regarding him but I now realize that I definitely had feelings for him but had too little experience and too many insecurities to even acknowledge it Even though we argued often he normally was a very kind and considerate person Things came to a head when he said something hurtful to me during an argument and I distanced myself for a while out of fear of being disliked He did try to approach me like normal during this time but would get frustrated when I distanced myself I found out later on that he confided in some close mutual friends about this too We eventually reconciled and discussed the issue but it was never quite the same Then we graduated and I havent seen him since It was kind of hard to deal with because he was the type of person that felt like the world kept purposely inserting him into my life I feel like I lost someone who I shouldnt have Briefly after high school he unfollowed me and removed me as a follower on social media but did not block me Hes the type of guy that still follows his exes and ex friends so I dont understand why After the last six years of no contact I tried to follow him on social media a few months ago and he accepted and followed me back I dont even really care if he never liked me in that way because I never thought that he did I want these unresolved feelings of confusion to go away and to understand his point of view during that time He isnt the type to shy away or be closed off about his emotions so I know hed be truthful However it has been so long since weve spoken so I am scared of how he will react He is someone I miss being around a lot,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 04:49:43 UTC,1,0,0.6,,,0,0
1j7qxs5,I let my sister blame me for he ED disorder,So my sister had anorexia during highschool She had to go to an eating disorder facility to get her back on track Before her ED got serious she would always blame me for it she still does to this day When I loved out of the house she relapsed and had to go back She continued to blame me for it This has destroyed my mental health She became really health obsessed when a family member lifted her a fit bit She would walk all day and compete with said family member I cant tell her that was the start of it I cant take the blame longer,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 04:49:32 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0
1j7qxko,Timeless heirloom,My birthday is coming up next month I m 32 plan to get myself a pink diamond tennis necklace or a pink diamond pendant Pink is my fav color and the meaning of love and what pink represents really means alot to me but also has alot of unrelated meaning like as a male learning to not give a fuck what other people have to say 6 years ago I bought myself an amethyst necklace from mexico I love it I also bought myself a pink diamond tennis bracelet Around that time Id thought Id have kids mainly a daughter and I could pass down my timeless heirloom as something to be remembered by by the one person in my life who will look at me like something they never ever want to lose 6 years later Im nowhere near a child and I still hold onto those heirlooms potentially bound to wound up in a landfill or on someones desk who just looks at it as costume jewelry Its interesting how much an item can tell a story more than a price I like to think items cost more than dollar value but rather hold a lifetime of sentimental value to the person who made it to the person who originally bought it,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 04:49:10 UTC,1,0,0.6,,,0,0
1j7qxgb,I hate being trans so much,feeling bad about myself tonight I guess and I just needed to scream into the void with the chance of someone seeing it and maybe feeling a little bit of pity idk if this resonates Im really sorry for anyone feeling the same way I do Im an 18 year old trans dude I live in a pretty accepting area so I know a lot of trans people around me almost every trans dude I know has been able to be on testosterone since they were lt16 and their parents use their chosen name and pronouns or their dead namenickname with their permission Im so fucking jealous Im so jealous Im so jealous Ive been out for 45 years at this point I believe and my mom barely does the bare minimum and my dad doesnt try at all i hate when my dad calls me this one or that one to not use my name the one time five years ago I had the naivety to believe hed actually listen to me was the last time I ever talked to him about it I ended up shaking and crying and hyperventilating on the floor while he screamed at me about how Im ungrateful and that I have a good life and I dont deserve it five years ago I asked my mom to stop using theythem because those arent my fucking pronouns and she simply deflected and told me shes trying her best and I believed it because shes my mother I asked about starting testosterone a few months after my transition and she basically told me being trans was a trend and notsosubtly hinted that she didnt think I was a boy because lots of girls think theyre transgender nowadays my dad tells new people that this is deadname but they go by name and only use sheher I know when my parents talk about me they use my dead name and sheher I know both of them have my dead name as their phone contact its sort of cringe looking back but a couple years ago I made a tiktok post basically saying I wish I were born a boy and my mom sent me a multiple paragraph email about how I was gaslighting her I was 15 years old Ive grown to accept it and that acceptance fucking hurts that acceptance is the only way Ill survive its just the way my parents are they claim to be accepting of everyone until its their own fucking kid its nights like these where I sit and think and I know I have to tamp these thoughts down or else they will fucking consume me because if my parents cant love me for who I am who fucking can my ex came out as a lesbian immediately after breaking up with meeither they didnt love me at all or never saw me as a man the worst part is is that anyone who fucking looks at me thinks Im either a girl or knows Im transgender and I know they dont see me as a man and I know theyll use theythem and it sucks that Ive developed such a visceral reaction to those pronouns being used on me because I know what it means I know theyre just being nice i know I dont sound or look or act like a man my back hurts constantly from binding because my mom passed down her D cups to me and I cannot go out without binding or else Im viscerally uncomfortable i dont even mind having the wrong genetalia people cant see that when they look at me i dont mind being ugly or fat but I hate my voice I hate my breasts i hate my face and I hate the way everyone fucking knows and I have to be grateful all the time i have to be grateful or else everything else will be taken from me the scrap of respect I have will be gone the moment I bring it up to my parents or my friends or anyone because I know Ill just be seen as that annoying trans guy who cant stop reminding people or that ungrateful brat who doesnt know how good he has it Im grateful my parents didnt kick me out Im grateful that they dont treat me with hostility but what else should I be grateful that they project their dead daughter on to me should I thank them for all of these nights spent sobbing because no one will ever love me for who I am because time and time again its been proven that is the case i have to be happy and unbothered and proud for who I am because what a joy it is to be part of a community who accepts me for who I am except they dont except I know what they see me as no matter how hard I try i dont hate my life I dont hate my parents I dont hate my friends i just wish things were different i wish I was more comfortable in my own skin and I wish I didnt have to curl up on myself and hide my sobs from my father so he doesnt start screaming at me once more because I learn my lesson because I know what will happen the whole post is sort of edgy sorry Ive been on edge and anxious and sad this whole weekend because of something that happened the other day if you made it this far thanks i dont really need advice I just needed somewhere to air everything out before popped yknow,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 04:48:56 UTC,0,8,0.47,,,0,0
