1j67irz,i feel like i cant find love.,i m21 am in my last semester of undergrad. so far in college career ive been on 0 dates had 0 sex and i also havent had my first kiss yet. anytime a friend would ask how i was doing with girls i would say that i didnt have time because i was taking 18 hours every semester. partially that was true. depending on classes it could be a particularly timeintensive thing. though i would try to get involved on campus whenever i could. i guess long story short all my friends have had this stuff fall into their laps. i dont know why i havent been so lucky. im worried that im past the point where having no experience is fine and now its leaning into sad territory. i think im decently attractive and funny so i dont know what my issue is. i am going to grad school very far from my whole support system and where im in undergrad. im afraid the work load there will put me in a similar position to not be able to do anything. i dont know i guess im just throwing this out there.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 02:53:54 UTC,1,2,1.0,,,0,0
1j61gx2,i need advice,to start off im 27f with a 22m boyfriend. weve been together for almost 3 years and we met due to working together. i still cringe at our 5 year age gap. i have a friend that is 30f and i dont know if i am a complete ahole for wanting to cut ties with her or maybe i already accidentally did. the last time i saw her i ended up staying for a weekend which was fun at first and we tried to drink but we both fell asleep too fast which her boyfriend got mad about. i did not like this boyfriend 36m due to him constantly sleeping with his ex and being so obvious about it but shed be in this denial or whatever and cry to me constantly about it. he was also somewhat a neglectful parent to his daughter from what my friend would tell me. so anyways the next day came and i agreed to stay an extra day to watch her two daughters and figured id be getting paid because we discussed it prior. well i didnt and during this i ended up getting bed bug bites on my neck hands and ankle area. pretty much where my skin was exposed. since leaving there i still feel like i have bugs on my skin and im honestly afraid to ever go back. i dont know why i pick and choose when to be confrontational because i just let left and didnt say anything. i dont know whether to say anything at all. weve talked about bedbugs before and shes said shes gotten rid of them so i dont know what to say. fast forward a few days and she tells me her and her boyfriend 36m broke up and shes back together with an ex 32m. this ex 32m was sleeping with a 17 year old girl and my friend 30f let both of them move into her home with her two children before they both just dipped and apparently had left the place trashed and thats when the bedbugs originally came about around this time too. oh and that man32m knew her children for a few months and was having them call him daddy. i felt so uncomfortable witnessing all of this and then seeing what she allows herself and her children to be put through willingly. for months i was telling her xyz was not right and shed be defending herself and him 36m until they broke up. at that point is when she is like oh i could never be with someone who does xyz and completely shitting on this man talking about everything she defended and excused when she put up with it for months and would have continued to put up with it if he 36m didnt have his baby momma over again to stay the night after she had been begging him to stop for months doing that for months. so im just over it? im like why are you actively choosing to put yourself through these things? i dont like to sugar coat things because why the hell should i act like neglecting a child is okay just to be a girls girl? their relationship wasnt abusive or anything like that a lot of accusations of cheating coming from both amp issues starting a few days after they began dating which is never a good sign but neither were afraid of each other it wasnt like that and she will put up with almost anything to keep a guy around and thats my issue. i used to think she was a good mom but i dont think shes that great anymore. i used to praise her when she would say she wouldnt let strangers around her kids and doesnt let anyone else watch her kids until i realized shes letting men she just met meet her kids inside her home and be around them unsupervised. i used to think she was a good mom until i realized she raises her daughters through sugar and electronics and doesnt really watch even though around her children. all of these realizations have come to me now after she broke up with her long term boyfriend of 2 years34m and have gone through 45 relationships in a year and i dont think shes the person i thought she was and i feel awful but i dont want to be around someone like that. so she has her new boyfriend ex boyfriend 32m currently living with her again and i sent her a message a couple days ago saying i think that hes a pedophile and i dont want to be around him to which shes never responded but has sent other things. i know that once her and her current boyfriend 32m break up or start having issues she will be wanting my pity party but i cant do it anymore. i feel like i have no empathy for her anymore. if we had more to talk about than her and her relationships i feel like it wouldnt be such an issue but she has no subsidence to her at all if it is not about a man. any advice on what you would do in my situation? its not my life so i dont know why im so bothered.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 21:57:32 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j674ys,the past few weeks have shown me that life will continue without me.,specifically that my animals will be ok. one dog will go to my parents. one will go to my friends who are obsessed with her breed and if they find her another home awesome. my bird will either go to the local zoo or the house down the street. my cat can literally go anywhere. i am not needed. i promised my therapist i would reach out if i was planning anything. i lied. the gun in the house is gone but i still have the ability to purchase one amy day id like. work doesnt need me. we all know we are expendable at our jobs but its been hard for me to accept. but theres no other way to reconcile the fact that ive been at my job longer than two employees who have become managers and yet im nothing. im useless. im dispensable. im nothing. im about done.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 02:32:47 UTC,0,1,0.5,,,0,0
1j66syz,honestly this is how i am learning to cope with being singlelonely for a long time,i hate to say that i am that guy who has been single for a really long time despite my best efforts but i am. i 27m havent even been lucky enough to go on a date in like 5 or 6 years but i have not given up hope even though things do look a bit bleak for me at the moment. i am a really busy graduate student i try to fit in workouts and other activities too but it is pretty hard. i do not have a lot of extra energy left to put in substantial effort to find the right person for me on most weeks. so the thing i kinda wanted to get off my chest is i have been working on conceptswriting for a fantasy novel for a while when i get some time alone. with my life being romantically unfulfilled i have fit in a relationship between two characters the mc and another to fulfill all the things that i have dreamed about. it was not really part of my original ideas for the story but it kinda just happened. its pretty much all wholesome relationship stuff that i have never really got to have the hand holding the closeness sharing feelings tender moments having each others back etc. as lame as it sounds it has been decently fulfilling for me. there are still days that i really could use a hug even from a friend but there is something about getting all the stuff i have always wanted on paper that has been pretty nice and comforting. even though adding this stuff in has been satisfying for me i am a little afraid it makes the writing worse lol and when its all finished it makes me that much more afraid to show it to anyone. some of my friends know i have been working on this but have no idea theres romance involved in it. i just really wanted to get off my chest i have been vicariously living out my romantic dreams through my fictional characters because i do not really have a better outlet. i think its been a healthy way to express what i am missing out on?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 02:14:59 UTC,4,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j66ms7,my friend has a new boyfriend and i hate it,i know it probably sounds like im in love with this friend but im not. im married and happy. but this boyfriend is an ex friend and ex boyfriend of mine and i was really close to them. they were my first friend in my new highschool where i didnt know anyone. one day a couple years ago they texted me saying all this mean stuff and telling me that we werent friends anymore. they also didnt tell me what i did. it hurt so bad for years and im just now getting over it and i was doing good until i saw my friend posting about their new boyfriend and seeing my exs face just hit me. even after we had broken up we were great friends and hung out almost every day until that text. a really big part of me wants to stop being friends with the current friend or at least keep my distance until i feel like im ready. i dont know what im going to do. honestly i might just block them after sending an explanation. im a bad person after all so they probably shouldnt be friends with me. someone please help,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 02:05:57 UTC,0,2,0.33,,,0,0
1j65zll,update i 23m still love my ex 24f and i dont know if she feels the same,so we made the plans and i asked if it was a date or not to my surprise she said it was which is just awesome to me. we met on the train heading to the neatest city to us i had zero idea where i was being taken but it was a small café not too far from a park and museum. we sat in there for around an hour before walking around the park and just talking the weather did start to turn a little dreary so we went to the museum and listened to an organ for a bit before just walking around to see what had changed since wed last been there they removed all the old armourswords and replaced them with old chairs? towards the end we walked back through the city and got on the train. i got off two stops later than i should have just so i could walk her to her car and then we headed our separate ways. all in it was a pretty fun day and were thinking of going out for dinner next time.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 01:32:06 UTC,5,3,0.73,,,0,0
1j65j6m,my family hate that i go to bed earlier than them and i hate that they expect me to not do it,i wake up 430am on weekdays to go to work so i have dinner at 7 go to bed at 8 so i can decompress and relax to then sleep at 93010. my family has been having dinner at 830 for about a month now because one of my sisters gets off work at 8 and theyve been expecting me to wait for them but if i do so i would be going to bed at 9930 giving me little to no time to decompress and relax to finally sleep at a decent hour. pretty much 23 days they ask me if i want take out for dinner and everytime i say no because i cant wait for them because it gets late pretty quickly and everytime they get annoyed at my answer. today a spin off of a show that we watch all together premiere and now my mom is complaining we wont get to watch it because i dont wanna eat dinner with them anymore. is it so hard to empathize a little and understand i have to wake up very early to go to work? like why are they like this?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 01:08:41 UTC,252,42,0.97,,,0,0
1j65iqy,i got terminated from my volunteer position with no explanation,so i 18f just finished volunteering for the day at my workplace animal sanctuary yesterday when i got a message from my boss to see he sent me a termination letter nothing in the message either just the letter itself and they have ignored me since. also sorry this is a long one i just have a lot of things in my head i need to sort out. so a bit of backstory since i was around 14 ive been dealing with the struggles of depression anxiety and adhd and ended up leaving school in yr10 because of it. took a while to figure out but i ended up going to tafe to complete my cert ii and iii to become a qualified zookeeper as ive always loved animals and cant see myself doing anything else. because of tafe i had to start volunteering to complete the practical component of my course and ended finding this amazing sanctuary to work at. so i ended up starting there in early february 2024 and fell in love with the place and the people. i was originally going once a week but started going twice a week in around november bc i loved it so much and wanted to be there more. they always told me they loved how i would be there consistently every week and i would pride myself on it as it was a big commitment for me as i lived an hour away. the environment there was great honestly i couldnt have asked for it to be any better. the owners always quite involved and prided themselves on this and wanted us to feel more like family rather than a workplace. because of this i became quite close with the people who were on my days and considered them my second family. the owners also lived on site and their kids were always around because of this i became quite close with them as well even buying them small presents for their birthdays and helping them with their homework. i suppose im telling you this so you understand how close i was with them their family and the other volunteers so you can understand how hurt i am by the way theyve handled this situation. even on my bad days they were half the reason id get up in the morning even when i didnt want to drive or talk to people id still show up bc i didnt want to let them down as again i seen them as my second family and greatly valued their opinion. so fast forward back to yesterday it was completely normal. nothing out of the ordinary we were still talking like normal doing all our tasks as normal having lunch together like normal i even got a last minute tour and stayed back to finish it up which brought in a fair bit of money for them. also just a note its a nonprofit all the money from tours goes right back into the sanctuary to care for the animals food and water vet bills etc. so just my little routine afterwards i stop on the way home to go to the bathroom get food etc. so i was checking my phone like normal and seen he sent me an attachment funny thing is i thought he was sending me a dumb reel or something. boy did i have a rude awakening when i read termination letter. so naturally i read through it and start crying because again that day was normal there was not even a hint that something like this was coming. luckily i had one of my friends with me so i didnt do something dumb like driving with so many tears in my eyes i could barely see and probably getting into an accident. in the letter he basically highlighted the fact that he wants to maintain a positive workplace and while he values my input he needs to put the sanctuary first blah blah blah the typical things in a letter that would put the blame on me so he doesnt seem like the bad guy. so one important thing to mention they say this to everyone but from the start they said that theyre the kind of workplace to make sure everyones included and dont like people to form cliques. however i became really close to two people in particular specifically because theyre great friends and have done so much for me. now while i was really close with these two i feel we included everyone when we could. especially since some days at the sanctuary wed be so busy wed barely see each other that day. so wed always go out for lunch however wed always ask everyone if they wanted anything and never ate out always came back to be a part of the whole team. wed all have a break at the same time. now obviously being friends wed hang out after work but again wed ask some people if theyd wanna come if we werent going too far away. and we would call and stuff but i feel its normal for friends to do that. so one thing i could see where they wouldnt have been to happy with this is that we were doing an animal course about 5 hours away. you have to finish the online part first before you go do the practical bit. so one of my friends told the boss that we were going to be doing it he already done it prior and was just driving us and unlike the last time it was done they didnt put it on the group chat or anything for people to say theyre interested. i think they assumed wed tell people that we were doing it and ask if theyd want to come. mind you this was about a month in advance so plenty of time for people to do the online section. i will say this course ends up being quite expensive so some people werent able to do it due to financial reasons anyway. anyways long story short one other person from the sanctuary ended up doing the course btw the course only has 4 spots for the prac part. we had a great time and included him in nearly everything we did he traveled separately to us so was only left out of stuff we did on the way. we even had a game night and everything and really the only people who were left out were the people who couldnt come but wanted to which i dont blame them for. i can only assume that this is the reason they fired us my friend that drove was quitting next week was going to be his last however they messaged him yesterday basically telling him to not come back and my other friend also got a letter similar to mine. again i was completely blindsided by this as yesterday and even the last few weeks were completely normal. no they didnt even try to chat with us saying something like hey this is what we can see is happening and we dont like it can you just try to include the other people more. something like that and i wouldnt have been as devastated. the only other thing it might be is that i would make some pretty crude jokes although i wasnt the only one that would say them and me and my boss would say them to each other and everything were aussie btw its part of our culture i suppose if we dont know you or dont like you well be quite civilpolite to you but if we do like you then youll probably cop it. although i dont think this was the problem bc again it wasnt just me making these jokes. i guess what hurts the most is that i really respected my boss and viewed both of them quite highly. like theyre great people at least i use to think so theyre great parents really community oriented and from what ive heard quite highly regarded in our field. so basically for him to not even have the decency to even send me a message along with the letter it is what hurt the most. so naturally i sent them both a message asking them to give me a call bc for my own peace of mind i really need an explanation. both of them i assume accidentally opened the message and i can see they read it however they both ignored it. so i sent them an email this morning however still waiting on a reply. ive never been through a breakup but i imagine itd be like this except instead of breaking up with one person ive just lost my second family. with no warning no explanation. anyways thanks for listening to me ramble sorry it was so long im just kind of at a loss for now. hopefully ill stop crying and get out of bed soon. thank youse heart_hands tldr i was volunteering at an animal sanctuary when i got a termination letter from my boss with no warning no explanation. i feel like ive lost my second family.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 01:08:02 UTC,4,4,0.83,,,0,0

1j657gu,am i being used?,am i being used? do i 26f need a reality check? ive been friends with my friend blake 26m for over a year now. we have been pretty close since the beginning. when we first met we bonded over our shared love for playing soccer together and music. i would say we have many similarities. we both enjoy adult animation like studio ghibli raves and playing board games. since we shared many similarities we kept in touch daily through text messages phone calls and facetime. we had a mutual friend named jennifer. jennifer and i were very close until i noticed that whenever we spent time together she spoke negatively about everyone around her. as a result i gradually distanced myself from her. around the same time jennifer and blake started dating. although i wasnt close to jennifer and didnt personally like her i wanted blake to be happy. blake and i maintained a consistent relationship and communication. we talked every day even during our lunch breaks via facetime. however things took a turn when jennifer informed blake that i had feelings for him and wanted to pursue a romantic relationship with him. that was not the case and i was even in a relationship at the time. as a result blake ended our communication to preserve his relationship with jennifer. we did not talk for eight months. however in january he reached out to me. he told me that jennifer suddenly broke up with him in december. since then weve been hanging out again. in february we attended a rave and ended up having sex that night. a week later we confessed to each other that we had both harbored feelings for one another since weve first met. at this point i informed him that i didnt want to be a rebound and he responded by stating that he wasnt ready for a relationship and wanted to focus on healing. i accepted his decision. we continued spending time together and continued having sex. however i later told him that i no longer wanted to have sex with him because i was struggling to separate our friendship and romantic feelings. around the same time his exgirlfriend jennifer filed a protective order against blake. sidebar personally i have had past experiences with abusive men which may have influenced my perspective. however i must admit that i am not entirely aware of the details of jennifer and blakes relationship. given jennifers personality i cant help but wonder if this situation is a attentionseeking ploy. on the other hand i have only heard blakes side of the story. however i suggested that we establish boundaries. we agreed to refrain from having sex and i told him i need a break from constant communication. i also told him to fine another trusted friend to confide in about the jennifer situation because i havent healed from my own trauma from the abusive i had endured. blake expressed his agreement to the physical boundaries and expressed he didnt want to lose me again and our friendship. since implementing these boundaries our relationship has undergone a significant change. we dont talk that much anymore and when we do the protective order case seems to be the main topic of discussion. although last night i visited blakes place to watch star wars. during the movie he asked me to engage in a platonic cuddle. we did and he said thank you. i inquired about the reason behind his gratitude. he mentioned that my presence was naturing and made him feel less lonely. am i only in his life because he feels lonely?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:52:22 UTC,2,4,1.0,,,0,0
1j652ed,my husband had a thing for a dog and now im rethinking him as a person,three weeks ago me 28f and my husband 29m went out to a bar. when we got there we happened to run into a middle school friend of his. we got to talking and his friend was sharing stories about when they were in middle school together. like the time his friend walked into the wrong restroom by mistake and was made fun or for a year and when my husband got hard asking out a girl after a few more embarrassing and funny stories his friend who well call jeff says hey remember that dog. i think you can see where this is going. my husband started breaking down laughing and i was totally confused. so i asked what dog jeff explained in sixth grade wasiswhatever the terminology is a zoophilia he was sexually interested in a dog named champion he didnt do anything but got a boner after he was playing with this dog. he and his friend shocked about it for a while but he kept taking pictures of this dog. it started to move from joking territory to creepy. three months later he attempted to kidnap the dog. thankfully jeffs father the owner of the dog caught him. is it weird that im reconsidering my marriage even though this hasnt been a problem in decades. my whole view of my husband has changed so am i over reacting to my husbands middle school issues?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:45:17 UTC,2640,425,0.95,,,0,0
1j64ucy,the animation industry is making me think dark thoughts.,hello. im posting this on here because anywhere else i could be found out. im a recent graduate who studied animation. i want to be a character animator working with studios or even just contract freelance work. but nobody is hiring juniors or graduates. i aced my grades. ive been given compliments on my reel. i have connections. i did some experience only to be ghosted. linkedin and indeed are only posting senior lead or principal positions even if its a mid position they wont hear back from you. even when i reached out to people they said they liked my work but werent hiring. in 202324 i reached out to over 115 places. from 2023 to now i have a spreadsheet and im on application 724. axis studios shut down technicolor and its subsidiaries shut down so now theres an even bigger pool. i feel hopeless. i feel empty. people telling me that ai will take over me too theres nothing anymore. all ive ever seen myself as is an animator and if i cant be that i dont see myself doing anything else and i cant fathom doing anything else that its making me think horrible things. that if i cant get a job or if im stuck and the industry fails and i have to switch ill be at square one and i just cant. what can i do. im so scared and hopeless.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:34:13 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0
1j64p36,i think about the one that got away even though we were never together.,due to trauma i have an extreme flight feeling so that even though things are going good with my current partner i keep thinking about just packing my things and leaving. i keep thinking about a fwb i was with prior that if we had tried a relationship probably we probably wouldve been great together. i love my current partner and dont want to actually leave him and i cant say anything to either of them because i wont let my trauma response ruin a relationship and friendship. i am working on it with my therapist. i know that if i do pack up and leave and have something with the friend that the same feeling will happen with him because i need to work through the trauma rather than giving into it. i dont really have any friends i can talk to about it because none of them will understand.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:27:03 UTC,3,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j64g7u,coming to terms with the thought that my sister is not a good person after all,it has been almost 15 years since its slowly started to dawn on me that my sister never really loved me she just thought i was so much lamer than her that she didnt see me as a competiton. for the context she is 10 years older than me and for as long as i can remember i loved her more than anyone alive. i loved her more than our parents brothers friends etc. she was my absolute role model and everything she did was perfect. it is fucked up to compare kids ever but when parents and relatives are comparing two people who are so different and not even in the same age group that is especially fucked up. she was always labeled the beautiful one me as the smart one. she was the caring child i was the mean one. her life was hard mine was easy. everything that was happening to her was always celebrated if it was good or we were all devastated together with her if it was bad and it was never her fault when it was bad. everything i ever did was considered as luck or as normal if it was good and my fault if it was bad. she loved me back and always worked on building my self confidence but never to the extent of me succeeding in being better than her in any way. this was particularly obvious in her relationship with our parents where she told me multiple times that our father wanted mom to have the abortion when she was pregnant with me. any sign of me not liking that thought was being met with the comment along the lines of me being too sensitive or oh come on he loves you now. i reacted explosivelly about that only once when i told her openely to go fuck herself with those fucked up pieces of info which of course ended with her being in tears appologizing and making me promise that i will never remind her about that event. she made it about her and her feelings and i was told by the involved parties that i shouldnt have been so hard on her. these were occasional outbursts when i would always make a conclusion that i over reacted and i would end up crying begging her to forgive me and promising never to do it again. bear in mind we are talking about my teenage yeara here not adult me. ff to my 20s while she had one relationship with her then longtime bf who became almost like a family member i mostly fucked around and either didnt really meet reciprocated feelings in guys or i didnt even want anything serious. she eventually broke up with him it was a family tragedy ofc like anything bad that happens to her and she somehow put us both together to we are never getting married file. i mean she never said it but it was obvious that she is not supportive of my potential relationships. i kind of knew it but i became sure about it when i started to date my now husband when i was 25 and as i became more selfassured because i felt loved she started to become more and more openely toxic and she was doing it often. she would use every opportunity to let me know she thinks he is lazy and irresponsible while i didnt think any of that. she started to hate my hobbies style habits which didnt change much i just wasnt as miserable as before and she was suuuuper pissed when she broke with her second bf and i got engaged. she called me and raged about how it is inconsiderate that everyone is saying congrats on social media while they are aware of her recent break up. i felt bad because during the last year of her relationship she lost one pregnancy but i still didnt think that i should hid posts my boyfriend put on social media when he proposed. after that it all went downhill. she was good to me either when something super good would happen to her or when something really bad would happen to me. she hated my wedding day and pregnancy but she was full of understanding when i had ppd. she did nothing to help but she was good to me then. as soon as i got better she was hating me again. in the meantime all good that was going on in her life was still celebrated and all bad was mourned while my life was kind of unimportant to our mutual loved ones mostly. i started to fight back but i was rarely talking shit about her to our family while she wasnt really private about her opinion on me. every time when she would show her good side again i would come back to life because i would regain the hope that the most loved person from my childhood is still there. recently i lost all hope that i will ever want her back in my life. our father died and in his final months while i was crying my guts out and doing everything to help him as we all did she told me that i was selfish as always and not showing any empathy towards him. that was the straw that broke the camels back for me and i screamed at her and told her to get the fuck away from me forever. we did communicate after that because there were many things that had to be done with our dad and i was there for her to be her shoulder to cry on when she needed me but it was just because i felt i had to for the rest of our family. as our dad passed my feelings of disgust came back and i am back to feeling hurt by our last fight. she mentioned it briefly and said that it was just a dumb fight as she always does after moments like that but to me it wasnt. to me now none of the fights we had were dumb and they were all about one thing her wanting me to be the obedient loser sister that she had when i was from 0 to 20ish and her from 10 to 30ish. i cant stand the thought of her hanging out with my kid anymore. my kid loves her and i was so happy when my sister and i patched our fight from a few years ago and she had good relationship with her niece but honestly i have two fears 1. she would fuck her up the way she fucked me up 2. she would be telling my kid mean things to show me as a bad person for whatever reason. one thing i found out later after my ppd was gone is that she was planning to take the kid away from me because it seems like i am not fit to do it but she never considered talking to my husband about it. like he didnt have ppd he was fine why didnt she talk to him? why was she planning to adopt the kid who was not out for adoption? anyway... i am done with her but i think i will need a lot of time to process this. maybe therapy would be beneficial.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:14:59 UTC,6,0,0.81,,,0,0
1j64e6n,i hate living with my parents so much,i moved back home recently after graduating from college and living with my parents again has made me cry more than i did during my four years at college. i found out today that my mom opened an enveloped addressed to me and read mail intended for me that included a lot of personal information. she left the letter in her room for at least three days without even telling me i had any mail and only mentioned it today. shes also been using the personal info in that letter to make fun of me. yeah im lucky to have parents that will welcome me home and that feed me. theyre not bad parents. but living with them genuinely makes me want to die.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:12:09 UTC,1,4,1.0,,,0,0
1j64ccx,close friend passed today at 28,you know how we always talk about how great someone is once theyve passed? this friend was truly one of the best people ive ever known hands down. i truly honest to god do not have a single negative thing to say about him. weve been friends for 20 years. we grew up together. he was the most himself person with a huge heart. he followed his passions in a way i rarely see taught children who adored him and was just such a damn good friend and person. during the last conversation i had with him over christmas he told me he was the happiest hed ever been. doing what he loves every day. pursuing his passions. i was so so happy for him. that day he also met the man im going to marry for the first time and told me how much he liked him. its hard to imagine he wont be at my wedding now. i know theres no rhyme or reason to death and i wont waste my time on arguing with it but man if anyone deserved a long happy life it was him. i feel extremely sad and just needed to get it off my chest.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:09:37 UTC,12,1,0.94,,,0,0
1j648yo,who am i?,can someone explain my situation? i dont know who i am. am i from this country? i dont feel like i belong. i dont feel like a woman or a man. sometimes i feel like a child sometimes a man sometimes a teenage girl sometimes a mother sometimes a woman. i dont know but i feel frighteningly different from my family and the traditions of my country. even the religion of my countryim not fully convinced by it. am i religious or not? why do i always drift off and listen to songs in different languages but never in my native tongue? why do i always feel like im living in a parallel world? why dont i feel like i belong to this earth? why am i always alone and why do i love escaping reality? as i write this i remember my childhood. at first i pity that little girl but in the end i dont want to sympathize with this womannot because im not proud of myself but because why am i not brave enough to discover who i am? why do i feel like my personality isnt real? is it because of my environment society or because i dont belong to this country and this religion? who am i?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:04:59 UTC,0,0,0.33,,,0,0
1j63zlg,too rich to qualify for assistance. too poor to pay the medical debt i need assistance for.,sometimes i wish i could literally die in an accident so that the calls from collections and bills piling up on my mailbox stopped. sure i make 80k but it means jack shit when i live in a somewhat expensive city and a huge chunk of my income goes towards these bills. recently i started to have health problems which are making me attend therapies to manage said problems twice a week. im spending an average of 600700 a month. i ended up in the emergency department last month too which means i have to pay 4000 to them. everywhere i go for assistance turns me away because i dont make less than 60k yet these braindead morons working there dont understand the concept of my income going towards these bills leaving me with less money to even feed myself. im down to 1 meal a day and honestly i can manage it because i have an eating disorder but i just feel bad for others that genuinely cant do it.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:52:38 UTC,3,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j63j0w,update my gf beat the shit out of someone who broke into her house,i dont know if anyone remembers me but a while ago my girlfriend and i had a home invasion incident that culminated in her beating the shit out of the intruder. im tired of saying my gf so im going to call her diana. turns out the guy was a drug addict from the next town over. he was in his 60s and he had an extensive history in jail and mental hospitals. unfortunately about two months after my post he passed away. we didnt know anything about why until we got a chance to talk to his sister who insisted she didnt blame diana and that the doctors even said that he probably didnt have much longer anyway. diana was visibly distressed during this conversation so im not sure whether or not the sister just said that to comfort her after that diana went on a trip to a national park during a week she knew i couldnt take off and forgot her meds. she has seizures that look like mild psychosismagical thinking and ended up refusing to come home at the end of the trip. she kept saying that she felt like she couldnt leave the woods because she was certain there was something she needed to learn there that she hadnt yet and when i asked her how long that might take she said some people take a lifetime. i asked if she was breaking up with me and she said something about feeling like she was too attached to me her house her pets etc and that she needed to meditate on that for a while. i ended up going to her temple to see if anyone was willing to give me some perspective on the situation since she was seeing things through a buddhist lens. it was the right choice. a monk actually drove the six hours out to her with me to talk to her in person since she wasnt picking up calls. i am so so unbelievably grateful for that monk because diana started taking her meds again and came home soon after. ive never been religious but i started to read the pali canon afterwards and that shit slaps. diana was already volunteering her time at the temple so now we both go together when we can. all things considered since then things are back to normal and going well. were both children of divorce so even before all this we were doing prophylactic couples counseling every few months and for a while after we were going once a week. diana has started seeing a therapist on her own as well which i am so proud of her for since shes always hated the idea of individual therapy. we also stepped up our home security game. diana already had plenty of cameras but now we have doorwindow alarms and motion sensors. i also convinced diana to get another dog so now we have a 75lb puppy i know a lot of people were rooting for us to get married but thats not going to happen. legal marriage isnt something that interests us and it never has. but we did buy each other rings and its been a great comfort to have something physical to remind me of her on my person all the time. were also considering having a small commitment ceremony next fall lt3 thanks again for all the feedback on my previous post. i got a lot of great advice and some good criticism. i showed it to diana and she got a kick out of the comments and we had a little mutual cry over how kind a lot of you guys were. i asked her if she was okay with me posting this update and she clucked at me and told me to do whatever i want online as long as im being nice and anonymous lol. so hope this qualifies!,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:30:31 UTC,2524,62,0.97,,,0,0
1j63eh6,i feel stuck in this life of disappointment,damn i will definitely be embarassed about this in the future but anyways ive always been a sensitive person i always cared about others and made sure to make them feel good and happy. my middle school years werent the best i had to move out of my old house and i completely changed life by moving to a town 50 minutes far from my previous residence. you can imagine that i an introverted and nerdy kid wasnt able to make many friends and so i got lonely. in fact i was known as the lonely kid no one ever wanted to talk to me and sometimes even made fun of me i discovered some years later that everyone talked behind my back during those years and that was the reason no one even wanted to approach me. and so i spent three years of my life by myself i spent my days alone definitely years that i wouldnt want to live again. once middle school ended i was full of hope that same summer i made some friends and had a lot of fun with them and so i was positive about starting high school. and so once my first year of school started i tried to me more extroverted and social the outcome was awkard im not good at being extroverted. even tho i tried the outcome wasnt positive. this time no one talked behind my back but i had trouble making friends and so i became the lonely kid once again. i was depressed spent my days listening to music and sleeping all day just to escape that feeling of void that was suffocating swallowing me whole. i was ready to end it all but i wasnt brave enough to even try so i kept living my life and eventually things got better. i made new friends i became more social and felt truly happy after years of suffering. i am happy about how i lived the rest of my teenage years but that feeling never got away. i am now left with an overthinking mindset idk if i can call it like that which leads me to anxiety about all the friendships that i currently live i cant be calm because i sometimes think that everyone will sooner or later go against me and make me live the hell i went through one more time. i cant trust anyone and this thing is making me mad because come on why am i so defensive? why cant i just live my life like the others and not worry about this? i dont truly know why i wrote this probably to feel better or to relate to someone here who perhaps lived my same experience. anyways i feel costantly feel this overwhelming sense of entrapment in my own life i feel like my past will always follow me no matter what i do. no matter how many new people i will meet i will always have this anxiety that they will disappoint me and life is so hard this way. i dont even know if someone will read this i will probably only get some upvotes and my post will be forgotten in this sub,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:24:33 UTC,2,1,0.63,,,0,0

1j638ou,my dads in the icu my boyfriends planning a trip,this happened in mid january. for context i am 32f and my boyfriend is 34m weve been together for 3 years and we live together in a house that i own. now for the story my dad has been unwell for over a month and my siblings and i mom died from cancer when i was young have been taking care of him while we waited for test results and some answers. last week his condition took a turn for the worst and he ended up being taken to the hospital by ambulance and has been in the icu for a week. he was diagnosed with cancer. we still dont have all the answers and i dont know what the future holds for my family. on the third day that my dad was in the icu my boyfriend was at work and texted me about his plans for the following day that consisted of him meeting up with friends to plan their trip. i knew they had been talking loosely talking about potentially going on a trip at the end of the month but i thought it was common sense that since my dad is in the hospital the trip would be off. well apparently not. needless to say we had an argument. i told him its extremely hurtful that he would abandon me at a time like this. after a lot of back and forth throughout the day he let me know the trip was cancelled nothing had been paid for or even booked yet but at this point i just feel like the damage is done. who would prioritize a boys trip when their partners only parent is extremely sick in the hospital. the obvious answer is to break up but i dont know if i have it in me to go through a breakup right now. its been a few days now my dad is doing much better hes out of the icu and ive been there everyday helping him with his recovery so he can come home. ive been off work for the past week and a half during all this and went back yesterday and have been going to the hospital between shifts. my boyfriend has been moping around the house the last few days and every time i ask him whats wrong he says nothing or i dont know im just sad. i said if this is about the trip then just go. he says thats not what its about. i suggested he goes to talk to someone a therapist or a friend.. or me. he declined all of this. i asked what i can do to help he said nothing and im not his therapist i said nothing and just collected my stuff and went to work. i have a lot on my plate already and im feeling angry that hes putting this on me now as well. we spent the next few days avoiding eachother around the house which was making my mental health seriously depleted. we finally had a conversation i told him he should go on the trip because theres no sense of him staying here if hes not even going to acknowledge me or be supportive to me and my family anyways. the next day he booked his flight. i tried to convince myself i was okay with it but his 5 day trip suddenly turned into 10 days and i just knew i was done. we had a few conversations while he was away mostly me crying and telling him how angry i am with him. he came home and i ended it as soon as he walked in the door. he begged and pleaded said he never would have left if he knew i would end it because of the trip. there was a lot of back and forth and i asked him if he could just leave for a few days to give me some space which he did. he ended up taking me on a date for valentines day later that week and things seemed to be getting a little bit better. we planned a night away the following week to try to connect again. during our romantic night away he decided it was a good idea to invite his friend and friends girlfriend to join us for dinner the girlfriend ended up not coming so it was just me my bf and his friend .. and then surprisingly a bunch of his other work friends just happened to be at the same restaurant. what was supposed to be a romantic evening to try to repair our relationship ended up being a table of 8 of us talking about my boyfriends job. we went back to the hotel got into an argument and went to bed angry. the next day we woke up and he got in the shower and left his apple watch on the night stand. i had that gut instinct to check his messages and there it was. he was been messaging with another girl the entire time my dad was in the hospital and was meeting up with her for coffee dates . which i highly doubt is all that happened. so ya thats it. he moved his stuff out last week and the person i thought i knew for the last almost 4 years has become the person whose hurt me more than anyone ever has in my life. im on my own again going to be 33 next month and starting from scratch. i dont know what the future holds but it has to be better than this right?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:17:01 UTC,10,1,0.78,,,0,0
1j62wut,nex fiancé ruined my life blamed me for it and then admitted he was never capable of it,just saw a post about their narc maybe being dl and im realizing mine definitely was and after everything he did and blaming me for it he said thats why he did it and couldnt have let us every happen or get married bc of his hidden desires. exact quote at the bottom in the beginning he said he had a deep fetish he said it was humiliation at first. then the real truth was later revealed to me. and then it wasnt until after the break up he said there was sissy and cross dressing and that he might be gay. which is so bizarre bc one he only ever told me about the real kink way later and never told me the full details of it and he loves women sexually and is very sexual and addicted to porn. but he was interested in trans women and anal sex i guess. its wild bc he always said he could never be in a relationship with a man bc he needed a woman who was submissive and he had control over basically. he wanted a woman in her feminine energy but wasnt safe enough to let me stay there. after our break up also he went on a power kick after i was trying to say goodbye like i guess trying to regain power and he was being agressive and telling me to submit and basically confirm that he was right and i was wrong and legit got hard from it. the next day i said i will only submit to a man who protects and takes care of me and does not abuse me and he said he would still abuse me and i should stop whinning about it. there were times he wanted to have sex with me while watching porn and wouldnt show what the porn was or giving him bjs and hjs while he watched porn. ive posted my story lots but have left out this major detail bc it felt wrong to discuss but for reference we got engaged i uprooted my life to go move in with him in another state. 6 days after the proposal and me thousands of dollars deep into the move he called it off unprovoked bc by this time i had been perfect according to his unreasonable standards but he still blamed me. this is all after months of emotional and verbal abuse. i lost my home a job a baby mental health love my best friend my safety the realization is he legit told me he loved his fetish and addictions more than me. and he also said after he broke off our engagement and putting me through absolute hell and destroying my life and financially abusing me and me loosing my home to go move with him after our engagement after blaming me for the reason why he did it and a couple weeks after i came back to my state and was recovering from the move. he said so we get married have kids and i say by the way i love wearing diapers. dressing as a girl and letting dudes or someone fuck my ass? i wasnt gonna let that happen and that he wasnt sure if he was bi or gay. i couldnt tell if he was saying all of that as a ploy to make it easier to be friends with him bc he was actively saying he wanted me in his life and he said would it be easier if i were gay and then told me all those things. idk if it was more manipulation or if its true. i know his kink is a major thing and it wasnt something i was into and he wants to be with someone romantically who isnt into in but still have sexual encounters with people who are into his kink. i can never tell when he was being honest or just saying something to get a certain reaction out of me. there were several times hed say im going to go fuck this girl tonight bc you stress me out and then id find out he was home along and not with her. his mom would tell me or he later would tell me he never did. there were plenty of cases like this too. he would just say things to make me believe it. so i couldnt tell if he was saying he might be gay for that instance too. idk. in no way am i being insensitive to sexuality or kinks. i was very supportive to him through it all but this is just making me realize he was never going to follow through and legit used me. he basically admitted to putting me through hell abusing me very thoroughly blaming it allllll on me and my character flaws made me lose my home to move states with him tell me entire family we got engaged lose my job and spend thousands on moving lose a child all to cancel our engagement and move during a mania spike he had and blames it on me all while he was literally never going to be capable of following through. there were so many signs too im realizing now that ive missed. he used to straight up tell me that he was mirroring me and i thought that was weird bc women typically mirror the man. he used to also say hed just find someone to marry him out of convenience bc he wasnt capable of love. he was always so selfish in every aspect of our lives. he always made it known to everyone and called me his wife and loved the image that it gave him but treated me like dirt. this man was straight up telling me he was a narcissist and i missed the signs in a haze. he emotionally verbally mentally and financially abused me for literally nothing. bc i was kind and sweet and supportive and empathetic and showed him love he couldnt even fathom. he literally watched me as i bent over backwards for him and took care of him and lost the stability in my life to create one with him while he was just belittling me and destroying my worth and esteem. he needed control over me bc he lacked it in his own life and addictions and self. and was never going to marry me or create the life together we planned bc his demons and desires would have never allowed it even when i was accommodating and understanding. but the blame is all on me for loving him and having needs. theres so many factors to this and so many versions of him its hard to wrap my head around it all,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:01:38 UTC,4,5,0.67,,,0,0

1j62rt3,i seriously hate my parents,theyre so fucking stupid and annoying. they bitch at me16f and complain every 2 seconds over something small. every time ive tried to tolerate their shit i end up crashing the fuck out. quite literally ive tried to be nice and help a lot with stuff ive done a bunch of chores around the house even some chores they have to do ive even babysat my younger siblings just to keep them happy and their mouth shut. but nah im still walking on eggshells with them. theres been a couple times ive been clumsy and accidentally knocked someone over like my little brother when i was trying to sweep and he snuck behind me and i turned around then he fell over. and when that happens its like absolute hell on earth because they yell at me and act like im some demon over it. so i dress one of my younger siblings for them because hes disabled and cant do that for himself so i pick an outfit out for him for school and all. when i came home today i got berated over it because the outfits i choose arent fasionable or whatever like wtf? and quite literally if i do anything wrong im berated called useless and other insults. ive literally went to the psych ward cuz i was suicidal and my parents decided to snoop through my room and my stuff and basically when i got back they didnt even care if they were triggering me or not. they just used it as fucking fuel. i just cant wait to get revenge on them i dont give a fuck about how cruel i plan on getting revenge but goddamnit im gonna make them wish they were never born.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 22:55:35 UTC,7,25,0.64,,,0,0
1j629ya,i am having problems with my relationship and i feel trapped,i dont know where to start with it all. this is going to be long and if any of you get to the end i appreciate you taking the time to read my story. i would say that this feels like a common place story that happens to a lot of people in different ways. i just need to get my story told. almost feels like i am just asking for pity maybe i am and that is an issue with myself because seeking pity is not good for ones mental health but what ive been holding in also isnt good for my mental health. ill start the story at 4 years ago when my relationship started. it started 7 years ago. i start there. i was a lonely type of fella and i did not have much relationship experience from my time growing up and being in high school total of 2 relationships before this current one i find myself in one 8 months with it ending with me getting cheated on and the other 1.5 years with me proposing and then getting cheated on. both inperson and then transitioning to longdistance youd think id learned my lesson the first time. anyways i go about a year of being single and searching for love as all young people do and nothing worked for me dating apps social events or just finding people in places that youd want to be able to share interest with. until one day i posted a nice thirst trap online to get the selfseeking validation that i felt i needed at the time and someone slid into my dms someone that i had known from hs but never truly talked to. i began talking with this person and then we grew closer every day despite being long distance with a 3hour time difference. we facetimed each other every once in a while and then twice a week and then every day. the problem at the time in that relationship was two things i was not emotionally intelligent and i had a group of guy friends that were semitoxic. my significant other was not fond of my friends as they wanted to go out and party all the time which i didnt mind doing but it wasnt my cup of tea. so i spent more time talking with her and then one day i tried to introduce her to my group of friends on facetime and she talked to everyone a little bit and just found them all disgusting and asked to talk to me again. she said something along the lines of wow cant believe you did that and hung up on me. now for me i was confused because my buddies did the same thing with their signifcant others and no one was upset and it was nice getting to know the person they loved back homefor a little context me and my so had not met up yet we were still having facetime and what not. it was also a surprise for her because when she called i was hanging out with my buddies and one of them picked up. so after she hung up i called her back in private and i asked her what was wrong and she told me that she felt disrespected by what happened and that was our first big fight with each other and it ended with me texting her updates of when and where i am so she knows if she can call with me. i agreed with it all not thinking that it was a big deal. we continued the relationship with one another with basically a gradual turn of all my free time being spent with her. i neglected friends and became somewhat isolated from my world. as an inexperienced youngling i didnt see that issue. i kept the good friends and started distancing myself from my friends wed hang out with but it started to be less and less as the month went by. i would say that we are about 8 months into this relationship with each other when we first decided to meet up with each other and have about a week together. now before we met with each other she alluded that there were things that she wasnt going to give me or ask of me unless we were dating because i hadnt asked her to be my girlfriend and i dont know why but that enticed me to figure out what she was alluding to and that brought me to the point of when meeting up with her i asked her to be my gf and she said yes but i was so nervous asking her it felt like she was a bit hesistant on that matter when replying yes. that happened the first day and then we started dating with our first week in a relationship of hanging out with each other. i stayed at her place the whole week and we did various things and hung out with each other. it felt like things went well for the week that we spent together it felt like we connected and everyone had a good time before we had to say goodbye and continue our longdistance relationship. after i got back to my home things started to change with our relationship she wanted more from me in ways of being more emotionally aware of my day and tell her my feelings and how things made me feel and as the emotinally unintellegnet person i was it was hard for me to change that in my everyday life i was just going with the flow of life and never realy discussed my emotions with others becasue it never really came up in conversation. we argued about how i was still just discussing my day with her and not sharing my emotions with her so i worked on it and slowly got better with being in touch with my emotions yet i feel like it was never really enough for the relationship. as the months went by she continuously felt like i wasnt telling her enough about my life and felt left out the more i told her about my day so i committed to telling her everything that happened in my day as she was doing to me. now my struggle was that there was a lot that happened in my day so i would sometimes do it when it happened in my day. still i would eventually tell her about it when we called each other every day. still she would then get upset that she missed out on knowing when it happened and what i felt in that period. once again being the emotionally unavailable guy i was i tried my best to do what i could to satisfy that need for her. at this point youre probably wondering why we just didnt break up. i have no clue its probably just me being weakwilled. at this point i spent just about every waking moment texting and talking to this girl and we got into arguments just about every single day either about me missing information i was telling her or me not being emotional. being young i thought this was healthy because the arguments led to deeper conversations with each other and figuring out what made us who we are. i would say about 4 or 5 months after our initial meetup i had pretty much completely distanced myself from my friedns with rarely ever hanging out with them but maybe once in a blue moon but it made it harder in my relationship to hangout with them becausea of her wanting to know everything and me jsut wanting to spend time with friedns so there was communication delay from waht was happening in the conversation and what i was doing vs what was acutally happening in my life. this all led to arguments down the line and then our next meet up this time i was meeting her parents and she was coming to me. i set things up so that i could stay with her and got a friend that i was closer with that she seemed to like because he was married and approved more of our relationship. we spent the time together for about 2 weeks this time one week just me and her at my place and then a week with her parents. it seemed like another good meet up with both of enjoying ourselves but a little bit of tension between us from the arguments and the fact i was moving from a 3 hour time difference to a 13 hour time difference which we both imagined would put more of a strain on our relationship her parents liked me on a side note. we parted ways and i began my new path in life with her being in college and me being abroad for work. we had both been right tensions did increase with each other as i was abroad it became even hadrder for me to comunicate with her with everything that was going on in my day to day life as it was for the most part always unpredictable and hard to keep up with myself and she would sleep half way through my day as the time differnece so if she didnt wake up to a butt load of text about my day she felt upset and always had this feeling of misisng out on my life so i continued to distance myself from others and not participating in group events and when i did i tried to keep to myself to minimize the updating i had to do. at this point she just felt like i didnt love her because i wasnt involving her in my life the same way she was involving me in her life. she told me everything about her day so this wasnt a double standard and she was also busy but i would say that i was definitely busier than she was. i continued to apoligize about the communication issues with keeping in mind i still was telling her about everything that happened in my day whenever we talked on the phone especially all the things i forgot to tell her and she felt that i conviently kept forgetting to tell her about the interations that i had with females throughout my day beacuse as you can imagine she was jealous that other females got to interact with me throught out the day more and she didnt. i was better about telling her about female interaction through my day but i still missed a few here and there. sometimes i got rides from females and shed get upset that i didnt tell them when it happened. she always felt she never got the full story the first time and she had to ask multiple questions to get the whole story and that was tiring for her and it got to the point where i thought i was doing a good job but was not and i just gave up on updating her one day because life just got overwhelmed and i couldnt handle life and my relationship at the same time and she ended it after that day. i was devastated as we had been going through this struggle for almost 3 years and it just felt like it was all for nothing. we met a third time before breaking up and were going to meet up a 4th before covid19 occurred and travel bans happened which didnt improve our relationship. we broke up i got friends and started to move on with my life slowly finding myself and what makes me happy. for about a year i was single. i decided to move back to the same timezone as her and go to the college that she went to. not expecting her to be in the area not ever really knowing why i did it either. i wanted to complete college not being in a relationship but that was not what occured. as you can expect we ran into each other again and started dating because she felt like i was a changed man and was able to prioritize things in my life a little better. i can say that i did grow in the time after we broke up and explored my inner workings a little more. the thing is she thought i started dating her again because she was a different person but she hasnt really changed all that much still wanting the same things and i was more able to provide those things she wanted and it felt like things were going in the right direction. we moved in with each other and where dating for a year until she said that she wanted more and didnt feel we were growing and she said it was because i had not asked her to be my gf so about 3 months of me trying to find the right time to ask and it not working out we get into an argument about it and i asak her and she says no ask another time. so i dont plan for it and just start asking her once a week until she just says yes about 2 months later while we are living and sleeping in the same bed with each other. anyway things started getting a little tenser between us. i dont have many friends as i learned not to make friends in this relationship and i dont talk to my old friends much because it just causes conflict and id rather avoid than lie. we continued dating and for about 2 years we lived in the same place. we have had our ups and downs through the two years. i changed my job twice and have a female supervisor as you know she is upset about that but she ignores it better. she says she just at this point in the relationship buries her emotions and hides her concerns because she doesnt want conflict in the relationship and she only ever feels that she has problems with what is going on in the relationship. we still argue a lot and have those arguments turn into deep conversations and i become more and more emotionally drained as these arguments happen and i can barely keep up with my studies work and relationship yet i push on. we are starting to get to the real point of this story and why i am just done is that we were initially very active sexually in the beginning of our relationship like once a week and then it moved to once a month which you know i didnt think to much of it because i figure sex drive just went down as the relationship got more secured but we just moved to a new place and signed a 15 month lease that niether of us can afford to break and i tried to be sexual with her this morning and she told me that it felt nice but shed been thinking of her ex when weve been doing stuff and that its kinda always been that way becasue she used to be very sexually active with her ex but he was fine with not having sex and she puts herself in his position and wouldnt want that pushed uponed her and makes her feel sad and turns her off from anything that we are doing and i tried to help her get to the root of it this morning before leaving to work and i just felt that i disrepected myself by doing that and not being more upset about her thinking of her ex and it just hurts because it means just about everytime we do sexual stuff its about how she feels about her ex and makes sense why she has to sometime watch things when i go down on her. honestly i know that this is a super toxic relationship but i love her so much and have tried so hard in this relationship with the time and effort i put in everyday it just sucks all of it tldr gf thinks of ex during intimate time after 7 years of relationship and gets turned off just about every time because she pushed herself on her ex and her ex didnt care about having sex and she didnt like the idea of being in his position. so it has tanked our relationship and everything feels distant and we moved to new place with 15 month lease no one can afford to break. i feel stuck,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 22:32:58 UTC,2,1,0.75,,,0,0
1j626pw,my chronic illness has taken my will to live,i 22 f have had a chronic condition for more than 10 years now. the thing is its something i havent seen mentioned before or other people experiencing it. i feel so alone and ive seriously considered an escape route in the sense that i genuinely do not have a will to live. i have a chronic sore throat and its ruining my life. i cannot drink or eat anything cold without getting ill after. absolutely anything. i cannot just eat ice cream and enjoy cold drinks. i always have a lump in my throat no matter what i do. after i eatdrink something cold or when im sick this lump gets thicker and inflammation follows. but the worst of all is second hand ciggarette smoke and other dense smokes. just feeling it makes this lump get thicker and i start coughing. i cannot walk normally on the street and always have to avoid smokers that are everywhere. i cannot go out to bars hang with people my age because theyre all smoking. i am the insane one. the doctors do not care since there is no concerning inflammation and ive been told to just deal with the smoke and avoid it as if thats possible. i live in eastern europe ive also had my tonsils removed because the inflammation affected my bones and heart but even after that theres been no improvement. the thing thats causing it is a bacteria called staphylococcus aureus and this chronic state most likely developed when i failed to do a treatment properly. ive been desperate to find an explanation for my pain on my own and was able to find just one scientific paper studying the sensitivity of this bacteria to second hand ciggarette smoke. i wish i could live somewhere isolated without pollution from smoke but its not likely since im just an average woman. no skills to survive on my own nor the resilience for that. i am so tired. i do not see a future for myself. ive never had a relationship due to some other reasons in the past and i dont see myself having one because of this. also sorry if this isnt the appropriate sub for this. i mostly posted this as a cry for help and maybe to attempt at finding people who relate. ill remove my post if needed. thanks for reading.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 22:28:51 UTC,5,1,0.67,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0
1j623o7,i just broke up with my partner because they didnt even realise theyd cheated on me,life is feeling real batshit today. came across my partners alt account on social media. open to public viewing. they described it as an orgasm journal where they seemed to be exploring self pleasure. cool love that. very datadriven. cut to a post about collective episode with another online user. they had been exploring what sounds to be a lot like mutual masturbation where youre turned on by the idea of someone watching viewing things through a datadriven lens in the name of research. naturally i lost my shit and messaged them. we called and i told them all of the assumptions id made. they didnt say i was wrong just said its research. i feel like im getting pulled into insanity and delusion here. it feels like kink gone wrong. what do you mean its research?? research is ethical? having sexual conversations around topics that arouse you with another person for the purpose of sexual pleasure sounds like infidelity to me? i cant believe i had to tell this person who most of the time has their head on square amp thinks intelligently and rationally that this constitutes as cheating. its not research or data what are you talking about!! theyve just posted after our break up yes im going to stop looking but its been 12 hours please let me wallow that theyre open not poly. fast fucking turnaround when we were in a monogamous relationship literally 8 hours ago. we were in a long term relationship and i cannot for the life of me process that this is the way it ends. can someone please tell me im not going insane? edit just to clarify weve had in depth conversations around our expectations of a monogamous relationship. i didnt specifically set a boundary of i am not comfortable with mutual masturbation online in the name of research because.. thats very specific and not at all a normal conversation to have lol. but i did explain what would be uncomfortable or dealbreaking for me and i would fully put the onus on them to have needed to clarify in this situation instead of going in blind because i think its very clearly something i would take issue with based on every other conversation weve had on the subject.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 22:25:00 UTC,2953,110,0.97,,,0,0
1j61ohl,my sisters life is ruined ig?,tw drug abuse so i dont know how to start. my sister hashad a longterm relationship and i even considered him my brother because he was like that with me. they even have a child together. it all started last year when my bil asked my father for 400 but not to tell my sister and he would pay it back as soon as he got paid. to this day he never payed back and he lost my fathers respect because of this. we suspected that he may be doing drugs but we kinda hoped he wouldnt do something like this because he loves his child to the moon. there were few incidents where he acted off we never interpreted much into this and just hoped everything would be okay. he works in a field where the future is the secured and a few weeks back he told us that he and his other colleagues were laid off but they would all receive loan payments till the contract ends. idk it came with a surprise and i had a thought that maybe he was the only person that got laid off. i asked my bf about it because his father works in the same company but in a different department. he said he didnt know anything about this. well wednesday was the incident that ruined my sisters life. we dont know what happened exactly but my sister has ended the relationship for good and threw him out because she found drugs. she told our mom that he had a history with drugs a long time ago but he swore it would never happen again. since yesterday he is supposedly in rehab. i dont how to talk to my sister about this and i dont know what to think myself. he was like a brother and i always defended him to everyone. i am scared what will happen in the future i mean what if he collapses again? right now my sister is a single mom who works full time with only a half day daycare. i dont know whether my bil was under influence when he was watching my nibling. there were times where he was alone with my nibling for two weeks. was he driving under influence? and was my nibling with him? for how long was the abuse? will my sister recover from all this? was he thinking about what his abuse will do to my sister and nibling? was he even thinking? there is only so much hurt that a person can endure and my sister had enough in her life. my mind all over the place and i have so much questions i would like to ask but i know that i cant get an answer. i would like to tell my bil how disappointed i am but i know that this would not help his rehab. my mind is all over the place and my heart is hurting and i cant talk to anyone expect my mother but she feels the same way expect that her heart hurts more because this is her daughter. i dont know what to do right now. i dont know what to think. i dont know what to feel. i dont know how to help my sister. i had to get this off my chest thanks for reading,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 22:06:17 UTC,2,0,0.75,,,0,0
1j61hol,i stopped focusing on myself because of my husbands actions,me and my husband have been married for 3 years and we had a rough start to marriage we were both very toxic to each other and ended up putting hands on each other but over time we go the help we needed and we are trying to rebuild but its been difficult very difficult. he was a virgin when i met him and he was my second partner ive been with. lately ive been feeling very lonely and discouraged from trying to be sexy around him before we got married and were dating he was very horny all the time and wanted it almost 3 or 4 times a day but now im lucky to even get with him once every week or 2 weeks and ive noticed that its always me initiating it also he doesnt really touch me he straight just only goes to fumble my boobs and nipples then goes down on me then we only do missionary and doggy thats it and it takes about 30 min. once i didnt initiate at all and wanted to see how far he will go to not having sex it was a month and thats because i couldnt handle it anymore. recently ive been trying to talk to him about it but he says that he wants to build up emotionally because of our past and doesnt want to focus on the sexual stuff which i feel is important too. ive bought lingerie to maybe inspire him but all he does is say i look beautiful and thats it he doesnt go feral he doesnt dirty talk he doesnt admire me he doesnt role play he doesnt grab my ass nothing we dont even make out. im starting to feel more like a roommate i stopped putting in the effort of being a woman i stopped shaving i stopped plucking my eyebrows i stopped waxing or trimming i shower only once a week because i thinks whats the point? and yes ive brought this up to him multiple times and he says i still look beautiful and thats he still loves me. i just dont feel wanted or desired i dont know how else to explain it to him. ive said to get home and throw me on the bed and fuck the shit out of me but he says that no because he comes tired from work and dirty which i dont give a fuck ive told him to look for more positions to try but he always says well you research and ill do it. which i dont want i want it to come out of him to want me to desire me. ive put lingerie on and once i really out did myself i got my hair done and shaved trimmed everything but then he said that he doesnt get turned on by lingerie but he also doesnt know what turns him on. also one time we were getting into it and he pointed out i missed a spot when i shaved down there which made me feel really embarrassed and we ended up not doing it. i dont know what else to do really ive brought this up to him a hundred times but he never gets the point and leaves it to me. what do i do? i feel so frustrated with the situation,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 21:58:26 UTC,3,6,1.0,,,0,0
1j61gr1,broke up with partner but the real reason is his penis didnt satisfy me.,we were in an open relationship and i have several other regular sex partners of 10 years and five years. i also have hookups with others. there were some differences that caused me to end the relationship. however i am a size queen and know i need it packed to feel fuflilled. needless to say it afected my satisfaction a lot! im really sad that i settled for someone who didnt satisfy me. i tried to approach sex life as something for us to build on. as this was a newer relationship. but i never craved him when we were apart and i would not miss him physically. this signaled an end to me! i guess size really does matter and i just needed to find out.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 21:57:20 UTC,0,7,0.24,,,0,0
1j61gar,is there a right way to tell my christian brother about my sexuality?,hi this is my first time writing here so i hope it makes sense. i am a 21 year old female living in a generational christian family. being told your entire that married and have kids is something i have to do and that if i dont now i will someday. so when i found at the age of 14 that i am asexual and just a couple years after bisexual. i kinda felt relived but also terrified. i have only told my cousin and she was very accepting of me and we tell each our problems all the time. i have been debating on telling my brother about my sexuality for a couple years. just the two of us are going on trip this can either going to ruin our whole trip or strengthen our bond. the biggest problem is that i am worried he will think i am too young to talk about these topics and hell say i can change either when i am older or when i find the right person. all that to say that i love my brother but knowing his biblical stance on sexuality has made this very difficult for me to say anything. anyways thanks for reading my rambling i havent 100 decided to tell my brother but i hope to soon.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 21:56:46 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j61dns,my mother is most likely the cause of my uncles suicide.,today i learned that my mother was most likely the catalyst for my uncles suicide and im devastated. wednesday night she kicked me out of her car and left me on the side of the road because we were arguing and she was caught in one of her many liesgaslights. i spoke to my grandma today about it and she came clean about the reason behind my uncles suicide. i never met my uncle he committed suicide at a young age while being held in jail. the note mentioned specifically because he felt like a failure he was deep into alcoholism at the time. my grandma sat me down and told me the events that led up to his death. mom and my uncle were both extremely drunk with mom driving and my uncle being the passenger. they got into a nasty fight and mom kicked him to the side of a highway and told him to walk home. so he did. he mistook another house as his own and woke up to the police ripping him off the couch. he was arrested for breaking and entering and disorderly intoxication. he was sent to sit in jail for 60 days. he committed suicide on the 2nd day. if mom didnt leave him on the side of the road he would most likely still be here. theres a part of me thats extremely vindictive of her for doing so but another part that knows that she didnt intend for it to end that way. it pisses me off that im so understanding about it and it devastates me.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 21:53:32 UTC,152,11,0.92,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0
1j61aoy,im turning 18 today and i cant even afford a cake.,today is my 18th birthday a milestone thats supposed to feel like the gateway to adulthood independence and new beginnings. but instead of feeling celebrated i feel overlooked. instead of joy theres this heavy weight in my chest pressing down on me making it hard to swallow the disappointment. for almost two months now my father hasnt been able to work due to a jobrelated injury. money is tight so tight that even something as simple as a cake a small token of acknowledgment is out of reach. i understand. i really do. i know its not their fault and i know they love me but that doesnt make it hurt any less. birthdays are supposed to be special a day when you feel seen. but mine never really have been. ive had birthdays forgotten birthdays i had to share like they werent fully mine birthdays that felt more like an afterthought than a celebration. and now here i am reaching a turning point in my life and it feels like just another ordinary day except worse because deep down i wanted it to be different. what makes it harder is the facade i feel forced to maintain. everyone around me assumes im fine that im well off that things in my life are smooth. my friends ask me what my plans are and i dont even know how to answer. do i pretend i have something lined up? do i admit the truth? how do you explain to people that your birthday this huge symbolic moment feels hollow because even the simplest things are out of reach? i keep telling myself to be grateful to focus on what i do have but id be lying if i said i wasnt struggling. its not about material things its about feeling valued feeling like this day matters feeling like i matter. and right now i just feel invisible. i know life isnt about birthdays that one day in the grand scheme of things shouldnt define anything. but when you spend every other day just pushing through birthdays are supposed to be different. theyre supposed to be a pause a moment where you feel like the world sees you. but today i feel like im standing in the middle of a crowded room screaming for someone to notice me and no one even looks up.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 21:49:53 UTC,11,13,0.92,,,0,0

1j604wh,everyones dying on me,over the past seven years three of my friends have committed suicide and two have attempted. now i am doing better but my partner is suicidal again and he says he cant just take a break from college and work to get some time off because hell lose his student visa. i cant afford to put him through college he cant live with us because my abusive brother wouldnt tolerate a man living with his little sister. his life is full of regrets. he had a fullride scholarship back in new york but due to a misdiagnosed slap lesion they fucked up his shoulder during a surgery and his american degree is basically worthless here. all that work for nothing. i dont know how to cheer him up. i dont want to lose my best friend and first love.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 20:57:08 UTC,3,2,1.0,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0
1j5zzni,i want to get him out of my brain,i dont know where to begin but its been eating at me for a while and for the sake of myself i gotta get it off my chest. i f19 met this guy in 2023 he randomly blocked me a little less than a year ago and we lost contact. its been 9 months and although i dont think about him anymore in the sense where ill openly think oh i miss him out of the blue i still feel like i see him in everyone. ive moved on i dont think about him randomly hearing his name doesnt upset me anymore nothing about him hurts me anymore. the problem is just that certain gestures that hed do certain things hed say every time someone does the same or does something that reminds me of him he comes to mind immediately. mostly its the way hed word stuff and for some reason whenever someone says the same thing or acts similarly its like i have to tell myself its not him. nobody had ever made me feel the way he did which i find weird cause we never dated. kinda feels like i found my soulmate but lost him if that makes sense. it sucks because im in a relationship and i love my boyfriend to bits. weve been dating for around a month now but despite that hes my favourite person. being with him and being able to know him is the highlight of my life so why does that one guy still haunt me? i feel so incredibly guilty writing this because although its not something i can help i feel like shit about it. i feel like the guilt is eating me alive and id bring it up with my boyfriend but i know what hes like. if i do hell start telling me to break up with him even though he could say the same exact thing to me and has actually admitted to feeling this way about someone before and im not mad about it because i understand.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 20:47:53 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
