1j626pw,my chronic illness has taken my will to live,i 22 f have had a chronic condition for more than 10 years now. the thing is its something i havent seen mentioned before or other people experiencing it. i feel so alone and ive seriously considered an escape route in the sense that i genuinely do not have a will to live. i have a chronic sore throat and its ruining my life. i cannot drink or eat anything cold without getting ill after. absolutely anything. i cannot just eat ice cream and enjoy cold drinks. i always have a lump in my throat no matter what i do. after i eatdrink something cold or when im sick this lump gets thicker and inflammation follows. but the worst of all is second hand ciggarette smoke and other dense smokes. just feeling it makes this lump get thicker and i start coughing. i cannot walk normally on the street and always have to avoid smokers that are everywhere. i cannot go out to bars hang with people my age because theyre all smoking. i am the insane one. the doctors do not care since there is no concerning inflammation and ive been told to just deal with the smoke and avoid it as if thats possible. i live in eastern europe ive also had my tonsils removed because the inflammation affected my bones and heart but even after that theres been no improvement. the thing thats causing it is a bacteria called staphylococcus aureus and this chronic state most likely developed when i failed to do a treatment properly. ive been desperate to find an explanation for my pain on my own and was able to find just one scientific paper studying the sensitivity of this bacteria to second hand ciggarette smoke. i wish i could live somewhere isolated without pollution from smoke but its not likely since im just an average woman. no skills to survive on my own nor the resilience for that. i am so tired. i do not see a future for myself. ive never had a relationship due to some other reasons in the past and i dont see myself having one because of this. also sorry if this isnt the appropriate sub for this. i mostly posted this as a cry for help and maybe to attempt at finding people who relate. ill remove my post if needed. thanks for reading.,content warning suicideself harm,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 22:28:51 UTC,4,1,0.65,0,my chronic illness has taken my will to live content warning suicideself harm i 22 f have had a chronic condition for more than 10 years now. the thing is its something i havent seen mentioned before or other people experiencing it. i feel so alone and ive seriously considered an escape route in the sense that i genuinely do not have a will to live. i have a chronic sore throat and its ruining my life. i cannot drink or eat anything cold without getting ill after. absolutely anything. i cannot just eat ice cream and enjoy cold drinks. i always have a lump in my throat no matter what i do. after i eatdrink something cold or when im sick this lump gets thicker and inflammation follows. but the worst of all is second hand ciggarette smoke and other dense smokes. just feeling it makes this lump get thicker and i start coughing. i cannot walk normally on the street and always have to avoid smokers that are everywhere. i cannot go out to bars hang with people my age because theyre all smoking. i am the insane one. the doctors do not care since there is no concerning inflammation and ive been told to just deal with the smoke and avoid it as if thats possible. i live in eastern europe ive also had my tonsils removed because the inflammation affected my bones and heart but even after that theres been no improvement. the thing thats causing it is a bacteria called staphylococcus aureus and this chronic state most likely developed when i failed to do a treatment properly. ive been desperate to find an explanation for my pain on my own and was able to find just one scientific paper studying the sensitivity of this bacteria to second hand ciggarette smoke. i wish i could live somewhere isolated without pollution from smoke but its not likely since im just an average woman. no skills to survive on my own nor the resilience for that. i am so tired. i do not see a future for myself. ive never had a relationship due to some other reasons in the past and i dont see myself having one because of this. also sorry if this isnt the appropriate sub for this. i mostly posted this as a cry for help and maybe to attempt at finding people who relate. ill remove my post if needed. thanks for reading.,0,1
1j7y9is,my value is in my career and its driving me insane.,i graduated university 2023 with a 21. i have worked in retailhospitality since i was 18. ive struggled for years with severe mental health issues. i finally got better and wanted to start my career about august 2024. i started volunteering and applying to jobs. my mum passed away 2 months ago. i have so much time and i should be grieving but i feel this immense pressure to get a good career and prove to myself my life is worthwhile. nobody pressures me except myself. my mum never cared as long as i was happy. same with my partner my friends. but i have put so much of my value into what my career is. i feel ashamed to work in hospitality and i dont know where its came from. im going insane thinking about how im wasting my time every day that passes. im scared that when i do get a new job it wont fulfil my needs to be successful. maybe its because im in my mid 20s and i just have no idea what the fuck im doing. i guess i just needed to rant. thank you,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 13:11:51 UTC,2,0,0.67,0,my value is in my career and its driving me insane. i graduated university 2023 with a 21. i have worked in retailhospitality since i was 18. ive struggled for years with severe mental health issues. i finally got better and wanted to start my career about august 2024. i started volunteering and applying to jobs. my mum passed away 2 months ago. i have so much time and i should be grieving but i feel this immense pressure to get a good career and prove to myself my life is worthwhile. nobody pressures me except myself. my mum never cared as long as i was happy. same with my partner my friends. but i have put so much of my value into what my career is. i feel ashamed to work in hospitality and i dont know where its came from. im going insane thinking about how im wasting my time every day that passes. im scared that when i do get a new job it wont fulfil my needs to be successful. maybe its because im in my mid 20s and i just have no idea what the fuck im doing. i guess i just needed to rant. thank you,0,1
1j7eii2,tw miscarriage. letting the void have my loss.,my husband and i knew it would be hard to have kids. 2 egg retrievals 3 chances 2 transfers and we have our son who is almost 2 years old. i love him so much and live for his laughs and hugs! i want him to have a sibling but our transfer after him didnt work and we are down to one embryo left. we decided to take a break even though i am not young because ivf is fucking hard on your body. well 2 weeks ago i got the shock of a lifetime with a positive test. we just laughed and hugged thinking maybe my body learned what to do with our son and how lucky we were not to have to do another round of ivf. but the cramping started last night and i knew. i begged this baby to please stay. i loved it already though it was so tiny and i had let myself dream about what life would be like with 2. life is cruel though and once a miscarriage starts it doesnt stop because you want it to. i just want to scream to the void that its not fair to dangle that hope then have to suffer through its loss. its not enough that your heart hurts your body is in pain as well. its not fair that we could give a child a good life and people that hate their kids easily get pregnant. im just mad and sad and i hate my body for not being able to do this and i have so many emotions about putting my husband on this rollercoaster with me. i know reddit in general doesnt like kids but i dont care. you existed i love you and im so sorry i couldnt make you stay.,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 18:48:13 UTC,70,18,0.92,0,tw miscarriage. letting the void have my loss. my husband and i knew it would be hard to have kids. 2 egg retrievals 3 chances 2 transfers and we have our son who is almost 2 years old. i love him so much and live for his laughs and hugs! i want him to have a sibling but our transfer after him didnt work and we are down to one embryo left. we decided to take a break even though i am not young because ivf is fucking hard on your body. well 2 weeks ago i got the shock of a lifetime with a positive test. we just laughed and hugged thinking maybe my body learned what to do with our son and how lucky we were not to have to do another round of ivf. but the cramping started last night and i knew. i begged this baby to please stay. i loved it already though it was so tiny and i had let myself dream about what life would be like with 2. life is cruel though and once a miscarriage starts it doesnt stop because you want it to. i just want to scream to the void that its not fair to dangle that hope then have to suffer through its loss. its not enough that your heart hurts your body is in pain as well. its not fair that we could give a child a good life and people that hate their kids easily get pregnant. im just mad and sad and i hate my body for not being able to do this and i have so many emotions about putting my husband on this rollercoaster with me. i know reddit in general doesnt like kids but i dont care. you existed i love you and im so sorry i couldnt make you stay.,0,0

1j8yjxi,i have decided to cut ties with my mom after she refused to be there for me when i needed her the most.,hi all. my mom has always treated me like i am her second favourite after my sister all my life. this has really messed up with my self esteem. now i am married with a son and another one along the way. anyways there have been three situations where i asked her to come and stay with us for a bit. we initially both stayed in the same city but now are 2 hour flight away. 1 first my husband had a work trip in oct last year. the morning sickness was at its peak at 3 months. and i just wanted someone around incase there is a medical emergency for 34 days. we have a nanny to help with my son for most of the day. so all she had to do was just be around. she refused saying she has a neighbours birthday party to attend. i let it go. 2 last month i called her and asked her if she can be with my son for 34 days when i will be in the hospital around my due date. again the nanny is there. she just has to manage the night when he is sleeping. she refused saying she cant leave my dad alone during easter time and needs to cook for him. my dad is a perfectly abled man who can cook his own food. 3 yesterday my husbands side of the family had an emergency situation and my husband had to leave for his parents place for 34 days. this time i was sure i will not ask my mom to come down again. but my husband called my mom and literally begged her to come down as he didnt want to leave me alone with my son at this juncture. her cold response was that she has to be with my dad and cook for him etc. she asked us to keep the nanny to stay over for a couple of days. i fully support my husbands decision to be with his parents at this time for reasons i cant divulge. after yesterday i lost it with her. i told her that she wont hear from me again and she is a sad excuse for a mom who cant even be with her daughter when there can be a medical emergency. and in case i die she need not come either. so she blamed me for moving cities without considering all this. and that my dad has slogged all his life to educate us etc. how can i think she can leave him and rush to me. for context i moved cities because i got a better job that pays her bills to a certain extent and gives me some semblance of work life balance. as for my dad he is not a baby. what kind of mother would want to miss the birth of her grandchild or not want to be with her daughter when she is almost due,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-11 18:59:20 UTC,231,41,0.98,0,i have decided to cut ties with my mom after

1j7n8o7,im done with being religious,hey everyone. first time posting on reddit thanks to the click for giving me enough confidence to post. i was baptized had my first holy communion and i am an altar server in the catholic church. now that im old enough i have started confirmation classes. however i am not happy with this. i am an altpunk kid that identifies as trans bi and greyasexual. with my bright blue and red halfandhalf dyed hair and odd fashion sense i stick out like a sore thumb. i feel like i was forced into this just to make my mom and grandmother happy. i have expressed my discomfort in catholic beliefs for over a year now but it feels like nobody is listening to me. i dont feel anything when i attempt to pray. it feels like god isnt listening. i dont feel loved and i dont feel light from him. ive walked out of confirmation class crying more times than i can count. i feel out of place and uncomfortable at church events and retreats. i dont feel a connection to anything that is said at masses. today was the final straw. there was confession instead of class. my mom and i were sitting together listening to the process for confession and we were given a few questions as food for thought. i really didnt like the questions especially the ones about my relationship with god. i started crying again as i hated the fact that i just didnt see it the way others did. i managed to go up and get my confession over with but after i still felt nothing. my mom sighed handed me some tissues and we stepped out and talked for a bit. instead the discussion being consoling it just felt like she was making up excuses to get me to stay in catholicism. i told her that i felt nothing connection and that this is making me unhappy. we ended up leaving. she didnt speak to me about it on the car ride home. she only talked about other random things to try to lighten the tension i didnt want to hear it. it feels like shes ignoring me. i dont know what to do. sorry for the long ramble but i just needed to let this out. any advice or kind words are appreciated. note i am not targeting anyone who is religious. religion can be great and can bring people together. if you have found comfort in religion stick with that comfort.,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 01:26:32 UTC,5,3,0.79,0,im done with being religious hey everyone. first time posting on reddit thanks to the click for giving me enough confidence to post. i was baptized had my first holy communion and i am an altar server in the catholic church. now that im old enough i have started confirmation classes. however i am not happy with this. i am an altpunk kid that identifies as trans bi and greyasexual. with my bright blue and red halfandhalf dyed hair and odd fashion sense i stick out like a sore thumb. i feel like i was forced into this just to make my mom and grandmother happy. i have expressed my discomfort in catholic beliefs for over a year now but it feels like nobody is listening to me. i dont feel anything when i attempt to pray. it feels like god isnt listening. i dont feel loved and i dont feel light from him. ive walked out of confirmation class crying more times than i can count. i feel out of place and uncomfortable at church events and retreats. i dont feel a connection to anything that is said at masses. today was the final straw. there was confession instead of class. my mom and i were sitting together listening to the process for confession and we were given a few questions as food for thought. i really didnt like the questions especially the ones about my relationship with god. i started crying again as i hated the fact that i just didnt see it the way others did. i managed to go up and get my confession over with but after i still felt nothing. my mom sighed handed me some tissues and we stepped out and talked for a bit. instead the discussion being consoling it just felt like she was making up excuses to get me to stay in catholicism. i told her that i felt nothing connection and that this is making me unhappy. we ended up leaving. she didnt speak to me about it on the car ride home. she only talked about other random things to try to lighten the tension i didnt want to hear it. it feels like shes ignoring me. i dont know what to do. sorry for the long ramble but i just needed to let this out. any advice or kind words are appreciated. note i am not targeting anyone who is religious. religion can be great and can bring people together. if you have found comfort in religion stick with that comfort.,0,0
1j623o7,i just broke up with my partner because they didnt even realise theyd cheated on me,life is feeling real batshit today. came across my partners alt account on social media. open to public viewing. they described it as an orgasm journal where they seemed to be exploring self pleasure. cool love that. very datadriven. cut to a post about collective episode with another online user. they had been exploring what sounds to be a lot like mutual masturbation where youre turned on by the idea of someone watching viewing things through a datadriven lens in the name of research. naturally i lost my shit and messaged them. we called and i told them all of the assumptions id made. they didnt say i was wrong just said its research. i feel like im getting pulled into insanity and delusion here. it feels like kink gone wrong. what do you mean its research?? research is ethical? having sexual conversations around topics that arouse you with another person for the purpose of sexual pleasure sounds like infidelity to me? i cant believe i had to tell this person who most of the time has their head on square amp thinks intelligently and rationally that this constitutes as cheating. its not research or data what are you talking about!! theyve just posted after our break up yes im going to stop looking but its been 12 hours please let me wallow that theyre open not poly. fast fucking turnaround when we were in a monogamous relationship literally 8 hours ago. we were in a long term relationship and i cannot for the life of me process that this is the way it ends. can someone please tell me im not going insane? edit just to clarify weve had in depth conversations around our expectations of a monogamous relationship. i didnt specifically set a boundary of i am not comfortable with mutual masturbation online in the name of research because.. thats very specific and not at all a normal conversation to have lol. but i did explain what would be uncomfortable or dealbreaking for me and i would fully put the onus on them to have needed to clarify in this situation instead of going in blind because i think its very clearly something i would take issue with based on every other conversation weve had on the subject.,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 22:25:00 UTC,2962,110,0.97,0,i just broke up with my partner because they didnt even realise theyd cheated on me life is feeling real batshit today. came across my partners alt account on social media. open to public viewing. they described it as an orgasm journal where they seemed to be exploring self pleasure. cool love that. very datadriven. cut to a post about collective episode with another online user. they had been exploring what sounds to be a lot like mutual masturbation where youre turned on by the idea of someone watching viewing things through a datadriven lens in the name of research. naturally i lost my shit and messaged them. we called and i told them all of the assumptions id made. they didnt say i was wrong just said its research. i feel like im getting pulled into insanity and delusion here. it feels like kink gone wrong. what do you mean its research?? research is ethical? having sexual conversations around topics that arouse you with another person for the purpose of sexual pleasure sounds like infidelity to me? i cant believe i had to tell this person who most of the time has their head on square amp thinks intelligently and rationally that this constitutes as cheating. its not research or data what are you talking about!! theyve just posted after our break up yes im going to stop looking but its been 12 hours please let me wallow that theyre open not poly. fast fucking turnaround when we were in a monogamous relationship literally 8 hours ago. we were in a long term relationship and i cannot for the life of me process that this is the way it ends. can someone please tell me im not going insane? edit just to clarify weve had in depth conversations around our expectations of a monogamous relationship. i didnt specifically set a boundary of i am not comfortable with mutual masturbation online in the name of research because.. thats very specific and not at all a normal conversation to have lol. but i did explain what would be uncomfortable or dealbreaking for me and i would fully put the onus on them to have needed to clarify in this situation instead of going in blind because i think its very clearly something i would take issue with based on every other conversation weve had on the subject.,0,0

1j5xpao,the weight of my own mistakes,there was once a boy who believed in lovenot the fairytale kind but the kind that made the world feel right. and for a while he had it. a girl who stood by him who saw the best in him even when he didnt see it himself. she loved him with a kind of loyalty that was rare a love that never wavered even when he gave her reasons to walk away. but love isnt just about feelings its about choices. and one day fear made him choose wrong. he let gonot because he didnt love her but because he was afraid. afraid of not being enough. afraid that one day she would leave and it would hurt too much. so instead of holding on he let himself drift away. he convinced himself that if he stopped putting in effort if he stopped making her a priority then maybe just maybe it wouldnt hurt when it finally ended. but she never left. she stayed. she still believed in them even when he had already started moving away. and then he made a mistake he could never take backhe gave his heart to someone else before he had truly let her go. at first he thought he could move on. but something inside him shifted. after some time in his new relationship he finally understood his mistakes. he realized how deeply he had hurt the one person who had truly loved him. but he never knew how to make it right. how do you fix something after breaking it beyond repair? how do you face the person you betrayed knowing no apology will ever be enough? he wanted to go back to do something anythingbut the guilt held him back. and so he stayed. not because he had moved on but because he was afraidafraid that if he left his new relationship to make things right he would once again be the villain in his own story. the guilt consumed him so instead of looking back he convinced himself that staying was the only way forward. and in his guilt he changed. determined not to make the same mistakes he became kinder. he tried to treat the new girl right giving her the love and care he had once failed to give. but kindness when given to the wrong person is easily taken for granted. and she did exactly that. she manipulated him gaslighted him twisted his guilt into a weapon against him. she made him believe he was always wrong always at fault. every time he questioned her actions she turned it around making him doubt his own reality. whenever he felt she was wrong she made herself the victim and made him feel like he was the one to blame. slowly he lost himself. the person he once wasthe person who understood things clearlybegan to fade. and as you already know he never spoke up. regret became his shadow. guilt his reflection. he had apologized to the one he had hurt over and over again but some wounds dont heal with words. he had hurt someone beyond repair and now he was paying the pricenot just through his own pain but through the way he was now being treated. he wanted to move forward to leave it all behind but no matter what he did the past followed. every quiet moment became a reminder of what he had lost. every time he tried to love again he feared he would be taken for granted just as he had once done to her. maybe this was karma. maybe this was what he deserved. or maybe just maybe he still had a choice. as he stood at the edge of everything he had been and everything he could become he realized something he had no idea what came next. would he ever forgive himself? would he ever find peace? or would he always be haunted by what he had done? he didnt know. but for the first time in a long time he was ready to find out.,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 19:27:03 UTC,1,0,1.0,0,the weight of my own mistakes there was once a boy who believed in lovenot the fairytale kind but the kind that made the world feel right. and for a while he had it. a girl who stood by him who saw the best in him even when he didnt see it himself. she loved him with a kind of loyalty that was rare a love that never wavered even when he gave her reasons to walk away. but love isnt just about feelings its about choices. and one day fear made him choose wrong. he let gonot because he didnt love her but because he was afraid. afraid of not being enough. afraid that one day she would leave and it would hurt too much. so instead of holding on he let himself drift away. he convinced himself that if he stopped putting in effort if he stopped making her a priority then maybe just maybe it wouldnt hurt when it finally ended. but she never left. she stayed. she still believed in them even when he had already started moving away. and then he made a mistake he could never take backhe gave his heart to someone else before he had truly let her go. at first he thought he could move on. but something inside him shifted. after some time in his new relationship he finally understood his mistakes. he realized how deeply he had hurt the one person who had truly loved him. but he never knew how to make it right. how do you fix something after breaking it beyond repair?

1j7knoh,reconnecting with someone but im so sensitive to their teasing comments,not really looking for any advice on this i just need to vent as i dont feel its a big enough deal to bring it up to them grinning_face_with_sweat ive recently been talking to someone i lost touch with ages ago. we used to be extremely close and always teased each other jokingly. but since reconnecting with them ive just been feeling a lot more sensitive to their comments? it feels silly as i know they dont mean anything bad by their words but i just find myself wondering if they even really like me as a person or if theyre judging me. couple of examples i have pet cats and this friend knows i love them. theyve never liked cats which is fine. they sent over a funny video of a cat but that somehow devolved into them telling me how much they hate cats and talking about how they also thought cats made their owners bitches etc... i just tried to brush it off and joke back defending my stance on cats a little bit. this isnt the first time ive had to hear about someones grievances with cats but its just such a conversation killer for me. like cool you hate the animals i happen to really like. i am so glad you have given me this reminder lol. the other thing that bothered me a bit was just a comment that made me feel like they thought i was immature. i said something like oh this slaps and they immediately said dont say that youre 31. its such a small thing but i guess ive always been a bit anxious about seeming mature enough to people so it did sting a bit. i imagine a lot of this is just my own anxieties getting the best of me as well as the fact that its been so long that were almost strangers in a lot of ways. i guess i dont really know what they think do me anymore. if you made it this far thanks for reading! grinning_face_with_sweat,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 23:19:06 UTC,1,0,0.67,0,reconnecting with someone but im so sensitive to their teasing comments not really looking for any advice on this i just need to vent as i dont feel its a big enough deal to bring it up to them grinning_face_with_sweat ive recently been talking to someone i lost touch with ages ago. we used to be extremely close and always teased each other jokingly. but since reconnecting with them ive just been feeling a lot more sensitive to their comments? it feels silly as i know they dont mean anything bad by their words but i just find myself wondering if they even really like me as a person or if theyre judging me. couple of examples i have pet cats and this friend knows i love them. theyve never liked cats which is fine. they sent over a funny video of a cat but that somehow devolved into them telling me how much they hate cats and talking about how they also thought cats made their owners bitches etc... i just tried to brush it off and joke back defending my stance on cats a little bit. this isnt the first time ive had to hear about someones grievances with cats but its just such a conversation killer for me. like cool you hate the animals i happen to really like. i am so glad you have given me this reminder lol. the other thing that bothered me a bit was just a comment that made me feel like they thought i was immature. i said something like oh this slaps and they immediately said dont say that youre 31. its such a small thing but i guess ive always been a bit anxious about seeming mature enough to people so it did sting a bit. i imagine a lot of this is just my own anxieties getting the best of me as well as the fact that its been so long that were almost strangers in a lot of ways. i guess i dont really know what they think do me anymore. if you made it this far thanks for reading! grinning_face_with_sweat,0,0
1j8i893,i genuinely dont like people and its causing me to become a damn near recluse....,growing up i didnt have the good fortune of growing up in a well adjusted family. multiple people in my family were toxic hot messes that never sought to improve their lives or get appropriate therapy or find ways to remedy their own issues. i was always a kid who spoke my mind and who called out my toxic mums behavior and anyone around me. she would then tell everyone i was a disobedient problematic child and other family or friends would reprimand me even though she was lying. she only wanted to destroy my reputation. she only did this to make sure she would shut me up.... for good. my dislike for people has grown because toxicity happens all over the world. toxic people never having the awareness to get help or do better. when people say most people are good people that is a gotdamn lie. its simply impossible in terms of how many people dont have basic self awareness and basic emotional intelligence. i loathe how people are incapable of empathizing with one another or working together to create change in a good way. i hate how people screw each other over in relationships through complete dishonestydisregard for the other person. cheating. lying. using and hurting the other person. complete cruelty. why??? it goes back to the very beginning of my post. toxic parents. toxic family. most people are not good people. ive seen and experienced too many things to think differently at this point in life. i am irritated with how people are also passive. i mean damn. the building i live in management takes gross advantage of tenants. they constantly violate the terms of tenants leases and then dare you to take actions to protect yourself. i live in a building of over 400 tenants yet people only complain to each other about major issues and never take real action to change their circumstances. it is not in me to sit and complain all day without taking action. i simply dont understand how people operate in life like this??!! fully grown adults just sitting back and allowing the worst to happen to them or other people. i had my own situation to deal with concerning management. when i get angry i get really angry and i take very calculated extreme measures to remedy the problem quickly. another tenant heard how i stood up to management and was in shock. all i thought was wtf are you in shock about????unamused_face all i did was speak the truth get a lawyer and i followed through on creating boundaries and followed through on any threats if they stepped out of line. people have the same ability to stand up for themselves but they dont. they wont!!!!! a lady tenant in my building said you seem intelligent then proceeded to trauma dump all of her grievances about the buildingmanagement on to me. i asked her if she wanted to brainstorm solutions to fight the issues or if she just wanted to vent. i basically told her i didnt want to hear it if all she wanted to do was complain and not do anything. then she got upset with me and started going off. im a very solution oriented person so complaining without a plan is counterproductive to me. i dont understand the blatant world of passivity people live in. people will let human rights disasters happen right in front of them. they will allow the complete decline and fall of democracy. they will allow multiple entities to take advantage of them and literally do absolutely nothing to stop it. so for the past 2 years now i pretty much have been a recluse. i disappeared off of social media ive stopped reaching out to people. and i dont care to socialize mostly at all. im just sick and tired of people. they are so entirely disappointing. anyone else feeling this way?,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-11 04:00:50 UTC,9,1,1.0,0,i genuinely dont like people and its causing me to become a damn near recluse.... growing up i didnt have the good fortune of growing up in a well adjusted family. multiple people in my family were toxic hot messes that never sought to improve their lives or get appropriate therapy or find ways to remedy their own issues. i was always a kid who spoke my mind and who called out my toxic mums behavior and anyone around me. she would then tell everyone i was a disobedient problematic child and other family or friends would reprimand me even though she was lying. she only wanted to destroy my reputation. she only did this to make sure she would shut me up.... for good. my dislike for people has grown because toxicity happens all over the world. toxic people never having the awareness to get help or do better. when people say most people are good people that is a gotdamn lie. its simply impossible in terms of how many people dont have basic self awareness and basic emotional intelligence. i loathe how people are incapable of empathizing with one another or working together to create change in a good way. i hate how people screw each other over in relationships through complete dishonestydisregard for the other person. cheating. lying. using and hurting the other person. complete cruelty. why???

1j7ybiz,living with my abusive sister,my whole childhood was a blur due to all of the abuse i had to endure from my sister. it all started around when i was in kindergarten and she was in 6th grade. i remember her holding me down in my mothers closet punching me in the face repeatedly. she would hold my head underwater when we went to the pool until i almost went unconscious. she would chase me and my mom around the house with any weapon she could find and she ended up stabbing me with a knife in the stomach at some point. this and more all went on for years until she moved out after she graduated high school in 2020. at some time between 1st3rd grade i was sad by her. she would make me watch pay gorn with her then she would make me kiss her also lick her chest and her downstairs. she would make me and my disabled little sister shower with her and one time she also made my little sister lick her. i spoke to my cousin about this and similar happened to them. they also witnessed my sisters abuse on many occasions. fast forward to today i am 17 my sister is 23 and she moved in with me my mom and my little sister after the hurricanes along with her fiancéef22 and their son2. they originally were just evacuating but they decided that they werent going back. they were supposed to move out within a month but it has now been 6 months. they reside in my little sisters room so she now shares a room with my mom. the whole house is being taken over and im tired of biting my tongue. last week i was about to take a shower and i noticed a pretty big mess my nephew made. there were crushed eggshells spread all over the carpet along with stickers and price tags my mom runs an antique business i asked my sister to clean it up and i go take a shower. i had just gotten out and there were even more messes that were made. there were crushed eggshells are still there. i go to the kitchen and there were magnets covering the floor which were also in the dining room. the cats water had been dumped out and there were three towels in the garbage. i asked my sister what had happened shes sitting on the couch on her phone. she says something along the lines of my son was just playing. i asked her to clean it up and she said ill do it later. the thing is she either never cleans or she does it half assed. so i texted my mom pictures and basically told her that these messes were made my sister isnt cleaning it and im not gonna be the one responsible for it. my mom calls my sister and she immediately starts yelling at me saying why would you tell mom my sons making a mess? dont talk about my son like that i tell her that its not her son i understand hes a toddler but she has to be responsible for that. my mom calls me and i go to leave to my room. i noticed my sister following me and out of the corner of my eye i see her threaten to punch me. i turn around and say girl dont even then she punches me in the face and we tackle each other to the ground. my mom was on the phone the whole time and was telling her to get out of the house. she wouldnt leave and kept arguing with me saying stuff about how nobody helps her and she will never talk to us again but the thing is she has lived in three peoples houses rent free including ours. she asks everybody for money and they send her money. our family has helped her so much and she is so ungrateful and entitled. my mom gets home from work and tells her that she needs to get a hotel for a few days before they can come back and have a conversation about this all. three days pass and it was the most relaxing three days of my life. i deep cleaned the house and discovered how much damage she has caused to our house holes in the wall paint splattered on everything just everything being nasty. the day has come that they come back. my sister has to work so she drops off her fiancé and their son first. i talk to her about everything and we seem to be on the same page she witnessed my sister hit me and argue with me. time passes and everyone is home now. we tried to talk but my sister wasnt engaging and was just staring off into space. at this point no one is mad anymore we just want to work through this bump in the road but my sister oh no she was pissed. she denied everything and acted like she didnt do anything wrong and kept asking for proof of everything that we talked to her about even though everyone knows what happened. she leaves and goes to their room. i leave and go to my room but i can hear my sister talking to her fiancé about everything through the wall and she acted like she had no clue about anything. she said she didnt see my sister punch me and was just telling my sister what she wanted to hear. this pisses me off so i tell my mom whats going on and we go to their room to stop the twisting of the story. my sister had nothing but hateful things to say to me but what really got me was that she said i never have her back when i say i do. i really have had her back so many times there are so many things that i have never told another soul because she asked me to. i tell her that and shes still denying and lying. i figured that the only way i can prove to her that i in fact did have her back and to get it through to her that she needs to stop lying and be accountable for her actions was to tell her darkest secrets. i started tame and told my mom the reasoning why my sister got jumped a few years back. my sister acts oblivious. i as her if she wants me to keep going. she says she doesnt care so i tell her fiancé about how she cheated on her with a man less that a year ago. of course she denies it but i had proof. i pull up text messages of her describing everything when it happened and she still tried to deny it. she and her fiancé start arguing which causes my sister to run away. she would do this all the time growing up if she got caught doing something bad she would run away but she would come back an hour later but keep in mind this is a 23 year old adult were talking about. we found her sitting on the street talking to a random man and we bring her back home. she keeps threatening to off herself which is another tactic she used as kids. at home she starts arguing with my mom and i saying that everyone hates her and that i ruined her life and i only said that out of spite. i told her exactly why i did it but shes not having it because when she makes up a story in her head she will stick to it. me and her fiancé go to the gas station to blow off some steam and we talked the whole time. she talked about how my sister would try to do nasty stuff to her but she didnt want to because she had a gut feeling that she was cheating and she was right. she also said that when she didnt want to do anything my sister would try to force herself into her. her saying this triggered my memory of the sa that happened when i was a kid. i told her about it and she said she believed me. we get home and i figured i should probably tell my mom about the sa. i had hidden this from everyone because my sister always threatened me and by the time she was no longer a threat to me i had blocked out that memory. this whole situation just resurfaced everything. my mom was horrified and at this point no one knows what to do but my sister needs to get out of the house. she has no one to go to because she ruined everyones trust. she has no money because she cant save for shit. we decide to sleep on it because at this point its like 1 am. i couldnt sleep for the life of me but the next day this all continues. the fiancé repeated everything i told her to my sister and of course she is denying everything and calling me a liar who is just out to get her. not only that but her fiancé is denying everything that she told me such as my sister forcing herself onto her. their stories for everything keep changing but mine has stayed the same for everyone. all day my sister was talking shit about me. its so bad that i cant even be in my own room because i can hear them talking through the wall. as of now im sleeping on the floor in my moms room. if im not in the same room as my mom they will talk shit to her. despite all of this my mom believes me and my one story along with all of the proof i have. i havent been this enraged since i lived with my sister as a kid. it feels like im living with squatters from the worst roommate show. i have zero privacy and i cant breathe without someone making something up about me. i dont know what to do this is still going on as of right now. im currently on spring break so we have time to deal with this but we dont know how and if theyre still here by the time i go back to school i will go insane. i have no where to go to because all my family lives in another state. i cant live like this. theres a lot of details i missed but its just too much and my brain is scrambled. if anyone has any advice please help.,content warning sexual assault,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-10 13:14:41

whole time. she talked about how my sister would try to do nasty stuff to her but she didnt want to because she had a gut feeling that she was cheating and she was right. she also said that when she didnt want to do anything my sister would try to force herself into her. her saying this triggered my memory of the sa that happened when i was a kid. i told her about it and she said she believed me. we get home and i figured i should probably tell my mom about the sa. i had hidden this from everyone because my sister always threatened me and by the time she was no longer a threat to me i had blocked out that memory. this whole situation just resurfaced everything. my mom was horrified and at this point no one knows what to do but my sister needs to get out of the house. she has no one to go to because she ruined everyones trust. she has no money because she cant save for shit. we decide to sleep on it because at this point its like 1 am. i couldnt sleep for the life of me but the next day this all continues. the fiancé repeated everything i told her to my sister and of course she is denying everything and calling me a liar who is just out to get her. not only that but her fiancé is denying everything that she told me such as my sister forcing herself onto her. their stories for everything keep changing but mine has stayed the same for everyone. all day my sister was talking shit about me. its so bad that i cant even be in my own room because i can hear them talking through the wall. as of now im sleeping on the floor in my moms room. if im not in the same room as my mom they will talk shit to her. despite all of this my mom believes me and my one story along with all of the proof i have. i havent been this enraged since i lived with my sister as a kid. it feels like im living with squatters from the worst roommate show. i have zero privacy and i cant breathe without someone making something up about me. i dont know what to do this is still going on as of right now. im currently on spring break so we have time to deal with this but we dont know how and if theyre still here by the time i go back to school i will go insane. i have no where to go to because all my family lives in another state. i cant live like this. theres a lot of details i missed but its just too much and my brain is scrambled. if anyone has any advice please help.,0,1
1j8i324,insecure about my size for many years and now im absolutely flabbergasted,so i was sexting with a woman and sent her a dick pic. what ensued was absolutely crazy for me. ive only ever been with one woman who was my exwife and i got no particular comments about my size but some remakes regarding her previous partners which contributed to me feeling insecure. i know im about average in length and perhaps slightly above average in girth its difficult to find facts about this. but now suddenly this woman is scared and nervous of potential sex because she thinks its too big. i was sure it was nothing to worry about and that it wasnt too big or anything. she said she is relatively small but still. me trying to convince her its not that big made her feel like i was diminishing her fear. but i was simply so flabbergasted in what i was experiencing. being insecure for the majority of my life to eventually not caring about size to now being told its big. i feel as though my perception of reality is being distorted. almost feel like she was lying just to make me feel good or something. this might sound like a humble brag or whatever bragging about an average penis lol but truly i am flabbergasted. flabbergasted is the correct word for what i wasam experiencing.,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-11 03:52:44 UTC,1810,275,0.9,0,insecure about my size for many years and now im absolutely flabbergasted so i was sexting with a woman and sent her a dick pic. what ensued was absolutely crazy for me. ive only ever been with one woman who was my exwife and i got no particular comments about my size but some remakes regarding her previous partners which contributed to me feeling insecure. i know im about average in length and perhaps slightly above average in girth its difficult to find facts about this. but now suddenly this woman is scared and nervous of potential sex because she thinks its too big. i was sure it was nothing to worry about and that it wasnt too big or anything. she said she is relatively small but still. me trying to convince her its not that big made her feel like i was diminishing her fear. but i was simply so flabbergasted in what i was experiencing. being insecure for the majority of my life to eventually not caring about size to now being told its big. i feel as though my perception of reality is being distorted. almost feel like she was lying just to make me feel good or something. this might sound like a humble brag or whatever bragging about an average penis lol but truly i am flabbergasted. flabbergasted is the correct word for what i wasam experiencing.,0,1
1j7fdqt,my exgirlfriend gaslit me while relationship while cheating on me found out on my birthday,my m24 now exf26 girlfriend started dating in march last year. i had just come out of a toxic situationship where i take part blame. i was a bad communicator im sure i still am but i gained some communication skills. i really liked her found my now ex 3 weeks later. i knew it would be a rebound but it helped so much. especially considering this girl had been my crush since 8 years ago when i had first started working with her. we had so much fun early on trips going out eating out. it started to feel less like a rebound and something of a real relationship. unfortunately it came to her moving out of her moms house. she needed a place to go and me with my somewhat trust issues was scared to let her move in with her friends which were one girl and two guys. she had been known to get around but i trusted her more than most people did and had hope. she was very kind had many mental issues but nothing i couldnt stand i had grown up with childhood trauma and this seemed like nothing. so me with my trust issues and wanting to move out of my moms house as well took her offer of renting a place together. it seemed fun and i had just started a career job so it seemed like a good time. found out very quickly it would not be. see my ex well call fiona had severe insecurities and drinking issues not to mention drug addiction. i had known to some extent but not to this severity. the first week we moved in i wanted to have a get together party for our first place together. turns out fiona hates having people in her space. she was very quiet the whole night and near the end she stormed off to the room where id get yelled at when i head to bed. she scream at me in bed as i had work the next morning i told her sorry and wed talk about it tomorrow. she got up and stormed out the room. i was just happy for the quiet until i hear her screaming my name and yelling help! help! i storm out seeing her wrist covered in blood with it spilling all over the floors. i help her best i can she didnt hit an artery so it soon stopped but left a nasty scar. after this night most nights especially when we went out i would get no rest being accused of cheating or just not giving her enough love. over the next few months one of our mutual friends decided a surprise birthday party for her. i honestly wasnt thinking to hard about it i just thought maybe itd make her happy forgetting she didnt like people in her space. same thing happened. she was upset the whole night stayed in the bedrooms and never came out. through out the night you could hear her screams saying get out of my house! in the most embarrassing way possible. her sister was there and tried to calm her down the whole night which did not work. i eventually got everyone out because the music was barely covering it up. i went to bed again. same thing yelling at me. she got up stormed out. i was worried but thought that it was a one time thing. nope i instantly hear my name being screamed. this time much worse. i come out to see the cut is even deeper attempt to stop the bleeding but it just wont. i call 911 while making a makeshift tourniquet to try and stop it. the paramedics get her after the police which was someone i knew. i told them about how she was saying before that she wanted to die. i didnt think this was an attempt but a callout. i took her to the hospital after the medics said she didnt need the ambulance after patching her up. stayed up all night at the hospital dropped her off at home then went to work. i was miserable. i couldnt stand this anymore. i didnt want to break the lease but at the same time i also still cared for this girl. i felt bad. i needed a way out that night was my chance but you just couldnt leave her alone she cried and begged me. so we continued our relationship. a few months later same thing yelling at me and saying i dont give her enough affirmations and accusing me of deleting snapchats and sneaking people in when shes off at work. which led to a night that she destroyed my tv in the living room put holes in the walls and screamed at me in my face. i was done i left to stay at my friends house. told her to leave wed figure out the situation after. the day after she said she needed time to move and wanted to talk. i went over and we talked the whole night. she promised shed get therapy and help. and i felt so terrible i truly loved this girl but it was such a toxic relationship. i gave her one last chance. we decided to stick together agreeing to talk things out more. see i still have my trust issues and being accused of things makes me curious why its that in particular. i memorized her password months ago but never really felt the need to look through her phone. i had it just in case. but i was working one night straight shift. she went out with her friends. acted very strange to me and i just felt something was off. i come home at 7am find her dead asleep. couldnt even wake her up to give her a kiss. she had left her phone on my side of the bed. i felt the urge to look through it. went through it for hours. finding hidden messages in messenger of her taking to her ex saying how she thinks about him everyday and that she needs him. other messages to her other ex on snapchat came across it by chance because it had been cleared and muted. it was of last night being very flirty and him leaving hearts and her pictures with her hearting back. her saying i miss you and then a phone call about 6 minutes lasting. i called this number i asked him to be straight up if shes cheating. he sounded dumbfounded but said she wasnt and that they were just friends that use to date. but i found pictures dating only right before we started dating that they were kissing and all over eachother. i woke her up absolutely heated. ngl this was probably the angriest ive ever been. i told her what i had seen. she of course denied it. eventually admitting that it was cheating but they never had sex. which i absolutely think is a lie. but i said it was over and she took it so easily. she nodded and called her mom got her stuff in the car then laughing about a joke she made saying shes tired of constantly moving. all while i sit and wait for her to leave. also if i didnt mention this happened all on my birthday. she leaves not answering any of my questions like why? how could you do this? since then ive been sitting here she still left a few things and needs a truck to come pick them up. she just texted me that shes coming today to pick them up. i still feel like shit but can hold my emotions together.,content warning suicideself harm,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 19:25:36 UTC,0,4,0.5,0,my

1j73qfo,my partner is completely irresponsible with money and im considering breaking up,i apologize in advance for any grammarspelling mistakes english is not my first language. for context me 27f and my bf 25m have been in a relationship for 5 years and living together in my fathers house for 4 in my country living costs are really high so its pretty common to still stay with your parents beyond your 20s. at the end of last year my bf decided he needed a new phone for posting content tiktok and reels since his current phones camera wasnt good and his career gym instructor personal trainer could use a boost from social media. while i agreed that a new phone with a better camera would help and i knew that he had saved some money i asked him to wait a little longer 1 month or 2 before making any impulsive puchases since i was unemployed at the time and that money could be used for any emergencies. well he disregarded everything i said and decided to buy the phone anyway and

way he wanted the shop was really suspicious and it was better to buy from an official store if he was going to spend that much in a phone. it was really frustrating but i tried to help him contact his bank to see if there was anything we could do and to my surprise they refund almost half of the money but my happiness was short lived because the very next day he fell for another scam and lost both the recovered money plus 300 250 from his account and 50 from mine. i was livid at this point the car had broken down another 600 expense we had no way to pay our share of the bills plus the repair costs and he had to ask for money from his mother bless her to solve everything but we survived. well now im employed and things were better until yesterday when he told me he was thinking again about buying the phone to wich i told him no way not right now since were not completely stable yet to spend that much money and i thought he would be at least a bit more mindful since were still paying for his poor decisions from last year and we barely have money for bills but he didnt want to listen to my reasoning kept justifying why he needed it and im sure hell buy it even though he knows that if he does that ill have to cover his share of house expenses and im honestly mentally and emotionally exhausted i feel like he isnt my partner anymore just an oversized toddler and its draining me. for additional context hes been betting his money on soccer games and although he wins most of them last week he almost lost all of the grocery money our currency is not usd so those are

considering breaking up i apologize in advance for any grammarspelling mistakes english is not my first language. for context me 27f and my bf 25m have been in a relationship for 5 years and living together in my fathers house for 4 in my country living costs are really high so its pretty common to still stay with your parents beyond your 20s. at the end of last year my bf decided he needed a new phone for posting content tiktok and reels since his current phones camera wasnt good and his career gym instructor personal trainer could use a boost from social media. while i agreed that a new phone with a better camera would help and i knew that he had saved some money i asked him to wait a little longer 1 month or 2 before making any impulsive puchases since i was unemployed at the time and that money could be used for any emergencies. well he disregarded everything i said and decided to buy the phone anyway and to make a long story short it was a scam in wich he lost almost 800. to

1j8y9fu,im 15 but i already feel 20,at just 16 years old im already thinking deeply about my future. unlike many others my age ive been through a lot thats shaped who i am today. from helping my parents and carrying the weight of their struggles to pushing through the challenges of growing up ive learned that life doesnt hand you anything on a silver platter. ive had to work for everything think for others before myself and endure a lot of stress and anger. but at the same time ive developed a mindset that sets me apart. one of the key thoughts ive been carrying with me is the idea that tomorrow is always promised. tomorrow is always there until the day you die. this isnt just a saying for meits something i live by. to me this quote represents both a hope and a grind. its not just about letting life go by without thinking its about realizing that each tomorrow is a chance to push forward to fight for something better and to build a future. i dont want to be rich like some people dream of im not asking for millions. i just want a stable happy life a twostory house in the suburbs a good car like a porsche cayenne a loving wife and kids. i want to be able to give my family a better life than what i had to leave something behind for my future family tree so they dont have to struggle the way i did. its not about me its about building something that lasts for them. until a few months ago i used to think life was just about living day by day doing whatever you want because we all die one day. but something shifted in me. now i see life as a journey where you have to grind and grind and grind until you make it. it might not happen today next year or even in ten yearsbut eventually something will work out. and when it does thats when you can finally breathe finally enjoy life without the weight of stress on your shoulders. people judge me without knowing what ive been through. they call me immature but they dont understand that while they have a cupcake on their plate i have a wedding cake a heavy load of responsibilities and struggles that theyve never had to deal with. ive grown up too fast. im 15 almost 16 but my life has made me feel like im 20 already. i smoke to calm the pain but i know im not addicted its just a way to escape the stress. nicotine soothes my anger though i know its not a solution for the long run. ive tried what i really want is to focus on building a future. i want to master marketing and strategy because i know thats the way to make real money. ive tried dropshipping and digital marketing nothing worked but im not giving up. i want to learn how to grow businesses sell them and build something meaningful. i dont see myself as a normal person. i know i have a different mindset a sharper more driven way of thinking that most people my age dont have. thats why i believe i have what it takes to be an entrepreneur. i want to create businesses not just for money but to secure a future for my family and to leave behind a legacy. at the end of the day i dont care about fame for myself i want my familys name to shine. i want people to know who we are what we built and what we stood for. life might be hard

want to learn how to grow businesses sell them and build something meaningful. i dont see myself as a normal person. i know i have a different mindset a sharper more driven way of thinking that most people my age dont have. thats why i believe i have what it takes to be an entrepreneur. i want to create businesses not just for money but to secure a future for my family and to leave behind a legacy. at the end of the day i dont care about fame for myself i want my familys name to shine. i want people to know who we are what we built and what we stood for. life might be hard now but i keep pushing because i know that tomorrow is always there. until the day i die ill keep moving forward no matter how tough things get.,0,0
1j8if00,i feel betrayed and hurt by my ex.,i 20f broke up with my boyfriend of 10 months last weekend and i cant shake the feeling of betrayal and anger off. my emotions went haywire when he turned around and said itd be better if we split. i agreed at the time but later that night found myself deeply regretting my decision. i begged him to take me back only for him to metaphorically slam a door in my face. to begin with my ex who ill call joe for this was a sweet and caring guy. things were going well at first for me and joe despite being long distance. at first wed call for hours and play together having a laugh and playfully teasing each other. it was honestly a great experience for me id talk to joe nonstop and always make sure to give him morning and night texts getting online and helping him with his projects he was working on. things ended up starting to go downhill about halfway into our relationship. ill be brutally honest im extremely clingy and have a crippling fear of abandonment due to trauma from my past so i struggle a lot with being left without replies. at the time things started to go downhill joe had started to become increasingly infrequent with his replies. i got worried and confused i would end up asking if there was something i was doing wrong or if he still loved me only for him to turn around and say everything was fine. i started to feel as though the relationship was only being driven by me that if i stopped then hed just forget i exist or something. compared to the start of our relationship joe had just changed. instead of actively responding to me and seeming genuinely interested in what i had to say all my sent reels or posts would just be liked in bulk as if he wasnt even taking the time to acknowledge anything i sent. however things took a sharp downward spiral a couple of months before me and joe split. one of my excolleagues lets call him fred and i fell out over comments hed make. he would constantly jokingly flirt with me and my best friend who both explained that we were uncomfortable with his advances. in the end i ended up no longer responding to his messages. i needed space but apparently fred wasnt very fond of that idea. after a while fred quit his job and decided to leave me a note which basically threatened me stating that hed be my demise and whatever other shit he went on about. long story short fred made me incredibly uncomfortable and i asked joe if he would cut him off as them being friends made me uncomfortable. joe refused saying something about ruining friendships cause of cutting people off in the past which fair enough but this is the wellbeing and safety of your girlfriend were talking about here. id do the same for him id protect him with my life if i had to. i suffered silently for those months hoping maybe one day joe would change his mind but he never did. in the end i just couldnt deal with the emotional toll this was taking on me and since i struggled with wording it myself due to my anxiety i had to get my best friend to talk to him about it. after she did i got the message from joe suggesting that we should just be friends mentioning how his work schedule of getting up and going to sleep early was taking a toll on him which is fair enough but it only takes two fucking minutes out of your day to reply to your girlfriend. eventually i gave in. even if it broke me i knew joe didnt love me anymore but i couldnt help but shake the feeling that it was all my fault. i spiralled badly joe was the main thing keeping my mental health stable after my self harming tendencies and past suicide attempts. i couldnt handle it. the emotional pain was so unbearable it became physically painful. my world came crashing down in that moment the only thing i could think of was how none of this wouldve happened if i wasnt around in the first place. that night i threw caution to the wind and attempted on my life. the rest of that night is a blur to me in all honesty. aside from some nasty painful cuts on my wrists im slowly healing. ive been reflecting a lot on my relationship with joe over the last few days thinking back to the times we actually spent together face to face. each time the same me spending 130 to travel down to the other end of the country to see him spending an extra 3040 on takeaways. the most he ever spent on me being 20. i feel used and betrayed. i thought he loved me. i thought he genuinely loved me. but looking back on it i realise i was nothing more than a cocksleeve to him. how hed always try and touch me up and use me. i never saw genuine love in his eyes only lust. he only wanted the pictures i sent the free deliveries id buy him. i cant help but feel angry at myself for letting this go on for so long for getting attached to this man i thought truly loved me. i just wish i wouldve been smarter. tldr a rough breakup with my ex almost cost me my life i just wish he loved me as much as i loved

1j4a10l,in an instant i saw two lives change forever in two completely different ways,i have been trying to process and work through what i saw yesterday but it has been really hard. the event itself was a lot but now im dealing with the whys which make me feel guilty since what happened has nothing to do with me. i was just a witness. i tried writing through it but it hasnt been enough so im trying again thinking that if i get it in front of others i can start to live past it. yesterday evening i was sitting on this big rock while i was waiting for the bus. a little ways down the road there was a taxi van. he was either backing out or adjusting his uturn but obviously reversing and not moving super fast. from where i was sitting i didnt see how fast the bike courier was going when he hit the front side of the van. and the biker immediately went under the front wheel of the van and i could hear him and his bicycle crunch under the tire. the position the biker was on the ground was how he stayed for the whole 20 minutes that he was out there. he never moved. so im almost positive he died during the collision or if there was some way he survived he could have been fully paralyzed. but there werent many people to see the accident head on like i did. a man in his jeep came out and a few security from the booth around my stop is near a campus came out to help. they checked for signs of life and directed traffic around him and had someone call 911. police came and did much of the same. the fire department came and started doing cpr but they didnt take off the mans helmet. the ambulance came and i didnt see any defibrillator or adrenaline unless they did those things in the back once they loaded him on the gurney and took the man away. but even after they put him in the ambulance it didnt leave or take off. there wasnt a rush. it felt like i was out there for two hours but it all happened in about 20 minutes. and its hard to think about the collision and how if the biker hasnt passed away im sure the injuries will last a lifetime. and i think about the taxi driver who just sat in the van with his head down and how he will most likely lose almost everything because of an accident. i dont know why i had to see it but i did and i dont know what to do with it if anything at all.,content warning violencedeath,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 18:28:08 UTC,8,2,1.0,0,in an instant i saw two lives change forever in two completely different ways content warning violencedeath i have been trying to process and work through what i saw yesterday but it has been really hard. the event itself was a lot but now im dealing with the whys which make me feel guilty since what happened has nothing to do with me. i was just a witness. i tried writing through it but it hasnt been enough so im trying again thinking that if i get it in front of others i can start to live past it. yesterday evening i was sitting on this big rock while i was waiting for the bus. a little ways down the road there was a taxi van. he was either backing out or adjusting his uturn but obviously reversing and not moving super fast. from where i was sitting i didnt see how fast the bike courier was going when he hit the front side of the van. and the biker immediately went under the front wheel of the van and i could hear him and his bicycle crunch under the tire. the position the biker was on the ground was how he stayed for the whole 20 minutes that he was out there. he never moved. so im almost positive he died during the collision or if there was some way he survived he could have been fully paralyzed. but there werent many people to see the accident head on like i did. a man in his jeep came out and a few security from the booth around my stop is near a campus came out to help. they checked for signs of life and directed traffic around him and had someone call 911. police came and did much of the same. the fire department came and started doing cpr but they didnt take off the mans helmet. the ambulance came and i didnt see any defibrillator or adrenaline unless they did those things in the back once they loaded him on the gurney and took the man away. but even after they put him in the ambulance it didnt leave or take off. there wasnt a rush. it felt like i was out there for two hours but it all happened in about 20 minutes. and its hard to think about the collision and how if the biker hasnt passed away im sure the injuries will last a lifetime. and i think about the taxi driver who just sat in the van with his head down and how he will most likely lose almost everything because of an accident. i dont know why i had to see it but i did and i dont know what to do with it if anything at all.,0,1
1j4d2y1,i went to a fancy beach resturant soaking wet alone for my birthday a couple weeks ago,yup you read the title. so my birthday was a little while ago it was my 20th and honestly i was pretty damn depressed for it. didnt have a lot of friends to celebrate with and was basically alone and it feltstill feels really weird not being a kid anymore. i decided to treat myself to a beach day both to go romp around and also cause i needed some driftwood for an aquarium i was setting up. i have no car though so had to take the bus to get up which had a very inconvenient schedule. so i got to the beach found some sticks and got so distracted that i unfortunately missed the bus pick up. now there was another bus coming in a couple hours and i could always call a ride too if needed. so i decided that now that i was here for at least a couple hours i might as well do some more exploring. this particular beach stretched for 3 miles north up to another beach where on the other side there was a small resturant. i was pretty hungry at this point so thought itd be fun to walk up there and catch bus later that evening at that spot instead. so i cruised up the beach and got some really great views of the clouds and sinking sun along the way. i eventually got to the cutoff to where the other beach started however while the map only portrayed a small stream separating them by now the ride had come in and that tiny stream was basically a river. after scouring the area for a bridge or easier way across i stupidly chose to wade through a shallower point which worked and i made it to the other side of the beach soggy but triumphant. i had no change of clothes in my pack. so after drying off a tiny bit i walked up to the resturant and when i got inside i realized this wasnt just some little beach shack it was a full on fancy ass resturant. my belly was roaring though so i decided to give it a try. i asked for outdoor seating for obvious reasons and was really surprised to see them

reasons.,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 20:30:14 UTC,1,0,1.0,0,i went to a fancy beach resturant soaking wet alone for my birthday a couple weeks ago yup you read the title. so my birthday was a little while ago it was my 20th and honestly i was pretty damn depressed for it. didnt have a lot of friends to celebrate with and was basically alone and it feltstill feels really weird not being a kid anymore. i decided to treat myself to a beach day both to go romp around and also cause i needed some driftwood for an aquarium i was setting up. i have no car though so had to take the bus to get up which had a very inconvenient schedule. so i got to the beach found some sticks and got so distracted that i unfortunately missed the bus pick up. now there was another bus coming in a couple hours and i could always call a ride too if needed. so i decided that now that i was here for at least a couple hours i might as well do some more exploring. this particular beach stretched for 3 miles north up to another beach where on the other side there was a small resturant. i was pretty hungry at this point so thought itd be fun to walk up there and catch bus later that evening at that spot instead. so i cruised up the beach and got some really great views of the clouds and sinking sun along the way. i eventually got to the cutoff to where the other beach started however while the map only portrayed a small stream separating them by now the ride had come in and that tiny stream was basically a river. after scouring the area for a bridge or easier way across i stupidly chose to wade through a shallower point which worked and i made it to the other side of the beach soggy but triumphant. i had no change of clothes in my pack. so after drying off a tiny bit i walked up to the resturant and when i got inside i realized this wasnt just some little beach shack it was a full on fancy ass resturant. my belly was roaring though so i decided to give it a try. i asked for outdoor seating for obvious reasons and was really surprised to see them setting the table with fancy cloths and a bunch of different forks and silverware and shit. i ordered crabcakes and some jumbo shrimp which were the cheapest things there but combined still cost a whopping 70. they eventually bring out two tiny barely palm sized pencilthin crab patties and 5 individual finger length shrimp both

1j8uzgr,my life is changing drastically and i regret it,throwaway account. 34m. sorry for the rambling that is about to happen. ampnbsp ive been in several longterm relationships since my mid 20s which all failed for a variety of reasons. typical reasons like career moves which meant relocating and the other person not wanting to move loss of feelings etc. the constants in my life though were my closest friends and family. i knew i could go visit my family after a breakup to help cheer me up. my best friends and i live in separate parts of the country so we stay connected through online gaming. when id be in a relationship the amount of gaming i did with them dropped off but never completely. and when those relationships ended i knew i had my buds waiting for me to get my mind off the broken relationship or whatever. ampnbsp as ive compiled failed relationships ive grown worried and nervous for my future. that id be alone forever never get married never have kids etc. but during those periods of single life i took my freedom for granted. i could do whatever i wanted whenever i wanted. i didnt appreciate it enough. i got too caught up in chasing family life. ampnbsp now im with someone and were engaged. they have kids from a previous marriage and theyre with us most of the time. we have one of our own on the way. we recently bought a new house that im not thrilled about. mostly because of how much we paid for what were getting. when we got engaged i was excited. when i found out i was going to have my own child i was excited. i love my partner very much and i love the children very much as well. ampnbsp but for some reason the last few months have been tremendously hard on me. im sure its all the changes happening and the feeling that i have no escape because i dont. i cant just break up and find my own place like i did in the past. i feel stuck despite my feelings for my family. i miss my single life and being able to do what i wanted and answering to no one. going to work coming home eating whatever i wanted and playing games or going for a beer or whatever. it was totally up to me. now im a slave in my own house. i go to work to pay the bills which is never ending. i cant use any of that money for my own hobbies or interests. no more deciding on a whim that i want to take a long weekend and travel somewhere. no more unwinding after a long day of work because being at home with kids is also work. by the time the kids are in bed my partner wants us time which to be honest sometimes i just want my own time. and sometimes i do

1j7cxzj,i was dumped yesterday but i had been thinking about the breakup for a year it hurts so much,i 25f was in a relationship 25m for almost 2 years. it started off very very well very dreamy and romantic where i told my friends that i had found the guy i had been looking for all this while etc etc. 2 months after our first date i lost my job and i realised how emotionally unavailable he was because all he cared about was his job and his work stress he didnt know how to empathise with me or support me or help me out for context the city we live and work in is his hometown but i thought probably my expectations are a bit much because we are so early in the relationship. but i have known since aug 2023 that this isnt right for me. i am going to bulletise the problems spending time despite living in the same city he only saw me once a week frisat which i initially found weird but adjusted around it. however because he is an insane workaholic we didnt do anything special just stayed in. there were no date nights. when we went out on date nights i planned all of them i initiated them and i convinced him. i wanted to spend more time with him see him more but that he told was not possible because it messes with his routines. a lot of his habits and ideas of how we should be were straight up selfish inconsiderate and disreputable tbh. a twisted definition of ambition different definitions of meaning of life he has a well paying reputable steady job but he wants to start his own thing so that he is doing something meaningful in life. what that means for us is insane working hours no downtime no quality time no matter how much i tried to adjust. when breaking up he said the kind of relationship i want works for people who have job stability and dont want to do much outside of that and i disagree so much. all i wanted was someone to spend my weekends with have that quality time. isnt that the bare minimum? also if he cant do this how will he ever be in a relationship? for me i am super ambitious and have built a career in a foreign country from the ground up but for me ambition means being good at job and liking it enough to login every morning to do a good job. meaning of life doesnt come from the job as i work for the paycheck but meaning comes from travel experiences relationships and friendships. his routine he was obsessed with his routines. wake up at 6 sleep at 10 gym at 7am work 89 kinda guy. which is ok routines are good but what that meant was he only saw me fridays and called me daily 93010 he didnt call me initially at all and we foughjt a lot to get here. anything outside of that was not possible. this didnt emotionally sit right with me because i couldnt trust depend rely on him. in fact when we were breaking up he told me he calculated ???? the amount of time he spends with me or talking to me and thats about 12hweek which is not possible for him right now. what this translated in my head was i am not worth the 12hweek his spending habits he lives at home with his parents earns a lot more than me and saves and invests all that he earns to an obsessive degree. he has enough to retire rn and i respect that. but what that meant for us was he was extremely stingy and calculative. we split stuff but he just wasnt happy spending on date nights dinners gifts. heck he even calculated the transport cost from his home to mine. he even liked to lecture me about how i should spend money when i already live below my means because i have a loan. he also said that he is saving enough for the both of us but that never gave me confidence because i saw that as an attack on my independence i cant live on the money he has earned or saved because it is not mine he will always reinforce that and i will have a lesser of a say in how we spend that money. he definitely wanted a prenup if we were to marry which i dont mind but his general attitude towards money and being too calculative wasnt reassuring basically these were longstanding problems which i identified very early on in the relationship and communicated why i find them problematic. however after each time i communicated he gave me something new to cling my hope on to and i hoped things would get better because i genuinely wanted this to work. they never got better we kept on arguing until yesterday when he asked the question and i agreed i felt a bit blindsided tbh because he never told me he is thinking about it too. i guess there are 2 lessons for me 1. to be in a relationship and live in the present and not with the persons potential and what it could be 2. to not be so obsessed with the idea of relationships and building a life and the feeling of home with someone that i keep putting up with shit having said all of this the feeling of loss is immense and i still miss him and have been bawling my eyes out when it was me who had been considering breaking up for the past year and i know in my heart he is not the one for me.,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 17:40:16 UTC,2,0,0.76,0,i was dumped yesterday but i had been thinking about the breakup for a year it hurts so much i 25f was in a relationship 25m for almost 2 years. it started off very very well very dreamy and romantic where i told my friends that i had found the guy i had been looking for all this while etc etc. 2 months after our first date i lost my job and i realised how emotionally unavailable he was because all he cared about was his job and his work stress he didnt know how to empathise with me or support me or help me out for context the city we live and work in is his hometown but i thought probably my expectations are a bit much because we are so early in the relationship. but i have known since aug 2023 that this isnt right for me. i am going to bulletise the problems spending time despite living in the same city he only saw me once a week frisat which i initially found weird but adjusted around it. however because he is an insane workaholic we didnt do anything special just stayed in. there were no date nights. when we went out on date nights i planned all of them i initiated them and i convinced him. i wanted to spend more time with him see him more but that he told was not possible because it messes with his routines. a lot of his habits and ideas of how we should be were straight up selfish inconsiderate and disreputable tbh. a twisted definition of ambition different definitions of meaning of life he has a well paying reputable steady job but he wants to start his own thing so that he is doing something meaningful in life. what that means for us is insane working hours no downtime no quality time no matter how much i tried to adjust. when breaking up he said the kind of relationship i want works for people who have job stability and dont want to do much outside of that and i disagree so much. all i wanted was someone to spend my weekends with have that quality time. isnt that the bare minimum?

1j8e4qk,i caused a suicide in high school.,this happened 10 years ago it was my fault i shouldnt have snapped. it still eats me up from the inside every single day. if i could go back and do things differently i would in a heartbeat. ten years ago when i was 16 years old this new kid started at school. i was really into minecraft back then and he was wearing a minecraft tshirt. i didnt have anyone to play with so i approached him and tried to start a conversation. he was really hesitant and shy at first but when i asked him about the shirt and complimented it he lit up. we got to know each other a bit and planned to play together. we played together for quite a few times and had fun but eventually i got bored of the game and went outside with my friends instead. my friends didnt like him so we never invited him and thats when he started to get a little clingy he would constantly keep asking to play and wouldnt take the hint if i said no. he had also asked our friend group if he could play outside with us quite a few times and i didnt mind him and would have welcomed him some people in the group didnt want him there so i went along with it. he started following me around a bit later and pestering me quite often. he would follow me around and talk about memes youtube videos and minecraft often talking about it nonstop for up to 10 minutes without even giving me a chance to speak.. this kept going on for quite a while and the whole time i was getting more and more irritated yet the more we spoke the more i was getting irritated. i was too scared to back out of the conversation politely which led to my irritation building up over time. then i had one bad day which took away a life. one day we were at the bus station and he approached me and started chatting. at one point all the anger built up over time inside me exploded and i snapped and i told him just shut up! i was never your friend we just played minecraft together a few times. you are extremely annoying and nobody likes you the next day the teacher sat us down and told us that he had committed suicide my entire world shattered. i instantly knew that what i said caused this and that i had caused him to commit suicide. i was invited to the funeral during which his parents spoke to me and revealed an extremely important detail about him. it turns out he was very autistic and had severe trouble making friends all his life and he was obsessed with mc. when he met me and we played he became really happy and wouldnt stop talking to his parents about how he finally made a good friend they knew me as his best friend. this shattered my world i didnt know he was autistic and considered me his only friend i didnt realise how important our sessions playing together were for him. but that doesnt justify what i did i should have never said that. i still cant play minecraft after a decade. today is the 10th anniversary of his death and i needed to post his because it should have been me not him. edit thank you all for the kind support. many have been suggesting therapy while i do think its a good idea i dont know if it will help. i cant change the past but i can be a better person than i was. and to those telling me this is ai this is just how i write think what you want but it doesnt matter to me. yesterday was the anniversary of his death and a lot of fucked up feelings resurfaced and i wrote this in an emotional state i didnt want to keep it bottled up and i really needed some sort of way to let it out.,content warning suicideself harm,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-11 00:31:03 UTC,8272,357,0.94,0,i caused a suicide in high school. content warning suicideself harm this happened 10 years ago it was my fault i shouldnt have snapped. it still eats me up from the inside every single day. if i could go back and do things differently i would in a heartbeat. ten years ago when i was 16 years old this new kid started at school. i was really into minecraft back then and he was wearing a minecraft tshirt. i didnt have anyone to play with so i approached him and tried to start a conversation. he was really hesitant and shy at first but when i asked him about the shirt and complimented it he lit up. we got to know each other a bit and planned to play together. we played together for quite a few times and had fun but eventually i got bored of the game and went outside with my friends instead. my friends didnt like him so we never invited him and thats when he started to get a little clingy he would constantly keep asking to play and wouldnt take the hint if i said no. he had also asked our friend group if he could play outside with us quite a few times and i didnt mind him and would have welcomed him some people in the group didnt want him there so i went along with it. he started following me around a bit later and pestering me quite often. he would follow me around and talk about memes youtube videos and minecraft often talking about it nonstop for up to 10 minutes without even giving me a chance to speak.. this kept going on for quite a while and the whole time i was getting more and more irritated yet the more we spoke the more i was getting irritated. i was too scared to back out of the conversation politely which led to my irritation building up over time. then i had one bad day which took away a life. one day we were at the bus station and he approached me and started chatting. at one point all the anger built up over time inside me exploded and i snapped and i told him just shut up!

1j4t53m,did my partner cheat 10 years ago and forget it wasnt me that was with him,my partner and i were in bed watching silly videos when a clip of a comedian popped up asking people about the weirdest place theyd had sex. without thinking i laughed and said oh for us it was definitely the beach! remember when we used to go there? for context it was a very isolated beach. but then he looked at me and said nooo the weirdest place was in the bathroom at asda. i froze. what? i stared at him confused. we never had sex in a bathroom at asda. he insisted we didback when he was living with his brother and i was staying with my aunt. he even painted the scene our son was asleep so we snuck off to the bathroom. only our son wasnt even born yet. i was pregnant at the time. and i am absolutely sure i would remember having sex in a supermarket bathroom. that kind of adrenaline rush would have stayed with me forever. yet he kept insisting it happened. and thats when it hit me. did he cheat on me and forget that the person he was with wasnt even me? this was 10 or 11 years ago but still i would not have forgotten this. and i know this because i remember every place ive ever had sex in public even from before i was with him. so this made absolutely no sense to me. so yeah there you have itthe truth off my chest. . . . . edit or update whatever you want to call it i didnt expect this post to get so much attention. this is my first time posting here. this is not ai or fake. english is not my first language but i am somewhat fluent. my grammar isnt the best so i asked ai to correct it i dont see a problem with that. and seeing how some people are roasting me in the comments for being with a cheater saying my child deserves better hoping hes not a doormat like his mom and that i deserve this i can only imagine what the comments would look like if my grammar was bad! as for those commenting about my child he doesnt know anything about this. hes never seen us argue all he sees is what we let him see. apart from the things i mentioned weve had a very loving relationship the cheating 5 years ago i forgave and i dont regret that we have been happy trust is still hard sometimes but at the moment in the present he has not given me reasons to think that he has cheated or though about it. i understand what people are saying that he might be abusive or mentally manipulating me but i dont really see it that way maybe when we argue but i dont think he does that on purpose or maybe im just blind . right now im thinking this might be something hes confusing with a dream or something like some people have said. thinking back i have mentally blocked out a lot from that time i had a very stressful and traumatic pregnancy and its not something i want to get into or talk about. i posted this just to get it off my chest. please dont offend me in the comments thats just mean and dont bring my son into it he has nothing to do with this!,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 11:10:46 UTC,5751,275,0.95,0,did my partner cheat 10 years ago and forget it wasnt me that was with him my partner and i were in bed watching silly videos when a clip of a comedian popped up asking people about the weirdest place theyd had sex. without thinking i laughed and said oh for us it was definitely the beach! remember when we used to go there?

1j8f2qr,brain injuries are realitywarping cockgobblers,2 months ago i did the lifealert limbo and fell down the stairs like a granny. terribly embarrassing but it was significantly worse when i realized i was going to puke. i had gone from vertical to horizontal in record time smacking my head with a couple hundred pounds of force about 5 times while i did some carpet sledding down the stairs. thankfully my wife knew right away i probably had a head injury but also knew that there wasnt shit that the er could do unless i had signs of a brain bleed i did not and she works in the ed and knows they would just give me tylenol and call it good. she monitored me closely and i woke up the next day in denial feeling...off. she didnt believe me that i said i was fine but i really insisted it and would not entertain the idea of going to see the doctor. looking back on it my reasoning was seriously impaired and i had suspicions that the doctors were evil somehow. it gets worse. i would describe it as almost being in a paranoid nightmare. i was determined that nothing had happened and i was overreacting because thats what my parents wouldve said. i dropped everyone off and went to work like normal getting madder and madder at various people for imaginarysmall slights mostly for no reason at all. i started to spiral into a delusion that people were plotting against me and i was stuck in fight or flight mode all day. it got worse on the second day when i was working from home and i caught myself writing an angry email. i had this horrifying moment of clarity. wait thats not my writing. thats not me. thats not something i would ever do. this deep sense of dread overtook my whole body and i knew i had to confess my fears to my wife. i remember when i went downstairs and she thought i was having a stroke. i babbled something about concussion and tell my boss i need a break for a bit and honestly...its a huge blank past that point for weeks after. what i heard from other people was that i went to the doctor and they confirmed i did manage to have quite a concussion bordering on moderate tbi because i had impaired speech memory eye focus coordination etc. because i had gone about those two stressful days just as hard as i normally do that did major damage that set me back for weeks at least. i lost memory from decemberhalf of february. its just gone. i only suffer the consequences of whatever deranged nonsense i was up to during that time. i was unable to read or write without help or profound effort for...a while. not sure how long. i was definitely totally unable to drive safely as i forgot how to judge distance speed and how hard to push the accelerator. i went to a specialized tbi clinic and they confirmed that theres not really anything you can do except rest and participate in physical therapy to learn how to use your body again. they said it was a functional injury rather than a structural injury so we dont have high enough resolution scans or some shit. i just wanted something. anything. nope just painkillers and lots of rest. rest was agonizing. being in the darkness with nothing but silence was actual torture. it made it worse but i craved some kind of stimulation to keep me out of my paranoid and angry thoughts. i spent way too much time working and on screens. so much more than i should have. it kept setting me back. it kept causing me pain but it was better than feeling alone isolated and psychotic. i had to relearn how to move my body because my body felt like a mech suit i was controlling remotely. my senses felt distant and unfamiliar. my eyes followed their orders as if they were suggestions not commands. my emotional regulation and impulse control reduced to that of my toddler. when he would scream i wanted to as well even though i used to be cool as a cucumber. when he would flip shit i had to go storm off not to overreact. i couldnt stop myself from inhaling half a box of oreos merely because they were there. theres so much more but my eye and brain stamina arent keeping up right now. i will say that i think im at 80 now. my speech is mostly normal and my coordination is almost back. i suddenly remembered how to drive a couple weeks ago. the main struggle is overall stamina and sensitivity to lightnoise. if i push too hard i will get a migraine or throw up. but until that pointim nearing normal again. i attribute a good chunk of my recovery to the fact i have been continuing lowdose ketamine therapy. i have a quarter to half of my typical dose and i suddenly get a big jump in progress a day or two after. makes a lot of sense because its whole thing is neurogenesis but wow this is an underresearched area. i got called a pioneer for merely having the balls to see

1j64g7u,coming to terms with the thought that my sister is not a good person after all,it has been almost 15 years since its slowly started to dawn on me that my sister never really loved me she just thought i was so much lamer than her that she didnt see me as a competiton. for the context she is 10 years older than me and for as long as i can remember i loved her more than anyone alive. i loved her more than our parents brothers friends etc. she was my absolute role model and everything she did was perfect. it is fucked up to compare kids ever but when parents and relatives are comparing two people who are so different and not even in the same age group that is especially fucked up. she was always labeled the beautiful one me as the smart one. she was the caring child i was the mean one. her life was hard mine was easy. everything that was happening to her was always celebrated if it was good or we were all devastated together with her if it was bad and it was never her fault when it was bad. everything i ever did was considered as luck or as normal if it was good and my fault if it was bad. she loved me back and always worked on building my self confidence but never to the extent of me succeeding in being better than her in any way. this was particularly obvious in her relationship with our parents where she told me multiple times that our father wanted mom to have the abortion when she was pregnant with me. any sign of me not liking that thought was being met with the comment along the lines of me being too sensitive or oh come on he loves you now. i reacted explosivelly about that only once when i told her openely to go fuck herself with those fucked up pieces of info which of course ended with her being in tears appologizing and making me promise that i will never remind her about that event. she made it about her and her feelings and i was told by the involved parties that i shouldnt have been so hard on her. these were occasional outbursts when i would always make a conclusion that i over reacted and i would end up crying begging her to forgive me and promising never to do it again. bear in mind we are talking about my teenage yeara here not adult me. ff to my 20s while she had one relationship with her then longtime bf who became almost like a family member i mostly fucked around and either didnt really meet reciprocated feelings in guys or i didnt even want anything serious. she eventually broke up with him it was a family tragedy ofc like anything bad that happens to her and she somehow put us both together to we are never getting married file. i mean she never said it but it was obvious that she is not supportive of my potential relationships. i kind of knew it but i became sure about it when i started to date my now husband when i was 25 and as i became more selfassured because i felt loved she started to become more and more openely toxic and she was doing it often. she would use every opportunity to let me know she thinks he is lazy and irresponsible while i didnt think any of that. she started to hate my hobbies style habits which didnt change much i just wasnt as miserable as before and she was suuuuper pissed when she broke with her second bf and i got engaged. she called me and raged about how it is inconsiderate that everyone is saying congrats on social media while they are aware of her recent break up. i felt bad because during the last year of her relationship she lost one pregnancy but i still didnt think that i should hid posts my boyfriend put on social media when he proposed. after that it all went downhill. she was good to me either when something super good would happen to her or when something really bad would happen to me. she hated my wedding day and pregnancy but she was full of understanding when i had ppd. she did nothing to help but she was good to me then. as soon as i got better she was hating me again. in the meantime all good that was going on in her life was still celebrated and all bad was mourned while my life was kind of unimportant to our mutual loved ones mostly. i started to fight back but i was rarely talking shit about her to our family while she wasnt really private about her opinion on me. every time when she would show her good side again i would come back to life because i would regain the hope that the most loved person from my childhood is still there. recently i lost all hope that i will ever want her back in my life. our father died and in his final months while i was crying my guts out and doing everything to help him as we all did she told me that i was selfish as always and not showing any empathy towards him. that was the straw that broke the camels back for me and i screamed at her and told her to get the fuck away from me forever. we did communicate after that because there were many things that had to be done with our dad and i was there for her to be her shoulder to cry on when she needed me but it was just because i felt i had to for the rest of our family. as our dad passed my feelings of disgust came back and i am back to feeling hurt by our last fight. she mentioned it briefly and said that it was just a dumb fight as she always does after moments like that but to me it wasnt. to me now none of the fights we had were dumb and they were all about one thing her wanting me to be the obedient loser sister that she had when i was from 0 to 20ish and her from 10 to 30ish. i cant stand the thought of her hanging out with my kid anymore. my kid loves her and i was so happy when my sister and i patched our fight from a few years ago and she had good relationship with her niece but honestly i have two fears 1. she would fuck her up the way she fucked me up 2. she would be telling my kid mean things to show me as a bad person for whatever reason. one thing i found out later after my ppd was gone is that she was planning to take the kid away from me because it seems like i am not fit to do it but she never considered talking to my husband about it. like he didnt have ppd he was fine why didnt she talk to him? why was she planning to adopt the kid who was not out for adoption? anyway... i am done with her but i think i will need a lot of time to process this. maybe therapy would be beneficial.,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:14:59 UTC,8,0,1.0,0,coming to terms with the thought that my sister is not a

competiton. for the context she is 10 years older than me and for as long as i can remember i loved her more than anyone alive. i loved her more than our parents brothers friends etc. she was my absolute role model and everything she did was perfect. it is fucked up to compare kids ever but when parents and relatives are comparing two people who are so different and not even in the same age group that is especially fucked up. she was always labeled the beautiful one me as the smart one. she was the caring child i was the mean one. her life was hard mine was easy. everything that was happening to her was always celebrated if it was good or we were all devastated together with her if it was bad and it was never her fault when it was bad. everything i ever did was considered as luck or as normal if it was good and my fault if it was bad. she loved me back and always worked on building my self confidence but never to the extent of me succeeding in being better than her in any way. this was particularly obvious in her relationship with our parents where she told me multiple times that our father wanted mom to have the abortion when she was pregnant with me. any sign of me not liking that thought was being met with the comment along the lines of me being too sensitive or oh come on he loves you now. i reacted explosivelly about that only once when i told her openely to go fuck herself with those fucked up pieces of info which of course ended with her being in tears appologizing and making me promise that i will never remind her about that event. she made it about her and her feelings and i was told by the involved parties that i shouldnt have been so hard on her. these were occasional outbursts when i would always make a conclusion that i over reacted and i would end up crying begging her to forgive me and promising never to do it again. bear in mind we are talking about my teenage yeara here not adult me. ff to my 20s while she had one relationship with her then longtime bf who became almost like a family member i mostly fucked around and either didnt really meet reciprocated feelings in guys or i didnt even want anything serious. she eventually broke up with him it was a family tragedy ofc like anything bad that happens to her and she somehow put us both together to we are never getting married file. i mean she never said it but it was obvious that she is not supportive of my potential relationships. i kind of knew it but i became sure about it when i started to date my now husband when i was 25 and as i became more selfassured because i felt loved she started to become more and more openely toxic and she was doing it often. she would use every opportunity to let me know she thinks he is lazy and irresponsible while i didnt think any of that. she started to hate my hobbies style habits which didnt change much i just wasnt as miserable as before and she was suuuuper pissed when she broke with her second bf and i got engaged. she called me and raged about how it is inconsiderate that everyone is saying congrats on social media while they are aware of her recent break up. i felt bad because during the last year of her relationship she lost one pregnancy but i still didnt think that i should hid posts my boyfriend put on social media when he proposed. after that it all went downhill. she was good to me either when something super good would happen to her or when something really bad would happen to me. she hated my wedding day and pregnancy but she was full of understanding when i had ppd. she did nothing to help but she was good to me then. as soon as i got better she was hating me again. in the meantime all good that was going on in her life was still celebrated and all bad was mourned while my life was kind of unimportant to our mutual loved ones mostly. i started to fight back but i was rarely talking shit about her to our family while she wasnt really private about her opinion on me. every time when she would show her good side again i would come back to life because i would regain the hope that the most loved person from my childhood is still there. recently i lost all hope that i will ever want her back in my life. our father died and in his final months while i was crying my guts out and doing everything to help him as we all did she told me that i was selfish as always and not showing any empathy towards him. that was the straw that broke the camels back for me and i screamed at her and told her to get the fuck away from me forever. we did communicate after that because there were many things that had to be done with our dad and i was there for her to be her shoulder to cry on when she needed me but it was just because i felt i had to for the rest of our family. as our dad passed my feelings of disgust came back and i am back to feeling hurt by our last fight. she mentioned it briefly and said that it was just a dumb fight as she always does after moments like that but to me it wasnt. to me now none of the fights we had were dumb and they were all about one thing her wanting me to be the obedient loser sister that she had when i was from 0 to 20ish and her from 10 to 30ish. i cant stand the thought of her hanging out with my kid anymore. my kid loves her and i was so happy when my sister and i patched our fight from a few years ago and she had good relationship with her niece but honestly i have two fears 1. she would fuck her up the way she fucked me up 2. she would be telling my kid mean things to show me as a bad person for whatever reason. one thing i found out later after my ppd was gone is that she was planning to take the kid away from me because it seems like i am not fit to do it but she never considered talking to my husband about it. like he didnt have ppd he was fine why didnt she talk to him? why was she planning to adopt the kid who was not out for adoption? anyway... i am done with her but i think i will need a lot of time to process this. maybe therapy would be beneficial.,0,1
1j7ce4s,grieving biking season,for the past 2 years ive been smoking weed almost daily. i recently went through a lot of changes and in that i quit smoking and started taking supervised urine tests. among other things i knew that taking these tests meant i couldnt take my drivers license for at least a few months and that was okay with me. what i didnt know is that it meant i couldnt drive at all until these tests were finished which is 6 months even tho i am clean. my doctor failed to tell me or i failed to remember that i cant use the license for my motorcycle that i already have. i recently met a guy who made my passion for driving motorcycles light up again. i was so ready to get back on the bike bring it out of the garage change out the oil and have it in pristine condition. i was so excited to spent a summer on two wheels while getting my life back on track and this time with someone to share the joy with. in some ways it was part of my motivation for staying clean and having it ripped away in the span of a few google searches made it that much harder. i feel so angry and stupid. i feel like i should have known and i feel like it was obvious. yet i thought in some magical way that i could keep my excisting licence just not take another drivers test. i was so ready for the freedom of driving to work and going on road trips. or just driving to the store without relying on commute or friends or having to walk for 15 minutes. i know it really isnt the end of the world but the next 5 months is gonna be that much more challenging knowing i could have been on a bike if i hadnt admitted to my doctor that i smoked weed. im gonna call the doctors office tomorrow to see if im correct in thinking i cant drive my motorcycle but im scared of getting my hopes up. id rather sit with knowing ill get told i cant drive than be let down again tomorrow. but on the other side of things i probably wouldnt have quit if it wasnt for having to do this at some point either way. it just sucks that ill be done with these tests in september at the very end of the season.,,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-09 17:15:58 UTC,1,0,1.0,0,grieving biking season for the past 2 years ive been smoking weed almost daily. i recently went through a lot of changes and in that i quit smoking and started taking supervised urine tests. among other things i knew that taking these tests meant i couldnt take my drivers license for at least a few months and that was okay with me. what i didnt know is that it meant i couldnt drive at all until these tests were finished which is 6 months even tho i am clean. my doctor failed to tell me or i failed to remember that i cant use the license for my motorcycle that i already have. i recently met a guy who made my passion for driving motorcycles light up again. i was so ready to get back on the bike bring it out of the garage change out the oil and have it in pristine condition. i was so excited to spent a summer on two wheels while getting my life back on track and this time with someone to share the joy with. in some ways it was part of my motivation for staying clean and having it ripped away in the span of a few google searches made it that much harder. i feel so angry and stupid. i feel like i should have known and i feel like it was obvious. yet i thought in some magical way that i could keep my excisting licence just not take another drivers test. i was so ready for the freedom of driving to work and going on road trips. or just driving to the store without relying on commute or friends or having to walk for 15 minutes. i know it really isnt the end of the world but the next 5 months is gonna be that much more challenging knowing i could have been on a bike if i hadnt admitted to my doctor that i smoked weed. im gonna call the doctors office tomorrow to see if im correct in thinking i cant drive my motorcycle but im scared of getting my hopes up. id rather sit with knowing ill get told i cant drive than be let down again tomorrow. but on the other side of things i probably wouldnt have quit if it wasnt for having to do this at some point either way. it just sucks that ill be done with these tests in september at the very end of the season.,0,0

1j880m4,true story for english project,a few years ago in 2019 i went over to a friends house to complete a project. while there i noticed she had some cats roaming around her yard and she mentioned that her family also had a few dogs. the dogs were medium sized and the cats were of normal weight and stature and i assumed that when the weather became extreme they would be brought inside for safety and comfort. i barely spared them a glance trusting that they were cared for. at the time i didnt think much of it. animals are a part of human life and in the lowincome neighborhood that my friend lived in it was common for pets to live in backyards or spend a lot of time outside. she clearly seemed to love her cats even though they were not inside the house and it would be rude for me to question how things were done in her family. in some florida neighborhoods it is common for dogs and cats to spend their days outside the continuously warm environment with the occasional rain is perfect weather for those who cant afford to have more occupants in already small houses. it was two years of being friends that led to our first sleepover. that was when i started noticing a few odd things in my friends household. for instance her family had recently found a kitten on the side of the road and had taken it in. at first i thought it was a heartwarming act of kindness. they allowed the kitten to sleep in their beds cuddle with them and receive affection. however as soon as the kitten grew older they just put it back outside to fend for itself. it struck me as odd but i dismissed it thinking perhaps they just didnt want a fullgrown cat inside. this happened with several cats and they just found a new kitten a few months ago. i didnt like it but it wasnt exactly illegal. the straw that broke the camels back was in 2023. it was an extremely hot summer the hottest itd been in years. i went over to her house per usual but this time with another friend. we decided that before wed come in wed say hello to her dogs. usually she would tell us that the dogs werent important and would always steer us away. but this time we wanted to play with them. the dogs were confined in an unbearably small cageabout the size of a wheelbarrow. the space was far too cramped for even one dog let alone three. they had no shelter from the relentless 100degree heat and there was no shade to offer them any respite. the food bowl was empty devoid of any evidence of kibble meat or any form of sustenance. the water they did have was dirty contaminated with feces and entirely undrinkable. feces were scattered all around the cage indicating that they had been living in these conditions for a long time. as soon as they saw us the dogs started panting and wagging their tails shaking with excitement at the sight of people. they were desperate for attention for care for relief from their miserable existence. it was heartbreaking. no animal should have to endure such neglect. these dogs werent just sufferingthey were being denied basic necessities space clean water food and protection from the elements. my friends reaction to our concern was even more shocking. when confronted about the state of the dogs she simply walked away without a word. there was no explanation no sign of guilt or concern. it was as if she didnt see anything wrong with what we had witnessed. i was horrified. i knew i could not ignore what i had seen. this was not just a matter of differing opinions on pet carethis was neglect. leaving animals in these conditions without food clean water or shelter is not only cruel but could be considered animal abuse under the law. this experience changed the way i felt about her from then on. i had reported it to animal control but they did nothing and her family ended up moving the dogs into the garage a humid stuffy garage without windows to open and let air in but bigger than a wheelbarrow so progress is progress. animal control did not take the dogs away as i expected but instead gave a warning. this is one of those stories with no real happy ending. some people dont deserve the love animals give so freely. and sometimes walking away from a friendship is the only right thing to do. we still keep in contact after all she was my best friend. but every time i see her face im reminded of those moments and it doesnt feel good.,content

1j8ioxb,theres a girl i know from highschool...,...and im insanely jealous of her. sometimes i think about her life and how she turned out versus what i went through. specifically im jealous of her love life and the fact that she seems to have that white picket fence life a lot of people dream about. i still think its a miracle that she and her highschool sweetheart stayed together all this time even through college and eventually got married and started a family. im sorry her middle school sweetheart. they were in 7th or 8th grade when they first started dating and everyone knew them as that couple. nowadays theyre still that couple to be honest. meanwhile i met my first boyfriend in my senior year. we eventually had to get into a long distance relationship because we went to different colleges. he broke up with me after a few months into our freshman year because he met a new girl at his school. i honestly dont think id be feeling this way right now if i eventually found my stride. but no i had a long string of bad and failed relationships after my first boyfriend. i even met a man in college who i wanted to marry and have kids with one day but that fell through too. because he cheated its so much more common for middle schoolers to literally break up within a few months at most. and if you make it through middle school you break up at some point in high school. if you somehow manage to stay together through high school you usually break up in college. and those two also had to go long distance during their college years but no she was lucky enough to find that 1 in a billion man who apparently really does care about her. im not saying that she doesnt deserve to be happy im just saying that i wish i had it as good as she does. even a fraction as good as she does honestly. im jealous that she seems to just have a constant stream of lucky streaks where i feel like im constantly failing. even careerwise. im jealous that she had one idea for a career path and stuck all the way through it. now shes working as a lawyer. i cant tell you how disorganized my education journey has been. i changed my major several times and even took a year off to just focus on my mental health. i ended up getting my bachelors at 24 almost 25 actually. right now im even going back to school to be a nurse. meanwhile she got married right after graduating college and had her first child a year later. she and her husband bought a house together at some point and i cant help but just think of myself as a loser for having such rotten luck compared to her. just recently my fiance broke things off with me because we found out i cant have kids and now im living in some cramped apartment with 2 roommates. i keep feeling like every time i take one step forward something happens that pushes me 2 or even 3 steps back. i feel sad and hate how perfect some other peoples lives can be. i guess their existence just makes me feel like that kind of luck is possible to achieve
