1j61gx2,I need advice,To start off Im 27f with a 22m boyfriend Weve been together for almost 3 years and we met due to working together I still cringe at our 5 year age gap I have a friend that is 30f and I dont know if I am a complete ahole for wanting to cut ties with her or maybe I already accidentally did The last time I saw her I ended up staying for a weekend which was fun at first and we tried to drink but we both fell asleep too fast which her boyfriend got mad about I did not like this boyfriend 36m due to him constantly sleeping with his ex and being so obvious about it but shed be in this denial or whatever and cry to me constantly about it He was also somewhat a neglectful parent to his daughter from what my friend would tell me So anyways the next day came and I agreed to stay an extra day to watch her two daughters and figured Id be getting paid because we discussed it prior Well I didnt and during this I ended up getting bed bug bites on my neck hands and ankle area Pretty much where my skin was exposed Since leaving there I still feel like I have bugs on my skin and Im honestly afraid to ever go back I dont know why I pick and choose when to be confrontational because I just let left and didnt say anything I dont know whether to say anything at all Weve talked about bedbugs before and shes said shes gotten rid of them so I dont know what to say Fast forward a few days and she tells me her and her boyfriend 36m broke up and shes back together with an ex 32m This ex 32m was sleeping with a 17 year old girl and my friend 30f let both of them move into her home with her two children before they both just dipped and apparently had left the place trashed and thats when the bedbugs originally came about around this time too Oh and that man32m knew her children for a few months and was having them call him daddy I felt so uncomfortable witnessing all of this and then seeing what she allows herself and her children to be put through willingly For months I was telling her xyz was not right and shed be defending herself and him 36m until they broke up At that point is when she is like oh I could never be with someone who does xyz and completely shitting on this man talking about everything she defended and excused when she put up with it for months and would have continued to put up with it if he 36m didnt have his baby momma over again to stay the night after she had been begging him to stop for months doing that for months So Im just over it Im like why are you actively choosing to put yourself through these things I dont like to sugar coat things because why the hell should I act like neglecting a child is okay just to be a girls girl Their relationship wasnt abusive or anything like that a lot of accusations of cheating coming from both amp issues starting a few days after they began dating which is never a good sign but neither were afraid of each other it wasnt like that and she will put up with almost anything to keep a guy around and thats my issue I used to think she was a good mom but I dont think shes that great anymore I used to praise her when she would say she wouldnt let strangers around her kids and doesnt let anyone else watch her kids until I realized shes letting men she just met meet her kids inside her home and be around them unsupervised I used to think she was a good mom until I realized she raises her daughters through sugar and electronics and doesnt really watch even though around her children All of these realizations have come to me now after she broke up with her long term boyfriend of 2 years34m and have gone through 45 relationships in a year and I dont think shes the person I thought she was and I feel awful but I dont want to be around someone like that So she has her new boyfriend ex boyfriend 32m currently living with her again and I sent her a message a couple days ago saying I think that hes a pedophile and I dont want to be around him to which shes never responded but has sent other things I know that once her and her current boyfriend 32m break up or start having issues she will be wanting my pity party but I cant do it anymore I feel like I have no empathy for her anymore If we had more to talk about than her and her relationships I feel like it wouldnt be such an issue but she has no subsidence to her at all if it is not about a man Any advice on what you would do in my situation Its not my life so I dont know why Im so bothered,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 21:57:32 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j674ys,The past few weeks have shown me that life will continue without me,Specifically that my animals will be OK One dog will go to my parents One will go to my friends who are obsessed with her breed and if they find her another home awesome My bird will either go to the local zoo or the house down the street My cat can literally go anywhere I am not needed I promised my therapist I would reach out if I was planning anything I lied The gun in the house is gone but I still have the ability to purchase one amy day Id like Work doesnt need me We all know we are expendable at our jobs but its been hard for me to accept But theres no other way to reconcile the fact that Ive been at my job longer than two employees who have become managers and yet Im nothing Im useless Im dispensable Im nothing Im about done,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 02:32:47 UTC,0,1,0.5,,,0,0
1j66syz,Honestly this is how I am learning to cope with being singlelonely for a long time,I hate to say that I am that guy who has been single for a really long time despite my best efforts but I am I 27M havent even been lucky enough to go on a date in like 5 or 6 years but I have not given up hope even though things do look a bit bleak for me at the moment I am a really busy graduate student I try to fit in workouts and other activities too but it is pretty hard I do not have a lot of extra energy left to put in substantial effort to find the right person for me on most weeks So the thing I kinda wanted to get off my chest is I have been working on conceptswriting for a fantasy novel for a while when I get some time alone With my life being romantically unfulfilled I have fit in a relationship between two characters the MC and another to fulfill all the things that I have dreamed about It was not really part of my original ideas for the story but it kinda just happened Its pretty much all wholesome relationship stuff that I have never really got to have the hand holding the closeness sharing feelings tender moments having each others back etc As lame as it sounds it has been decently fulfilling for me There are still days that I really could use a hug even from a friend but there is something about getting all the stuff I have always wanted on paper that has been pretty nice and comforting Even though adding this stuff in has been satisfying for me I am a little afraid it makes the writing worse lol and when its all finished it makes me that much more afraid to show it to anyone Some of my friends know I have been working on this but have no idea theres romance involved in it I just really wanted to get off my chest I have been vicariously living out my romantic dreams through my fictional characters because I do not really have a better outlet I think its been a healthy way to express what I am missing out on,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 02:14:59 UTC,4,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j66ms7,My friend has a new boyfriend and I hate it,I know it probably sounds like Im in love with this friend but Im not Im married and happy But this boyfriend is an ex friend and ex boyfriend of mine and I was really close to them They were my first friend in my new highschool where I didnt know anyone One day a couple years ago they texted me saying all this mean stuff and telling me that we werent friends anymore They also didnt tell me what I did It hurt so bad for years and Im just now getting over it and I was doing good until I saw my friend posting about their new boyfriend and seeing my exs face just hit me Even after we had broken up we were great friends and hung out almost every day until that text A really big part of me wants to stop being friends with the current friend or at least keep my distance until I feel like Im ready I dont know what Im going to do Honestly I might just block them after sending an explanation Im a bad person after all so they probably shouldnt be friends with me Someone please help,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 02:05:57 UTC,0,2,0.33,,,0,0
1j65zll,Update I 23m still love my ex 24f and I dont know if she feels the same,So we made the plans and I asked if it was a date or not to my surprise she said it was which is just awesome to me We met on the train heading to the neatest city to us I had zero idea where I was being taken but it was a small caf√© not too far from a park and museum We sat in there for around an hour before walking around the park and just talking the weather did start to turn a little dreary so we went to the museum and listened to an organ for a bit before just walking around to see what had changed since wed last been there they removed all the old armourswords and replaced them with old chairs Towards the end we walked back through the city and got on the train I got off two stops later than I should have just so I could walk her to her car and then we headed our separate ways All in it was a pretty fun day and were thinking of going out for dinner next time,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 01:32:06 UTC,4,3,0.7,,,0,0

1j65iqy,I got terminated from my volunteer position with no explanation,So I 18f just finished volunteering for the day at my workplace animal sanctuary yesterday when I got a message from my boss to see he sent me a termination letter nothing in the message either just the letter itself and they have ignored me since Also sorry this is a long one I just have a lot of things in my head I need to sort out So a bit of backstory since I was around 14 Ive been dealing with the struggles of depression anxiety and adhd and ended up leaving school in yr10 because of it Took a while to figure out but I ended up going to tafe to complete my cert ii and iii to become a qualified zookeeper as Ive always loved animals and cant see myself doing anything else Because of tafe I had to start volunteering to complete the practical component of my course and ended finding this amazing sanctuary to work at So I ended up starting there in early February 2024 and fell in love with the place and the people I was originally going once a week but started going twice a week in around November bc I loved it so much and wanted to be there more They always told me they loved how I would be there consistently every week and I would pride myself on it as it was a big commitment for me as I lived an hour away The environment there was great honestly I couldnt have asked for it to be any better The owners always quite involved and prided themselves on this and wanted us to feel more like family rather than a workplace Because of this I became quite close with the people who were on my days and considered them my second family The owners also lived on site and their kids were always around because of this I became quite close with them as well even buying them small presents for their birthdays and helping them with their homework I suppose Im telling you this so you understand how close I was with them their family and the other volunteers so you can understand how hurt I am by the way theyve handled this situation Even on my bad days they were half the reason Id get up in the morning even when I didnt want to drive or talk to people Id still show up bc I didnt want to let them down as again I seen them as my second family and greatly valued their opinion So fast forward back to yesterday it was completely normal Nothing out of the ordinary we were still talking like normal doing all our tasks as normal having lunch together like normal I even got a last minute tour and stayed back to finish it up which brought in a fair bit of money for them Also just a note its a nonprofit all the money from tours goes right back into the sanctuary to care for the animals food and water vet bills etc So just my little routine afterwards I stop on the way home to go to the bathroom get food etc So I was checking my phone like normal and seen he sent me an attachment funny thing is I thought he was sending me a dumb reel or something Boy did I have a rude awakening when I read termination letter So naturally I read through it and start crying because again that day was normal there was not even a hint that something like this was coming Luckily I had one of my friends with me so I didnt do something dumb like driving with so many tears in my eyes I could barely see and probably getting into an accident In the letter he basically highlighted the fact that he wants to maintain a positive workplace and while he values my input he needs to put the sanctuary first blah blah blah the typical things in a letter that would put the blame on me so he doesnt seem like the bad guy So one important thing to mention they say this to everyone but from the start they said that theyre the kind of workplace to make sure everyones included and dont like people to form cliques However I became really close to two people in particular specifically because theyre great friends and have done so much for me Now while I was really close with these two I feel we included everyone when we could Especially since some days at the sanctuary wed be so busy wed barely see each other that day So wed always go out for lunch however wed always ask everyone if they wanted anything and never ate out always came back to be a part of the whole team Wed all have a break at the same time Now obviously being friends wed hang out after work but again wed ask some people if theyd wanna come if we werent going too far away And we would call and stuff but I feel its normal for friends to do that So one thing I could see where they wouldnt have been to happy with this is that we were doing an animal course about 5 hours away You have to finish the online part first before you go do the practical bit So one of my friends told the boss that we were going to be doing it he already done it prior and was just driving us and unlike the last time it was done they didnt put it on the group chat or anything for people to say theyre interested I think they assumed wed tell people that we were doing it and ask if theyd want to come Mind you this was about a month in advance so plenty of time for people to do the online section I will say this course ends up being quite expensive so some people werent able to do it due to financial reasons anyway Anyways long story short one other person from the sanctuary ended up doing the course btw the course only has 4 spots for the Prac part We had a great time and included him in nearly everything we did he traveled separately to us so was only left out of stuff we did on the way We even had a game night and everything and really the only people who were left out were the people who couldnt come but wanted to which I dont blame them for I can only assume that this is the reason they fired us my friend that drove was quitting next week was going to be his last however they messaged him yesterday basically telling him to not come back and my other friend also got a letter similar to mine Again I was completely blindsided by this as yesterday and even the last few weeks were completely normal No they didnt even try to chat with us saying something like hey this is what we can see is happening and we dont like it can you just try to include the other people more Something like that and I wouldnt have been as devastated The only other thing it might be is that I would make some pretty crude jokes although I wasnt the only one that would say them and me and my boss would say them to each other and everything were Aussie btw its part of our culture I suppose if we dont know you or dont like you well be quite civilpolite to you but if we do like you then youll probably cop it although I dont think this was the problem bc again it wasnt just me making these jokes I guess what hurts the most is that I really respected my boss and viewed both of them quite highly Like theyre great people at least I use to think so theyre great parents really community oriented and from what Ive heard quite highly regarded in our field So basically for him to not even have the decency to even send me a message along with the letter it is what hurt the most So naturally I sent them both a message asking them to give me a call bc for my own peace of mind I really need an explanation Both of them I assume accidentally opened the message and I can see they read it however they both ignored it So I sent them an email this morning however still waiting on a reply Ive never been through a breakup but I imagine itd be like this except instead of breaking up with one person Ive just lost my second family With no warning no explanation Anyways thanks for listening to me ramble sorry it was so long Im just kind of at a loss for now Hopefully Ill stop crying and get out of bed soon Thank youse heart_hands TLDR I was volunteering at an animal sanctuary when I got a termination letter from my boss with no warning no explanation I feel like Ive lost my second family,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08

1j657gu,Am I being used,Am I being used Do I 26F need a reality check Ive been friends with my friend Blake 26M for over a year now We have been pretty close since the beginning When we first met we bonded over our shared love for playing soccer together and music I would say we have many similarities We both enjoy adult animation like Studio Ghibli raves and playing board games Since we shared many similarities we kept in touch daily through text messages phone calls and FaceTime We had a mutual friend named Jennifer Jennifer and I were very close until I noticed that whenever we spent time together she spoke negatively about everyone around her As a result I gradually distanced myself from her Around the same time Jennifer and Blake started dating Although I wasnt close to Jennifer and didnt personally like her I wanted Blake to be happy Blake and I maintained a consistent relationship and communication We talked every day even during our lunch breaks via FaceTime However things took a turn when Jennifer informed Blake that I had feelings for him and wanted to pursue a romantic relationship with him That was not the case and I was even in a relationship at the time As a result Blake ended our communication to preserve his relationship with Jennifer We did not talk for eight months However in January he reached out to me He told me that Jennifer suddenly broke up with him in December Since then weve been hanging out again In February we attended a rave and ended up having sex that night A week later we confessed to each other that we had both harbored feelings for one another since weve first met At this point I informed him that I didnt want to be a rebound and he responded by stating that he wasnt ready for a relationship and wanted to focus on healing I accepted his decision We continued spending time together and continued having sex However I later told him that I no longer wanted to have sex with him because I was struggling to separate our friendship and romantic feelings Around the same time his exgirlfriend Jennifer filed a protective order against Blake Sidebar Personally I have had past experiences with abusive men which may have influenced my perspective However I must admit that I am not entirely aware of the details of Jennifer and Blakes relationship Given Jennifers personality I cant help but wonder if this situation is a attentionseeking ploy On the other hand I have only heard Blakes side of the story However I suggested that we establish boundaries We agreed to refrain from having sex and I told him I need a break from constant communication I also told him to fine another trusted friend to confide in about the Jennifer situation because I havent healed from my own trauma from the abusive I had endured Blake expressed his agreement to the physical boundaries and expressed he didnt want to lose me again and our friendship Since implementing these boundaries our relationship has undergone a significant change We dont talk that much anymore and when we do the protective order case seems to be the main topic of discussion Although last night I visited Blakes place to watch Star Wars During the movie he asked me to engage in a platonic cuddle We did and he said Thank you I inquired about the reason behind his gratitude He mentioned that my presence was naturing and made him feel less lonely Am I only in his life because he feels lonely,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 00:52:22 UTC,2,4,1.0,,,0,0

1j64g7u,Coming to terms with the thought that my sister is not a good person after all,It has been almost 15 years since its slowly started to dawn on me that my sister never really loved me she just thought I was so much lamer than her that she didnt see me as a competiton For the context she is 10 years older than me and for as long as I can remember I loved her more than anyone alive I loved her more than our parents brothers friends etc She was my absolute role model and everything she did was perfect It is fucked up to compare kids ever but when parents and relatives are comparing two people who are so different and not even in the same age group that is especially fucked up She was always labeled the beautiful one me as the smart one She was the caring child I was the mean one Her life was hard mine was easy Everything that was happening to her was always celebrated if it was good or we were all devastated together with her if it was bad and it was never her fault when it was bad Everything I ever did was considered as luck or as normal if it was good and my fault if it was bad She loved me back and always worked on building my self confidence but never to the extent of me succeeding in being better than her in any way This was particularly obvious in her relationship with our parents where she told me multiple times that our father wanted mom to have the abortion when she was pregnant with me Any sign of me not liking that thought was being met with the comment along the lines of me being too sensitive or oh come on he loves you now I reacted explosivelly about that only once when I told her openely to go fuck herself with those fucked up pieces of info which of course ended with her being in tears appologizing and making me promise THAT I WILL NEVER REMIND HER ABOUT THAT EVENT She made it about her and her feelings and I was told by the involved parties that I shouldnt have been so hard on her These were occasional outbursts when I would always make a conclusion that I over reacted and I would end up crying begging her to forgive me and promising never to do it again Bear in mind we are talking about my teenage yeara here not adult me FF to my 20s while she had one relationship with her then longtime bf who became almost like a family member I mostly fucked around and either didnt really meet reciprocated feelings in guys or I didnt even want anything serious She eventually broke up with him it was a family tragedy ofc like anything bad that happens to her and she somehow put us both together to we are never getting married file I mean she never said it but it was obvious that she is not supportive of my potential relationships I kind of knew it but I became sure about it when I started to date my now husband when I was 25 and as I became more selfassured because I felt loved she started to become more and more openely toxic and she was doing it often She would use every opportunity to let me know she thinks he is lazy and irresponsible while I didnt think any of that She started to hate my hobbies style habits which didnt change much I just wasnt as miserable as before and she was suuuuper pissed when she broke with her second bf and I got engaged She called me and raged about how it is inconsiderate that everyone is saying congrats on social media while they are aware of her recent break up I felt bad because during the last year of her relationship she lost one pregnancy but I still didnt think that I should hid posts my boyfriend put on social media when he proposed After that it all went downhill She was good to me either when something super good would happen to her or when something really bad would happen to me She hated my wedding day and pregnancy but she was full of understanding when I had PPD She did nothing to help but she was good to me then As soon as I got better she was hating me again In the meantime all good that was going on in her life was still celebrated and all bad was mourned while my life was kind of unimportant to our mutual loved ones mostly I started to fight back but I was rarely talking shit about her to our family while she wasnt really private about her opinion on me Every time when she would show her good side again I would come back to life because I would regain the hope that the most loved person from my childhood is still there Recently I lost all hope that I will ever want her back in my life Our father died and in his final months while I was crying my guts out and doing EVERYTHING to help him as we all did she told me that I was selfish as always and not showing any empathy towards him That was the straw that broke the camels back for me and I screamed at her and told her to get the fuck away from me forever We did communicate after that because there were many things that had to be done with our dad and I was there for her to be her shoulder to cry on when she needed me but it was just because I felt I had to for the rest of our family As our dad passed my feelings of disgust came back and I am back to feeling hurt by our last fight She mentioned it briefly and said that it was just a dumb fight as she always does after moments like that but to me it wasnt To me now none of the fights we had were dumb and they were all about one thing her wanting me to be the obedient loser sister that she had when I was from 0 to 20ish and her from 10 to 30ish I cant stand the thought of her hanging out with my kid anymore My kid loves her and I was so happy when my sister and I patched our fight from a few years ago and she had good relationship with her niece but honestly I have two fears 1 She would fuck her up the way she fucked me up 2 She would be telling my kid mean things to show me as a bad person for whatever reason One thing I found out later after my PPD was gone is that she was planning to take the kid away from me because it seems like I am not fit to do it but she never considered talking to my husband about it Like he didnt have PPD he was fine why didnt she talk to him Why was she planning to adopt the kid who was not out for adoption Anyway I am done with her but I think I will need a lot

1j63zlg,Too rich to qualify for assistance Too poor to pay the medical debt I need assistance for,Sometimes I wish I could literally die in an accident so that the calls from collections and bills piling up on my mailbox stopped Sure I make 80K but it means jack shit when I live in a somewhat expensive city and a huge chunk of my income goes towards these bills Recently I started to have health problems which are making me attend therapies to manage said problems twice a week Im spending an average of 600700 a month I ended up in the emergency department last month too which means I have to pay 4000 to them Everywhere I go for assistance turns me away because I dont make less than 60K yet these braindead morons working there dont understand the concept of my income going towards these bills leaving me with less money to even feed myself Im down to 1 meal a day and honestly I can manage it because I have an eating disorder but I just feel bad for others that genuinely cant do it,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:52:38 UTC,3,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j63j0w,UPDATE My gf beat the shit out of someone who broke into her house,I dont know if anyone remembers me but a while ago my girlfriend and I had a home invasion incident that culminated in her beating the shit out of the intruder Im tired of saying my gf so Im going to call her Diana Turns out the guy was a drug addict from the next town over He was in his 60s and he had an extensive history in jail and mental hospitals Unfortunately about two months after my post he passed away We didnt know anything about why until we got a chance to talk to his sister who insisted she didnt blame Diana and that the doctors even said that he probably didnt have much longer anyway Diana was visibly distressed during this conversation so Im not sure whether or not the sister just said that to comfort her After that Diana went on a trip to a national park during a week she knew I couldnt take off and forgot her meds She has seizures that look like mild psychosismagical thinking and ended up refusing to come home at the end of the trip She kept saying that she felt like she couldnt leave the woods because she was certain there was something she needed to learn there that she hadnt yet and when I asked her how long that might take she said some people take a lifetime I asked if she was breaking up with me and she said something about feeling like she was too attached to me her house her pets etc and that she needed to meditate on that for a while I ended up going to her temple to see if anyone was willing to give me some perspective on the situation since she was seeing things through a Buddhist lens It was the right choice A monk actually drove the six hours out to her with me to talk to her in person since she wasnt picking up calls I am so so unbelievably grateful for that monk because Diana started taking her meds again and came home soon after Ive never been religious but I started to read the Pali canon afterwards and that shit slaps Diana was already volunteering her time at the temple so now we both go together when we can All things considered since then things are back to normal and going well Were both children of divorce so even before all this we were doing prophylactic couples counseling every few months and for a while after we were going once a week Diana has started seeing a therapist on her own as well which I am so proud of her for since shes always hated the idea of individual therapy We also stepped up our home security game Diana already had plenty of cameras but now we have doorwindow alarms and motion sensors I also convinced Diana to get another dog so now we have a 75lb puppy I know a lot of people were rooting for us to get married but thats not going to happen Legal marriage isnt something that interests us and it never has But we did buy each other rings and its been a great comfort to have something physical to remind me of her on my person all the time Were also considering having a small commitment ceremony next fall lt3 Thanks again for all the feedback on my previous post I got a lot of great advice and some good criticism I showed it to Diana and she got a kick out of the comments and we had a little mutual cry over how kind a lot of you guys were I asked her if she was okay with me posting this update and she clucked at me and told me to do whatever I want online as long as Im being nice and anonymous lol So hope this qualifies,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:30:31 UTC,2525,62,0.97,,,0,0
1j63eh6,I feel stuck in this life of disappointment,damn i will definitely be embarassed about this in the future but anyways ive always been a sensitive person i always cared about others and made sure to make them feel good and happy My middle school years werent the best i had to move out of my old house and i completely changed life by moving to a town 50 minutes far from my previous residence You can imagine that I an introverted and nerdy kid wasnt able to make many friends and so i got lonely In fact i was known as the lonely kid no one ever wanted to talk to me and sometimes even made fun of me i discovered some years later that everyone talked behind my back during those years and that was the reason no one even wanted to approach me And so i spent three years of my life by myself i spent my days alone definitely years that i wouldnt want to live again Once middle school ended i was full of hope that same summer i made some friends and had a lot of fun with them and so i was positive about starting high school And so once my first year of school started i tried to me more extroverted and social the outcome was awkard im not good at being extroverted Even tho i tried the outcome wasnt positive This time no one talked behind my back but i had trouble making friends and so i became the lonely kid once again I was depressed spent my days listening to music and sleeping all day just to escape that feeling of void that was suffocating swallowing me whole I was ready to end it all but i wasnt brave enough to even try so i kept living my life and eventually things got better I made new friends i became more social and felt truly happy after years of suffering I am happy about how i lived the rest of my teenage years but that feeling never got away I am now left with an overthinking mindset idk if i can call it like that which leads me to anxiety about all the friendships that i currently live i cant be calm because i sometimes think that everyone will sooner or later go against me and make me live the hell i went through one more time I cant trust anyone and this thing is making me mad because come on why am i so defensive why cant i just live my life like the others and not worry about this i dont truly know why i wrote this probably to feel better or to relate to someone here who perhaps lived my same experience Anyways i feel costantly feel this overwhelming sense of entrapment in my own life i feel like my past will always follow me no matter what i do No matter how many new people i will meet i will always have this anxiety that they will disappoint me and life is so hard this way I dont even know if someone will read this i will probably only get some upvotes and my post will be forgotten in this sub,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:24:33 UTC,2,1,0.63,,,0,0

1j638ou,My dads in the icu my boyfriends planning a trip,This happened in mid January For context I am 32F and my boyfriend is 34m weve been together for 3 years and we live together in a house that I own Now for the story my dad has been unwell for over a month and my siblings and I mom died from cancer when I was young have been taking care of him while we waited for test results and some answers Last week his condition took a turn for the worst and he ended up being taken to the hospital by ambulance and has been in the icu for a week He was diagnosed with cancer We still dont have all the answers and I dont know what the future holds for my family On the third day that my dad was in the icu my boyfriend was at work and texted me about his plans for the following day that consisted of him meeting up with friends to plan their trip I knew they had been talking loosely talking about potentially going on a trip at the end of the month but I thought it was common sense that since my dad is in the hospital the trip would be off Well apparently not Needless to say we had an argument I told him its extremely hurtful that he would abandon me at a time like this After a lot of back and forth throughout the day he let me know the trip was cancelled nothing had been paid for or even booked yet but at this point I just feel like the damage is done Who would prioritize a boys trip when their partners only parent is extremely sick in the hospital The obvious answer is to break up but I dont know if I have it in me to go through a breakup right now Its been a few days now my dad is doing much better hes out of the icu and Ive been there everyday helping him with his recovery so he can come home Ive been off work for the past week and a half during all this and went back yesterday and have been going to the hospital between shifts My boyfriend has been moping around the house the last few days and every time I ask him whats wrong he says nothing or I dont know Im just sad I said if this is about the trip then just go He says thats not what its about I suggested he goes to talk to someone a therapist or a friend or me He declined all of this I asked what I can do to help he said nothing and Im not his therapist I said nothing and just collected my stuff and went to work I have a lot on my plate already and Im feeling angry that hes putting this on me now as well We spent the next few days avoiding eachother around the house which was making my mental health seriously depleted We finally had a conversation I told him he should go on the trip because theres no sense of him staying here if hes not even going to acknowledge me or be supportive to me and my family anyways The next day he booked his flight I tried to convince myself I was okay with it but his 5 day trip suddenly turned into 10 days and I just knew I was done We had a few conversations while he was away mostly me crying and telling him how angry I am with him He came home and I ended it as soon as he walked in the door He begged and pleaded said he never would have left if he knew I would end it because of the trip There was a lot of back and forth and I asked him if he could just leave for a few days to give me some space which he did He ended up taking me on a date for Valentines Day later that week and things seemed to be getting a little bit better We planned a night away the following week to try to connect again During our romantic night away he decided it was a good idea to invite his friend and friends girlfriend to join us for dinner the girlfriend ended up not coming so it was just me my bf and his friend and then surprisingly a bunch of his other work friends just happened to be at the same restaurant What was supposed to be a romantic evening to try to repair our relationship ended up being a table of 8 of us talking about my boyfriends job We went back to the hotel got into an argument and went to bed angry The next day we woke up and he got in the shower and left his Apple Watch on the night stand I had that gut instinct to check his messages and there it was He was been messaging with another girl the entire time my dad was in the hospital and was meeting up with her for coffee dates Which I highly doubt is all that happened So ya thats it He moved his stuff out last week and the person I thought I knew for the last almost 4 years has become the person whose hurt me more than anyone ever has in my life Im on my own again going to be 33 next month and starting from scratch I dont know what the future holds but it has to be better than this right,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:17:01 UTC,7,1,0.71,,,0,0
1j62wut,nex fianc√© ruined my life blamed me for it and then admitted he was never capable of it,just saw a post about their narc maybe being DL and im realizing mine definitely was and after everything he did and blaming me for it he said thats why he did it and couldnt have let us every happen or get married bc of his hidden desires exact quote at the bottom in the beginning he said he had a deep fetish he said it was humiliation at first then the real truth was later revealed to me and then it wasnt until after the break up he said there was sissy and cross dressing and that he might be gay which is so bizarre bc one he only ever told me about the real kink way later and never told me the full details of it and he loves women sexually and is very sexual and addicted to porn but he was interested in trans women and anal sex i guess its wild bc he always said he could never be in a relationship with a man bc he needed a woman who was submissive and he had control over basically he wanted a woman in her feminine energy but wasnt safe enough to let me stay there after our break up also he went on a power kick after i was trying to say goodbye like i guess trying to regain power and he was being agressive and telling me to submit and basically confirm that he was right and i was wrong and legit got hard from it the next day i said i will only submit to a man who protects and takes care of me and does not abuse me and he said he would still abuse me and i should stop whinning about it there were times he wanted to have sex with me while watching porn and wouldnt show what the porn was or giving him bjs and hjs while he watched porn ive posted my story lots but have left out this major detail bc it felt wrong to discuss but for reference we got engaged i uprooted my life to go move in with him in another state 6 days after the proposal and me thousands of dollars deep into the move he called it off unprovoked bc by this time i had been perfect according to his unreasonable standards but he still blamed me this is all after months of emotional and verbal abuse i lost my home a job a baby mental health love my best friend my safety the realization is he legit told me he loved his fetish and addictions more than me and he also said after he broke off our engagement and putting me through absolute hell and destroying my life and financially abusing me and me loosing my home to go move with him after our engagement AFTER blaming me for the reason why he did it and a couple weeks after i came back to my state and was recovering from the move he said So we get married have kids And I say by the way I love wearing diapers Dressing as a girl and letting dudes or someone fuck my ass I wasnt gonna let that happen and that he wasnt sure if he was bi or gay i couldnt tell if he was saying all of that as a ploy to make it easier to be friends with him bc he was actively saying he wanted me in his life and he said would it be easier if i were gay and then told me all those things idk if it was more manipulation or if its true i know his kink is a major thing and it wasnt something i was into and he wants to be with someone romantically who isnt into in but still have sexual encounters with people who are into his kink i can never tell when he was being honest or just saying something to get a certain reaction out of me there were several times hed say im going to go fuck this girl tonight bc you stress me out and then id find out he was home along and not with her his mom would tell me or he later would tell me he never did there were plenty of cases like this too he would just say things to make me believe it so i couldnt tell if he was saying he might be gay for that instance too idk in no way am i being insensitive to sexuality or kinks i was very supportive to him through it all but this is just making me realize he was never going to follow through and legit used me he basically admitted to putting me through hell abusing me very thoroughly blaming it allllll on me and my character flaws made me lose my home to move states with him tell me entire family we got engaged lose my job and spend thousands on moving lose a child all to cancel our engagement and move during a mania spike he had and BLAMES IT ON ME all while he was literally never going to be capable of following through there were so many signs too im realizing now that ive missed he used to straight up tell me that he was mirroring me and i thought that was weird bc women typically mirror the man he used to also say hed just find someone to marry him out of convenience bc he wasnt capable of love he was always so selfish in every aspect of our lives he always made it known to everyone and called me his wife and loved the image that it gave him but treated me like dirt this man was straight up telling me he was a narcissist and i missed the signs in a haze he emotionally verbally mentally and financially abused me for literally nothing bc i was kind and sweet and supportive and empathetic and showed him love he couldnt even fathom he literally watched me as i bent over backwards for him and took care of him and lost the stability in my life to create one with him while he was just belittling me and destroying my worth and esteem he needed control over me bc he lacked it in his own life and addictions and self and was never going to marry me or create the life together we planned bc his demons and desires would have never allowed it even when i was accommodating and understanding but the blame is all on me for loving him and having needs theres so many factors to this and so many versions of him its hard to wrap my head around it all,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 23:01:38 UTC,7,5,0.82,,,0,0

1j629ya,I am having problems with my relationship and I feel trapped,I dont know where to start with it all This is going to be long and if any of you get to the end I appreciate you taking the time to read my story I would say that this feels like a common place story that happens to a lot of people in different ways I just need to get my story told almost feels like I am just asking for pity maybe I am and that is an issue with myself because seeking pity is not good for ones mental health but what Ive been holding in also isnt good for my mental health Ill start the story at 4 years ago when my relationship started It started 7 years ago I start there I was a lonely type of fella and I did not have much relationship experience from my time growing up and being in high school total of 2 relationships before this current one I find myself in one 8 months with it ending with me getting cheated on and the other 15 years with me proposing and then getting cheated on Both inperson and then transitioning to longdistance youd think Id learned my lesson the first time Anyways I go about a year of being single and searching for love as all young people do and nothing worked for me dating apps social events or just finding people in places that youd want to be able to share interest with Until one day I posted a nice thirst trap online to get the selfseeking validation that I felt I needed at the time and someone slid into my DMs someone that I had known from HS but never truly talked to I began talking with this person and then we grew closer every day despite being long distance with a 3hour time difference We Facetimed each other every once in a while and then twice a week and then every day The problem at the time in that relationship was two things I was not emotionally intelligent and I had a group of guy friends that were semitoxic My significant other was not fond of my friends as they wanted to go out and party all the time which I didnt mind doing but it wasnt my cup of tea So I spent more time talking with her and then one day I tried to introduce her to my group of friends on Facetime and she talked to everyone a little bit and just found them all disgusting and asked to talk to me again She said something along the lines of Wow cant believe you did that and hung up on me Now for me I was confused because my buddies did the same thing with their signifcant others and no one was upset and it was nice getting to know the person they loved back homefor a little context me and my SO had not met up yet we were still having facetime and what not It was also a surprise for her because when she called I was hanging out with my buddies and one of them picked up So after she hung up I called her back in private and I asked her what was wrong and she told me that she felt disrespected by what happened and that was our first big fight with each other and it ended with me texting her updates of when and where I am so she knows if she can call with me I agreed with it all not thinking that it was a big deal We continued the relationship with one another with basically a gradual turn of all my free time being spent with her I neglected friends and became somewhat isolated from my world As an inexperienced youngling I didnt see that issue I kept the good friends and started distancing myself from my friends wed hang out with but it started to be less and less as the month went by I would say that we are about 8 months into this relationship with each other when we first decided to meet up with each other and have about a week together Now before we met with each other she alluded that there were things that she wasnt going to give me or ask of me unless we were dating because I hadnt asked her to be my girlfriend and I dont know why but that enticed me to figure out what she was alluding to and that brought me to the point of when meeting up with her I asked her to be my gf and she said yes but I was so nervous asking her it felt like she was a bit hesistant on that matter when replying yes That happened the first day and then we started dating with our first week in a relationship of hanging out with each other I stayed at her place the whole week and we did various things and hung out with each other It felt like things went well for the week that we spent together it felt like we connected and everyone had a good time before we had to say goodbye and continue our longdistance relationship After I got back to my home things started to change with our relationship she wanted more from me in ways of being more emotionally aware of my day and tell her my feelings and how things made me feel and as the emotinally unintellegnet person I was it was hard for me to change that in my everyday life I was just going with the flow of life and never realy discussed my emotions with others becasue it never really came up in conversation We argued about how I was still just discussing my day with her and not sharing my emotions with her so I worked on it and slowly got better with being in touch with my emotions yet I feel like it was never really enough for the relationship As the months went by she continuously felt like I wasnt telling her enough about my life and felt left out the more I told her about my day so I committed to telling her everything that happened in my day as she was doing to me Now my struggle was that there was a lot that happened in my day so I would sometimes do it when it happened in my day Still I would eventually tell her about it when we called each other every day Still she would then get upset that she missed out on knowing when it happened and what I felt in that period Once again being the emotionally unavailable guy I was I tried my best to do what I could to satisfy that need for her At this point youre probably wondering why we just didnt break up I have no clue its probably just me being weakwilled At this point I spent just about every waking moment texting and talking to this girl and we got into arguments just about every single day either about me missing information I was telling her or me not being emotional Being young I thought this was healthy because the arguments led to deeper conversations with each other and figuring out what made us who we are I would say about 4 or 5 months after our initial meetup I had pretty much completely distanced myself from my friedns with rarely ever hanging out with them but maybe once in a blue moon but it made it harder in my relationship to hangout with them becausea of her wanting to know everything and me jsut wanting to spend time with friedns so there was communication delay from waht was happening in the conversation and what I was doing vs what was acutally happening in my life This all led to arguments down the line and then our next meet up this time I was meeting her parents and she was coming to me I set things up so that I could stay with her and got a friend that I was closer with that she seemed to like because he was married and approved more of our relationship We spent the time together for about 2 weeks this time one week just me and her at my place and then a week with her parents It seemed like another good meet up with both of enjoying ourselves but a little bit of tension between us from the arguments and the fact I was moving from a 3 hour time difference to a 13 hour time difference which we both imagined would put more of a strain on our relationship her parents liked me on a side note We parted ways and I began my new path in life with her being in college and me being abroad for work We had both been right tensions did increase with each other as I was abroad it became even hadrder for me to comunicate with her with everything that was going on in my day to day life as it was for the most part always unpredictable and hard to keep up with myself and she would sleep half way through my day as the time differnece so if she didnt wake up to a butt load of text about my day she felt upset and always had this feeling of misisng out on my life so I continued to distance myself from others and not participating in group events and when I did I tried to keep to myself to minimize the updating I had to do At this point she just felt like I didnt love her because I wasnt involving her in my life the same way she was involving me in her life She told me everything about her day so this wasnt a double standard and she was also busy but I would say that I was definitely busier than she was I continued to apoligize about the communication issues with keeping in mind I still was telling her about everything that happened in my day whenever we talked on the phone especially all the things I forgot to tell her and she felt that I conviently kept forgetting to tell her about the interations that I had with Females throughout my day beacuse as you can imagine she was jealous that other females got to interact with me throught out the day more and she didnt I was better about telling her about female interaction through my day but I still missed a few here and there Sometimes I got rides from females and shed get upset that I didnt tell them when it happened She always felt she never got the full story the first time and she had to ask multiple questions to get the whole story and that was tiring for her and it got to the point where I thought I was doing a good job but was not and I just gave up on updating her one day because life just got overwhelmed and I couldnt handle life and my relationship at the same time and she ended it after that day I was devastated as we had been going through this struggle for almost 3 years and it just felt like it was all for nothing We met a third time before breaking up and were going to meet up a 4th before COVID19 occurred and travel bans happened which didnt improve our relationship We broke up I got friends and started to move on with my life slowly finding myself and what makes me happy For about a year I was single I decided to move back to the same timezone as her and go to the college that she went to Not expecting her to be in the area not ever really knowing why I did it either I wanted to complete college not being in a relationship but that was not what occured As you can expect we ran into each other again and started dating because she felt like I was a changed man and was able to prioritize things in my life a little better I can say that I did grow in the time after we broke up and explored my inner workings a little more The thing is she thought I started dating her again because she was a different person but she hasnt really changed all that much still wanting the same things and I was more able to provide those things she wanted and it felt like things were going in the right direction We moved in with each other and where dating for a year until she said that she wanted more and didnt feel we were growing and she said it was because I had not asked her to be my gf so about 3 months of me trying to find the right time to ask and it not working out we get into an argument about it and I asak her and she says no ask another time So I dont plan for it and just start asking her once a week until she just says yes about 2 months later while we are living and sleeping in the same bed with each other Anyway things started getting a little tenser between us I dont have many friends as I learned not to make friends in this relationship and I dont talk to my old friends much because it just causes conflict and Id rather avoid than lie We continued dating and for about 2 years we lived in the same place We have had our ups and downs through the two years I changed my job twice and have a female supervisor as you know she is upset about that but she ignores it better She says she just at this point in the relationship buries her emotions and hides her concerns because she doesnt want conflict in the relationship and she only ever feels that she has problems with what is going on in the relationship We still argue a lot and have those arguments turn into deep conversations and I become more and more emotionally drained as these arguments happen and I can barely keep up with my studies work and relationship yet I push on We are starting to get to the real point of this story and why I am just done is that we were initially very active sexually in the beginning of our relationship like once a week and then it moved to once a month which you know I didnt think to much of it because I figure sex drive just went down as the relationship got more secured but we just moved to a new place and signed a 15 month lease that niether of us can afford to break and I tried to be sexual with her this morning and she told me that it felt nice but shed been thinking of her ex when weve been doing stuff and that its kinda always been that way becasue she used to be very sexually active with her ex but he was fine with not having sex and she puts herself in his position and wouldnt want that pushed uponed her and makes her feel sad and turns her off from anything that we are doing and I tried to help her get to the root of it this morning before leaving to work and I just felt that I disrepected myself by doing that and not being more upset about her thinking of her ex and it just hurts because it means just about everytime we do sexual stuff its about how she feels about her ex and makes sense why she has to sometime watch things when I go down on her Honestly I know that this is a super toxic relationship but I love her so much and have tried so hard in this relationship with the time and effort I put in everyday it just sucks all of it TLDR GF thinks of ex during intimate time after 7 years of relationship and gets turned off just about every time because she pushed herself on her ex and her ex didnt care about having sex and she didnt like the idea of being in his position So it has tanked our relationship and everything feels distant and We moved to new place with 15 month lease no one can afford to break

1j61gar,Is there a right way to tell my Christian brother about my sexuality,Hi this is my first time writing here so I hope it makes sense I am a 21 year old female living in a generational Christian family Being told your entire that married and have kids is something I have to do and that if I dont now I will someday So when I found at the age of 14 that I am Asexual and just a couple years after Bisexual I kinda felt relived but also terrified I have only told my cousin and she was very accepting of me and we tell each our problems all the time I have been debating on telling my brother about my sexuality for a couple years Just the two of us are going on trip this can either going to ruin our whole trip or strengthen our bond The biggest problem is that I am worried he will think I am too young to talk about these topics and hell say I can change either when I am older or when I find the right person All that to say that I love my brother but knowing his biblical stance on sexuality has made this very difficult for me to say anything Anyways thanks for reading my rambling I havent 100 decided to tell my brother but I hope to soon,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 21:56:46 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j5xpao,The Weight of My Own Mistakes,There was once a boy who believed in lovenot the fairytale kind but the kind that made the world feel right And for a while he had it A girl who stood by him who saw the best in him even when he didnt see it himself She loved him with a kind of loyalty that was rare a love that never wavered even when he gave her reasons to walk away But love isnt just about feelings its about choices And one day fear made him choose wrong He let gonot because he didnt love her but because he was afraid Afraid of not being enough Afraid that one day she would leave and it would hurt too much So instead of holding on he let himself drift away He convinced himself that if he stopped putting in effort if he stopped making her a priority then maybe just maybe it wouldnt hurt when it finally ended But she never left She stayed She still believed in them even when he had already started moving away And then he made a mistake he could never take backhe gave his heart to someone else before he had truly let her go At first he thought he could move on But something inside him shifted After some time in his new relationship he finally understood his mistakes He realized how deeply he had hurt the one person who had truly loved him But he never knew how to make it right How do you fix something after breaking it beyond repair How do you face the person you betrayed knowing no apology will ever be enough He wanted to go back to do something anythingbut the guilt held him back And so he stayed Not because he had moved on but because he was afraidafraid that if he left his new relationship to make things right he would once again be the villain in his own story The guilt consumed him so instead of looking back he convinced himself that staying was the only way forward And in his guilt he changed Determined not to make the same mistakes he became kinder He tried to treat the new girl right giving her the love and care he had once failed to give But kindness when given to the wrong person is easily taken for granted And she did exactly that She manipulated him gaslighted him twisted his guilt into a weapon against him She made him believe he was always wrong always at fault Every time he questioned her actions she turned it around making him doubt his own reality Whenever he felt she was wrong she made herself the victim and made him feel like he was the one to blame Slowly he lost himself The person he once wasthe person who understood things clearlybegan to fade And as you already know he never spoke up Regret became his shadow Guilt his reflection He had apologized to the one he had hurt over and over again but some wounds dont heal with words He had hurt someone beyond repair and now he was paying the pricenot just through his own pain but through the way he was now being treated He wanted to move forward to leave it all behind but no matter what he did the past followed Every quiet moment became a reminder of what he had lost Every time he tried to love again he feared he would be taken for granted just as he had once done to her Maybe this was karma Maybe this was what he deserved Or maybe just maybe he still had a choice As he stood at the edge of everything he had been and everything he could become he realized something he had no idea what came next Would he ever forgive himself Would he ever find peace Or would he always be haunted by what he had done He didnt know But for the first time in a long time he was ready to find out,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 19:27:03 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j5u6ov,Why I dont support or celebrate Specific Group Celebration Holidays MenWomenMotherFatherPrideBlack Historyetc,I want to start by saying that this is a personal opinion and I understand and also support personal opposing views on this topic regarding individuals who believe the days to be an exemplification of feelings rather than the notes listed below In the past few weeks Ive been hounded on a LOT about not celebrating valentines day mothers day or International Womens Day by people other than the ones Id celebrate them for Ranging from people telling me Im an awful human being for not appreciating my mom or women in generaldespite this being wholly inaccurate to people threatening to assault me because i didnt do something special for my mom on mothers day I wanted to hear from random strangers online if my reasoning is sound and makes sense as toward why I dont celebrate them specifically as when I explain it in person people seem to get quite upset with me regardless I would like to note that around the holiday not on the holiday itself all the time just around that time period I still put more effort and care into the relevant individuals but I just dont like to celebrate the days themselves for the reasons listed below My reluctance to celebrate holidays like Fathers Day Mothers Day International Womens or Mens Day and others that specifically celebrate a group of individuals stems from a few key personal beliefs and feelings 1 Forced Social Expectations I often feel that these holidays create an obligation rather than a genuine expression of appreciation Society dictates that on this specific day I must express gratitude or admiration even if I already do so in my own way throughout the year It feels performativelike Im expected to participate just because its a designated date rather than acting on my feelings when they naturally arise 2 Commercialization Over Meaning These holidays have been heavily commercialized turning what should be a meaningful moment into an opportunity for businesses to sell cards flowers gifts and expensive dinners It feels less about genuine appreciation and more about fulfilling a marketingdriven expectation I dont like the idea of my relationships being tied to consumerism where love and respect are measured by the money or effort spent on a particular day 3 Personal Connection to the Honored Group Sometimes I dont have a personal connection that makes celebrating these holidays meaningful For instance if someone has a complicated relationship with their parents or lacks a strong figure that fits into the holidays framework these days can feel alienating rather than celebratory Its a reminder of what someone might not have rather than an opportunity to appreciate what I do 4 Selective Recognition Feels Arbitrary Why do we elevate specific groups on designated days while overlooking the everyday contributions of others It feels arbitrarywhy celebrate fathers on one day and mothers on another when both play roles throughout the year Why single out women for one day rather than advocating for equal treatment and appreciation daily It seems more symbolic than substantive and I prefer actions that carry meaning every day rather than confining appreciation to a calendar date 5 Pressure to Conform Theres an implicit pressure to participate in these celebrations whether its through social media posts attending gatherings or giving gifts If I choose not to theres often an assumption that I dont care or that Im being inconsiderate But in reality I simply prefer to show my appreciation in my own way at my own time without feeling compelled by external expectations 6 Not Everyone Experiences These Days Positively For many people these holidays can be painful rather than joyous Someone who has lost a parent might struggle on Mothers or Fathers Day Someone who has faced discrimination or hardship might not feel comfortable with the broad generalizations made on International Womens Day Mothers Day Fathers Day or International Mens Day These celebrations assume a universal experience that doesnt exist and Id rather avoid engaging in something that might inadvertently bring discomfort to others 7 Personal Values and Approach Ultimately I value sincerity over tradition If I appreciate someone I want to show it naturally in a way that feels right to me not because a calendar tells me to I dont need a designated day to tell my parents I appreciate them nor do I need a specific date to recognize the struggles and achievements of any group Id rather express my respect gratitude and admiration in everyday moments through my actions and words rather than as part of a structured societal ritual For these reasons I tend to avoid participating in these kinds of holidays Its not out of defiance or lack of appreciation but rather a personal preference for authenticity over obligation,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 17:22:18 UTC,0,3,0.36,,,0,0

1j5saoz,My girlfriend said shed cheat on me and now I feel worthless,IMTF 19 and my girlfriendF19 have been together for about 4 months now I know it isnt a lot of time but I really felt something for her She was the only person with who I could share my deepest secrets without judgement She knew me I didnt have to wear a mask around her and that made me comfortable We lived 8 hours away from each other We met every month or even more frequently I helped her with her struggles at the beginning She was freshly after a breakup with a guy she lived with she was extremely emotional since they guy seemed not to have cared for her He promised to visit her but didnt and only like 2 months after their breakup he started relentlessly calling her Nudging her to go to therapy etc He even joined her friend groups discord server and that made her so emotional she quit the internet for a week and only talked to me through phone I helped her through this period i was always calling her and wanted to spend every minute of my time with her First off it was good We talked we played games we watched movies She had her weird habits but i got used to them Eventually we started arguing a lot I mean I really did all i could for her She was my priority all of the time I called off parties to want to spend time with her I went on a 10 hour train ride just to see her and comfort her in a place she didnt really have a lot to do But the thing is she never really cared for me the way I did for her I reserved time for us during new years eve just so I could see her and she had a mood swing or something and called it off since she thought I was getting attached to quickly We were to meet about 2 weeks ago but she called it off too since our conversations wasnt good I am not going to lie It was not a pleasant conversation but a honest one nothing to get offended by Just us talking about us in a slightly sadder tone I get really emotional and jealous like she was talking to her friend that he has to watch something and that shes willing to watch the entirety of it with him I just thought well why doesnt she want to watch things with me Why does she want to visit him not me I was her girlfried at the end of the day and that guy called everything she recommended crappy Its like I gave her all this attention and she didnt even care enough to visit me This morning she wrote me an ominious message Would you still want to be around me if I had kissed someone else in the past month I replied that if she would give someone a kiss on a cheek or something which is kind of normal in my part of the world Id be okay with it but if it was romantic something that could be classified as cheating I would leave She then said that it is going to happen and that she would have done it a long time ago if it hadnt been for that that she doesnt go out much and is pretty asocial I mean that kind of broke me I never had any meaningful relationship I was always hiding a part of myself and when a person that accepted me came along they stab me in the back in such a heinous manner I already got cheated on once I know how it ends there is no redemption no coming back to what once was I really loved her gave her everything I could but that still wasnt enough,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 16:17:15 UTC,2,7,0.58,,,0,0

1j5rl29,I feel like my boyfriends sex doll,My boyfriends of a year is only my 3rd sexual partner When we met he told me he hated getting oral but loved giving it When we first started having sex it was really good I was worried he told me he was a porn addict previously but the sex was very focused on my pleasure and I was pleased I did try to give him oral but he would stop it after a couple of minutes and move on to me During those attempts I could tell what he didnt like and did so I stopped doing the things he didnt enjoy when I would go down About a month into sex he one day pulled my hair and started face fucking me After he asked me if I liked having him control me when down there or if I preferred being in control I told him I was really uncomfortable being held down there and I was really uncomfortable being face fucked He claimed he liked me being in control Last 2 months or so sex has completely shifted He hasnt gone down on me I feel like a rag doll he uses He grabs my legs and moves me where he wants me and grabs my head and pushes me into giving him oral often while holding me down there Then last weekend happened I said I wanted to try anal but have been scared We tried it once before but it hurt and I cried out and he stopped It wasnt off the table to try again He woke me in the middle of the night while I was asleep on my side by entering me from behind on his side too It felt good and he and I have an agreement to wake up sex when we spend the night together even middle of the night A few minutes in he pulls out and aims at my ass He pushed in a little I cried out and pulled away no lube used and he has a big dick He put his hand over my mouth and grabbed my waist and pulled me hard back onto his cock I started crying from the pain but he just held me there while he finished with his hand on my mouth When he was done I told him it hurt and all he said was I never said no and rolled over and went to sleep Then he woke me up again a few hours later and repeated the whole thing so I was super sore and have been since I love him but I dont love feeling like his sex toy Edit Im sitting here crying I felt used but never really thought about the fact I was violated I grew up in an abusive household and sometimes boundaries and normal things dont feel normal and abuse and bad things do Ive been really emotionally numb to this all and I guess I needed a wake up call to see this isnt okay behavior,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 15:52:12 UTC,6405,948,0.94,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j5ox11,Boyfriend wants to get married and Im indifferent towards it,Back story Im F28 and my M30 wants to be married We were on and off from the years I was 1920 and when I turned 21 we got together offically and I was convinced by him and his mom to move in since I was living alone and my parents are retired in a different country From the years 1922 he was just not nice very rude and he would always choose his friends over me and his friends were always females In the early stages his friends or family will tell him to leave me and he would do it and then be adamant on staying friends when I would say no He also kept crying to me about his ex and how much she hurt him and he hid the fact he would talk to her mom like once a week When I found out he stood his ground and said no to cutting her off He only agreed to cut her off because I was pregnant with his child When I turned 23 during Covid we fell pregnant although I took Plan B I didnt realize I was ovulating so it didnt work We kept our son but he was just so rude during my pregnancy he took it upon himself to be there for a female friend all because she was dating a guy and needed help and instead of her going to her female friends my bf was always available He went as far as to stay out all night and get drunk with her and their other friends and the guy she was dating when I didnt want him to and when he returned home he cursed me and his mother out because I held him back in life I also had told him for years how important marriage was to me and he was just so whatever about it I told him while I was pregnant just ask with a ring pop since we didnt have too much money and I wanted to be married before having a kid and he came home a few days later and as I was lying on the couch he threw the ring pop and said you going to say yes right I said no because he made it seem like a chore or obligation rather than him wanting to He also spend all my pregnancy mad at me because I didnt want to name our son after him When Ive told him since I was 19 and even before when we were sort of friends at 16 that I do not want to name my son after their father name Fast forward our son is born and he is currently 4 and throughout these 4 years he keeps wanting to be married and I told him unless he has a career were he can care of the home expenses what is the point Since our son been born Ive made almost all the money paid our rent our bills hes has jobs here and there He just made one year at his current job and he does pay his part but even before our son and now Im also paying like 6070 and he pays the rest and theirs been times Ive paid 100 I told him if he becomes a police officer id feel okay and comfortable marrying him since its a good paying job and he can support us and he wants to and hes doing it for him and for us to be married But I also feel so indifferent like I dont see the excitement in calling him my husband since we skipped over the step Sometimes I feel like its my fault and I should of ignored that he threw a ring pop at me and other times I feel like if I would of accepted it I would be open to constant disrespect from him in the future Him as a father super good and kind he takes our son to school and picks him up he lets me sleep in and sleep whenever He tries to pay for dates when we are out our son and him have a strong bond He gets me flowers offers to cook even it it doesnt taste the greatest Overall him as a dad and a partner is nice I do feel spoiled But because I cant let go of how he treated me Im always going to have this fever hes going to revert back,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 14:15:54 UTC,3,9,1.0,,,0,0

1j5o8uu,I broke up with my girlfriend of almost four years and I regret it,Its almost been a year and I made a mistakeIn June I broke up with my girlfriend of almost four years because we were going away for college and we were both going out of state on opposite sides of the country I thought it would be the best thing for us but its been the opposite I really hurt her when we broke up The first few days I thought this was going to be the best thing for me and I just tried to push her out of my mind as much as I could but I just kept feeling like an asshole She loved me so much and I took it for granted She would do things for me all the time just because and never expect anything in return She would constantly put me ahead of her and also just loved me no matter what I was going through I couldnt stop thinking about her and during my first week of college I was so excited about what was going on in my life and I wanted nothing more than to just text her and let her know what was going on It bothered me that in the almost 3 months we had been broken up at that point she never once reached out to me I wanted to know how college was going for her I wanted to know how she was doing How could the girl who I once had this amazing love with not try to reach out to me once I texted her letting her know that I had been thinking about her and that I hoped she was doing well She kept things super brief and said she hoped I was doing well but I wanted to talk to her so much more so I poked about what she had been doing and in two months she had done so much and she was going to this great huge school and was doing all of this without me I know I shouldve been happy for her but it just made me sad and angry We didnt talk for a month after that until she sent me a picture of a tattoo she had gotten I was so excited that she finally reached out to me This was the first time since we had broken up that she initiated the conversation We talked for a little bit and it felt so great We fell back into conversation like back when we were dating It felt so good to talk to her again but at the same time it made me feel sick that I knew so little about what was going on in her life now and I was only hearing so little about it I sent her a text telling her how happy I was for her and how what shes doing seems like such a great experience for her and she never responded That hurt a lot I looked at her TikTok and Instagram for the first time in months and I just wanted to throw up She is living this whole life without me She looks happy and most of all beautiful Like how dare she be so beautiful and smile at people with smiles that were once mine I would go to her Spotify and I would be so paranoid that one of those playlists was dedicated to someone that wasnt me I felt so selfish and angry and mad at the world and at myself I had to push her out of my mind so I started seeing someone I wasnt even really interested in them Lookswise they were nothing compared to my exgirlfriend Their personality was so dull and boring compared to my ex and in the end I ended up just feeling like this huge dick for stringing someone along for months just to get over my exgirlfriend I went home for my Christmas break from my college and it got even worse Knowing that we were in the same town and just a drive away from each others houses made me feel insane I got so nervous that I was going to run into her any time I left the house I thought about going Christmas shopping in the mall she worked at so I could accidentally run into her and then would just get sad because I was becoming this huge creep I wanted to text her every day asking if she wanted to get coffee and I never did because nothing would hurt more than knowing she didnt want to see me I texted her Merry Christmas and she was nice about it but she didnt want to talk to me anymore after that And then I saw she went back to her college before me and it was painful seeing her with all her friends having so much fun and having so much fun without me Seeing her cozied up with a girl on her Instagram makes me feel like Im going to throw up I see them post together all the time and I just want to know if theyre dating How could she date someone so soon after 3 almost 4 years How could she be so brazen and post her and that girl getting coffee and going on dates together Does she not think Ill see it I think I would feel worse if it was a man The thought of some man looking at her the way I used to and touching her and being intimate with her makes me angry and sad and violent all at the same time I would stalk her pages all day while I was still in our hometown waiting for her to post something and getting nervous when she would How could she be having so much fun and be so happy all without me We were each others first love first kiss first everything And now I dont know if shes doing that with other people Things got a little bit better when I went back for my second semester of college but I still just cant get her out of my mind Im starting to see another girl now to try and get over my ex and shes again nothing like my exgirlfriend and I dont think there will ever be anyone like herWhen I first broke up with her I didnt think it would hurt this much I guess in the back of my mind I thought she wouldve fought for us I thought she wouldve texted me more when we were broken up I thought she and I honestly wouldve gotten back together at this point Im so insanely in love with her still and I brought this on myself but I thought I was doing whats best for the both of us I guess I didnt appreciate or realize the things that she did for me while we were together,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 13:50:08 UTC,0,16,0.41,,,0,0
1j5o5qn,Is it ok to be confused and overwhelmed when figuring out what you want,A year ago I was stressed and scared that being a software engineer would ruin my plans to try and be creative I was dead set on it but I watched the creative industry crumble and I see how corporatized it really is it makes sense why people go indie So I shifted focus because of the news and Im just questioning what I want to do and how Now I just dont care or stress about being creative I dont mind doing it on my downtime even if I suck at it Ever since I traveled across the country I feel myself wanting to find a new place to live a place that vibes with me especially outside the US But Ill likely need to advance my education become a genius to be considered a hire for an overseas business Im just not fit with my associates degree So I feel stuck I may bite the bullet and get a software engineering degree but only so I can live somewhere cool and feel at home Edit I moved from one interest to another and Im feeling overwhelmed because of the news and I just want to find whats right for me but it will take a lot of work,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 13:46:44 UTC,5,2,1.0,,,0,0

1j5mosy,My mom might never be the same,Ok I know the tag is bad but let me clear stuff up right off the bat I didnt try to kill myself nobody in my family did and nobody in this story succeeds in doing so With that said its still disturbing I go to a high school that is located right next to a PreK8 school My mom works there and teaches PreK4 while my brother attends as a 7th grader Yesterday my mom and brother told me of something that happened Basically a kid in my brothers grade tried to kill himself in the bathroom using his belt part of the uniform and was at it for several minutes before a friend of the kid went looking for him To make a long story short it was a whole 2 hours afterward that the police were called and something was done about it Now this alone is devastating and disturbed my mom but what made me call my post this was this detail of the story The kid tried this around 11 am The administration was only made aware at 1 pm The kids knew this and said nothing Now you may think that its because hes a bully or disliked but he was a smart kid who played football at his school and was generally wellliked The chilling part was that most kids were just indifferent to the whole thing They felt bad but nobody was particularly emotional My brother said that everybody was silent but only a few who he knew feared death The kid who went to check on the victim got texts from the victim with suicidal thoughts and he said nothing at first And thats why I named this post what I did My mom is one of those people who believes that suicide is cowardly and that there are always options for those who feel that way but hearing how a group of kids witnessed one of their try that and then everyone not go talk to grownups was shocking for her Even worse since they have the school has not made anything public yet about this incident and probably is just going to sweep it under the rug Now I might have exaggerated the title a bit my mom is a very resilient woman But I fear that the way this story played out will affect her for a long time Also normally I would talk to friends and people in school about this but the victims older sister attends and probably doesnt want anybody to know so I ranted here,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 12:47:35 UTC,0,2,0.5,,CONTENT WARNING SUICIDESELF HARM,0,0

1j5l5t1,My Mom hates me,Sorry for the bad writing i attempted to post it in an german subreddit first but they ave a limit of 3k letters max and also dont allow blocktext wich is what this would have turned into if i tried to stay within said margin plus deleting a paragraph So i had to use Google translate Sorry I 25f always have disputes with my 59f mother Whenever I dont do something the same as she wants she gets pretty acidic and even if I do it the same way as she wants she somehow always has something to complain about Example of today Because of the beautiful weather I should hang my duvet out of my window but the problem is that the winter garden roof is right in front of my window and I cant hang it out because it is a more or less flat level So I decided to hang the blanket over the edge of the winter garden roof mind you at one point that was quite clean in my opinion at least And if I had hung the blanket directly out of the window she would have been dirty or even dirty anyway I also had planned and also discussed with my mother that I would wash the blanket this weekend anyway Nevertheless she then sniffed me about half an hour later and she also found it very shit that I sucked at the same time as I was sucking We have a solar system that produces a very nice amount of electricity in very sunny weather and I thought that it would already be finished with sucking because I hadnt heard her vacuum cleaner anymore and then started sucking my room However she still has a problem with it because she apparently continued to suck again after a moment which I couldnt hear because of my loud sucker and also ran the washing machine which I didnt know anything about because I couldnt see or hear her from my room on the first floor and that I was not explicitly told that it would be hired In addition she also complained because I took a break when sucking I have a cold and dont have enough endurance to create everything at once My room consists of two adjacent rooms of which I usually only do one because I am more in this but this time I wanted to do both and only took a break in between After I had explained Mama that she told me that I always had an excuse I then started crying no idea why sometimes happens during such confrontations and Mama asked in a rather aggressive tone why I would cry now even though there is no reason for it and that we would only have a reasonable discussion Incidentally the howling is nothing that I have an influence I dont because it is to cry afterwards or something I have zero control about whether or when this happens In the surplus she also titled such moments as psycho shit and attempted manipulation Not today but in other similar situation Incidentally she mostly teemers my attempts to explain and or counter arguments or ignores them entirely I often have the feeling of being shouted at in these moments even though she only talks to me very quietly her words I dont even want to do something in the household anymore because it is almost always wrong or not right And almost every interaction with her consists that she tells me something what to do or indicate that something is wrongdirty or somehow not correct That would be okay but everything is just too much I dont want to come down to her or talk to her When I come home and your car is not there Im already relieved Is probably not your fault Im probably just over sensitive or overreact or something Also i havent stopped crying the whole time while writingtranslating this and my mom came in and asked me in a really passive aggressive tone what was up and why i am still crying I told her to leave and she left Idk what to do I feel like she truly hates me and idk why she does all of this like that Maybe it makes her happy When asked she always says that she doesnt but Idk if i can believe that,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 11:14:08 UTC,1,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j5l09y,15 Years in CanadaNow Im Jobless Broke amp Out of Options,After spending 15 years building a life here I never imagined I would end up with nothing forced to start over from zero again I have updated this post to clarify a few things based on feedback I take full responsibility for my situation I made many mistakes along the way whether it was not staying on top of deadlines assuming I had more time than I did or not making the best choices I have struggled with severe ADHD my entire life and since I choose to manage it without medication I often leave things until the last minute That habit has hurt me in more ways than I can count and this situation is no exception At the same time the immigration system has changed significantly over the years making it much harder for someone in my position to qualify In the end it was a mix of bad timing personal missteps and an immigration system that has only grown tougher for people like me I moved to Canada as an international student a little over 15 years ago I started from nothing learning English from scratch completing my academic English education and then going to university and college I worked multiple jobs as a developer while paying my taxes and contributing to the country I wanted to call home Despite all that I lost everything when my work permit expired a few months ago I did not qualify for enough points under the everchanging immigration system so as soon as my permit expired my job was gone Because my work permit expired I was not eligible for unemployment benefits had no options just the expectation to pack up and leave like I never existed The worst part is that this is not just about money or survival I genuinely loved my job I had amazing coworkers a great team and what I believed to be the perfect job in the perfect country I was lucky enough to have made meaningful contributions and had so much more to offer as a 32yearold with a bright future ahead of me That is why I have so many regrets about how things turned out and I know they will stay with me for a lifetime I would give anything to go back and keep doing what I love But because I wanted to do things the right way legally and honorably there just do not seem to be any options left Losing my job did not just mean losing income It meant losing my ability to stay afloat in the country I call home Even when I had a good income I was living paycheck to paycheck covering expenses for two people A large portion of my money went toward taxes rent and paying off debts that piled up after I lost my previous job during the pandemic Now with no work permit not even underthetable cash jobs would be enough to cover my expenses and those would not be legal for me anyway Over the years Canadas immigration system has become increasingly strict The requirements kept changing the point thresholds kept rising and options like employerspecific work permits which could have been a lifeline for people like me were removed in Ontario By the time I finally became eligible or was just about to things had already shifted again I know people who moved to other provinces because obtaining permanent residency was easier there but even that became riskier when some pathways suddenly disappeared Going back to Turkey is not just about starting over It is a nightmare waiting to happen My brother and I are both considered army escapees which means we would be forced into mandatory military service soon after arriving The Turkish army is notorious for its brutal conditions As ethical vegans and atheists we would be in an impossible position The army does not accommodate veganism and being openly atheist is frowned upon both socially and institutionally I know our time there would be unbearable in every way The system does not account for people like me those who have given everything to this country only to be left with no way to stay Is this how the system treats people who dedicate their youth education and labor to this country I do not want to sound ungrateful I have always loved this country and I still do I love its people and I consider Toronto my real home Leaving would feel like losing a part of myself forever But after all these years not having a viable pathway to stay just does not feel fair to me After more than two days without sleep with stress piling up and rent due while I have no income my mind is all over the place while writing this I also recorded myself talking about all of this for about half an hour right before writing this crying the whole time It felt like therapy in a way just letting it all out Now writing this feels like another form of that release I do not know what comes next but I needed to get this off my chest If nothing else I hope sharing my story highlights how the system fails people who follow all the rules and still end up with nothing I truly hope it will somehow help future people like me Thank you for reading I truly appreciate anyone
