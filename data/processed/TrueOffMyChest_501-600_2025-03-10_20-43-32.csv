1j5k39v,feeling self conscious about my body after a comment made while intimate,hi reddit ive been struggling with something and im feeling really self conscious about it. i 19 m have always been aware that my penis is very small well below average and its something ive been insecure about but ive tried not to let it define me. recently something happened that made me feel way more insecure than ive ever felt. i was with a girl ive been talking to recently and we decided to have sex but during she said i dont know how to say this but i can barely feel anything. i was expecting something else the way they said it wasnt outright mean but it felt so dismissive and made me feel like i wasnt enough. it really got to me and now im stuck thinking about it all the time. ive always known im smaller than most guys but hearing a comment like that from someone i was intimate with really knocked my confidence. ive only been with 1 other girl and i was self conscious about it with her but we both had a good time for the most part. but after that comment im constantly worrying that ill never be enough for a future partner and that my size will always be a problem. i really dont want to let this comment affect me but its hard to move on from. thanks for reading my post and id love to hear from anyone with advice to help move forward and feel better about not being well endowed.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 09:59:10 UTC,1,6,0.67,,,0,0

1j5jdja,the time i feel like i need it the most i dont have anyone there for me.,the one person who was always there for me was a girl i had fallen for. she was the first one in years that made me actually feel this way about someone. she was loving caring and amazing and she would drop everything for me. if texted her she was there but today she was distant. and i know why. she told me she didnt have the same feelings and i know that and i have to be okay with that and im trying to. but its really difficult to. she started talking to this new guy and im pretty sure they went out today because she looked so nice in the one snap i got from her. it was her going out look. and the only time she doesnt instantly respond to me is when shes out with someone like that. if its one of her girlfriends shes normally really quick and talkitive with me still. and it sucks. it really hurts and she called today to say she had a birthday gift for me which is nice because i dont really celebrate my birthday i dont like making a day about me but its such a kind gesture. and i could tell she was really happy in her voice. and she said she had a good day and wouldnt tell me why which means its probably the guy. and its not like shes hiding that fact i asked her not to tell me about him and those experiences because it made me feel bad and insecure but honestly i dont know if hurts worse not being told but it still feels bad. anyways im really lonely feeling right now and just wanted a connection from someone and nobody is there to answer me it seems. all the people who i used to be able to pick up and talk to whenever whenever dont respond to me anymore and when i reach out in a time like this just to feel a small connection nobody is there. and i feel so alone and ive never felt this way. ive always been happy alone but its so different this time and i dont like it. its been a couple nights ive felt like this but this just feels so bad in an empty way.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 09:08:46 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j5jc5t,im almost 22 and ive never been on a date,like the title says ive never been on a date. women have expressed interest in me ive had past relationships but they were all long distance. which means ive never gotten to take a woman out for dinner or coffee. heres the kicker tho every time i tell someone that ive never been on a date i get a variation of no way or youre lying or how?. getting these types of reactions means that i am good looking to an extent i guess but it hasnt translated to any dates. i will admit tho i am a late bloomer i was bullied mercilessly as a child was fat then skinny and now im in the middle which is nice. i know i need to put myself out there more but every time i do so i get burned rather quickly in spectacular fashion i may add. im also afraid of rejection which doesnt help. my luck isnt the best either and considering how unavailable people in my city are i guess it makes sense. i just feel so far behind my peers i feel weird. i get everyone has their own timeline but at the same time when most people your age are in committed relationships or going out on dates its hard not to feel unlovedunwanted in addition to feeling like youre behind. i also wonder if i should ever tell a woman this when not if the day comes? will she be turned off? will she be weirded out and think to herself whats wrong with this guy? how has he never been on a date? thank you for reading and take care.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 09:05:42 UTC,2,3,1.0,,,0,0
1j5jbok,found out my dad had a grindr account,i 22f recently found this out and honestly have no one i can tell that wont look at my dad in a weird way. ive always had my suspicions but i wasnt sure what i was suspicious about. i knew he had done some pretty tame things like drink and smoke but whose dad hasnt? in a way this more just confirmed that he has cheated. ive also always been a sneaky person when i was younger i would always listen through the doors and behind walls whenever my parents would fight just so i can know everything and see how transparent theyd actually be with me. ive just always been nosy. a while back i was maybe 13 or 14 me and my family decided to upgrade all of our phones. when each of us transferred all of our information to our new devices some of the applications pop up. and at 13 i was the most chronically online emo loser who grew up in the 20002010s era so i recognize a grindr logo when i see one. that day my dad did look a bit like he knew that i saw but he probably thought i didnt know what it was he had on his phone. i just told myself maybe i thought i had seen that logo and left it alone until now. tonight after my nightly routine i forgot my hair ties in my parents room so i decided to sneak in there while my dad was asleep and his phone was unlocked with a chat opened. like i said.im nosy. i didnt see anything but i 100 knew it was grinder because i saw the logo. i did take a photo while his phone was open too i dont know why but something was telling me to! i also wasnt sure if this was something my mother knew of and just never said anything. just because i feel like its her natural response to something like that. i love my dad hes still a father to me and my siblings and he works hard. this doesnt make me hate him but it does slightly piss me off because all i can think about is my mom and how much she doesnt deserve her husband doing something like this. as of right now im not sure what ill do. i just wanted to get this off my chest because i know itll weigh heavy on me if i dont tell some one. i feel like if i tell my friends they might pity me just because this situation is just so weird and honestly i feel like freaky stuff like this doesnt happen in anyone elses family lol.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 09:04:41 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j5janh,people with digestive malfunctions i understand you. lots of people do.,three years ago i experienced strong health issues regarding my digestive systems. basically i was unable to eat and had diarrheas all evenings from 6pm which is very weird your digestive system aint supposed to work that way i had tests running and nothing worked. nor they found what i had i had like deep tests including bloods and cameras in my stomach. it caused a depression or the depression caused it? who knows?. i was belittled by my gp who was like youve got nothing dude youre fine in fact youre overreacting. i was willing to kill myself at the time because i had no hope id able to have a normal life then i changed my gp she gave my antidepressants and it went slowly better. i finally recovered after like 8 months in hell. i was able later to enjoy my life. now as i am about to do something thrilling in my life for a few months symptoms are back. its been one month. im unable to eat and i want to puke like a lot like i have no appetite at all i have dark thoughts eructations... dont know why might be after a covid infection i had but like ive had 6 of them till 2020 so i dont know. or a changing environment. i left my city. its bad but that time i got antidepressants quick whereby i hope my symptoms will get better. i searched on the internet might be dyspexia. si if anyone is experiencing something similar or generally troubles with their intestines yk youre not alone. we are a lot struggling with a society that does not understand us. i always had the feeling that for people when you dont have something killing you like cancer its no big deal you are overreacting and complaining for nothing. cancer is terrible worse for most of them but our troubles count. especially when you cant enjoy a meal a party or just hanging out with friends because of that. gotta wait one week for the effects of my antidepressants well see. the only good thing is that it disappeared one time so it can disappear again. bless you guys,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 09:02:28 UTC,5,4,0.86,,,0,0
1j5j3ag,im tired of not having friends,just here to vent. i 29m have never had any real friends. ive always just had people that i know. now im at the point where i realize that i dont have anyone at all. i thought that i had friends at various points in my life but they never stuck around for one reason or another. they were only friends with me out of convenience meaning that they didnt have any of their actual friends around and buddied up to me to pass the time. then there were those who were only friends with me to get what they wanted out of me before ghosting me or flipping out when i stopped providing what they wanted and ditched me. those friends who wanted rides or money or favors that monopolized my time and resources to the point where trying to tell them that they were asking too much of me made them lash out. those friends who wanted everything from me from a listening ear to a walking atm but who wouldnt do nearly the same thing for me. those friends were some of the worst but honestly the worst ones were those who tried to buddy up to me because they felt bad that i was all by myself because friendships built out of pity have the least amount of respect for the one being pitied. honestly im tired of it. im tired of feeling and being alone in crowded rooms. im tired of not having anyone around who cares about me and actually wants me around. im tired of being made to feel like its a chore for others to talk to me. im tired of caring more about others than they do for me. im tired of being so lonely. i havent had any real social connections in years and its obviously starting to get to me. i just want to have people to talk to about random every day crap. or better yet i want to have people to have serious conversations with about the universe and life or whatever over a bonfire or in a random spot in the middle of the desert on a clear star filled night. i want to have people who dont look at me funny when i say we should go on a random adventure to a museum that i think looks cool or some gimmicky attraction that i found that looks like it would be fun. i like gimmicks and museums and want people around who arent going to call me weird for liking them and wanting to go experience them. i want someone to go fishing with who isnt going to say theyre bored every five minutes or tell me we should just go to a bar because its the same thing. its not the same thing and i dont drink. i just want to have people around who take as much interest in me as i do in them without calling me or my interests weird or creepy or boring or lame. i want to go to museums and attractions with people. i want to go on random adventures to random places maybe go randonauting or urban exploring theres plenty of places to see. i want to go fishing with people. i want to watch football and baseball with people maybe even go to a local game together. i want to have people wholl play basketball or badminton or pokémon go with me. i want to go bowling and to the arcade and to the putput spot with people. i want to play billiards with someone who isnt going to call me creepy for loving to play it. i want to drive around aimlessly listening to true crime podcasts or creepypastas creepsmcpasta specifically or just with people wholl share music with me and not call my taste in music weird or oldfashioned. i want to go have lunch in my car in the sonic stalls with someone dont know why it just sounds like itd be fun. and on that note i want to have someone whos willing to go try new food places with me. i want to have someone to talk to about anything and everything. i want to be able to talk to someone about whos the best robin or how anissa is the worst character in invincible even worse than immortal. i want to have someone to talk to about some random occult things that i read about or saw on the internet. i think itd be kinda fun to pull out the ouija board or some tarot cards or something. i want someone to share random fun facts with me as much as i like to share with them. i want to be tagged in random posts on social media or actually have someone acknowledge that we did something together or better yet have people wholl want to take pictures with me without telling me that i ruined the picture by smiling weird or just telling me that they dont like taking pictures with me. i want to have a barbeque by the pool in the summer maybe throw a football around in the street. or maybe have some random potluck and ill make some currywurst for people to try. i want people to teach me some of the languages that they speak or maybe want to learn one with me or ill teach them some german. honestly as long as i had someone around who would share with me what i share with them then that would be enough. looking back on what ive already written none of that would actually matter in comparison to just knowing that i had a friend. but writing this all out and venting just makes me feel pathetic. it makes me feel even worse than having my family question me when i go out because i dont have friends so why am i out. that hurts on its own but the vibe of desperation that this seems like feels worse than that. i dont know. ive gotten this far but it feels like none of it even matters and theres no point regardless. im just that person who doesnt have friends and its just one of those things that needs to be accepted even though it hurts. it is what it is. its really not like it matters anyway because if the rest of this year plays out how im expecting it to i wont be here by this time next year anyway so that just makes it easier i guess. so why not vent and ruminate for a while and see how i feel later on? maybe things will be different and ill feel differently. plus thinking about everything makes me think that im just better off alone regardless but even then it doesnt make the pain of that loneliness go away so at least having some type of outlet helps in its own way. its better than nothing and just keeping all of this bottled up at least.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 08:46:40 UTC,4,2,1.0,,,0,0

1j5iwrt,is my bf incapable to love?,weve been together for 10 months and living together since november splitting bills. my bf is autistic and i pretty much brush off many things to that but im starting to think he has no idea what love is. im 100 sure he thinks he loves me im helping him a lot and were basically the only people for each other in the whole country. its pretty comfortable for us to live together. but nothing besides his own thoughts and life is interesting to him. he speaks 99 of the time. he never shuts up ever. when i talk he interrupts me and when being called out says he cant understand when its the time for him to talk and when not. sometimes hell also tell me what i said was boring. can you truly love a person if you dont give a shit about anything else apart from yourself and your thoughts?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 08:32:49 UTC,1,4,1.0,,,0,0
1j5iuc7,feeling hopeless seeking guidance on funding for graduate studies,hello everyone i am a sudanese civil engineer currently residing in the uae. i am actively seeking scholarships assistantships or any financial aid. ive been admitted to asu for an ms in civil engineering water quality amp scarcity. studying in the usa has been my dream but securing funding has been extremely challenging especially given the current situation. i have contacted over 60 professors and applied to multiple universities but funding remains uncertain. with the ongoing conflict in sudan and limited opportunities i am struggling to find a way forward. i am afraid that even if i secure funding i may not be granted a visa due to the war in my country. is it possible to study there given these circumstances or should i give up? if anyone has insights or advice i would truly appreciate it.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 08:27:47 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j5itfh,im breaking up next weekend with my girlfriend of 2.5 years,throwaway cos yeah personal stuff. i 26m plan to break up with my girlfriend 26f next weekend. we have been together for around two and a half years and we just dont really have anything in common our conversations are frankly boring she is a lovely girl which is why this has been the hardest decision ive ever had to make but i think its for the best. i spoke to her a couple weeks ago about a few things that were bothering me and sex was one of them and it made me realise that it was a different level of priority for us for me its quite high and im very much experimental in that department and would love to try things but she just doesnt. and im not going to get her to do something shes not comfortable with or doesnt want to do. we also spoke about how id like to see more effort and enthusiasm during sex from her as i felt a bit like my pleasure wasnt that important which isnt a great feeling let me tell you and she hasnt really put any more effort into it minus the absolute bare minimum. if im completely honest im terrified. im scared of what the future will be scared that i wont find someone else scared about hurting her which is the last thing i want to do is hurt her but i also need to take care of my own happiness. this is my first proper relationship and girlfriend ive never had to break up with someone and im so scared. my minds still a bit mad trying to process my decision so sorry if this doesnt read very well. edit more things to get off my chest jesus sorry. i do still love her and this yoyo effect im feeling of wanting to break up then doubting has made me feel so numb scared and empty i feel so lost. each time my girlfriend messages me today it hurts so much i really do care for her but i just dont know if im doing what i did early on and ignoring things that obviously do bother me because ive got complacent.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 08:25:57 UTC,1,4,0.6,,,0,0
1j5ij2t,i wish i had ignored his suicide note,tldr i am a sex worker and i let a client get too obsessed. he threatened suicide when i ended things with him and i went to the police on the off chance he was serious. it turned out to just be another ploy to try and get me to talk to him. lets preface this with i am an independent sex worker. i do in person sex work by the hour and its my job because i enjoy it and it gives me a lot of financial security. my best friend celia also does sex work and we share notes about the job and even have the same clients on occasion. she met john first. john is an obese 300lb man early 30s and a high maintenance client. he was very recently divorced because he cheated on his high school sweetheart wife with another friend from high school. he left his wife only to have his new girlfriend leave him about a month later for another man. why did he cheat on his wife? because she had gained so much weight that he no longer found her attractive i saw photos of her she was barely overweight. he on the other hand nearly doubled his weight since they got married. john is a home inspector for an insurance company. he makes good money by inspecting a high volume of homes but part of the job is using all the data collected to write personalized reports on each home inspection. when john was married his wife did the reports for him this was illegal because the information is supposed to be confidential but he was able to get away with it because they lived together and she used his work pc to help him out. so he left his wife then his girlfriend of two months left him. he was desperate to get her back any which way and knew she needed money so he offered to pay her to do the reports for him which worked out because his wife was no longer willing to do them. he figured out a way to log into his work from her pc trained her up and used his position as her boss to make her spend as much time with him as possible so he could potentially win her back he would only ever pay her in person for example and coerce her into spending hours with him before he paid her the money. this isnt important to the story it just gives background information on his history of inappropriate relationships and manipulating women. in the meantime he started seeing escorts to fill the sexual void. eventually he met celia and very quickly fell into limerance. for the first time since his ex girlfriend left him john had a new woman to obsess over. he shared his whole life story with celia texted her all the time and visited her more often than he could afford. she found him exhausting to see he had strangled dick syndrome from a porn addiction and struggled to get off but would urge her to keep trying. he talked constantly about himself overshared about his childhood trauma and would stay longer than he paid for forcing her to have to kick him out each time. she set boundaries about him texting her so much and taking so much of her emotional energy but he kept breaking them. so she enlisted my help. i have a few more years experience under my belt and felt confident that i could handle his neediness. after she talked me up he agreed to meet me. the appointment was a success. i was able to work around his strangled dick problem and he began to see us both regularly. but it became obvious that he was obsessive and inappropriate. he talked about celia nonstop and shared personal details about their time together with me. he also shared private details about his exwife and exgirlfriend. when he saw celia he talked about me and overshared in a similar way. it made her very uncomfortable and she set boundaries around it. he didnt abide by the boundaries so she fired him. he was devastated... but i was able to distract him and help him process the heartbreak. he felt betrayed by her because she treated him as a client and he felt like he deserved better treatment. i gently defended her actions but not so much that it would offend him. by this point i was earning steady money seeing him so i didnt want to risk jeopardizing that cash flow. i could see that he needed the full girlfriend experience so i gave it to him. he was very insecure so i often needed to reassure him that he could count on me that i would be a stable person in his life so long as he kept paying my rates for time together. i allowed him to take me to dinner off the clock occasionally and texted him back on occasion i didnt get triggered by his incessant texting in the same way as celia. it worked out pretty decently for a few months. i felt like i was meeting his needs and he seemed happier and more stable. unfortunately my carefully set boundaries started to erode. he didnt see me as an escort anymore he saw me as a sugar baby... then as a girlfriend. he told me he loved me. often. he started celebrating anniversaries for us and booking me for holidays. i too found his company exhausting. the whining the complaining the bad decisions the love bombing the delusional thinking.... it started to be too much. i felt like i was wearing a thick mask while i was with him forcing myself not to show my disgust. i hated the way he bragged about how much money he made while breaking the rules to do it. i hated his nice guy syndrome and how entitled he felt to attention from women. i hated the way he would eat dairy despite being lactose intolerant. i hated the way he binged on mcdonalds after eating a large dinner with bottomless cokes. i hated the way he touched me and kissed me. i hated the self obsession and the victim mentality he had. i couldnt stand his inability to take any personal accountability in his life. i eventually learned that despite making over 300k a year he was completely maxed out in debt because he had a gambling addiction in addition to his sex addiction. he learned to count cards at the casino and managed to con a younger card counter i think he was only 21 into lending him tens of thousands of dollars to invest into being an advantage player at the casino. unfortunately john lacked discipline and lost everything on slot machines. to his credit he is planning to pay the kid back but learning about this made me incredibly nervous and i started to get the sense that i was in over my head. i hated the way that he would talk about being sexually abused as a child without warning in excruciating and disgusting detail. i hated that he would rather spend money he didnt have on escorts and gambling than see a therapist. i felt gross and drained for hours or even days after seeing him and would sometimes have to turn down other work because i didnt feel up to it. the last straw for me happened feb 16. we were supposed to see each other on valentines day but i fell ill with the flu a few days earlier. he complained every day while i was sick and pestered me dangling the money for my overnight fee over my head. he wasnt able to schedule another overnight until march so if i didnt see him by sunday i would lose out on the 2000. also he just really really really needed to get laid and if i didnt see him hed go see another escort. so still feverish and really fucking ill i let him come see me. its important to note that the first time he booked me for an overnight he touched me in my sleep. this is a hard no for me and i let him know. subsequent overnights he did not cross that boundary. but this night i woke up again to him assaulting my body in my sleep. my heart was racing and i felt so violated that i wanted to cry. i didnt want major confrontation so i just pushed his hands away and told him i was still trying to sleep. but i spent the rest of the night on high alert only able to doze for short periods of time. after that i knew it was time to stop seeing him. because we planned our appointments for each month up to two months in advance it did not seem appropriate to simply ghost him. i struggled to find the right way to end it. i knew he was obsessively attached to me and it would be chaotic no matter how gently i tried to let him go. then an opportunity presented itself. he saw another escort and fell asleep in his car in her parking lot. he woke up to the police questioning him and searching his car and phone. he cracked under pressure and admitted to paying for sexual services. he told them about me and about her. they chose not to arrest him or press charges but when he related all the information to me i decided to seize this excuse to stop seeing him. i told him that for my safety i did not want him to ever contact me again. at first he said he understood and said goodbye. and then for the next five days he bombarded me with texts and emails. he also sent youtube videos of him crying and begging snot dripping. or drunk and begging and crying. then sober and matter of factly laying out the reasons why my fears about his interaction with the cops was unfounded. more texts more emails from different accounts. i responded to none of it. it made me feel even more disgusted by him honestly. i hoped that he would eventually tire and just go the fuck away. then he emailed me a suicide note. i didnt receive it until nearly four hours after he sent it because i was busy working. it stated that by the time i received it it was already too late to stop him. but then three hours after the email he sent me a youtube video suicide note which seemed fishy. it has my already frazzled nerves in shambles. i worried that i could somehow be found responsible if he was found dead and they traced the cause back to me. i eventually gave in and called the police. i posed as a girlfriend and i hoped it would be a one and done call but they kept calling me back for more information i knew his address and full name and vehicle and they wanted copies of his suicide letters. they tracked him down and it turned out he was absolutely fine. he just wanted me to talk to him and was willing to do anything to make it happen. i guess the cop successfully conveyed to him that he needed to stop harassing me because the emails texts and videos stopped. he did message my friend but she told him the same thing the cop did that he had to stop harassing me through her or else wed go to the police. i wish i had ignored his suicide note. i feel tricked and im still angry about

1j5i1na,my sisters now exboyfriendbaby daddy was my abuser.,my sister f 30 has been with her baby daddym 30 for about 15 years now. hes very much an abusive manipulative disgusting person that feeds off of peoples weaknesses. theyve been together quite literally half her life since she was in high school and at the time i was about 12 years old. at first he was an amazing brother in law and did all the cool stuff that comes with the brother territory. then once i reached 14 all hell broke loose. i wont go into too much detail but my sisters baby daddy sexually assaulted me from from the ages of 14 until i was almost 17. her and i had a huge falling out after the fact due to her denying it ever happened even though she was there for a few of the occurrences. hes a very violent man and has even attempted to murder a misbehaving dog by strangulation that he had owned. i always had a sneaking suspicion that he had been laying his hands on my sister but after two days ago my suspicions have been confirmed. a few days ago i got a call from my nanaf 71 stating that the baby daddy had beaten my sister pretty badly. he blackened her eye busted her lip attempted to strangle herhe left hand prints on her neck and beat her in the stomach with a broom handle. in a panic she managed to get away escaping to a neighbor womans house a few blocks away. after he tried searching for her in his pickup truck he then called my father and stated she was missing. he even tried filing a missing person report for her. unfortunately for him my sister had already contacted the authorities and notified them of the attempted murder. the cops escorted her the next day to get her two children from him and shes currently in a womens shelter until my nana can get to her. i dont wish what she went through on anyone and i hate that she even had to endure any of that. i can only imagine the turmoil and sorrow she feels. especially having been with someone for so very long. the problem im struggling with is setting aside my pride and being there for her in her time of need. we havent spoken in 5 years. at this point were two very different people. i think back to me being that scared 14 year old that no one believed or cared to stand up for. i had messages and physical marks on me at the time and the adults failed me. i know she was a victim too but its hard for me to forget her part as well. any advice would be much appreciated but please be kind. thanks reddit.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 07:28:13 UTC,94,18,0.94,,content warning violencedeath,0,0
1j5i0en,i really dont see any point in living past eighteen,life is so expensive nowadays and it feels like no matter how hard i try i will never be able to afford the kind of life i want. moving out seems like an impossible goal and even if i manage to get my own place i worry that i will still be struggling just to make ends meet. when i think about the future all i can picture is an endless cycle of stress waking up going to work barely making enough to feed myself coming home exhausted and then doing it all over again the next day. it feels like i will be stuck in survival mode with no time or money to actually live. i want more than that. i want to travel to see the world to experience things beyond the daily grind but i cannot afford to. i am happy right now but i know childhood does not last forever and that terrifies me. what happens when it is gone? what happens when i am on my own facing a future that feels like nothing but work and struggle? i do not want to live just to survive. i want to spend the one life i have being truly happy right up until the moment it ends but right now i cannot see a future where that is possible. i think i might just join the military so i can feel something and if that goes well i could get free college. but i dont know everything about the future seems so unappealing. why am i a rainbow child and why did the condom have to break i dont want to be here.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 07:25:40 UTC,1,2,0.67,,,0,0
1j5hrwp,my mom always prioritizes my sister in the weirdest ways,preface this happened around the holidays which is the only time im ever around my mom. we have little to no contact outside of when i visit my siblings. i 26f told my mom that i think my boyfriend 28m is going to propose to me. she responded with can you wait so i can recoup some money after your sisters wedding? not a congratulations im happy for you nothing positive at all. i immediately shut down and stopped talking about it. its been on my mind a lot recently because my sister is no longer in that relationship he was an abusive alcoholic and my mom doesnt understand why its still bothering me. i would never allow her to even attempt to pay for it because she would hold it over my head forever. she doesnt attempt to speak to me or have a relationship with me she doesnt speak to him at all she would try to control everything about it. she honestly probably wont even be invited at this point but it deeply bothered me that it was somehow made about my sister. this is the same woman that didnt tell me that my cat had passed after having him for 10 years and refused to even talk about it or acknowledge it when i was upset about it. she has been unkind my entire life but like.. what?????,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 07:08:27 UTC,20,6,0.96,,,0,0
1j5hng3,weird dynamic with my ex,ok! ive just gotta get this off my chesti am still pretty good friends with my ex as we have know each other since 8th grade and we are on good standing. see the problem is that when we broke up it was because he was making some choices that were really not great for our relationship. so i have gone on several dates as a now single woman after 4 years of dating him and i feel guilty. like i feel like even though i am single and i have broken up with him it feels like im cheating or lying by omission because i have gone on dates and made out with other guys. like i still care for my ex but unless he can work out his problems i just cant see a future with him romantically which sucks. i feel like me trying to sort out my feelings and date for fun would crush him if he found out ive kissed other men as i had only had one other partner before him. ugh its been eating me alive anyways i just had to get that out to the world and not keep it inside anymore.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 06:59:44 UTC,1,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j5hlsy,i hate myself and feels like ive given up without trying,im a 23yearold guy turning 24 in august and i feel like a complete failure. depression has been a constant in my life and im pretty sure theres something seriously wrong with me mentally. ive never sought professional help never in my life. instead ive coped by abusing drugs like mdma lsd and and ket weed every single day since i was 14. its been my crutch but its not working anymore. ive never had a real girlfriend though thats not even my main issue. the real problem is i cant stay consistent with anything working out holding a job nothing. today i was supposed to get up and go to work but i just couldnt be bothered. i bailed. it feels like my brain is fighting against me. im suicidal 247. when i hit these lows they last about three months then i get a month of normal before it crashes again. right now im in one of those dark phases and its so bad im genuinely debating whether to end my life today. i dont know what to do anymore. my bodys a mess too i go from fat to skinny and fat to skinny again stuck in this weird in between because of how depression screws with me. ive felt like this my whole life and im terrified itll never change. im getting older lifes getting more harder and serious and everythings so damn expensive. i have no ambitions no goals. i never went to school. i blow all my money im in debt and i live alone. i feel like a corrupt soul. i say i believe in god but i dont really. im a fake religious person a fake human. my friends are starting to ditch me because of how i am and i dont blame them. ive had enough. i feel like death is the only way out of this hell because i cant imagine dragging this on until im 28 35 or older. its already unbearable. my moms tried to help me so many times but shes given up too. i always end up back at square one no matter what. i hate myself so much. i guess im posting this because im desperate. has anyone been here and gotten out? i dont even know where to start.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 06:56:19 UTC,3,1,0.81,,,0,0

1j5gnd5,i survived cancer and no one around me really cares,not to sound whiny or anything. im in my early 20s and it wasnt a you have 6 months to live situation. super high rate of surviving and all that. i finished my treatment last fall and now im just here stuck at home recovering. im alright physically. and i dont expect people to put their lives on pause just because i got cancer. but its like i beat it and the moment just passed. i know its not that important to other people and in the grand scheme of things its just a blip in a whole lifetime. for me though im missing out on a whole year of college and it was going to be my last one. im at home and depressed feeling mentally worse than i have in a while. im covered in scars on my torso that will never go away. im happy im alive and all that but i guess i didnt realize that cancer just isnt a big deal if you live or its not one of the more well known ones. ive just got no one to talk to about it i guess. in a literal sense i do my friends and my family. but not really. they dont care that much and then i feel like im dragging it out. so i just finished some late night cleaning and now im feeling a bit sorry for myself. a little pathetic and im not quite sure what to do now. anyways congrats to me for beating cancer! party_popper,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 05:52:45 UTC,105,60,0.97,,,0,0

1j5fwwv,my girlfriend is beyond stupid and i feel like i might have to end the relationship,ok. when i first met my girlfriend i noticed she sometimes made misjudgements but i didnt think much of it. now that we been together 2 years i realize how stupid she is. that might sound harsh but thats the only word i can think of. we will go downtown to some place she wants to go and she will walk down a street and be like oh wait wrong way then walk down another street and be like oh no wrong way then walk down another street and be like oops wrong way again. its horrible she has no sense of direction and i feel so stupid following her around. she also talks in circles which makes me so angry. like for an example yesterday she asked me do you want a burrito for dinner? then i replied we dont have the ingredients for a burrito so im going to eat the food we have in the house. she then asks oh so you dont want a burrito? so i thought maybe she bought ingredients for a burrito so i said sure ill have a burrito. she then says ok but we dont have the ingredients for a burrito. like yes i know that. her stupidity makes me treat her worse which i hate because i dont want to be rude to people but sometimes the way she talks and acts just infuriates me. i also feel more slow and held down when im with her. like when she makes a dumb decision im usually around her so i have to help her correct her mistake. anytime i do something alone i feel a huge wave of happiness go through my body because i dont feel held back from her behaviour. overall shes a good person but i honestly dont think i can continue a relationship with her. her misjudgments cause me so much financial loss and general stress.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 05:06:36 UTC,6089,287,0.9,,,0,0

1j5fth6,i hate my parents for not letting me have surgery for pectus carinatum.,first of all i want to apologize for my poor english since im doing this through a translator. im a 19yearold guy who has had pectus carinatum his whole life. it has brought me a lot of teasing and stares and even though i have the mildest case i have a small bananashaped protrusion on my sternum. ive wanted surgery since i was 14. as a first option they wanted me to wear a compression brace for a year which is complete nonsense. i knew it wouldnt fix what i have and even the doctor said so. i fought for years to get surgery until one day they took me to the subcapital to see a doctor. the doctor told me it was a very mild case and that the surgery was very simple they would cut two cartilages push the sternum inward and that was it. this happened in june 2024. i was very excited about the idea of having a normal chest. my experience with this condition has been horrible and has caused me a lot of insecurity. every time i wear a tshirt the lump is noticeable making me look much fatter than i actually am. ive been training for five years and its horrible to see how i cant make progress in my chest because this damn protrusion sticks outits all ive seen in the mirror for five years. going back to what i was saying my parents postponed the surgery until 2025. i got angry with them and gave them an ultimatum either i get the surgery or i leave the house. i want to clarify that this was the only thing i was asking for the only thing i wanted. im the youngest child and i have a 29yearold sister who is studying her second degree because she realized that the first one wouldnt get her a job. my father has always helped her with her apartment and university expenses. ive always known she was the favorite and i wasnt asking for muchjust this surgery. today we went to see a doctor in our city and instead of agreeing with the previous doctor he said they would have to break my abdomen cut all the cartilage and insert a prosthesis. i suspect this was all planned because my father is a doctor and i have a feeling he talked to this doctor to make me change my mind or to have an excuse to say no. i walked home because i was so angry at them. ive been fighting for this surgery for about five years and they found the perfect excuse to deny it. tonight at dinner i ate in my room. im so tired of themthey are the most vile cruel and arbitrary people i know. i hate them for making me go through my entire adolescence and now my adulthood with this lump in my chest just because they dont want me to have surgery. they have no idea how much ive suffered or how much i wish with all my heart to die. i wish i could just wake up one day and no longer exist in this horrible world. i hate the parents i got and i hate my sister for being the favorite. if i could id take a gun and blow my brains out so i wouldnt have to endure this anymorebut i will make them pay. as soon as i get a job ill leave this place and never speak to them again. when theyre old ill put them in a nursing homeand im being generous. i should let them rot in their own filth. ill update if theres any news.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 05:01:13 UTC,25,1,0.87,,,0,0

1j5ez5s,i treated my for a broken handwrist as a kid and didnt knowrealize it until i was older very long read oof,i honestly really should probably talk abt this bc it honestly was actually pretty tramuatizing enough that i feel like i may have locked away some memories of what happened bc of just how awful some of the experience was my memory is somewhat spotty bc of how scary it all was but ill try my best to explain my friend had a halloween party at her house we decided to play something that involved running which was a rather stupid decision as everything was slippery and dark outside i was running nearon ground that was steeply raised up a bit for a buliding to be bulit flat on i slipped and fell despite the mud when i instinctively reached out to brace myself by putting my hand out towards the top of the small slope i got hurt really really badly i had never been in such pain before i dont remember how quickly it arrived exactly but it was pretty quick to show up i started crying a soon as the pain hit and the girl i had been running behind took notice and from what i can remember asked if i was ok the other girls i was playing with eventually noticed and the escorted me to the house and to my friends mother who is a vetvet tech she wrapped it in blue vet wrap in the kitchen and asked if i wanted to go to the doctor and child me refused out if fear of possibly having to get surgery and probably bc i didnt want to inconvenience anyone the vet wrap was uncomfortable and irritating but honestly the splint i got for a broken foot abt 2 years ago was worse and it was by an er doc too and while child me had to experience that awful splint the vet wrap did make my hand feel better i felt like i could pick it up and move it safely so i ended up staying inside sitting on one of their couches in the living room and resting my arm on the arm supports watching tv with my friends mom i wasnt rly interested in the show but that was the least of my worries then i think at one point she brought me food like a hotdog or smth which had ketchup bc my autistic ass wouldnt eat meat unless ot had ketchup on it the other girls went outside after everything calmed down somewhat tho my friend stayed a bit longer from what remember to make sure i was ok eventually they came back inside for an event i forget if it was planned or started bc it was dark and i was stuck inside basically it was a game where someone would get wrapped on toilet paper to become a mummy they included me in it by loosely wrapping parts of my armhand that i was willing to move and then we eventually all went home i dunno when any of this next stuff happens exactly but ill try to explain it in order i was cyberschooled then and at first i was fine... until i needed to write something im right handed and my right hand was the one that was injured i remember my mom yelling at me because i refused to use my right hand and i think i asked if she could write for me she told me to use it and i remember crying and saying i cant! i cant! i tried to move it even slightly in order to try obeying what she said but the pain was terrible horrendous unbearable i cant think of words that can extensively describe how much pain i was in i dont quite remember it all but i think when i tried to use my left hand to write i was yelled at too and my mom minimized my pain by saying smth along the lines of it isnt that bad and i was also condescendingly asked if i wanted to go the doctor which i again refused fearing surgery and also bc having my parents yell at me made me upset all this time i remember i still had that blue vet wrap on my hand was shaking and in so much pain i forget if my mom did the usual let me feel it thing but if she did i most definitely refused and probably yanked it away based on the fact i still had that vet wrap on i think it was probably the next day i was allowed to write with my left hand but not without being scolded i remember writing down things in notebooks for fun with my left hand and i even decided that a character id made had my left hands handwriting i eventually got better writing with my left hand and honestly really had fun with it while i wrote and did things with my left hand i also did not use my right hand or bend my wrist at least i did as little as possible i kept on using the vet wrap to stablize it until it wouldnt stick no more then i found some wrap i has gotten from when i sprained my leg and so i it instead and remembered how i treated my sprained leg used that was refrence for resting my hand and also didnt move it bc it was painful i dont remember much else abt the recovery i think i stopped wrapping it and started using my right hand again as soon as the pain lessoned which probably was after like a month or two perhaps? ik it takes longer for a broken bone to recover but the pain does go away pretty quickly honestly i remember my mom expecting me to recover from my sprain in about a week and was upset i still refused to use it and instead write with my left hand i did keep on writing with my left hand sometimes for awhile after that just for fun which ironically probably helped my right hand recover lol i dont quite know how long after it was but i think it was a decent chunk after but within the same year i once again slipped and fell and i forget which handi landed on but based on the pain and how caught myself the same way again i think it was my right which i once again assumed was a sprain but only a minor one so i again pulled out the wrap i had and i think for abt a day or 3 days wrapped my hand i remember not having much pain and wondering if it still needed wrapped the next day but i still ended up keeping it on i think and until i was a teen it never hit me that the pain i feltin my bones was not a normal sprain thing but probably a broken bone and it really hit me after a horse broke my foot 2 years ago that yea that probably wasnt a sprain... bc like it was while less pain that pain i got from my broken foot felt literally like a lesser version of the pain i felt in my hand when i was a kid tbh im not completely sure if i did break my hand as ive never rly had it inspected for past breaks unlike my foot it doesnt rly act up when the weather changes or from overuse etc at least i think so? i never rly took notice of anything like thay as a kid because i was never aware or looking for anybpain related to broken bones so im open to anyone suggesting its something else not for legitimate medical advice as well ik i shouldnt get it from here and its already healed just out of curiosity i wonder if it was like a pinched nerve maybe but it didnt feel like one at all ive unfortunately had and continue of have pinched nerves in my neck upsidedown_face,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 04:11:27 UTC,2,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j5etqw,i realize now i loved my first bf,strange title i know but i dated this guy in high school and at the time i didnt think i was in love with him. the thing is that every guy ive been with since him hasnt measured up. hes the guy i compare every other man to. hes the only person in my 31 years of life that actually made an effort. he always respected me and my boundaries. he accepted everything about me. hes the only guy to actually plan a date with me rather than putting in the minimum effort of asking me which restaurant i want to go to. i broke up with him because i didnt feel like i was good enough for him. he was on the football team and i was an awkward emo kid. i blew him off at first because i had been asked out by another football player as a joke a couple weeks prior. so for our entire relationship i just kept waiting for him to reveal that it had all been a joke too. my first real kiss was an uncomfortable situation that felt pressured and forced and i know that had it been with him it would have been so natural. i lost my virginity to someone who had zero respect for me who broke up with me because his dad said he should play the field. itbshould have been him. i married someone abusive and ended up divorced by the time i was 27 and now i have a child with someone who i live with and still only see on weekends most of the time because he would rather play videogames all night and sleep all day than actually put in effort with me and our child. hs bf and i hooked up years ago when we were between relationships and i psyched myself out again thinking i wasnt good enough and ended up blowing up on him over something that could have been easily talked through. i know that we are both adults and therefore totally different people now but i find myself thinking quite often weather the new him would like who ive become. im so badly damaged by a string of toxic men when i had the perfect guy for me and screwed it up multiple times. hes my one that got away and its my fault because i pushed him away.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 04:02:45 UTC,0,0,0.4,,,0,0

1j5ecgo,am i a horrible person,i agonize over my life. i am officially married but basically no relationship or sex in about 5 years. my husband is bipolar and treats me like crap even though i am the sole supporter in a tropical country. i have a business and work my ass off to support my legal husband and 23 year old daughter. she works now so not so much support. while in my home country i stay with a friend of the opposite sex and pay rent albeit not anywhere near market rent. when i am in my home country i pay my way. but my friend definitely likes me. he made advances on me and because he did so much for me i almost felt to secure my life i needed to reciprocate or i would be on the street. my husband has never shown me he really cares. he is bipolar and i was emotionally and physically abused for years. i met my friend and moved in. i run a business in my home country and travel back a lot to tend to biz. i never wanted a relationship with anyone but felt guilted into it or i would be on the street. i could not afford an airbnb and needed to stay with my friend. well he made advances and me feeling pressured went along with it to secure my and my familys well being. i care about this person a lot but am not willing to give up my life in my tropical country. i have 5 dogs that i cannot take to my home country and could not afford to live there. so i let the relationship continue. i feel major guilt every single day of my life. i do not want to lead this other relationship on but know i will be homeless when i go back. i broke it off because the guilt was too much but he still is hanging on hoping i come back. i want to live in my home in my tropical country with little to no stress with my dogs. my husband and i have separate rooms and do not have any intimacy for at least 5 years. my issue is my husband has worked really hard to improve. he is an asshole but less and less. my friend in my home country is a good guy but very insecure. i do not want to hurt anyone but it is inevitable. he does things for me without me asking and then holds it over my head. i am so torn. he lives in a dog free building so no way to take my babies there. i dont know what to do. i never wanted this chaos. my life is upside down. i want to just do myself in and end it but my two kids 23 and 30 are my best friends and their lives would be destroyed so thats just not an option. i hate my life so much. i want my kids and my dogs. i wish my life was easy.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 03:36:27 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0

1j5bn88,my uncles girlfriend is tearing my family apart,so im from a very closeinit family we love each other a lot and have always been together. my grandma had three children uncle a uncle b and my dad and then grandpa had a child with another woman uncle c. this is about uncle b. i dont like his current gf. she immediately trauma dumped on my grandma to gain sympathy then proceeded to imply she was old and getting forgetful and clumsy grandmas perfectly fine shes as healthy as they come then she brought along her son she had with another man who i have no trouble with. she herself isnt bad but the way she and her son behave is weird because its like theyre not a part of our family they just kinda live there and i have the feeling that she wants to kick my grandma out and have the house to herself which isnt possible because its decided 5050 between uncle a and uncle b but shes tried to buy the other half to uncle a who firmly refused because once they both pass away the house is mine. the worst part about all this is my uncles behavior since she arrived. he works with my mom at a local restaurant nothing fancy its main target are the broke college students nearby but they get paid well. my mom had a cousin of hers working as a waiter there and he wasnt the best but hey acceptable but uncle b decided to start saying that he was more trouble that its worth and that his girlfriends son should work there my mom firmly refused. my grandma has anxiety of going out on her own for years now and since she only lives with uncle b and his girlfriend she constantly relies on him to get medicine or to just go out and hes been getting extremely rude with her for no reason whenever she asks to go out yelling and saying he needs his own time too. we threw a party for grandmas birthday a while ago and youd expect him to sit with his mother but no he went and sat with his gfs family completely ignoring grandma. i fell and got hurt pretty badly a while ago and everyone called me and asked of i was okay but him? not a peep. my last straw came a few days ago my mom suffers really bad anxietypanic attacks sometimes and he caused her one. long story short he missed work without calling in advance and my mom had to cover his shift and then tried to reprehend him because shes the manager of the restaurant. he completely flipped out and said something along the lines of leave it doesnt matter gfs name can replace you and my mom got really mad and said i dont want to have anything to do with you as work or as family youre never stepping foot into my house again. now i love my uncle but his gf has completely ruined everything i dont like her i see her and i feel angry but i cant do anything because im forced to interact with her and youd think my lack of warmth would tell her to not talk to me but she talks to me as if she was my aunt shes not and i genuinely wish i could just make her go away and make things go back to normal. i want my family back.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 01:15:51 UTC,5,1,0.86,,,0,0

1j5b24x,i desperately want to hook up with my coworker again.,so towards the end of summer last year my coworker 26m and i 24f went on a date and ended up fooling around a few times after that. i had had a huge crush on him for a while and was so excited to finally go out with him. the date was super nice but the hookups were unexpectedly really good. i dont have a lot of experience whereas he does and he knew that and he let me take control of the pace and the things we did which made me feel comfortable enough to try stuff with him i hadnt done before. unfortunately life stuff happened all at once and he ended things like two weeks after the first date. i was crushed. i was hurt disappointed confused and quite honestly very sexually frustrated. i really really liked him and we had gotten very intimate very quickly with the expectation that there would be a lot more to come and then all of a sudden it was over. i felt like i was left high and dry. the thing is a couple of months ago we basically ended up confessing over text that we both still wanted each other in that way and almost made plans to meet up again but more life stuff got in the way and we both agreed that it would still be a bad idea to do anyway. but now every time i see him at work i cant help but think about the things we said and did and how much i want to do it again. the fact that i know that a part of him still desires me in that way is kind of driving me crazy. i could torture myself overanalyzing every normal conversation every glance every little interaction. it would very likely be a terrible idea to do it again and it would probably end worse than it did the first time but the feelings just wont go away no matter how much i remind myself of these things. i am down so so bad for this guy.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 00:46:54 UTC,0,15,0.5,,,0,0
1j5ati4,exposing a narcissist,so i recently exposed a narcissist but my situation is very different and i cant find anything online about this situation. so i came here for potential outcomes. so back in 2023 of march i started talking to this guy and he knew me from my childhood we were not best friends we just saw each other in passing during our middle school years and it went well at first. it only lasted two weeks while we were getting to know each other i got on his ig and saw this girl constantly posting on his page but he never paid her any mind and of course i asked and he denies it. but he must have sensed that i was hot on his tail so he decided to end things but still wanted to be friends even though we were never friends but i just said ok. what he didnt know is that i knew i was blocked after i questioned him about the girl on ig so i made a fake page to see what was up. and even though he said he wanted to end things he was still keeping in touch with me. even though im blocked on his ig so in april 2023 i saw him with that girl and he she got him to move down there with her. he is originally from my city and this girl lives in the dmv area. and with me investigating i realized that its a money thing so basically this guy is a prostitute she buys him stuff and he agrees to be her bf. so of course i wanted revenge but i wanted to wait until it was unexpected so for a whole year i gathered information on this girl and realized she may be a narcissist. with my digging on this girl i got her phone number driver license address email you name it i got it. and i tucked it away. so in march of 2024 i made a fake number and pretended that i knew her from one of the colleges she went to but i told her that i wanted to stay anonymous. and she went for it and all i did was expose her bf for being with me. i also wanted to add that had i not been hot on his tail he would have continued to date me. and when i found out about the girl i cut all communication with him and he found a way to contact me and wanted me back and i told him no. he even told me he never wanted us to stop talking but he needed help from this girl and i had all that in the screenshots. and you best believe i sent them screenshots to her when i was hiding behind the fake number. this girl really wanted to know who i was so i decided to give her a call and actually reveal myself and we were on the phone for 27 mins. mind you i recorded our conversation as well because i dont trust this bitch. but while we were on the phone she talked bad about her bf and her bf family and i did defend the family because i actually know them. because the city we are from is small. and at one point in time i was close with the guys cousin. she said really bad things about the bf mom too. and i didnt like that so i spoke up and i think she could tell i wasnt going for any of her lies because i knew she was lying. and im sure she didnt like that. i actually got off the phone with her because she wouldnt let me go. so the day after i spoke to the girl her bf called me screaming at me and accusing me of all these things i didnt even say. i couldnt even get a word in but i knew she was going to lie so i wasnt tripping because in my head i was going to get my lick back. fuck this hoe. the guy wasnt even mad that i hurt gf feelings he was mad that i lied on his family and said bad things about him. which i didnt say anything bad about him or his family. so after i took a verbal beating from this guy i just said cool. but i wasnt done yet. so i waited for about six months so now we are in september 2024 and from march of 2024 to september 2024 i kept my eye on them and i watched her crumble because she is very transparent on the internet and the bf broke up with her while she begged for him back because he realized that she lied on me and she must have found me on social media because she changed everything about herself to mimic me. mind you when i spoke to her in march of 2024 she claims that he begs her but social media says otherwise. and between march of 2024 to september of 2024 this girl and her friends and her momma started to bother me because apparently im the reason why her bf wont speak to her and i still keep calling her bf and pulling him away from her but i havent seen that man since march of 2023 nor have i spoke to him the only time i spoke to him was in march of 2024 and thats because he yelled at me. so in september of 2024 i reached out to him i unblocked him on ig in case you are wondering he did block me first on ig but unblocked me on ig to get in contact with me because i had him block on everything else then when he asked for a second chance and i told him no i blocked him on ig and he been on that list since september of 2024 and then i blocked him again because he is a dick and sent him all the details of the conversation i had with the gf. i even revealed to him that i was behind the fake number but he told me to leave him alone so i said ok bet and changed my number and reblocked him on ig. but what i banked on was how much he liked me so i knew he was going to read and listen to all the things i sent and within three days he started calling my fake number because he couldnt get in contact with me because i changed my real number so i deleted my fake number and got rid of my social media account because he had his family look for me too. he also offered to send me money to talk to him but i declined. and of course im still watching this all play out on my fake pages and again because she is so transparent on social media she is having a breakdown because he now knows the truth and she can no longer lie on me to him at least. but he is stupid anyway because why would you believe a liar with no proof but i guess because she is a narcissist and the guy isnt good at setting boundaries. i never been involved with a narcissist well i dont think i have been and i think its because im too outspoken and i have no problem getting into a fights. i promise you this is not what the fuck you want but overall im a pretty peaceful young lady if i do say so myself. anywho this girl is upset that not only is he furious with her but also his family is happy that someone was able to finally expose her for the liar and manipulator that she is i didnt know that his family didnt like her but apparently she plays victim and uses this guys insecurities and her money so she can get her way and this relationship was going on for years. im basically the hero. but i wasnt done with this bitch yet so i got my black ass on twitter and put her on blast so much so she lost a lot of followers on social media and her momma is off of social media completely because her momma was bothering me too. and i did this a few weeks ago me exposing this girl on twitter. so now im satisfied. but i wanted to know what happens when you expose a narcissist? i wasnt the one being manipulated but it was like i was the defender of someone who was being manipulated. and i came here to see if i could get any info because i couldnt find anything.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 00:35:30 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j5am4f,getting my messages with my groomer forensically checked tomorrow. im terrified.,after countless of procrastinating i ended up telling my mom i was sexually exploited by a man many years older than me. she was honestly very supportive and let me go on with the police investigation. tomorrow im getting my messages forensically checked between me and him and oh god am i shitting myself. the messages i had with him were very sexual and i feel guilty as i kind of just let everything happen as i liked the attention. i know everything will be okay as it is apart of their job but it still scares me that someone will be checking these very intimate messages. theres also the fact that someones gonna have my phone for a while and will be able to check my stuff which is also making my heart pound. for anyone who went through a similar experience with their phone being forensically checked howd it go?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 00:25:36 UTC,59,6,0.96,,,0,0

1j59s2n,influencer marketing agencies are a scam i worked for 3 of the biggest ones,i worked at three of the biggest influencer marketing agencies over the last decade and now that i dont its finally safe for me to speak the truth without risk to my career i need to expose that whole industry as a scam and no one is talking about it.. influencer marketting agencies make almost all their money not from sponsorships but from influencers paying them monthly fees to find them sponsorships that never happen. i was shocked each time i got a new job at a new influencer marketing agency to discover they all work the same way colleagues who mentioned it were fired or made redundant. its kind of like a pyramid scheme... out of thousands of influencers paying monthly subscription fees almost no sponsorships actually happened in the years i was there. all of our workload was dedicated to finding more influencers to sign up rather than sponsorship companies. think about it why would we need sign ups in the first place if we can find sponsors? wed obviously take a cut of sponsorship as that would make more money right??!! whats going on is dishonest amp takin advantage of the poor. most people think that a large following of 500k followers makes that person wealthy. the reality is that 99 of people with 500k followers on insta and tiktok and in many cases youtube shorts make nothing. ive worked with influencers sleeping in cars couchsurfing living below the poverty line for years incredulous to the fact they arent making anything while my colleagues persuaded them to continue building a following and that sponsors were just around the corner. we would be told to persuade these people to by dangling carrots like this. many of them worked 20 hours a day to build a following often from uplifting or positive content and werent narcissists it is not a pleasant life and i knew of so many like this. i dont like how the industry is taking advantage of these people. websites like socialblade are hilarious the number of times ive seen them claim people are making 500k per year but in reality theyre earning nothing... it happens all the time. the key is that most audiences arent monetisable no matter how big they are and the ones that are monetisable e.g. technical topics are nigh on impossible to persuade sponsors to bite because theyre all so stuck in the past they think of social media as something free and will only pay to advertise on tv or via traditional routes. to make things worse 99 of companies reaching out just want free advertising. they offer exposure or a cheap free product and refuse to pay. they all think that someone with a large social media following is a philanthropist millionaire or can eat free products didnt work full time to build that following and doesnt need income. meanwhile marketing agencies exploit this situation by selling influencers false hope and taking their money with no return. it has to be biggest public perception vs. reality mismatch ive ever seen.. on such a grand scale. no one is talking about this. agencies wont talk about it because their income comes from maintaining the lie. influencers themselves wont talk about it as they fear it might destroy their chances of getting a sponsor in future which is never going to happen!!. so i had to get this off my chest now that i dont work for them anymore. im frankly amazed these companies havent been shut down. im sorry but i cant name myself or the companies for obvious reasons but theyre all the same afaik and i cant give examples of specific social media accounts for similar reasons unfortunately. therefore you dont have to believe me on this but i speak the truth amp just happy to get this off my chest. my advice to you if youre unable to find sponsors for social media following dont waste any more time on it. views cant pay your bills. dont waste your life.. dont trust any social media marketting agency that requires a monthly subscription fee from you if they are genuine theyll operate on a percentage of sponsorship deals that they obtain for you not a monthly fee from you dont trust when anyone tells you youre just marketting wrong its impossible to have no income on 500k followers they dont know what theyre talking about unfortunately. most influencers even in the 500k braket make nothing but none will admit it for fear of it sabotaging their future chances. spend your time reskilling to do something else that will make a living dont fall for this scam. even monetisable accounts with monetizable topics are very hard to get sponsors for thats why so many dont have a sponsor for years. dont fall for the if i get a big following i will automatically find ways to make an income trap there. off my chest!,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 23:45:44 UTC,17,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j59b23,im tired of people who dont even make decisions in their own life trying to make mine.,throw away account so no one sees this. i have been working really hard the last 5 years or so to improve my life. a little background about me i come from a lowincome below poverty line house hold. grew up in housing during my childhood. majority of my family including cousins are either on social assistance housing drug addicts alcoholic ect. 6 or 7 years ago i was on social assistance myself. i didnt finish highschool. i was drinking daily. ended up in an abusive relationship. managed to get a cleaning job. since then ive gotten my ged partially went through college ended up building a career before i completed college am now a program manager on my way to making 90k a year in a field i love that feels like im making a difference in peoples lives in a happy loving fulfilling relationship where i live with my partner we plan to buy a house soon and are thinking about marriage and kids. i have a car. ive essentially hit all of the life goal milestones i wanted to hit by the time i was 30 and more i just turned 30 a few weeks ago. ive been to therapy ive been on a good medication for my mental health ive done the work. i feel like my life is finally on the right track. because of this ive finally been able to shift my focus to more shallow or less important things that have been kinda low on my radar. first let me say i love myself not in a self centered kind of way but i appreciate that im resilient goal oriented determined am empathetic to peoples experiences and i have a lot of love to give. and i have a lot of respect and compassion for myself just as i do for others. with that being said my appearance has always been something thats bothered me. ive always had bad skin i gained quite a bit of weight over the last 4 years and im just not in a place where i feel good about how i look. so ive decided this year thats what im going to work on. ive bought more professional clothes started my skin journey to help with my skin texture and acne scars and redness. and planning on getting my teeth fixed. getting a good hair regime. and controversial i decided id try ozempic. my insurance is covering it so essentially its like why not? why wouldnt i give this thing a try to support me in losing weight and feeling better about my appearance. its not that i think im ugly i know im not i just feel like i havent really taken care of myself and im working on it. anyway long story short i feel like im getting some much push back randomly now. and the more i think of it the more i realize how much push back ive gotten generally on decisions ive made. my dad once said how will you live on your own your on welfare this was 7 years ago before i met my boyfriend and 3 months before i got a fulltime job as a cleaner and my own apartment many times as ive changed jobs to move up and learn more ive gotten arent you scared? are you sure you want to do this? and now from some family members and old friends its wow that treatment is a lot of money ive heard so many negatives about ozempic etc. my own mother has issues with me improving the way i look for some reason. i just dont understand it. i would never try to put someone down for bettering themselves in anyway. its actually almost hurtful. of course i realize i dont have to and wont listen to others on my life choices because my choices have gotten me to where i am today. i guess im just venting because it feels like the people who dont even make decisions try to influence yours. anyway thats all haha.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 23:23:40 UTC,2,6,0.75,,,0,0
1j59a9z,friend is dying of cancer cant tell almost anyone about it,it was only a couple of months between his first doctors visit and finding out it was terminal. all of this has moved incredibly fast and i dont feel capable of talking about it much. in the few times i have mentioned it to other people im always very calm. im very calm when i see him too. i just cant seem to cry about it when youd expect me to but then i break down at random times. hes a lot older than me so if i ever thought about it i probably wouldve guessed hed die before me. but not like this. not this soon. im not family or anything or a really close friend. there are people who have known him for more than a decade and i have to be some kind of blip in his life having only really been his friend for a few years. in a way it doesnt seem like i have any right to be upset about this. not when hes got actual family and friends who are as close as family. but here we are. the thing is like my own parents are...fine but fell short in a lot of ways. id never ever admit this to anyone i know but i diddo see him as kinda a parental figure. or at the very least a trusted older adult. someone i could be honest with and rely on which is pretty rare in my life. he looked after me a bit. now im trying to look after him. i dont think im doing a very good job of it but im doing my best to do as much as hell let me. i feel so worn thin. im trying so hard to be here for him and also be here for my best friend whos going through a rough time mentally and my family and also work and have my own life and not go absolutely fucking insane. i dont know. this is more important than anything else i could do. im just so tired and sad and im not sure i deserve to be but there it is. i want to tell him that hes important to me that this is really fucking me up but i have no idea where to find the words. i dont know that the right words exist. id give anything to fix this. if i could die instead i would but thats not how cancer works. i dont know. im tired and right now i just desperately want things to be okay or to not have to be the strong one for once but who else is gonna be?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 23:22:40 UTC,3,0,0.72,,content warning violencedeath,0,0
1j58nr5,ive been in a secret relationship for the past 9 months and im afraid to tell my family,hi everyone last summer i 22f met a man on this app who is 45m. the day after we met online we had a phone call and ended up spending nine hours on the phone! the following month he flew out to see me and i spent that whole weekend with him. we had an instant connection and even nine months later things still feel really great. him and i live only a few states apart so for the past nine months we have been traveling a lot just to see eachother. we have been traveling back and forth so much that this weekend is our 20th visit with eachother and we have spent roughly 100 days together in person! when we first started seeing each other i didnt tell anyone because i was too afraid of the judgment people would say. i have no clue how people in my family or community might feel about our age gap. overtime it just got more and more involved but i still did my best to hide my relationship from everyone. this upcoming may i need to find a new place to live and i dont really have many options. the best case scenario is for my partner to move to my state and for us to live together. that is a realistic plan for us but the only issue is that i dont think i can hide that from my friendsfamily. i am also starting to think about just telling them since there are times where it is hard to have to hide my relationship especially when its such a big part of my life. i am really worried about what my family might say. i am worried they will look at me in a negative light. i know that its just their opinions but it isnt easy to feel judgment. i am really stressed and confused on what the right decision is. any advice would be greatly appreciated white_heart,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 22:55:24 UTC,0,8,0.43,,,0,0
1j58nd7,i saw csam on x today and it just ruined my day and pissed me off,probably gonna delete this soon as i just wanted to get it off my chest and have no one to talk about this with. im sorry if this is too explicit. kinda embarrassing but i have a personal porn account on twitter just for reposting videos that i find hot and stuff like that probably my fault as this stuff is the wild west but ive had that account for almost 3 years and have never seen any csam ever. i only watch videos of adult couples who are promoting their stuff so that type of thing never pops up. one of the accounts i follow but never really see had been sold and taken over or something and reposted a sexually suggestive video of a girl that was very obviously young as fuck like 1213. i clicked on the original account to see if all the videos were like this and it was literally just a bunch of young girls maybe 10 to mid teens with some in extremely explicit situations. i was absolutely disgusted and reported the account immediately and the account that reposted the video. then worst part is that the reposted video had over 1k likes and 350 reposts i looked at the reposts and it was hundreds of grown ass men and a bunch of fake of accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers obviously not run by whoevers pictures theyre using just mindlessly reposting whatever. im just disgusted this is the type of thing you hear about but never really see for yourself. i cant stop thinking about those poor young girls and how they must be feeling and how they hell they were taken advantage of to get into that position. also the poor young girls who were probably groomed into sending explicit vids and dont know those videos are floating around on the internet or perhaps they sent them to another teen and they got leaked. sad and disgusting. i hate this world. face_vomiting i know this is partly my fault for watching porn online but it honestly jumpscared me seeing that i dont really watch porn that much anymore but this has scarred me for sure. upsidedown_face,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 22:54:56 UTC,37,18,0.79,,,0,0
1j5805v,im so dense she was flirting with me i think,i really dont have anyone to talk about this to so im just gonna share this here. a year ago i 20m was at a party with some of my friends. at the party there was this really pretty girl im talking peoples heads were turning when she was walking by. we were alone at the snack table and started talking i dont remember much details the conversation went really smoothly and at the end she invited me to go to a rap concert with her. i politely declined as its not my genre of music. the party went on everyone got slightly drunk and the girl invited me to dance with her. at some point the dance became kind of intimate to the point she wanted me to grab her ass jokingly so ofcourse i excused myself and went to get a drink. at some point me and my friends went upstairs to chill on the couch later in the evening the girl joined us and squeezed in right next to me. some time passed and it was getting late so people began to fall asleep. i wanted to go find a bed for myself but it turned out the prettiest girl ive ever laid my eyes on fell asleep holding onto me snug on the hoodie over my left ribcage. being the awkward fuck that i am i just spent the night with one arm parallel to my body and the other on top of the couch as to not hug her without consent. my memory has never been the greatest so i probably left out some details but generally our chemistry when talking was great. in hindsight it seems pretty obvious she could have been kinda into me or she was jus being nice guess well never know,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 22:26:17 UTC,1,4,1.0,,,0,0

1j560mr,i think i believe in fate because my first love came back into my life,i 21 fam dating my high school sweetheart again after years of not seeing or speaking to each other. we met working a shitty fast food job in high school and i fell in love with her almost immediately. shes smart so fun to be around made me laugh and made me feel genuinely loved and appreciated for the first time in my life. i felt more confident more comfortable around her. not to mention shes also the most gorgeous person ive ever seen. we dated for a bit and then she broke up with me towards the end of our senior year. i was heartbroken and went off to college still processing and dealing with the breakup. as silly as it sounds and i know most people think this with their first love but i really thought i was going to marry this girl. we chatted on and off throughout my freshman year just normal shit like hey how are you doing and we should catch up before i finally decided it was finally time to fully move on and forget about her so i blocked her on everything that summer and deleted her number. while i still thought of her from time to time i wasnt angry or hurt about the breakup anymore i had accepted that 17yearolds know nothing about love and all i can do with heartbreak is learn from it. fast forward to the beginning of my junior year of college and ive dated on and off for years now and was in the process of trying to end a terrible long term relationship. i drove from college to my hometown around 3 hours to be with my friends after ending things while my new ex blew up my phone with calls and messages telling me what a horrible person i was for breaking up with her i was not she treated me terrible and refused to listen to me when i had an issue. my friends and i decided to grab food and hangout in my car in one of the parking lots in our hometown. we pulled in and i saw my first exs car. it had a very distinctive bumper sticker so i knew it was her. i didnt get out or try to say anything but my heart skipped a beat. i really truly believed i would never see this girl again. i debated reaching out but in the end i unblocked her on snapchat and reached out with a simple hey! were you at x lot the other night? and we spent a few weeks catching up and then hung out for the first time in years. she told me she missed me and had always regretted the way things ended between us. i had no intention of trying to date again when i reached out but i admit i did miss her too. that was about 9 months ago and one thing led to another and now we are fully back together and its been amazing. i know its only been three years since we broke up originally and i will say that i still dont know anything about love. im a different person than i was in high school and so is she. she makes me feel like the most beautiful person in the world and ive never come close to feeling this way for anyone but her. all i do know is that as long as im able i will do my best to love her the way she deserves because as far as im concerned she does the same for me. i cant help but wonder how my life would be different now if we hadnt gone to that one parking lot that night. thank you for reading xoxo,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 21:01:47 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0

1j55g68,today i found out my mom was murdered.,today i found out my mom was murdered. blunt force trauma to the head that lead to brain bleeding. she had a migraine for 11 days and vomited daily. i had no idea she was sick. she passed in july of last year and the county i am in is so backed up that the medical examiner took 8 months to get back to us. we all assumed it was a fentanyl overdose that she may have come in contact with because one of her friends was an addict. it turns out that she had no drugs in her system. ive been waiting for 8 months. im only 20. my dad hasnt been around at all for my whole life. my mom picked terrible men. her whole life has been around horrible men. she was raised being beaten by her father by anything and everything possible he could find. she married a man who got addicted to crack my father. she then married another man who cheated on her the entire relationship with other men. the final man a man who had stolen from her in a relationship prior and who has killed 2 of his previous partners indirectly took her too. the only answer it could be is that the final man took her from us. he had never killed them exactly but both of his previous wives were completely clean before they met him. 5 and 7 years later they both died of a heroin overdose. i cut off my relationship with my mom in 2019 due to something i was a victim of when i was younger by the man who cheated on her with other men. he did some fucked up things. a lot of fucked up things. he let a lot of fucked up things happen to me under his supervision. i had caught a disease from what he didlet happen and decided to move in with my grandma because i did not like the man she was now with the man who may have killed her the final man. i had no contact with her after i got a restraining order. she and i had started to get along for once in 4 years. i had hugged her albeit halfassedly for the first and last time. she cried and cried. i dont know what i would have done if she were to have passed and i didnt get on good terms with her again. i wanted to see her succeed in her life. she spent all of her life desperate to be shown that she was worthy of being loved. i tried to show her before she passed a few months before that the way i had loved her growing up was enough proof that she was worthy of love. that if she can say she isnt worthy of it then my love i showed her as a kid meant nothing. she finally started to understand. we were going to go to college together. i wanted to help her get her ged. to start going to school. to make the loser of a boyfriend she has had for years go work instead of making her work 2 part time jobs being disabled and still not being able to make the rent. he did nothing for her other than steal from her and hurt her. i had to protect myself by moving out those years ago. she didnt want to listen when i knew he was bad news. ive known since i was 14. i just wish i could have done something to save her. i wish he never met her. i wish i could have been there to stand up for her when he hit her. im terrified. im so scared of being angry. i dont know how to deal with the fact that someone took her from me. she was my everything for years. someone so cruel took her from me and made her be in pain. no one knew he had hit her. no one knew her migraine was not just a migraine. she couldnt tell anyone or go to the doctor because she would have to admit he hurt her. again. i thought i processed it all when she died. but being told today that she died due to blunt force trauma and brain bleeding makes me feel like i lost her this morning. i dont know what to do. i dont know how to feel. i feel like my world just broke. again. and now i have to deal with detectives with getting information with anything that i can do to help them investigate. i just want my mom back.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 20:37:59 UTC,1147,27,0.99,,content warning violencedeath,0,0

1j55c34,i sometimes wish i had an eating disorder.,im a 21yearold trans woman. i realized i was transgender some four or five years ago and i have been on hormone replacement therapy hrt for almost a year. i suffer from anxiety and depression and was diagnosed with cyclothymic disorder. so yes i deal with body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria. i wont deny that it likely fuels a lot of my feelings. but despite that i am extremely selfconscious of my weight. and youd think id be fine with it. i support body positivity heavily and would not ever judge others about their weight. weight is not a proper scale of health nor should it be tied to your selfworth weight is weight. it only ever seems to be myself that i judge for my stomach. i have a potbelly. when i look in the mirror all i see is my toolarge stomach. and how it doesnt match the body that im supposed to have. and i do everything in my power to hide it because it causes me so much embarrassment. i wear high waisted skirts and pants ill tighten my belt just a little too much to tie it in and ill wear shape wear all so i dont have to acknowledge it. it makes me feel like less of a woman. which i know is stupid. women come in all shapes and sizes. hell my girlfriend is plussized and shes the most attractive woman ive ever laid eyes on. and yet i still cant help but compare myself to other women who have flat stomachs and small shoulders. i can never stick with exercise long enough to see any results. i like eating unhealthy sugary foods. i eat a lot in part to help my chest grow bigger as hrt affects new fat distribution. i like to eat. and i live in the south so you know the food here is good. im terrible at forming habits. it feels like no matter what i do ill never have the body that i actually want. so sometimes i wish i had an eating disorder. ive tried to give myself an eating disorder. i wish that i could go days without food and let my stomach shrink just so i can finally look the way i want. i wish i could live on scraps of food. but i cant. food is always there mocking me until i finally give in. and the worst part is that i feel like i cant tell anybody. i cant talk to my girlfriend about it because its a trigger for her own weight dysphoria. i have no friends i can talk to about it and im terrified to talk to my parents about it. i hate the way my body looks and i wish i could just force it to look the way i want.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 20:33:10 UTC,0,0,0.5,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0

1j54s03,my best friend tried to off herself yesterday night and i still havent cried,basically the title heres some context. i f19 and my best friend df19 have been close friends since elementary school. the summer before covid me and my parents moved to south florida for the start of high school and still we talked everyday. we would talk on facetime for hours fall asleep on the phone play multiplayer games and watch movies through shared play together. we got through college app season together first jobs and she was the first person i came out to. ive never had a sibling but ill always call her my sister. even though weve practically been 1000 miles apart for almost 6 years shes always my 1 call. i tell her i love her everytime we hang up. d is in college in new jersey for nursing and just recently started sessions with a psychiatrist. she is actively on medication for depression and sleep. shes always been a very introverted person but recently she has been telling me that shes been going to different club meetups and parties. i was excited for her because this was a chance for her to make some friends and get out more. we downloaded life360 together and i told her to keep her phone charged text me when she got back and have fun. im not dumb i know kids are drinking alcohol and smoking at college events. personally ive made a life choice to stay away from that crap but i dont hold judgment to my friends and others partaking. however d has skipped the little white claws and high noons and started drinking straight vodka and tequila whenever she goes out. at first when she told me i just assumed she was taking a little shot here and there and calling it a day. however some of her friends who know me and our relationship have let me know via insta that shes drinking to the point of blacking out and keeps multiple bottles of alcohol in her dorm room. ive called d and told her that shes turning into an alcoholic that she should stop going out as much and that drinking leads to more destructive behaviors. she brushed me off and called me judgemental and stuck up. shes even blown off our gaming nights to go smoke with her friends. last night she texted and told me she had to call me about something serious. she told me that she was drinking alone last night to the point of wanting to kill herself. her roommates had found her called the police and she was brought to a psych ward. she told me that the police and her dad found out about the alcohol and that she ended up coming out to her dad unintentionally. shes also been lying to her psychiatrist and has been skipping her meds. she said shes been admitted and was calling to let me know so i wouldnt worry. i just told her that i love her like always and that im glad shes still here. but after getting off that phone call all i could think was i fucking told you so. i told you the dangers of drinking and you ignored me. ill i feel is anger. i feel angry that she would think that way about herself and want to leave me and her parents and her little sister. im angry at her on campus friends who observed this behavior and didnt stop it. they let her get this bad and i wasnt there to help her. it kills me that im halfway across the country and cant afford to see her and make sure shes okay. and most of all im upset that if she ended up killing herself i wouldnt be able to do anything about it. im just her former middle school friend on facetime a million miles away. i havent cried or felt sad and im not sure if this is normal.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 20:10:06 UTC,1,1,0.67,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0
1j54p4q,i hate one guy at work,tw violence and threats i work at a care home for people with various physical and mental disabilities. the one thing i absolutely hate is how passive management is with the participants. they let them make any decision they want even if it ends up with someone falling down the stairs with little to no consequences. the one guy they are horrible with and let him get away with anything. he is extremely violent and has hurt me and others on numerous occasions. the only consequence he faces is when he breaks things he just doesnt get to use it till its fixed or replaced. which is nothing the worst part is this guy is smart and knows he can do whatever he wants and get away with it. the worst time i experienced this was when me and another staff took him out to buy him candy with his own money. he wanted to buy a knife it was a butter knife and we said no. it took alot just to get him away from the knifes and out the door. we managed to get him some of his candy and as protocol we gave him some. still mad with us daring to say no he threw the candy at me and tried to run back to the store to get the knife so i can stab you fckers. i had to do a hold to stop him from going too far and hurting someone else. however the hold we are trained to do doesnt restrain both hands so they decided to scratch at my arm hard to the point i was bleeding. it took a long time to calm him down and get him back in the car. the part that broke me was the fact he wanted me the one shaking and crying to apologize and my coworker who did nothing but call management to let them know what was going on also tried to get me to apologize. i couldnt cause i went completely nonverbal and just got in the car. i missed a week of work cause i was terrified of that participant and was locked up in my room. i filed a report for injuries but nothing came of it. now i just hate the participant. ill never do anything to hurt or try and upset him but i will always hate him and wish for his downfall. one thing i want to note is that i understand alot of the people i work with cant control how they act. this one in particular also struggles to control their anger. however ive seen them handle no from their parents and staff he likes and he was completely fine. he just doesnt like me and gets upset any time i ask him to do something or deter him away from dangerous things im not rude about it i always ask very nicely im just not a guy or pretty enough so he hates me. tldr i despise a guy cause he can get away with anything he wants including hurting others and he knows it.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 20:06:44 UTC,0,2,0.33,,content warning violencedeath,0,0
1j54haw,waited 6 hours for a 5 min with human services,last year i think i was sent an email in december saying that i needed to send proof of income effectively tomorrow. it was also a 2nd notice. assuming the 1st one was lost in the mail. i was already gathering that for a different service so i just made copies of the pay stubs waited an hour and turned in everything asked. that is when i was told that i had been flagged for something involving income and needed to see a medicare insurance adjuster. i wondered if any were available and was told no and that i needed to come back tomorrow or call in. i asked if i could make an appointment but was told none were available as due to holiday training and staff shortages we are unable to fill requests for appointments at the moment. however i would put a note in my file that it was a late notice. i asked if i could get an extraction as i never received proper notice. i was then told also due to staffing shortages and holiday training we cannot do extractions nor can we as we are not responsible for lost or delayed mail. she then told me that the best option was to come in at 7 in the morning to be the first in line. i told them that i work tomorrow and cant come in. i was told i didnt have to but it would be at the small penalty of losing my medical and dental through california. so i did that and was one of the first 15 people waiting in line for the doors to open in cold rainy weather. i got a ticket and waited for about an hour thinking i could make it to work on time at 1030am. i sat and told them i was there for a medical adjustment with a medicare insurance adjuster. i was told they were not one and that the hours wait was to set an appointment. i was told i could have called or come in earlier to have a specialist set it up. i told them i tried yesterday and there were none available. i was hit with well its not my fault you poorly planned this. seeing as you had 2 weeks. i told them about the late notice and a note in the file. the man eyerolled me and just scribed out the latter on my ticket. telling me to expect my number to be called again in 2 hours and that in the future to be more mindful of prep and time management. i called my boss he was surprised but was cool with me coming in later as long as i kept him updated. and so i waited as eight became 9 and 9 became 10. i checked in as it should be around time for the meeting and was told due to a lack of adjusters today there will likely be unseen delays. so i had just to wait and i skipped breakfast to get there messing with my phone and eating some of the fruit offered there. i messaged my boss every half hour as he was skeptical that any department could wait this long. by the 11 or 12th hour of the day they started giving out parking passes as the parking lot had a twohour limit and needed one. there was a small argument between one of the managers and staff members about whether they should ask the ones here over the limit just to move their cars as they technically violate the parking code and we shouldnt be encouraging that behavior. a 3rd staff member had to step in just to hand out the passes. so by the 13th hour and a half when i was falling asleep and wondering how much of my shift i would have left someone poked me in the face and told me to look up. a new number had popped up. it was mine. i go through the door with paperwork in hand to see the ajestor about what the problem was. it turns out they wanted to know if i had ssi payments and asked why i didnt have any from ssi. i told her that i wasnt on ssi and she told me that was the problem. when applying for calcover i marked down that i had a federally recognized disability autism. so they wanted to see if i was making too much for the program when i didnt show any ssi payouts i was flagged for possible fraud and they tried to ask me in person if i had any other forms of assisted living payouts or financial aid. i told them i was disqualified due to being able to work. so the adjustor told me that next time i needed to uncheck that box as legally for health care i didnt have a federally recognized disability as it implies im getting federal aid. so i waited nearly 6 hours for a 15minute meeting asking me not to say i have autism on a federal level. my god why do we put people through this?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 19:57:51 UTC,2,2,1.0,,,0,0

1j53tt6,til that my coworker had a title ix case against him from my predecessor and hes still here.,i dont really know what to make of this and i dont really have anyone to talk to about it. i 23f started my masters this academic year and was brought in as a graduate assistant in one of the academic advising offices on campus. our office has a new director who comes from a high school administration background and relatively new advisors two of them both have been here five years max. until yesterday i didnt know why the previous ga left her role. she clearly left in a hurry because my office her office still had wall decorations cork boards with posters and flyers supplies and cabinets chockfull of folders with papers guides flyers you name it its here. it looked like the place was already in use is what im getting at. she created entire binders about our departments programs and even fully stocked the supply closet that we have. i knew she hadnt left due to graduation it had to be either right before she graduated or she hadnt renewed her contract but i didnt know why. its not really my business but i was curious and wanted to be sure it wasnt for something nefarious. so my suspicions rise when a classmate of mine m recognized the office that i said im a ga for a handful of us are gas most of them for our college but me in this advising office and she brought up that she used to work there in undergrad until she graduated last year. m started asking about names from when she was there and it became apparent weve had a lot of staff changes in less than a year. i thought interesting i wonder why? she also did not like most of the people advisorsdirector who arewere here. i kind of shrugged it off figuring that she probably just had some bad experiences or that the leadership prior to our current director was suboptimal because i liked my coworkers. naïveté on my part ill admit. but something hasnt quite left me since that day m said the previous director lets call him colin resigned after being caught in a relationship with a student. i took this with a grain of salt because i hadnt heard that not even from the other student workers who like to gossip and m had made it clear that she didnt enjoy the office atmosphere. things came to a head for me yesterday when i met with the current director to discuss some issues with the website. things progressed to how she doesnt like how disorganized the supply closet currently is and her plans to clean it out with our administrative assistant over spring break. she mentioned having so much stuff left behind by the previous ga like thick binders of whoknowswhat and not knowing what to do with them. theyre multiple 5inch binders stuffed to the brim. bringing up the ga snowballed until director casually mentioned how my coworker lets call him andrew one of the two advisors in our department was the one caught making sexual advances and toward the previous ga. they had gone out for drinks afterhours unsure if it was with a group and he had texted her inappropriately about hooking up. the thendirector colin received word of this but didnt want to do anything about it. he was promptly fired for his inaction once an actual fullblown title ix case opened against andrew. the ga left after this incident and no one has seen her since. she left everything behind. her friends harassed the office to try and hold colin accountable but it wasnt until the case was opened that action was taken. im in shock and just dont know how to process these instances. he came onto my predecessor yet she left and he is still working here. i dont even know if shes graduated but it makes sense now why her stuff was left behind and why nobody talks about her aside from the student workers who dont know the truth.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 19:29:57 UTC,10,3,0.78,,,0,0
1j53puu,boyfriend seems to be choosing our mutual friend over me,hi everyone i just need to vent out. i am 26 f and my boyfriend is 24 m. we met through this girl who is our mutual friend. they are roommates. but since last year it has been a bit up and down between all the three of us. it all started when my ex suddenly showed up at my door wanting to talk. but this girl friend of mine got angry at me because i asked back the money i am owed back and went and told my boyfriend that my ex showed up we talked and some other stuff. this caused a major break in between our relationship and i only knew about this recently that she was the one who ratted me out when it wasnt her place. i would have told him but she went ahead and told him adding unnecessary untrue details to it. we had some misunderstandings and we moved past that. but as of now she seems to be becoming more possessive of him though she has her own boyfriend. she expects him to take her out everywhere doesnt include me and he seems to be doing it. but when i ask him its always reasons and excuses. she still owes me a little around 600 and i am honestly scared to ask her about it. they have been doing a lot of video calls texting constantly and i know it may be nothing but i just cannot digest the fact. i know i need to be more trusting but i feel like a third wheel in my own relationship. he expects me to adjust to this but why should i be adjusting in my relationship. yesterday night i questioned him about it and he came to hit me. i got shocked that he raised his hand on me when i asked why did he video call her. he keeps saying i am more important to him and i am his first priority but i just cannot understand why he would get so angry when i questioned about it. this was the third time in a row he raised his hand on me. but later consoled me. i asked him to choose between me or her he said he is in a situation where she is his roommate and he cannot do anything. i hate the fact that she is so touchy around him i just hate it. i trust him that he wouldnt do anything behind my back like sleep with her but i just cannot let it go. i am still in shock from yesterday night. i feel like i lost all my friends because of him i dont feel like i belong with anyone and i dont even have anyone to talk about this that i have to vent it out on reddit. tldr my boyfriend seems to be involving our mutual friend a lot into our relationship and seems to be choosing her over me.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 19:25:14 UTC,5,20,0.78,,,0,0

1j52yjk,the obsession with control with muslim arab parents,ive always wanted to live life on my own terms but my muslim arab parents make it feel impossible. even though im an adult they still try to control every aspect of my life my career my choices even how i spend my time. the moment i push back im met with guilttripping and emotional manipulation youre disobedient. youve dishonored us. i will never forgive you until the day of judgment. and many of the things they react this way to arent even that big of a deal. for example ive always wanted to cut my hair short but my mother made it clear that if i ever did she wouldnt forgive me and that it would be a a sin hanging over my neck until judgment day. even something as small as asking them to knock before walking into my bedroom turns into an argument as if having basic privacy is an act of rebellion. and if not through words they use threats. they tell me theyll force me into marrying someone against my will or that theyd lock me in a room if i disobey them. even if they dont act on these threats just hearing them is enough to make me feel powerless like my life isnt really mine to control. it feels like their love is tied to control as if i can only be a good son or daughter if i follow everything they say without question. their obsession with obedience and authority makes it impossible for them to see me as an independent person. its as if my life belongs to them and any choice i make for myself is seen as betrayal. i know they believe theyre acting out of love but it doesnt feel like love. it feels like a cage. its exhausting to constantly be torn between my own happiness and their expectations. im tired of feeling like my worth is tied to how obedient i am. i just want to be allowed to make my own decisions without fear guilt or the weight of their disappointment crushing me. what hurts even more is that when i try to talk about this im always met with the same dismissive responses theyre your parents you must obey them no matter what society expects the owns who go through this to just accept it as if their love should come with conditions and control. but i dont want to spend my life suffocating under obligations i never agreed to.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 18:54:15 UTC,2,1,0.75,,,0,0

1j52tul,i think i was raped and still have problems to process it,writing from a throwaway. three days ago i met a guy. he found me on social media and we talked on the phone for a few days. he seemed easygoing and respectful so when he asked if i wanted to meet for a cigarette not at my place just somewhere outside in the neighborhood. when he arrived we sat outside and talked for a bit. then he suggested going to a nearby hotel. only if i wanted to of course but it was cold and dark and he said we could just sit inside have a drink and talk. he promised he wouldnt try anything that he didnt want to be intimate either. he seemed harmless trustworthy even. so i agreed telling him i only had two hours anyway. at first he was still friendly. but as time passed he started acting off. i kept my distance positioning myself in a way that made it clear i wasnt comfortable with any physical closeness. then he went to the bathroom. when he came back he was only in his boxers. i told him to put his clothes back on and that i was leaving. that was the moment i felt truly unsafe. i got up heading for the door when he grabbed me by my ponytail and pulled me to the floor. i fought as hard as i could but he knew exactly how to overpower me. at first he didnt rape me he enjoyed me fighting back. he hit me yanked my hair and choked me so hard i couldnt even make a sound. he threw me all over the room. my body is covered in bruises even on my throat. and then at some point he raped me. i pleaded for him to stop but he just threatened me over and over again. eventually my phone rang. i saw my chance and told him i had to answer it that my friend would be suspicious if i didnt call her back immediately and that she had my location she didnt and it wasnt a friend calling i was lying. i told him id just meet her quickly and then come back. he let me go and i left. if this had happened to someone else i would never blame them. but standing in my own shoes i cant stop thinking what the fuck is wrong with me? who goes to a hotel with a guy they just met? im almost 30. i should know better. i should have learned my lesson by now. but i dont feel scared. i dont feel sad. i dont even feel vulnerable. and that makes it hard to process what actually happened to me.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 18:48:58 UTC,0,1,0.5,,content warning sexual assault,0,0
