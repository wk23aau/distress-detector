1j4irfk,no one subs to a youtube channel because the video asks them to,i cant think of any channel i subbed because the creator constantly reminded me to or complains that only 5 of their views come from subscribers. i think it does more harm than good and you can hear it coming from a mile away in every video.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 00:32:55 UTC,62,40,0.72,,,0,0
1j4ipqp,its a real story! i have sleep paralysis and it gets...nsfw,im not sure where to post this but i really need advice thats why i made an account just fot this because im starting to question my sanity. i recently started living alone in my first apartment. im extremely careful i always lock the doors and windows at night and i dont have any pets. i used to have occasional bouts of sleep paralysis during a stressful phase but they were relatively harmless dark figures just staring at me hearing weird noises etc.. but since ive lived here its different. now i wake up several times a week in the middle of the night completely paralyzed. i can only move my eyes hear and feel. and every time i see this big dark shadowy figure in my room. but it doesnt just stand in the corner. it slowly comes towards me. it pulls my blanket away then my pants and then it starts touching me in a way that feels far too real. it starts touching me with its mouth. it licks me sucks me as if it is completely obsessed with my vagina. and the most disturbing thing is i feel everything. every detail. much more intensely than any real human contact i have ever had. it brings me to orgasm over and over until the sensations are so overwhelming that i pass out. and when i wake up in the morning my blanket is actually at the foot of the bed or on the floor my pants exactly where it threw them. for the ones who wants to imagine it the figure is black shadowy with glowing white eyes but sometimes they look red and it is very large. it has a somewhat human shape but also somehow not. there is a dark aura around it like black smoke. the hands are very large and the fingers are extremely long. the only thing i remember is that in one of my earlier sleep paralyses years ago i saw these hands or very similar looking hands trying to grab me. but i was able to free myself from the paralysis in time bec my sister suddenly came in my room and turned the lights on. its mouth is not visible but when it begins with the act i can make out the outline of the mouth and it has a very long tongue. you can then imagine where the tongue goes. it doesnt say anything or even talk to me. i know it might feel like a particularly realistic sleep paralysis but how can things be moving in my room? im scared. it happens almost every night and although it doesnt hurt the thought that it might do more at some point scares me. what if its not just a hallucination? and before anyone asks no im not desperate or lonely. im single right now but im happy with it. i dont miss anyone feel untouched or crave closeness. ive had relationships in the past but right now im enjoying my own life so i understand even less why this is happening. but my biggest concern is that deep down im starting to enjoy it. there are moments when i catch myself thinking dont stop. keep going. and that terrifies me even more. i have a disturbing theory what if it isnt just a sleep paralysis? i know its not a dream bec im fully awake im just unable to move or make a sound. what if it is some kind of entity or demon that possessed me? i know how crazy this sounds but if you were in my shoes would you really rule it out? i feel like i cant talk to anyone about this. its so humiliating and the worst part is what if it keeps coming to me every night until the day i die bec i dont do anything about it? im desperate and conflicted because as terrifying as it is it also feels good. and im starting to crave it. i dont think a real man could ever satisfy me again like this. ive tried to relax before sleep and i dont have any stress in life at the moment but it still visits me almost every night. and like i said im extremely embarrassed to talk to other people in real life because ive started to enjoy it and i dont have any money for fancy therapies. what if this continues for years? i feel everything and when i wake up in the morning my intimate area feels a bit numb and tingly as if someone had been fiddling with it so its not fake its really happening to me. i almost always pass out from all the orgasms. being satisfied so intensely every night can be dangerous right? idk. have any of you ever experienced something like this? am i just crazy or is something going on here that i cant explain?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 00:30:48 UTC,34,89,0.62,,content warning sexual assault,0,0

1j4ido9,i hate women approaching me,i 19m hate women approaching me. throughout my life i was considered to be ugly. i was told by multiple people and girls would treat me like dirt and constantly remind me im ugly throughout my life. over the past 2 years i made a decision after being insulted brutally on a friend app called wizz more like a dating app. i was really skinny and hence i decided to eat more and bulk up to gain some muscle mass as well as starting skincare and hopping on minoxidil for better hair quality for my facial hair scalp hair and eyebrows too along with multiple other changes. anyway these 2 years increased my looks considerably to the point where i almost looked like a different human being. during this however my self esteem was still incredibly low. for the past few months i noticed a girl that was constantly staring at me and i first thought oh she must think im ugly hence shes staring. later on she started laughing with her friend group while looking at me so i thought wow she must think im extremely ugly. this was not new to me. more recently she added me over snapchat which she got from a friend of mine as ive found out recently and she had a little conversation with me ill call her j. j sent a snap of herself and told me she had seen me around and that she really liked me. this however triggered me and i remembered the treatment i had received up until now especially the treatment on wizz. in that moment i snapped and insulted the mole on her cheek as well as her forehead and told her id have to be blind or in a coma for her to ever have a chance with me. this was quite recent. more recently ive had a female cashier give me a discount on some shopping i was doing to make a milk cake because im handsome. it honestly disgusted me and i genuinely just left the shop without any of the ingredients. it hasnt been long since ive become apparently attractive and im getting a whole lot more attention from girls and i hate it. fuck these girls. they treated me like shit for all these years when i was ugly and now they think they have a chance when im attractive. makes me want to punch them all in the face. i notice a lot of little changes in my daily interactions even with my family. its revolting.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 00:14:36 UTC,0,86,0.21,,,0,0
1j4i8vx,i got the sadness,im 35f and ill be a first time mom pretty soon. throughout this entire pregnancy the ones i considered close to me have been treating me really like shit. the dad opted out so that he can continue to date or whatever the fuck he wants to do. this included him making me find somewhere else to live so he can really lean into his bachelor lifestyle. my family has not been a source of emotional support which is all i need because im financially in a good place and always helped them. his family makes excuses for him so ive stopped reaching out they are clearly on his side which is fine. ill have to give birth alone but im grateful for my unborn and excited to start a new chapter. once my baby is born im just going to ghost everyone for about four months. i dont even feel the need to tell anyone when she is born or anything. it makes me sad af but feels necessary. i literally have no one to confide in so i just had to get these thoughts off me. thanks for reading sparkling_heart,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 00:08:19 UTC,2,6,0.67,,,0,0
1j4i0nn,i want to help people my entire life. but the issue is i feel like i am the touch of death.,for complete transparency i wrote this out first on wordpad can post the original if requested but since my grammar and wording is never great learning disability i ran it thru a ai grammar editor. the message and feelings are still mine as i reread it to be 100 sure. just thought you all should no. im writing this because its been weighing on my mind for a long time. it keeps happening and i cant shake the feeling that im the common factor. for as long as i can remember ive wanted to make a difference in someones life. in high school i dreamed of becoming a teacher to help kids. at one point i even considered becoming a doctor or a nurse to be there for people in their worst moments. but over the years those dreams fadedbecause every time ive tried to help things have ended the same way. it seems like whenever someone needs emergency medical care and i step in to help they dont make it. the moments that haunt me one of the first times this happened i was around 1820 years old. i was walking home from walmart when i heard a crash. looking over i saw a motorcycle had been tboned by a car and the driver was on the ground. without thinking i ran toward him weaving through traffic. i took his hand and spoke to him trying to keep him calm while others applied pressure to his wounds. he handed me his phone and asked me to call a family member to let them know he was going to the hospital. i did exactly that then gave the phone back to him. soon after paramedics arrived and took him away. later i read that he had died from his injuries. at the time i didnt think much of it beyond the tragedy of the accident. a few years later i was at home when my stepfather suddenly jumped up and said call an ambulance. we did and while waiting i ran upstairs to grab him a shirt as asked. i helped him put it on talking to him reassuring him that everything would be okay. the paramedics arrived and took him away. shortly after he went into heart failure and died. then a few years after that i was living in an apartment building. one day i glanced out the window out of boredom and saw my neighbors unloading groceries. out of nowhere the wife collapsed and her husband barely caught her in time. i didnt hesitatei bolted out of my apartment without even locking the door ran down the hallway hit the elevator button and after a few seconds of waiting said fuck it and took the stairs. i got to them as fast as i could. her husband was on the phone with paramedics while i held her trying to comfort her as he gathered her meds and health cards. the building superintendent came out just standing there saying shes going to be okay. just being completely useless . it took the paramedics over 30 minutes to arrive. the moment i stepped back to let them work they had to use a defibrillator there heart had stopped. she didnt make it. the fear that lingers these are just a few of the moments that have left me feeling this way. i may add more as i remember them. but because of them i feel like i cant help peoplebecause when i do it only seems to end badly. i honestly have never had someone survive going to the hospital after i help. its been about three years since i last experienced something like this and i hope i never do again. but im scared that if it happens again ill freeze up. that fear eats at methe fear that i wont be able to help that ill hesitate that ill fail someone when they need me most. im shaking as i write this scared of being judged of being called a coward. but i needed to get this off my chest because its been haunting me for far too long. i am shaking trying to hit the post button,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 23:57:50 UTC,6,2,1.0,,,0,0
1j4hyop,im a rent man and i think i have a crush on my client,warning slightly sexually explicit. probably nsfw. i dont really know how to say any of this but i know i need to write it somewhere. ill probably delete this at some point after. im 27m and im a rent man. another term for what i do is male escort. but i live in a small sleepy town and we just dont call ourselves escorts. i decided to get into this because i needed some money to help me finish my degree. im also in good shape so i thought it would be an easy side hustle. i didnt dont have a partner and i havent been interested in dating. business is generally very slow. when i first started i only had 1 client who i would visit every week. after that she moved away and i had two more clients that i would see periodically. it was always a very clinical and mechanical experience get in do what needs to be done get out. things were quiet for about a year and a half. i wasnt really providing services anymore. but a few months ago i got a message on my profile from a lady who was interested in my services. she was just reaching out asking how it works. we spoke for a bit and we decided to meet up. my services are customisable and she selected a variation of the boyfriend experience. i went to her house and i was... surprised? she had a really nice place. in a rich neighbourhood. im sure this might not be out of the ordinary for other male escorts but my previous clients werent situated in rich neighbourhoods. i didnt grow up rich. she was very welcoming. she was a few years older than me. she seemed to have a successful career. we sat in the living room and just talked. she told me that shes had sex for her whole adult life and shes enjoyed it for the most part. but shes had some kind of sexual awakening recently and shes looking for someone to explore this with. she said she doesnt even care if we didnt have sex that night. she wanted to talk to make sure that we would be a good fit for what she had in mind and if i was okay with it. that was also a first for me. my previous clients didnt really care what i was okay with. anyway. lots has happened since then. i see her maybe once every two weeks. and its always an incredible experience. i cant explain it. sometimes we have sex. sometimes we dont. sometimes we eat pizza and watch movies sometimes we drink and have sex. its so passionate. sometimes its primal. sometimes its lazy and intense. its not the mechanical sex that im used to. she truly turns me on. she likes it when im satisfied. sometimes we just talk and nothing else. ive opened up to her about my life. she pays me every time. ive even started insisting that she doesnt need to. but she believes in me and my future and wants to support me in finishing my degree. the problem is i no longer see this as a professional relationship. i really like her. and she seems to really care about me as a person. we know so much about each other but i feel so weird to say that were friends... she pays me for my time so are we really friends? and sometimes i let my mind wander... what if we were more? shes quite an incredible woman. and weve had many deep conversations. shes been through a lot. one of the topics that came up was her previous relationships. because i was wondering why she would approach a service instead of exploring this with perhaps a romantic partner? and i guess long story short she was in a relationship with a man who absolutely destroyed her. she no longer trusts people enough to share her life with. she wants to be alone. forever. but she desperately wants to explore her sexual side. i guess thats where i come in. by the way. i know who this man is. its a small town. fck you for what you did. you had such a great woman. whats wrong with you? i havent heard from her in a while. and i desperately want to reach out to her. im trying not to lose myself in this situation. i keep telling myself shes just my client and nothing more. this is just me doing my job. but i know that i feel a certain way. unfortunately i dont think shell ever see me as anything more.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 23:53:55 UTC,1130,76,0.94,,,0,0
1j4hnld,i work at a hospital... the sounds of a mother losing her child is something you will never forget.,nsfwtw death i work in a hospital. most patients on our unit are old. not terribly often but sometimes people die there. death is sad of course but i normally try to not think about it as a way to protect myself. ...but this story is about a young person we had admitted. from the outside they looked perfectly healthy but they had a freak medical event that resulted in irrevocable damage to their brain. the mother came and found out the news from the doctor. and she took it as well as youd expect a mother to learn her child was brain dead and whose body was only alive due to life support measures... she wailed. she cried the most gut wrenching cries. she was pleading and begging my baby please come back! it was like her soul was ripped into a thousand pieces. she was understandably utterly inconsolable. hearing the sound of a mother learning her child is dead... one isnt the same after that. it rips at your heartstrings. and you just breathe and try not to think about it. edit these comments loudly_crying_face,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 23:37:01 UTC,11775,670,0.98,,content warning violencedeath,0,0

1j4guer,im a bad friend and its affecting people i care about,recently i fell out with a friend of mine who ive known for a little over a year. its most likely my fault given that i a have talked to them about it already b am somewhat aware that i probably sucked at some point in time that i dont entirely remember . it started around 34 months ago when all my friends made plans to hangout together out of town a few dont show up because of curfew although they didnt make any real attempt to meet with any of us or let us know where they were until leaving to go home. they argued they told us about curfew beforehand we mentioned how we deliberately shifted the schedule up by a few hours to accommodate that they then said we didnt even agree on a meeting place we did they apologize and swear it wont happen again. after this i was upset for quite a while with one of them whom i was closer to and gave them the cold shoulder for a while. we dont talk for ages since i dont speak much with others in lessons and they kept wandering off with my other friend. meanwhile another one of my friends who organised the hangout trip is slowly losing patience with friend a and b because they keep ditching her when leaving to buy lunch which also kinda ticks me off because its getting hard not to see a pattern forming distance grows i dont do much about it since i attributed it to something else entirely and wanted to give them space this is around 2 months back. we still dont talk properly. they ghost me starting from around a month ago and dont talk to me in person or respond to my texts. eventually i ask to meet up and talk about it and they agree. when asking them they say the reason why is that i dont really talk to them kept moving away whenever they sat near compared their skills to another persons even though theyre the same grade made snide comments people whore friends with me arent nice to them etc. i dont remember a ton of this and while some of it is probably coincidence moving away from them theres a solid chance that some of it is stuff ive done. i can be pretty horrible sometimes especially when im not doing so well mentally and im so angry with myself that i crashed a friendship with someone i cared about over crap communication and my own assholery. i wish i could say that i atleast know where i went wrong but i cant since i dont remember the whole bloody thing happening. another of my friends has distanced themselves from my current group to join another group with this person and i cant tell whether they actually want to remain friends with me or if its just because they cant bring themselves to stop talking with me entirely. theres also the chance that their negative impression of me is creating a negative impression of everyone associated with me and that im 90 sure their new friends keep talking shit about me since they all go quiet whenever i get too close although there could be any random thing theyre talking about. to top this all off im not even sure if my own friends enjoy my presence and i feel myself drifting from them although this part is probably in my head and a reflection of current circumstances tldr i hate myself my friend hates me their new friends hate me i cant tell if another friend hates me and my current friends might hate me. its been a long week. im sick. and tired.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 23:02:01 UTC,1,0,0.67,,,0,0

1j4glug,i wish i commited sui cide when i had the chance,i had to use a throwaway account to avoid a third therapist psychiatric committees and a whole bunch of prayers. i 26f have had depression for a long time. most of it was due to having undiagnosed disorders and the rest was due to family issues. the symptoms flared towards the end of 2019 when i moved in with my sister while in university. i dont want to get into so many details but i have had thoughts of suide since high school and they came strong during that period. my parents were arguing a lot during lockdown which worsened my dpdr because i had to shield my younger siblings from being caught up in the mess. i ended up thinking of death so frequently that i couldnt sleep at night. some days i would stay up until midnight just to celebrate seeing the next day. i tried to get my parents to help but mom refused saying that i would get over it. i had yo write several suicide letters for them to agree. the second therapist paid attention and had me sign no suicide contracts and one psychiatrist attempted to talk to me telling me to think of how other people would feel after a final diagnosis of mdd. i tried to keep busy with extra courses after graduating and looking for jobs. i even tried spirituality and manifesting to get my mind to a better position. i have no interest in anything. i dont want to do anything. i have no job no money no friends no one to talk to. i was a foodie and now i eat because it has been a routine. music is just filling a void when it gave dopamine. colours are turning to black and white. i have slowly turned into a shell of a human being. i dont know if i want help any more. i dont even know what i want. i cant make attempts anymore. i fear could get arrested if it failed or be called an attention seeker or worse watch my younger siblings suffer for my sake. if i did it when i had the chance i wouldnt be here being a burden.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 22:52:16 UTC,1,5,0.6,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0

1j4d2y1,i went to a fancy beach resturant soaking wet alone for my birthday a couple weeks ago,yup you read the title. so my birthday was a little while ago it was my 20th and honestly i was pretty damn depressed for it. didnt have a lot of friends to celebrate with and was basically alone and it feltstill feels really weird not being a kid anymore. i decided to treat myself to a beach day both to go romp around and also cause i needed some driftwood for an aquarium i was setting up. i have no car though so had to take the bus to get up which had a very inconvenient schedule. so i got to the beach found some sticks and got so distracted that i unfortunately missed the bus pick up. now there was another bus coming in a couple hours and i could always call a ride too if needed. so i decided that now that i was here for at least a couple hours i might as well do some more exploring. this particular beach stretched for 3 miles north up to another beach where on the other side there was a small resturant. i was pretty hungry at this point so thought itd be fun to walk up there and catch bus later that evening at that spot instead. so i cruised up the beach and got some really great views of the clouds and sinking sun along the way. i eventually got to the cutoff to where the other beach started however while the map only portrayed a small stream separating them by now the ride had come in and that tiny stream was basically a river. after scouring the area for a bridge or easier way across i stupidly chose to wade through a shallower point which worked and i made it to the other side of the beach soggy but triumphant. i had no change of clothes in my pack. so after drying off a tiny bit i walked up to the resturant and when i got inside i realized this wasnt just some little beach shack it was a full on fancy ass resturant. my belly was roaring though so i decided to give it a try. i asked for outdoor seating for obvious reasons and was really surprised to see them setting the table with fancy cloths and a bunch of different forks and silverware and shit. i ordered crabcakes and some jumbo shrimp which were the cheapest things there but combined still cost a whopping 70. they eventually bring out two tiny barely palm sized pencilthin crab patties and 5 individual finger length shrimp both elaborately decorated in the middle of these giant white plates. for the cost of it all i was half convinced id be able to keep the plates too. i kept getting odd looks from the other diners who were almost all either in pairs or groups. i was the only lone person there. not to mention still pretty soggy dressed like a casual vagabond and with my backpack as my only companion in the opposite chair. yeah i stuck out like a giddamned giraffe in a horse ranch. eventually i finished up and caught the bus back home where i promptly went to sleep. happy 20th birthday bud theres 70 bucks you aint getting back and an experience youll cherish for all the wrong reasons.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 20:30:14 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j4g027,what am i doing this for?,im 23 years old and i work in mental health. my life is mental health. i dont leave the house often i am on antidepressants and i work way too much. life has actually gotten way better recently. from not knowing what i want to do with my life to being so close to going to a world renowned university to train in to become a nurse in two specialities. im finally getting where i need to be. im finally getting sleep i leave the house a little bit more and i am well liked at work and seen as an asset. my anti depressants have solved a life long period of uncontrollable lows and selfneglect yet i am not fully there where i can begin improving myself. im still obese im still balding and im still ugly objectively. but im proud of myself i am on cusp of greatness and yet at night i still question what im even doing this for yeah my ego is now bloated but my family are no longer in this swirl of poverty i will not be able to lift them out of it. my brother and sister are in good places in life and my mother is no longer struggling. there are times i find myself truly at peace. but there is this deep loneliness within me. its a weakness i cant help it and its selfish but i want someone to love and to love me. i cant help it i thought losing weight might help which it didnt neither didnt overwhelming myself with hobbies and spending time with friends and family. i think truly after so many years i cant ignore my minds call to want someone to not just see me as a good friend. i want to be more than just needed. im needed at work im great at what i do but that is. i thing on the feeling of truly being wanted laying upon eyes of someone who sees you for who you really are. i want someone to share little secrets with to spend time with and devote myself to. i want to leave work one day knowing that im not just coming to an empty house. its so selfish to think im entitled this but why not me? is my personality screwed its my looks my mannerisms? i get along fine with everyone im really social at work and even outside of work barring my current situation but that for another reason. do i just reek desperation? am i unlovable? the answer is no i was loved once maybe even two more times but those relationships could not hold it bring questions to my head once more. im going work my ass off its just what i do. ill spend my life helping others and caring for the vulnerable being the person i wish i had in my life when i struggled. but at the end of the day i just dont know what im doing this for? the further my career goes forward i am scared that ill become the guy who says im married to work when i damn well know i want a family. eitherway i wish something changes soon. i dont want to be alone forever.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 22:27:32 UTC,0,1,0.5,,,0,0
1j4fr1m,update i started washing and putting away my roommates favorite mug whenever she uses it. when she caught me i lied about why.,good morning yall! a couple days ago i made a post at 3 in the morning to confess to doing my roommates dishes because i secretly love to watch her do a happy dance when she sees her favorite mug is clean for her to use again. that post changed our lives and im only being a little dramatic by saying that. i gotta say thanks to everyone who upvoted and commented on my original post im still shook at just how many people read about me and my mug happy best friend. the amount of people saying my post made them smile or reminded them of their own friendships or significant others has kept me smiling for days. im kind of into making people happy if that wasnt already obvious so the fact that so many people had even a moment of positivity because of me has been awesome. when i made that original post it was because i just wanted to tell someone about the mug dancing but i knew gwen wouldnt like it if i told anyone we knew so i came to reddit to shout to the void and oh boy did the void shout back. there were so many comments asking if i really thought we were just friends and ill be honest when i made that post we absolutely were just friends. we had never talked about being more than friends and i was happy being friends because we have an amazing friendship. i hadnt really thought about there being a possibility for more because dating was always something i planned to do when i had my life together or when i had more money. i never let myself consider what i was missing out on by waiting for the right time. her finding my post opened up the chance for gwen and i to talk about things that we hadnt before and over breakfast that morning we found where we stood with each other and what we thought things could look like moving forward depending on what we both agreed was the best course. we didnt make any solid plans or decisions and didnt want to rush into something that would ruin the good we already had going for us but ill admit i was hoping for a specific outcome. there was one comment on that first post that had really caught my attention. to paraphrase they told me to think about how i would feel if someone else got to see gwen do her happy mug dance instead of me and it hit me so hard. i didnt mind the idea of someone else seeing her so happy. i just dont know if anyone she dates would notice what i did and decide to do what i did. what if they didnt care or didnt think it was that important or any of the other things i do to make her laugh or smile. i really didnt like the thought of not being there to make sure she has that extra reason to smile in the morning. gwen wants me to admit that im a sappy moron because i teared up writing this. im a sensitive man in touch with my emotions and you know you love it so shut it you squinting_face_with_tongue. to all the people saying its possible for platonic relationships to be like ours you are absolutely correct. our friend group is very open with physical and verbal affection and we help each other all time with big and small things. we all say i love you to each other its just normal communication for us as a group not just between gwen and i. honestly if i hadnt made my original post im not sure when or if we would have gotten to the point we are now. maybe we would have continued as we were and that would have been just as happy of an outcome just a different one like a choose your own adventure with multiple options for a good resolution. which brings me to the actual update. gwen and i agreed we want to try dating. we arent putting a new label on our relationship yet but our first date is next week. im making it all a surprise. gwen helped write this post and will be reading the comments so i cant give any details but its going to be the best first date she has ever been on or ill eat my candy corn patterned socks. i think she might be the one for me and im going to take every chance i can to make sure she thinks the same about me. yall are the best and we love you. do something kind for your loved ones for us and everyone can and should find something to happy dance about it makes life more fun. love gwen and peter pink_heartspider_web,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 22:17:28 UTC,5944,370,0.98,,positive,0,0

1j4f39s,is my relationship doomed?,i 25m have been with my gf 26f for 3 months now and i dont know if im overthinking this and self sabotaging my relationship or if there are larger issues. as i mentioned in another post weve disagreed about washing rice before and someone gave me some solid advice about how to talk to her about it. i felt we had a positive and productive conversation but it all started because she got mad that i washed the rice for a certain dish. shes also recently got upset with me over a project she asked me to tackle just assembling a lamp we bought at the store. i made the mistake of trying to screw in a screw that had a defect and got stuck. she wasnt screaming or anything but she was upset that i tried to use it anyway. i got it out and replaced it and the lamp turned out well. she has childhood trauma to do with strict parents who would severely punish her if she didnt do things the exact way they wanted and so i think she gets stressed when something isnt going to plan. i feel like an idiot when these sort of things happen. theyre such simple mistakes easily avoided and yet i make them. shes also been stressed with her kitten that still needs to get spayed shes been in heat alot and she yells at the cat when she wont be quiet. i think this isnt right and have tried gently mentioning that her cat is just doing what cats do and she needs to try and ignore her. i made a larger mistake the other day when i asked to try her thc vape. she said that beginners should always be in a safe place and try to relax. i asked in jest do i feel safe here? and she asked the same. i thought about it a bit and promptly got distracted by other thoughts. i have adhd and sometimes this sort of thing happens. im still ashamed of it because when i realized i trailed off and said i do feel safe here she made a a comment stating that took a long time for you to figure out i didnt respond i knew i got distracted and i started silently panicking thinking i do feel safe here but nothing i say now will convince her. i wouldnt have tried the thc if i didnt i wouldnt leave my knife at home if i didnt i wouldnt be with her if i didnt but i gave some lame excuse about thinking too deeply about it and tried to laugh it off. i feel like an idiot. she makes me happy. shes important to me. im worried that her trauma will drive us apart. i dont know what to do to work through this.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:51:13 UTC,0,3,0.33,,,0,0
1j4f34n,i only now realize that i was badly bullied in school,i graduated last year and am now atending a university. the diffrence is astonishing. i realized that the behavior i had to endure was way more off the charts than i thought. i am transgender ftm and autistic. in my old class was another autistic kid whose autism presented diffrently from mine. funny enough i was always excluded and people didnt like me for being weird and missing out on social clues. but when i got diagnosed and received accommodations that was me getting favors and faking autism for attention. i know of some rumors that were spread about me but i have no clue how or who started those. apperently i was a lesbian never was and some were convinced that i would get mad and loud when i get missgenderd. i dont know why anyone believed that since i did get missgendered quite often and literally only corrected the people with a hey sorry it is actually him or sth. one kid in particular seemed to have it out for and said some homphobic stuff though he only did it when i wasnt present others snithed or he thought i wouldnt hear him. he actually once ran up to me while carrying a knife. a joke. surrrreeee my class loved jokes. they would act as if they were jerking off in the back of the room or say something rather loudly etc when i held presentations. i always went to the teachers and asked for help. no one ever helped me. some wanted to but had to catch them in the act which wasnt that easy and the other teachers didnt seem to care enough. though every adult always reassured me that i would be fine and nothing would happen to me. i wasnt the easiest kid to be around since i literally learned how to be nice in 10th grade and sucked a great deal before and during that learning. but i was always willing to reflect and talk about my misstakes. i am now in a much better place. everyone respects me and i feel comfortable learning again. though i am starting to feel angry that this extreme behaviuor was ever permitted and given space at that school. i love some of my teachers they were the kindest people i ever met and helped me greatly. others not so much. bullying really sucks and i needed to get this off my chest,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:51:03 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0
1j4f0wx,im crushing on this girl and its only deepening,i 25m got this gorgeous girls number at a bar last saturday she and i had this amazing and absolutely fluid conversation before i invited her and her friend to join my table where my friends sat. it was extremely enjoyable and she and i were flirting backandforth mind you ive hardly flirted with anyone since my ex cheated on me sometime ago. before she and her friend left for another bar i asked for her number but i quickly told her if youre not comfortable with it you really dont have to. i just think youre cute and witty and id love to talk to you more. she replies with and this made my smile like an idiot im not uncomfortable at all. i was waiting for you to ask. got her number wish her a great rest of her night and we separate to our respective friend groups. then i text her the following afternoon and since then weve had these fantastic flirty and personal conversations. heres the issue she doesnt text back too often. let me preface this by saying i know people get busy or preoccupied or even forget to text others back but im talking hours on hours without a response from her. when she does she immediately reciprocates my energy and the conversation returns to being wonderful. this isnt an attempt of mine to gripe all things considered. i just find myself feeling like a high school with a crush again she genuinely makes me grin like a fool and fills my stomach with butterflies. more than anything i want to talk to her. of course i busy myself while she isnt responding and try not to think too hard on it while im occupying myself but i really pray she texts back soon. im tempted to ask her to facetime if shes cool with it because of how greatly i want to keep talking to her.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:48:27 UTC,8,12,0.9,,,0,0
1j4eq01,rant for my anger stage of grief,i still wish he would come back dont get me wrong... that hasnt disappeared just yet and i suspect it wont for a little bit. i started doing dance classes again and my first couple of classes were hard. i hadnt danced in awhile and the emotions were still heavy. in fact i went home and bawled in my roommates arms because i was just hit with memories of my favorite routine of chatting with you after class and looking forward to being with you online when i got home. but the drive was hard and not quiet since i had a comfort song blasting and me just yelling into the car how much i loved you and what an idiot you are to walk away. i had another class just yesterday and i felt incredibly good doing it since it was a familiar choreo. i smiled. i was proud of myself. i laughed with my friends. and when i got out i felt angry... i was angry because i disliked how you made me feel hurt unseen invalidated and frightened during our breakup. angry that you decided to give up. im not going to try to convince you to stay so okay ill go. especially since youd do that explosive reaction again with the justification being you had no choice to in order to be heard. ya know my counselor said thats what people who do the abuse in abusive relationships say. if only she didnt do trigger then i wouldnt of hitscreamedthrowetc. her. i know youre not abusive though. i know youre flawed and that response is something you can work on if you recognize it to be. i wanted to do that with you. i wanted to work me. on us. but no you gave up and walked away. and although i know we had good times i now notice a lot more things in our relationship that werent that great. things i wish a partner would do for me. the slow roll into complacency. how i feel fooled being charmed by you. that i tell you how i feel when im in some mood is not your responsibility to fix and to please let me figure out how to make myself feel better and ill tell you. but no you make yourself take responsibility anyways and feel bad about yourself and frustrated at me when you cant solve it right away. what the hell?! dont you listen?! and i tell you my love language is words of affirmation and i barely hear any compliments from you. i dont remember the last time you called me beautiful or cute. i dont ever remember you telling me you appreciate me unless i ask or do it first by giving you all my words of praise. if youre proud of me or happy im yours. i said those things to you all the time! the random i love yous because i feel it in that moment. things i brought up id like to do but it gets overlooked and forgotten and then you get mad at me when i try to remind you and more angry when im sad you dont remember. and how i see you were also not telling me things that made you irritated and let build up but fault me for being the only one who does it. i also told you im scared youd talk to me like you talk to your parents. you gave me that wtf face like youd never. and yet there you were screaming at me assaulting me with words trying to blame me and all your what about you?! arguments. also how we agreed to disagree early on in a convo before our fight that giving someone the same energy they give you is a choice and can be potentially hazardous in a relationship. especially during an argument. communication is important but whats the point when you assume your partner is intentionally attacking you when its anything but?! i shouldve known better. i shouldve known when i saw those signs. youre so frustrating. how did i deal with all that?! and you know whats more frustrating?! its all solvable. they were things we could work on. things we could put out onto the table talk about our grievances and set out a plan to address them. i think at one time i said maybe we should see a couples counselor to better understand each other but that was swept aside. i know i can be frustrating too. i know it do things that make you mad. but no one deserves to be treated the way you treat me during arguments. you once brought out something in me that made me hate myself in an argument. all because it was so heightened and just not healthy because i was trying to match your energy. i hated it. i dont like being so angry id say things i regret and would hate myself for later along with the fact im sure it hurts you! why would you want that dynamic?! why are you okay with that?! its unhealthy! how did it feel when i said i felt hurt attacked and frustrated like you but didnt want to scream or escalate things so i cried instead?! you probably thought i was pathetic... and so fine... go find someone else who can match your energy without feeling shitty about themselves and about hurting you. find someone who argues the same way you do and see how disrespectful exhausting and hurtful it is. because thats not what i want.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:35:59 UTC,1,0,0.67,,,0,0

1j4egl8,my brother passed away 5 years ago today at the age of 18. this is that story,im not sure if this is the right sub but i need an outlet to post this anonymously when i was 14 my brother passed away suddenly. he was born with hlhs hypoplastic left heart syndrome which is a rare congenital heart defect in which the left side of the heart is severely underdeveloped. he had many surgeries as a child which i wont get in to but the important thing to note is that from the ages of 718 he was physically fine. sure he sweat a lot and slept more the most teens but nothing extreme. in february 2020 he got sick his livers started failing he would faint randomly and when they got it checked out it turn out he was in heart failure. however he started taking new meds and was seemingly improving. one night at the beginning of march he and my sister had a baking contest and both made desserts. we tasted them and ranked them his chocolate mousse won by a landslide. i had the grand idea of putting whipped cream on the back of my hand and hitting it into the air and the trying to catch it in my mouth. me and my siblings all tried it and my brother laughed so hard his face turned blue. it was a night filled of laughter and jokes. thats the last time i saw himalive. the next morning both of my parents went out to work which was unusual because my mother works from home and was my brothers primary caregiver i stayed home from school for a reason i cant remember now. at around 10am my father called me to check on my brother who wasnt answering his phone and to make sure he takes his meds. while still on the phone with my dad i go to my brothers room when i walk the smell hits me like a ton of bricks but my father was rushing me so i tiptoe over to his bed and i see him with his eyes rolled back and mouth slightly agape i tried to shake him but his skin was cold and thats what i noticed his arms were a deep shade bluish purple i told my dad to call the emts because my brother was not waking up. i remember drinking water unlocking the door and waiting in the living room. emts burst through the door professional looking people running in and out of our small apartment. and then the rush slowed down i wasnt informed on much and i was nervous to interfere. now there are more professional people running in and out with my small apartment although now some were patiently waiting for my father to arrive and since my mum wasnt answering her phone oblivious to her only sons passing all i could do is wait. i remember feeling awkward and unsure of what to do with all these personnel in my home so i just kept offering everyone water and snacks but they would just look at me with sad eyes and politely decline. i was only 14 so there were some issues of them telling me things but after about an hour while my father was on his way a kind man with a thick southern drawl sat me down. he informed me that my brother had passed away by the looks of it he had already been gone for quite some time. i responded with an understanding nod. i didnt cry. i remember when my father came home hearing the news and holding back tears i let the professionals do the talking while i sat in my room my father joined me and i held his hands while the police questioned us. ill never forget the whale of agony my sister let out when she got home and heard the news. the rest of the day is a blur. his funeral was the next day and rained and hailed so hard my shoes were soaked through to my socks. i had a complicated relationship with my brother but at the very least im glad that he died at home in the comfort of his own bed and not in a hospital bed hooked up to machines and wires he hated the hospital. its so incredibly hard and painful especially since five years ago was a different world. he passed away right before covid lockdown started happening. it feels like i knew him a lifetime ago. sometimes i forget his face and struggle remember what he looks like and it scares me because its only been five years and statistically speaking i have around 70 more years to go . every family event is painful all days of celebration and holidays are surrounded with this dark cloud that feeling that theres someone that isnt here that should be here. i hope this post is coherent im after a long day at work. feel free to ask anything in the comment if anything needs clarification.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:25:42 UTC,9,2,0.92,,content warning violencedeath,0,0
1j4eb33,breaking celibacy,this weekend my friends are taking me out to cheer me up after my cat passed. i told them we can go all out since i dont have anyone waiting for me at home anymore. we were throwing out ideas and one of them suggested a swingers club in the area. i know it was a joke but i kinda want to go. my only issue is breaking my 7 year celibacy and having a terrible experience. i dont want to be drugged by some rando. i dont want to risk being sad. i dont want to risk my health stipregnancy. i also dont want to waste a body and it fucking sucks. we probably arent going i think you need a password to get into clubs like that but i just feel like doing something out of the ordinary im a hardcore prude. i just want to feel something other then sadness. i just have so much anxiety and loneliness built up i just want someone to lean on. to hold on to. even for a night.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:19:38 UTC,1,4,0.55,,,0,0
1j4eayz,my parents passed away and im not sure how to feel.,throwaway account because my brother follows my main account and i dont want him finding this. sorta long post so beware. and english isnt my first language i hope its not too bad. so recently my parents passed away both my mom and dad. its still kinda hard to believe that they are really gone. im 17 years old so its been a bit rough for me. my parents relationship had never been good. my dad was a serial cheater i dont know the full details but i know he had a bunch of mistresses and constantly slept with other younger women he might even have other children... my mom always knew this apparently but never left because she was only a highschool graduate with no prospects for a job to provide for us. i had told her to leave but i knew it was fruitless. recently theyd been fighting so much to the point where it was unbearable. in the entirety last year and even this year there was constant arguments in my home. they would have screaming matches and fights i would always hear banging and yelling i could barely sleep at night because of their fights. theyve broken so much stuff in the house doors the tv ive stepped on glass shattered glass before after a bad fight. there was not much i could do but to just endure it and try to focus on my studies i couldnt intervene and i was forbidden from telling anyone. we also had a bunch of financial problems. im at a point in my life where i need to focus heavily on my education and make sure to get good grades but the stress of it all was making it impossible. my mom would constantly pressure me to get good grades and i really tried to get good grades but i just cant i really tried my best. i was mentally and physically exhausted. i was under alot of stress because of all of this i literally just wanted to die so i didnt have to deal with it anymore. it felt like my own home wasnt home anymore and that i couldnt find peace anywhere. they would try to rope me into their fights and it just stressed me out more i really couldnt do a thing about it. my physical health was depleting rapidly i was gaining weight i was always sick always tired i wasnt getting enough sleep. also my brother lives abroad he has a job and a house and everything and my mum for some reason doesnt wanna tell him all the details he knew some stuff but not to the extent that i did so i was all alone in this. anyway almost 2 months ago i remember my parents had a huge fight they broke the tv again and it literally lasted all night i couldnt sleep at all. after that my dad went to work in the morning and didnt come home till like 12am. that same night my mom had come to my room and talked to me and told me that she knows how much i suffer and she told me to study hard so that i can get out of here and she gave me a hug she hasnt hugged me or touched me since idk so i was just sorta stiff and didnt say anything. in the morning i had school so i went i was really tired and slept through my entire econ class... at some point during another class the supervisor called me to her office and when i went there my homeroom teacher the principal and my aunt my dads sister were there.. i knew what happened immediately. my parents had gotten into a car accident and died in the hospital during surgery. the police think it was a suicide but i dont really wanna know. since im a minor and still in school i still have a year left ill be in 12th grade soon my dads sister took me in but his other siblings also visit me often i dont have any contact with my mums side. living with my aunt and uncle has been okay though i dont feel much at home. after im done with school and my alevels no i am not from the uk ill be moving to the us where my brother lives. i already have a visa and scholarship. i recently went to a psychiatrist where i was told that i have severe depression and anxiety and bpd. i didnt see their dead bodies because i didnt have the courage and i couldnt cry at the funeral because i felt so... numb? after all that happened i didnt know how to feel at all. i cried after i came home all of it felt like overwhelming. i feel like a horrible person for not grieving enough but idk what else to feel i dont want to tell my brother yet. ive just been trying to study for my final exams soon its this year and i need to finish revising. i try to play games too but i dont really have much energy. my friends from school have been very supportive and kind. anyway thats all i guess i know its really long but i just wanted to ramble because other than my really close online friend i havent told anyone.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:19:31 UTC,1,0,0.99,,content warning violencedeath,0,0
1j4ea62,i feel like im a failure and a monster because my best friend and my sister arewere depressed,i am a teenage girl the feels like im a failure and that is probably because i am. i have a best friend ill call them muffin for anonymity purposes who lives three hours away so i dont see her often anymore. she is depressed and does self harm she has expressed that she wanted to get a therapist multiple time but they refuse. i feel like im failing her and i want to help but i cant i feel like i dont do enough for her. i feel like im a bad listener or that i ignore her or that i dont rech out often enough to her and that im a bad friend and a bad person for that. she also almost always never reaches out to me. i know its not my fault but i blame myself. im scared she might become or is suicidal like my sister was. my sister was in the hospital for mental health a few times and this first started when i was younger. she threatened to cut her hand off the night i was supposed to sleep in hee room. btw she is 5 years older than me. i blame myself for that too. i am not suicidal or do self harm or depressed. i dont have a therapist but i used to due to bullying which i no longer deal with. i don t have many friends thats something ive always had in life. i have i tight group of friends but i feel like im a bad friend. i feel like my classmates dont like me because i smell bad due to me not showing enough even tho i try too or am weird and i consider english as my first language but ive lived in a french speaking countrie my entire life and i feel like my speaking in french isnt good but they dont know that so they just think im a weirdo who cant speak or even read properly im dyslexic. my parents arent abusive in any way shape or form. i just want someone to love me. i feel like i live day to day trying to repese these feelings and live life and tell myself everything is going to be fine but i m scared for the future. i know that my adulthood is in years but im still scared. i feel like im not good at anything everyday i just go home and watch videos on my phone. im very self conscious of my athleticism im not at all flexible or strong or fast and my stamina is horrible. i feel like people would think im overexaggerating if i tell them this. i feel like monster and i just want someone anyone to tell me that s not true. i know that the person reading this will probably see this feel bad for a bit or just dont care at all and forget about it. i know this is probably just a scream in to the void but i just want to be heard and loved. my family loves me but i feel like its not enough. please just tell me im not a bad person. and if i am just tell me. this is just something i needed to get off my chest. thank you so much for reading my useless vent. this is a repost from my main account i deleted the original post because my mom wanted to follow me on reddit and i didnt want her to see this.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:18:37 UTC,2,0,1.0,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0
1j4e57g,hooked up with moms friend,tldr my moms friend helped me through a tough time and get into college. we got really close and weve been hooking up since. no one knows. she worked with my mom. they grew close over the years and became even closer the summer before i left for college because my parents were going through a nasty divorce. she threw me a birthday party when my parents were too busy fighting in court to remember. she made a big effort to be there for my mom and by proxy she was also there for me. we grew close because she would bring over dinner and eat with me drive me places pick me up and bring me home and even helped me with school. my mom picked up another job to help pay for the divorce lawyer so she was gone a lot. she helped me prepare for my college interviews wrote me references and connected me with people she knew. most nights shed feed me dinner clean up and make sure i was home instead of out partying then lock up our house and sometimes sleep there on the couch or my moms bed until my mom got home. i always was attracted to her since she was younger than my mom but still had that fit work out milf type of look. i would check her out often and even use her as the focal point of my masturbation. it got to the point where i snuck into her laundry basket a few times to check out her used lingerie. we grew closer and talked about sex. it started from her giving me advice on navigating the dating world and a girls perspective. i felt comfortable with her helping me figure out these social situations since she is young and attractive i just figured she understood. i complained about girls friends anxiety. she was a great listener and i would love receiving comforting hugs from. her. i would always get aroused from talking with her about things. one night when we hugged she felt my hard arousal accidentally press up against her but nothing happened. my fantasy was just that a fantasy until i went to college. my parents were still dragging the divorce out so she graciously helped me shop pack and even dropped me off. it was only 45 mins away from home i wanted to go further away but im just lucky to even get into college with all the stress. her texts were often and short so it wasnt unusual for us to be casual with each other. one night i got really drunk and texted her pretty late thinking she wouldnt get it until later in the morning. i mentioned how i thought about her during random hook ups or masturbation. well to my surprise she replied and we engaged in a little back and forth. this happened a few times over the course of my first semester and i did try to push the flirting boundaries when we talked about intimate things. it usually started with reminders for me to practice safe sex and then lead to talking about sex in general. i could tell she was really careful about being intimate with me. a few times it slipped into flirty territory. there was a blizzard as everyone was leaving for winter break. i could have taken the train but i texted her that i didnt have a ride home because i wanted to spend time with her. it was late and the storm was pretty bad by the time she dropped me off. she insisted that shed come in and make me dinner. at some point a bottle of wine was consumed. she mentioned that my mom was working until 10pm that night so she stayed up with me to watch a movie. we ended up talking about all the things that happened that semester and i admitted to her her my lack of confidence with girls. i joked that if only i could get some practice in real life instead of watching porn i could find the clit. well one thing led to another and we spent a lot of break together. since coming back to school shes been driving here and getting a hotel for us once a week. im afraid that i wont like girls my age anymore after this and that shes making it so fun and easy that im not making an effort to meet girls my age. not really sure what to do but needed to get this off my chest. its just nice having someone to have sex with so easily instead of putting in effort to flirt play games go out drinking and risking being with a random girl.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:13:00 UTC,0,2,0.38,,,0,0
1j4e234,i 30m have the biggest crush on my coworker 35f and i cant stand it,ive worked with this woman for about 4 years. weve traveled together on business several times. ive always been a pretty shy guy but am especially cautious when socializing with women i work with. i try to be myself but not act in a manner such that they could feel uncomfortable basically im afraid of flirting because i want to be a good human being and also keep my job. when im with this woman its pretty chill. we chat about our travels and places we want to go. she occasionally tells me very personal things one time she randomly told me she had an iud after we were just sitting in silence for a few seconds. anyway i think shes great. shes very smart and successful. we both make 140k at basically the same job. she owns her own house but im not quite there yet. shes funny cute and very fashionable. the little things like the way she paints her nails neat like a professional does them for her on the daily and wears her hair are so unique and attractive. sometimes things feel fantasy like when were traveling together. we might both reach for the temperature controls in the car at the same time because the ac is too cold and touch hands. we say the same things at the same time and have the same thoughts when a random event happens in front of us. sometimes she would say interesting things like if it was appropriate id invite you to stay at my house because the office is far for me and close to her. or if i talked about moving shed get excited and joke that i could be her neighbor. i always wondered if she was attracted to me but she shows mixed signals. shes a very smart woman so its possible she thinks the same way i do and doesnt want to jeopardize her career. shes had boyfriends on and off and im not even sure what her current status is. i feel like in an alternate reality we would be the perfect couple. but in this reality well just be coworkers who live a couple hours apart. its frustrating. ive never been sexually active before because im waiting for someone who electrifies me as much as she does to truly desire me and to be in the right situation for it. thats hard to find. tldr just a dumb man crushing on a coworker update i dont think i can ask her out. messaged her at work today to ask how things have been and the conversation felt one sided. i cant deal with the humiliation embarrassment and fear of her getting freaked out by me doing so,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:09:36 UTC,171,157,0.9,,,0,0
1j4e1ue,yall aint ready for this one,so 2 months ago i got tinnitus that is extreme. and i mean extreme. its hissing its beeping its white noise type sound its crickets occasionally its pulsitile and high pitched but these two last for a short time. music has changed as well as my own voice or the voices of my loved ones i dont have silence music shows or movies any sound causes hyperacusis noises like cars are different so i have to stay come cant even go to school anymore and have to be in 247 surveillance so i dont commit suicide. and my favorite thing in the world was silence as well as reading in silence or studying watching movies listening to music dancing going out to walk my dog going to different events and movie theaters shows concerts. now cant do anything like that and its constant sound you cant turn off its everywhere its consuming me. some people here have everything here and still wants to commit suicide and it makes me wonder how many people actually dont appreciate what they have and make their own problems seem too big. love your friends your family try to live for them your favorite songs movies sleeping in peace. for me all that is lost so life has seriously become just a shitty place with no purpose or future and im only 19. so yes that last day on earth is coming pretty damn soon. peace.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:09:18 UTC,1,6,0.67,,,0,0
1j4drdt,i sent nudes to feel loved but it only left me with regret and shame,over the past few months ive had talking stages and situationships with six guys. after a while they all asked for nudes and some even threatened to leave me if i didnt send them. i knew it wasnt right but i kept sending them anyway without really thinking about the consequences. i kept convincing myself that maybe it would be different this time that maybe they would care about me but deep down i knew i was making a mistake. once i sent them i immediately felt disgusted with myself. the shame hit me hard and i couldnt stop thinking about what id done. i felt like i had given away something of myself something i couldnt get back and it made me feel empty and worthless. i just wanted to feel wanted and loved but now it feels like ive only been used. long story short they all left mesome blocked me others ghosted me without a word. i know i should have stopped after the first guy but i was so desperate for affection that i ignored my own worth and let myself get caught up in it. i feel so small and discarded now. looking back im filled with regret and i cant shake the feeling that i was taken advantage of. the shame eats me alive and im constantly terrified that my pictures are out there somewhere being shared without my consent. it haunts me. i sent nudes to all six guys and each time i convinced myself it would lead to something real but in the end they all left and i feel like ive only given pieces of myself away for nothing. am i the only one whos gone through this? i feel like ill never be able to undo the damage ive done to myself. also im still a virgincan i still be considered a virgin if ive sent nudes? it feels like ive been used and thrown away and thats hard to live with.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 20:57:45 UTC,93,44,0.79,,,0,0

1j4cyxv,a guy i knew died thinking his wife was faithful to him,i knew this girl in high school lets call her hailey and she got engagedmarried very early. one of my best friends well call her samantha is very close with her. samantha told me once years ago that hailey had cheated on him once before maybe more. i was really shocked my gut instinct was to tell him but i didnt know him well and he seemed kind of mean. samantha told me not to say anything because she was using it as ammunition in case hailey ever wanted to tell one of her big secrets great friendship right?. anyway i listened to samantha and never said anything despite feeling some guilt. she assured me that hes probably cheated on her as well. i didnt think much of it for a while. recently he died of an overdose. the guilt of not telling him weighed on me pretty heavy after i found out. i keep telling myself that he probably wouldve ended up overdosing anyway but i dont feel like it was fair to him that he spent his short life with someone who was unfaithful. regardless theres nothing i can do about it now except hope hes in a better place.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 20:25:49 UTC,201,38,0.87,,content warning violencedeath,0,0

1j4cb0j,final update i went on a date with my exhusband last night.,update from this post. my 35m exhusband 36m and i recently reconnected. i wont go over the details of why we split or our reconciliation since im sure the average redditor can click buttons and most likely read. he was the one taking me out and promised that it would in his words knock my socks off to make up for his neglect of me. he sure as hell delivered. a little backstory weve been together since we were 15 and 16 respectively and have never moved out of our hometown. this year would have been our 20th anniversary of getting together not marriage. we were dating secretly for about five years before our parents caught us one day during summer break. the fallout from finding out their son was gay actually made his parents split. his dad wanted to send him away to conversion therapy. hes seen his father maybe once per year on average and every time hes incredibly cold towards me. would never refer to me as his soninlaw only my husbands pal. i wonder why. anyway not what youre here to read. ill get on with the lore. he picked me up from the house and wouldnt tell me where we were going but told me to dress warmly. he ended up taking me to the place where we met a run down ice skating rink in our town. he used to do hockey and i spent some time trying to learn figure skating until people started beating me up for it. both sports would practice at the same time and i remember barely being able to keep my eyes off him. we went skating i tried to pull off a few of the moves i remembered he only had to catch me from falling on my ass once or twice and i wont complain about an attractive man that i love hooking his arm around my waist and we spent an hour or so there until our feet hurt. at one point i said that my face was getting cold so he skated around in front of me and placed his gloved hands on my cheeks to warm me up. i just about burned a hole in the ice from how hard i was blushing i swear to god. he wasnt done then. we left and went to dinner specifically the restaurant where we had our first date. its a cheap holeinthewall place seeing as we were poor teenagers when we first met. we chatted and ate food that probably took 5 years off our lives he was an incorrigible flirt and even held my hand underneath the table like he did all those years ago. i know i said i never stopped loving him and i stand by that but i think i somehow fell in love with him a thousand times over again during that meal. at the end of dinner he asked if i had energy for one more simple thing to which i agreed. he took me a while out of town to a dark sky zone park specifically the one where he proposed to me ten years ago. he set out a blanket to sit on and another to cuddle under and we went stargazing all bundled up together. you never know how much you miss the sound of someones heartbeat until you havent heard it for so long. we shared a bottle of sparkling grape juice in plastic champagne flutes and dumb giggly kisses. it felt so similar yet so different. he told me in a moment of quiet that he loved me and oh god. it took everything i had not to cry. i barely hesitated before asking if he wanted to change venues. he seemed surprised but eagerly accepted. i ended up at his place as some of you may have seen from my edit on my second post yesterday. i wanted to take it slower than this but it was so hard to. i was so starved of affection and hadnt been intimate with anyone for just about six years. im gonna keep what happened at his between us but all ill say is that his medication was no issue and all of you should be jealous. i woke up in his bed this morning reached over for him and pulled him close just like i used to do. i havent been this happy in a long time. we had a sleepy discussion and decided to get back together but were not using the term boyfriends. it just feels weird after all this time. so hes my partner or my lover. hes mine. thank you reddit. wouldnt have done it without a little push from the internet. lets see where all this goes.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 19:58:59 UTC,107,20,0.99,,,0,0
1j4bxql,the only thing i will ever regret,hello everyone i 20m miss my 19f exgf so much. when we first met eachother 2 years ago everything was perfect. we were in love and having good times no matter what. we were long distance about an hour and 30 minutes from each other and we hated it but it never mattered. the more days that went by the more in love we were. at the time i was struggling with really bad paranoia and i quit my job and ran away to go live with her. i left my family and most importantly my grandmother behind. i wanted to show her everything i wanted was with her and her only but i think that was one of the worst decisions we made during our relationship. we were only together for 23 months at the time and i stayed with her brother while she lived with her mom and step dad. we started spending every second together and it was just getting even better but we started getting aggravated with eachother more. i eventually got a job 12 months after moving in with her brother. then things started to pick up again probably because of the motivation of going to work and getting money to spend on her. she never cared about the money. i did its the only way i knew how to prove my love. her mom and step dad were both alcoholics and abused eachother quite often and they really werent a fan of me for some reason. they got in a fight one night and started treating my ex wrong so i stepped in and pulled her out of that situation before she got hurt and i took her to taco bell at 3am. after that we started fighting a whole lot more because money was getting tight and it was the only thing that made me feel stable. i wasnt comfortable living with her brother at all and was starting to wish i never moved in. we started getting more and more distant until the day she got me a cat. a beautiful baby and i named her honey. she was the sweetest thing ever and it brought me and my ex closer than ever. then i got kicked out of her brothers for unknown reasons. i just had to be out by the weekend so i called up my family for some help and me and my ex moved into a camper with some of my distant relatives. we were still arguing and growing more distant but we worked out some of the problems but it just wasnt enough. we ended up moving back in with our families separately and only seeing eachother on the weekends but going from living with eachother for over a year and then all of a sudden splitting apart again brought some issues. my trust issues got very very bad and i started with my outbursts and starting arguments for no reason. we both did and we would blame eachother for everything. i broke up with her and got back with her multiple times. i started running from our problems and coming back expecting it to be the way it was when we first got together but it never turned out that way. i started focusing on myself and what i could do to be better for her. i tried so many things and so many ways but i could never find a way that worked and made us both happy. i wanted it to work out so much but she got fed up with me and blocked me on everything. i broke her heart so many times and lied to her because i didnt wanna admit i was wrong. i miss her so god damn much and wish i could go back in time to fix things. i want to hold her one more time. i want to give her all the affection she deserves. i wish i payed a little bit more attention to her and put myself to the side for once. my only regret so far in life i wish i treated you a little bit better peyton. if by any chance you find this and read it just know im still trying my best and not giving up just for the chance i get to love you like i should have. honey was the best thing we ever had and youre the only other person that i share those memories with. you have her kitten and i miss getting to see her. youre my fucking soulmate peyton and i will never love anyone else like i love you. if my life ends with you not by my side then it was all a waste. my life will have no meaning.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 19:43:50 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j4boba,the view from halfway down,you know what im talking about if you saw the ending of bojack horseman. the terror of realizing that you dont want to die the sudden desperation to live only its too late now and youre already falling to your death. maybe some of you have experienced it yourself. if you did im sorry and im glad youre still here. ill get to the point. i prepared to commit suicide something that has been on my mind every day for the past year and a half. approximately. i decided to finally do it in january i think. ghosted all my friends ruined every relationship within my family completely neglected my schoolwork to the point that its not salvageable anymore and that id have to drop out if i didnt die though honestly i gave up on that much earlier. i wrote the letters. i bought the rope. i chose the place. but i am scared. im fucking terrified. i dont want to die anymore but now it feels like i dont have a choice. that i already made this decision and i have to follow through. its not that i want to live... i dont. at least not the life i have now. its not even something worth being called a life. i do realize that it is only myself who can save me that it is in my hands to turn my life around that i am the only one responsible for my own happiness. i know things can change theoretically but i know myself and i know that i am too weak to try and face the consequences of my own actions in an attempt to fix this. to rebuild the last bridge i burned. im not sure i want to. i dont know what i want. the idea of living is dreadful. the idea of death although once so comforting is terrifying. i want nothing but i dont want to die. i have tried to kill myself before when i was a teenager. multiple times. never before have i experienced this crippling horror at the idea of dying not even when i thought i succeeded. the thought now makes me nauseous with fear and i dont know what to do because i have to die. thank you for reading. im sorry if this post doesnt fit the subreddit or if i dont make much sense and im sorry if i sound pretentious. im really not trying to be. im not sure what im trying to go for with this post in all honesty or what im looking for. im just lost and i dont understand why im suddenly so afraid of something i ruined my life for. i feel pathetic.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 19:33:26 UTC,2,2,1.0,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0
1j4bixc,my cousin went crazy todayis this the end for him?,im reaching out to this community because im really worried about my cousin who has been battling alcoholism for the past six years. hes never liked drinking but after so much time he feels completely trapped in a cycle of addiction. on top of that he has significant mental health issues and he lost his mother a while ago dad left him which has only deepened his struggles. today his behavior was really concerning. he was talking constantly repeating words over and over and even making a song out of them. he was jumping around in the bathroom laughing uncontrollablythough it was forced almost like a nervous laughter. he was narrating random nonsensical stories smiling in a way that didnt feel normal. this isnt the way he usually behaves. hes normally very calm and thoughtful even shy but today he was completely out of character. hes been becoming more antisocial lately and despite me being the only one visiting him he still feels incredibly lonely. hes tried therapy but it hasnt helped much and he often feels like hes beyond saving. he has also mentioned feeling like he might end it all though not directly. im really scared for him but i dont know what to do anymore. i love him deeply and im doing everything i can to support him but i cant fix this alone. im looking for any advice support or resourceswhether its therapy recommendations strategies to help him when he spirals or even just emotional support from people who understand what this is like. im open to any suggestions even if theyre hard to hear. please if anyone has experience with something similar or knows of any supportive communities id really appreciate your input.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 19:27:21 UTC,1,5,1.0,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0
1j4bc76,my exhusband broke me,this is going to be a long onesorry in advance. i 29f got divorced three years ago from my manipulative exhusband after being with him for 6.5 years. we had no kids because he didnt want any responsibility. ive moved on from him in the sense that i dont want him back but i feel like the emotional and psychological abuse i went through changed me in ways i cant undo. whenever a potential new partner comes into my life i cant seem to accept them. the moment i see something i dont agree with even if its small i start emotionally distancing myself to avoid getting hurt. i dont even know what a healthy relationship looks like. on top of that i live in a middle eastern country where everyone constantly pressures me to get married before i become too old. it just makes me feel worselike the manipulation and mistreatment i faced really broke something in me and i dont know how to fix it. what my ex did to me to summarize he cheated on me multiple times and i only found out about all of them at once. he never got me giftsonly things he wanted me to have so he could show off his status. he never initiated intimacy it was always up to me. he didnt want kids but the moment he felt like i was pulling away he suddenly wanted thembasically trying to baby trap me even though it was obvious our relationship was already over. when i needed helplike when my car wouldnt start or the faucets were burstinghe never answered my calls. i had to handle everything myself. he claimed he had ocd about cleanliness but would leave trash and dirty clothes everywhere expecting me to clean up after him just because i was a stayathome wife at the time. financially he cut me off except for food and clothes when i got a parttime job and started making more than him for like three months. in my culture the husband is supposed to provide for his wife but as soon as i had my own income which was around 4k a year yes a year he refused to spend a single cent on me unless it was food or clothes had to pay my own cellservice gas etc which he previously paid for. when we traveled it was never about meit was just because he wanted to see the world and his friends couldnt afford to go with him. when i put effort into our relationshipplanning picnics buying games so we could play together setting up dates booking hotelshe ignored it all yes i slept in a hotel by myself which is a huge nono in my culture because he wanted to hang out with his boys instead. i tried everything to make it work and the only complaint he had about me was that i didnt clean enough. he would literally swipe his finger over a light switch show me the dust and act like that was a real issue. our last conversation? he told me i was perfect that he was sorry he cheated and that was it. only when he realized that i was really leaving him that he started crying in the corner of the apartment we had like a 3yearold toddler. 2 days later he was like i did everything for you and its all your fault i cheated where im at now the cheating destroyed me. i never even checked his phone because i respected his privacy and in return i got blindsided. i lost myself completely. people see me as this cheerful bubbly person but its just a facade so my parents dont worry about me. after the divorce i moved back in with them which is normal in my culture. my dad even built me a small studio flat upstairs so i have my own space. but i stopped working so i have no income. even if i got a fulltime job the salaries here are terriblearound 15500 usd a year even though i have nine years of experience in marketing and content. realistically i should be making 20k30k but thats a whole other issue. i just feel like i have nothing to live for. my biggest dream in life is to have a family and kids but the dating scene is discouraging. i do have hobbiesi love reading drawing playing video games watching animetvmovies taking walks and doing athome pilates. so its not like i do nothing with my life but inside i feel completely empty. my struggle with marriage im very traditionalnot because of my family but because i truly believe a husband should take care of his wife. that doesnt mean i expect to be spoiled and contribute nothing but i dont think it should be my responsibility to cook clean and do everything 247. most men here though want a wife to take care of them. i keep getting set up with men through my family and its always the same storythey expect a woman to be a maid not a partner. i feel like im running out of time to get married and its making me anxious because i really want to build a family. my thoughts are all over the place and i dont know what to do. ps this is the first time ive ever shared something this personal. i dont even know if this makes sense. english isnt my first language so sorry if its messy.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 19:19:44 UTC,61,24,0.94,,,0,0
1j4b4s9,i have a deep crush on a faculty member and i cant get over him adhd,hi everyone. so ive had a crush on a ta from my faculty for a year now. the problem is im still a ba student l hes doing his phd. ive talked to him quite often we even went out for coffee and hes been always very friendly and helpful. however since this semester he kind of... shut down? i asked him out for coffee again and he simply didnt answer shoved it under the rug and didnt really interact anymore. i have adhd and i wish i could just stop having this crush as he obviously doesnt like me that way because hes had plenty of opportunity to respond favorably. hes everything id like to have in a partner kind attentive intelligent helpful and very sensitive a bit mysterious. hes also my type in terms of dark hair etc. idk how to get over the feelings for good as ive never been good at just stopping to think about stuff like this due to my hyperfocus. i just had to get this off my chest as i admire him a lot as a person and respect him. and its okay that he doesnt like me back but i wouldve liked some closure. thanks for reading this!,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 19:11:27 UTC,2,3,0.75,,,0,0
1j4b2z1,im leaving for college soon... but its breaking me apart...,this also gon be long i cant help it i am literally crying as i typed this... tldr im leaving for college soon and while im excited im struggling with the thought of leaving my mom behind. weve always been close since my dad works overseas but lately ive been unintentionally pulling away getting irritable and saying things i regret. i thought distancing myself would make leaving easier but it only hurts more. seeing how much my mom will miss memade me realize i dont want to leave things on a sour note. i keep having vivid dreams about my departure and the guilt of how ive treated her is overwhelming. i want to fix things before i go but i dont know how. im moving away for college in a few months and as excited as i am for this new chapter i cant stop thinking about how much im going to miss my mom. shes been my biggest source of comfort my whole life and since my dad works overseas weve always had a strong bond. but now that im getting closer to leaving i feel this huge mix of emotions that i dont know how to deal with. lately ive noticed myself pulling away a littlenot intentionally but i think its my way of trying to make leaving easier. instead its just making me feel worse. ive been more irritable and i hate that ive raised my voice at times when i never used to i always used to listen to her life stories even if i had heard them countless times her rants too whenever she shouted for reasons i wasnt even wrong... but now i am talking back to her get angry on her and say awful things when she tells her stories i say they are boring and please shut up i dont know why i am doing this... i still want to listen to her rants and yapping but i am not able to i am going into that angry zone and i have done many mistakes. i havent even apologized properly and that weighs on me. its like im watching myself act this way but cant stop. i know this is all part of growing up but the thought of leaving her behind even temporarily is really hard. i dont have many close friends so my mom has always been the one i could talk to. but over time i started keeping things to myself thinking i shouldnt burden her with my problems. i used to be able to just rest my head in her lap and cry when things got hardwhen i got bullied when i felt alonebut i havent done that in years. it makes me sad because i feel like ive lost that connection a bit and i dont want to leave things this way and now when i probably need it the most i feel like i cant show her the weak side of me that i have long pretended to have erased. the other day something happened that really got to me. my mom was taking a nap and before sleeping she had asked me to grab some groceries. while she was resting my little sister was joking around and said he left for college and my mom suddenly started crying in sleep. she thought i had already gone. i was still at home but seeing that broke me. i rushed to get the groceries but i was tearing up the whole time. it made me realize just how hard this is going to befor both of us and precisely the reason i was trying to distance myself from her that she doesnt grieve much but no now i feel that she will cry more that i left and our relation were sour and not mended i genuinely want to say sorry right now but i am stuck and i am going crazy. at night i keep having vivid dreams about the day i leave and they feel so real i do have genetic hyperphantasia from my mom that too that i wake up feeling broken. every time its like im reliving the moment before it even happens i know mom must be having those dreams too. it makes me feel so helpless because no matter what i do that day is still coming. i was going to leave this january but postponed it to august because in january we were close to ripping each other off that level of arguments... but now things are settling down but still it isnt back to what it was last year... i know i have to go and i know my mom wants the best for me. she always encourages me and im so grateful for everything shes doneraising me taking care of me making sure i dont feel alone i do feel but i pretend i dont to not hurt her i do have suicidal thoughts sometimes but i hold back that it will all fall into place soon however indefinite the soon is. i just want to spend these last few months showing her how much she means to me and making good memories before i leave. i just want to do the right thing but i feel so lost. i thought distancing myself would help but it only hurts more... idk how to leave without hurting my mom... how do i say goodbye without breaking her heart... all of these are constantly revolving in my mind and im going crazy... i still have a few months but i dont know how ill manage... i want to mend things... but i am thrown into my guilt... for those whove gone through something similar how did you make the transition easier? how did you make sure your mom knew how much you appreciated her before you left? i dont want to take this time for granted and id love to hear any advice on how to make these last few months meaningful for both of us. i know now that pushing my mom away wont make leaving any easierif anything itll only make it worse. i tried to make her love me less so she wouldnt hurt when i leave but all i did was create more pain for both of us. i dont want her to remember our last months together with regret. i just want to fix things before its too late and lastly just to clarify this is about my bond with my mom as a parent nothing else. were asianif i ever even thought otherwise shed personally set me straight with a slipper and more ultimate weapons. my dad works overseas but is always present calling daily morning and night and supporting her even more than i do listening to her rants and all. i love my mom because shes always been there for me and ive supported her in return. she doesnt rely on me for happinessi rely on her. i know i have to leave one day but i just want to make things right before i go.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 19:09:23 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j4awys,i used to be talkative but i cant or maybe dont want to talk anymore...,guys i am sorry but this is a bit long but i dont know who else to tell this to... dont tell me about diaries i suck at writing and tldr before covid i was social and talkative but after the pandemic i lost that ability. my friendships faded and now i barely talk at all. conversations feel forced and i overthink everything. i keep things to myself because i have no one to truly open up to. even online my attempts to connect go unanswered. i miss the version of me that could talk freely without hesitation. i dont know how to fix it and i just wish someone understood. before covid i was a completely different person. i wasnt exactly an extrovert but i talked a lotso much that teachers had to tell me to quiet down in class. i had a normal social life and conversations came naturally. but after the pandemic something changed. i used to have a few friends and talking felt effortless. but when everything went online i realized something those connections were weaker than i thought. conversations faded and soon i was just... alone. now i barely talk at all. i dont have close friends and i find myself avoiding conversations altogether. its not that i hate peoplei just dont know how to talk anymore. it feels like i lost the ability somewhere along the way. even when i try it feels forced like i dont belong in the conversation. i started keeping things to myselfnot because i wanted to but because i had to. there was no one to talk to. if i spoke up in online classes id either get ignored get shut down by teachers or feel like i was saying something dumb. friends who i thought were there just werent. and slowly i just stopped trying. even now in person i cant bring myself to talk like i used to. i hold back. i overthink. i dont have friends anymore. ive never had a girlfriend and honestly i dont need one for the reasons most of my classmates seem to. i just wish i had someone to talk tosomeone i could open up to about things i cant even tell my mom anymore see this post. shes been my only real friend for years but as i grew older i started holding back. i dont want to worry her and i dont want to burden her with my thoughts. but that means i end up keeping everything inside with no one to really share it with. i dont know how i ended up like this. i miss the version of me that could just talk without hesitation. i miss feeling like i had people to talk to at all. people say its just a phase but how long does a phase last? its been 56 years and im still waiting to snap out of itfeeling like a tether floating in space cut off from its base holding onto nothing but a fragile strand of hope that maybe just maybe something will push me back. i overthink at the silliest of times. even now as i type i am overthinking. its been two hours since i started writing this small post but my mind is stuck in a loophow to write what to write how much to write is this sentence wrong what if im misunderstood what if the post gets removed what if theres no reply? my mind just doesnt stop. i dont know if anyone else has experienced thisgoing from talkative and social to completely silent and disconnected. i dont know how to fix it either. i miss being able to just talk without overthinking everything. i miss having someone to truly connect with. i miss the part of me that could engage in conversations without secondguessing every word. back then i could even talk to girls without feeling like i was just spouting nonsense. not that i ever got much of a response but at least i was able to talk. now i hesitate for so long that by the time i figure out what to say the moment has already passed. the person has already walked away. whenever i see friends posting on instagram i reach outwhats up? nice! cool! how have you been? but most of the time theres no reply. and if there is its a dry okay or cool like they dont want to engage in a conversation no matter how hard i try. i dont have any social skills anymore. i dont have humor. i dont know how to flirt or even start a normal conversation. i have to ask chatgpt just to figure out how to say something. has anyone else gone through this? how did you handle it? i just wish someone understood. i am tired of being alone and reaching out isnt helping anymore,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 19:02:43 UTC,12,2,0.94,,,0,0
1j4an82,i loved her but i was never enough.,one night at a bar i met her. she was different. beautiful poetic full of life in a way i hadnt seen before. she looked at me like i mattered and for the first time in a long time i felt seen. we worked in the same company but had never noticed each other before that night. from that moment on my life revolved around her. we werent officially together but we acted like we were. shed come over almost every night wed talk for hours fall asleep in each others arms. it felt real. it felt worth fighting for. but she kept saying she wasnt ready for a relationship. i told myself to be patient to wait until she healed from her past. but months passed and nothing changed. every time i tried to define what we were she pulled away. and yet she always came back. she had a drinking problem. i picked her up from bars when she was too wasted to get home. i held her hair back when she was sick tucked her into bed made sure she was okay. i cleaned up the messes she madeliterally and figuratively. and still i wasnt enough. she had a kid and i got along with her so well. i ignored the fact that she still lived with her exhusband in the same apartment. one night after yet another drunken call she told me she had kissed another guy. a few months later she admitted she had slept with her ex. and yet i stayed. not because i had no selfrespect but because i loved her. because i convinced myself that maybe love was enough. but it wasnt. i convinced myself we werent dating. i guess she convinced me too. the night she finally agreed to date me it wasnt out of loveit was out of guilt. because i cried in front of her. because i was breaking. because she saw what she was doing to me. it wasnt the kind of love i wanted. it wasnt real. and yet i held on for months hoping things would change. they didnt. i should have left the first time she hurt me. i should have walked away when she made it clear i was just convenient. but i didnt. and it cost me more than i ever imagined. i dont know why im writing this. maybe just to get it out of my system. maybe because deep down i still love her. or maybe i just need someone to tell me that it wasnt my fault.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 18:52:30 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j4ainj,lost my mom feeling kind of cold about it all,i just need to get this out. im 44 an only child and my mother was 64. our relationship was never easy. throughout my life she always seemed embarrassed or ashamed of me for one reason or another. we hadnt spoken in three years though deep down part of me still longed for the kind of motherdaughter relationship i never had. then three weeks ago i received a message on facebook from my cousin saying they had heard about my mother and hoped things got better. my heart sank. no matter what had happened between us she was still my mom. i immediately started reaching out to familyher siblings my aunts and unclesonly to be told they couldnt say anything and that i needed to call my stepdad. long story short my mother was dying. stage 4 cancer. icu. when i asked if i could see her i was told she wasnt sure if she wanted to see me. that hurt in a way i cant even explain. by the time i finally made it to her home she was in hospice care and could no longer speak. her husband made it clear that she hadnt wanted me to know she was sickshe didnt think i would care. wtf. i got to say goodbye but only to the shell of the woman she once was. and now i dont know how to process any of it. the only time i ever really stood up to hernever in a disrespectful waywas when i asked her to stop belittling me in front of others and to show me some respect. i am collegeeducated have never been arrested and earn four times what she did. but in her eyes none of that mattered. i was overweight. i had a teenage pregnancy many many years ago. that was all she ever saw. this drove anxiety depression and a few failed attempts...well you know. she never had a relationship with her only grandson either. he wasnt told she was sick. he never got to say goodbye. its just... frustrating. heartbreaking. infuriating. thank you for letting me vent.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 18:47:28 UTC,12,3,1.0,,,0,0
1j4a7hn,my boyfriend has changed and i dont know if i should be worried,ive been with my boyfriend luis for three years and weve always had a close relationship with great communication. but in the past few months ive noticed that he has become distant. he doesnt text me as much as he used to he seems absent when were together and even our intimacy has changed. when i ask him if something is wrong he just says hes tired or stressed from work but i cant shake the feeling that theres something more. he no longer makes plans for us and when we do spend time together it feels more like an obligation than something he genuinely wants. i dont want to pressure him if hes going through something personal but i also dont want to ignore my own feelings of insecurity in the relationship. im unsure whether to give him space and wait or to be more direct and address the situation headon. i just needed to get this off my chest because this uncertainty is really affecting me.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 18:35:10 UTC,1,3,0.67,,,0,0
1j4a5d8,just need a little rant is all,i have never been the skinny girl or the pretty girl so when i became infatuated with a boy and finally heard him say yes to my request to date him i thought i was in a fairytale. last summer i 18 went to visit my boyfriend 21 who lived over 400 miles away. i was given an ultimatum if i didnt go see him he would dump me. so the naive me hopelessly in love agreed to take two weeks off my wellpaying job to meet him. after a 14hour train ride i was enveloped in his embrace and i felt so happy thinking this is it hes the one. i was exhausted from the long day and immediately fell asleep in his bed. however i woke up to a strange feeling and found myself unable to breathe. he was having sex with me and choking me. when i opened my eyes in shock all he said was you like that? you fucking slut. i felt so stupid and used i couldnt look at him the same way again. i stayed there for the rest of the two weeks but all we did was argue. i wanted love and to spend time with him while he just wanted to play games use me and sleep. once the two weeks were over i got the train home to encounter a 7 hour delay i spent a total of 21 hours on a train only to be raped by a man in an alley at 3 a.m. on my way to the hotel. i called my boyfriend crying and upset as my face had been bashed in. he called me a whore saying i shouldnt dress the way i did in public and that it was my own fault. then he dumped me. i had a mental breakdown of sorts lost my job self harmed almost daily never allowing my skin to be clean and overdosed twice. the worst part is no one believed me accusing me of being an attention seeker and dramatic and those who did believe me played it off as no big deal. although it has been five months i still feel unloved. i have always craved affection and i genuinely do not believe anyone could ever love me for who i am without wanting to use me although i hope one day im proven to be wrong,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 18:32:52 UTC,0,1,0.5,,content warning sexual assault,0,0
1j4a10l,in an instant i saw two lives change forever in two completely different ways,i have been trying to process and work through what i saw yesterday but it has been really hard. the event itself was a lot but now im dealing with the whys which make me feel guilty since what happened has nothing to do with me. i was just a witness. i tried writing through it but it hasnt been enough so im trying again thinking that if i get it in front of others i can start to live past it. yesterday evening i was sitting on this big rock while i was waiting for the bus. a little ways down the road there was a taxi van. he was either backing out or adjusting his uturn but obviously reversing and not moving super fast. from where i was sitting i didnt see how fast the bike courier was going when he hit the front side of the van. and the biker immediately went under the front wheel of the van and i could hear him and his bicycle crunch under the tire. the position the biker was on the ground was how he stayed for the whole 20 minutes that he was out there. he never moved. so im almost positive he died during the collision or if there was some way he survived he could have been fully paralyzed. but there werent many people to see the accident head on like i did. a man in his jeep came out and a few security from the booth around my stop is near a campus came out to help. they checked for signs of life and directed traffic around him and had someone call 911. police came and did much of the same. the fire department came and started doing cpr but they didnt take off the mans helmet. the ambulance came and i didnt see any defibrillator or adrenaline unless they did those things in the back once they loaded him on the gurney and took the man away. but even after they put him in the ambulance it didnt leave or take off. there wasnt a rush. it felt like i was out there for two hours but it all happened in about 20 minutes. and its hard to think about the collision and how if the biker hasnt passed away im sure the injuries will last a lifetime. and i think about the taxi driver who just sat in the van with his head down and how he will most likely lose almost everything because of an accident. i dont know why i had to see it but i did and i dont know what to do with it if anything at all.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 18:28:08 UTC,7,2,1.0,,content warning violencedeath,0,0

1j49dv1,i think my perception of a healthy relationship is whats sabotaging them.,most of my perception comes from observing from my parents relationship. they love each other a lot and spend pretty much all of their time together. however there are times when my mom feels a bit smothered by my dad and this has led to arguments in the past but i would say that overall she enjoys spending most of her time with him. ive even tried inviting her to different events but she would often turn me down to spend time with my dad. i feel like this has led me to create an unrealistic expectation that my partner and i should be spending a lot of our time together. a few of my partners have told me that they felt smothered or that i was never satisfied with them. was it a matter of different needs or was i truly doingexpecting too much? or is it a little bit of both? people say a relationship is supposed to feel easy or natural in the beginning but its never felt that way for me. i have to be doing something wrongwhether its not communicating well enough expecting too much from my partner or not setting firm enough boundaries for myself or maybe all of the above.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 18:02:26 UTC,1,4,1.0,,,0,0
1j499mz,im finally free of him,i 22f broke up with my boyfriend 20m of 6 months on new years of 2024. i broke up with him for a plethora of reasons including him accusing me of stealing 500 him accusing me of cheating him proposing how he treated me him telling me he was going to commit suicide and it was my fault and much more. for the record i didnt do any of the things he accused me of. well it didnt end at the breakup. this specific individual is in the military and most of our relationship was long distance. he sent me death threats after the initial break up which i did contact the police and his commanding officer about. i told him to leave me alone and blocked him. however for the year of 2024 he had his friends that live where i live follow me and threaten any guy i was seeing into breaking up with me he constantly messaged me on different numbers saying words coated in honey to try to get me back and he even showed up to my house when he was on leave. one of the many reasons i broke up with him was that he was home for christmas of 2023 and refused to see me and i got really upset because i still loved him at that time. i have now learned through therapy that it wasnt love i was just caught in the web. well christmas of 2024 came around and he was back on leave and he had his mom message me telling me that he was going to commit suicide if i didnt show up. i told her to leave me alone and it was of course an empty threat maybe even a test. he left after that and apparently according to his mom he was deployed. well i got a text on my birthday february 4th saying that he still loved me and yada yada which went ignored and then i got a call from his military base. apparently he had went missing in action and i was his beneficiary. i havent heard anything from him since but i feel free finally. i have a date this week and im going to see if anyone threatens my date into ending it with me. i kinda feel bad that i was so harsh but i also think it was survival. i think that if i was any less harsh it wouldve been a lifetime of pain for me.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 17:58:07 UTC,5,5,0.73,,content warning violencedeath,0,0
1j493kq,group of friends fucked me over,title. the sad truth is i was a compromised person when i made these friends and the relationship became really one sided and they fucked me hard. lost money time respect friends...lost pretty much everything i have basically. the fucked up thing is when i take a step back from the situation i see that these people dont even look at it like i do. they dont even really care or realize they have done anything. and in a way they didnt do anything because i was looking for the type of support that a family is supposed to give you when in fact they were just friends and our social backgrounds became really obvious as we grew up and we sort of grew apart... i see them from time to time. thats all i really want. sometimes i want it to go back to when we were all tighter but then i remember that the person who really made that a family space was me and the truth is that after what happened ill never really be the same and my desire to put out that kind of energy isnt really there anymore because im sick of being used and abused.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 17:51:31 UTC,1,1,0.67,,,0,0
1j48pud,blandest food ever,i have to get this out. my family makes the blandest food to ever exist. i moved out years ago for college and only now have i come back for a visit. bear in mind im a very culinary guy i love making various different foods all different textures tastes consistencies and all. be it italian french central european slavic arabic mexican indian all sides of asian cuisine. i love exploring different tastes and savor every bite. however when i visited my parents i remembered why i became so interested in culinary arts. its because my parents make food comparable to eating a stack of a4 paper. its not even bad its just... bland so bland that eating a meal that would take me ten minutes takes up to an hour. i swear any dish they make is outperformed and i do not exaggarate here by a fucking piece of bread with some salt and pepper sprinkled over it. i wish i was joking. which is fucking abysmal because the food actually looks good! it looks like it something that youd want seconds for but when you actually bite into it you wish to be put away for ten years in jail just so you dont have to eat it again. the taste of my family households cooking is what i imagine slop to taste like. you know those cartoons where the lunch lady always gave this grey slop in the cafeteria? im pretty sure my parents eat that on the daily just with a different look each day. its amazing no matter what they make be it soup sandwiches schnitzel literally any fucking thing they make is just akin to the taste of a rock. i just finished dinner and wish i didnt. thankfully i have money of my own so i can just say that im not hungry and then go out on the town later. but still i am amazed how they eat that... stuff. i cant even call it shit cause at least shit tastes awful. if their food was a person it would be this puny dresses always like hes going to work overly friendly and unopinionated guy at the party that talks to you when you contemplate jumping out of the building just so you can avoid his dribble about the fucking idk how much he likes mha. youd probably love my parents cooking if you enjoy the taste of water. their food reminds me of the food bodybuilders eat you know? cooked chicken and rice with no spices sauce or additions only that chicken and rice. my parents make food with all manners of ingredients yet they still taste like... fucking chicken and rice. its amazing i was able to eat that stuff for 18 years without consuming bleach which ironically would have more taste than their cooking and give me my will to live back. ok im better now see ya.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 17:36:17 UTC,2,2,0.75,,,0,0
1j48nfz,my boss keeps a camera feed of me going for a week.,my f29 boss m late 40s kept the camera feed of me on his computer screen at all times. obligatory throw away account cause the details in this might be easy for some of my coworkers to find this and i dont want to give up my main account. also i was posting this on am i over reacting but my update actually came as i was typing this on that sub so now im switching it to here that everything seems to be wrapped up. so i work in a mostly male dominated field in a cnc machine shop as a brake operator. i am the only woman at my company that works on the shop floor. about a year ago there was a fist fight between 2 other operators and there were no cameras inside to show who started the fight so both operators had to be let go. to prevent this from happening again the cameras went up all over the shop. absolutely no blind spots crystal clear hd camers we know this because our boss has a tv screen above his desk now where he can watch all the cameras. he can have up to 8 of the camera feeds on his screen at one time and it has the ability to cycle though all of the feeds switching feeds every few minutes. the problem came about a week ago when a coworker of mine came up to me and told me there was only one feed on the screen. me at my machine. i have never been written up or even talked to about problems with my work so i was very thrown off by this. when i had the opportunity where i could think of a reason to go into his office to see for myself when i walked in his office sure enough i saw my empty station on the screen. i pretended not to notice and just asked a question about a part i was working on that could be a reasonable question and went back to my work like nothing was wrong. over the next week or so i tried to put it out of my mind but i couldnt get past it and more coworkers approached me and said they saw me on the screen. so late last week i went to hr and asked if i was in trouble for anything. the hr guy looked surprised and asked me what i was referring to and i told him how closely im being watched and it seems to be just me singled out. he said he would look into it and get back to me but as far as he knew there was nothing wrong. about an hour later i get called into the managers office with hr screens are back to normal showing 8 different work areas. im happy for a second until i am asked why im spreading misinformation. i ask what theyre talking about and i proceed to be gaslighted for the next 5 or so minutes about how the cameras have always been this way and im seeking attention. i say multiple coworkers have mentioned to me about seeing it and we can bring them in to ask. they threaten to write me up if i keep bringing up this blatant lie and that im slandering the manager to my fellow coworkers. i contact a lawyer cause at this point im like fuck it im going to quit this job anyway might as well raise a little hell but then part of me decides its just not worth it and with everything ive been through lately its just not worth it. i decided to contact my ex who ive been broken up with for a year and fill him in. we were together for 5 years and hes the love of my life about a year ago he was offered his dream job across the country and asked me to go with him. my mother was dying of cancer at the time and i was the only one she had left to take care of her. he planned on turning down the job to stay with ne but i told him id never forgive myself if he passed on his dream job for me. about 6 months ago my mother passed and idk why i didnt contact him but it kinda felt like my whole world fell apart so i just accepted this was my life now. when i told him what was going on he said why dont you come move in with me? i didnt know it but he hadnt dated anyone since we broke up and neither had i because he had always planned on us reuniting after my mother passed and when she did he didnt want to rush me cause he wanted to wait until i was ready. i wasnt ready at all until he asked me that question but without hesitation i said yes. i put in an application that day at a cnc shop near where he lives and that was yesterday. so thats where this post was going to end on am i over reacting for picking up and moving across the country. and then the phone rang. apparently the place i was hiring was impressed with my years of experience and theyre a newer shop so i actually have more experience running a brake then most of their employees. they offered my about a 25 raise of what im currently making and i accepted on the spot. they asked when i could start and i said next week. immediately called my boss and told him hes a fucking creep and that i quit. hr has been calling me nonstop begging for me to reconsider but that ship has sailed. ex bf or possibly just bf again said hes excited for me to move in but will be setting me up in a separate bedroom at first just so we can take things slow and figure things out which i think is very smart of him and im glad cause i think we need that time too. my current landlady is an absolute sweetheart and knows how rough this year has been for me so shes letting me break my lease with no penalties and she already has someone lined up to take my apartment. i asked if they wanted to buy some of my furniture since im only taking what i can fit in my truck and they offered me a thousand buck for my living room set and all my drawers and dressers. not having to worry about all that i can fir the rest of my stuff in my truck easily and im starting my cross country trek tonight. fuck creeps and if youre thinking about putting up with that bullshit dont. theres always another option maybe even one youd.never thought possible.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 17:33:40 UTC,392,23,0.99,,,0,0

1j47j8o,i gained 50 pounds in a year and feel miserable about my body,hey guys. throwaway account herei 20f just want to vent after a trip to the mall recently that legitimately made me realize just how much my body has changed. i tried on a dress in the size i was last year and after i tried to force the zipper and it didnt work i felt so disgusted with myself. i weighed myself on my scale for the first time in a while and realized id gained about 50 pounds in less than a year. id just started college and a healthy eating and exercise routine id gotten into in my senior year of high school went down the drain during my first year as i began drinking more getting takeout and eating out at least 4 times a week and not exercising trying to balance a crazy social life with academics was just not something i was cut out for. this year im getting more into home cooking exercising and staying away from junk foods but whenever i feel like im making progress i end up relapsing for some reason. for example i made excuses during exam season and ended up getting a lot of takeout again ruining my progress. whenever i go out with friends or am with family i feel too embarrassed to mention im trying to diet because id always been the chubby kid growing up and i wanted to continue living as the thinner glowed up person id become when that isnt who i am anymore. as a result i end up eating a lot during hangouts or just giving in to temptations. i also sometimes have the bad mentality of i ate something unhealthy today already might as well just use today as a cheat day way too often. overall this isnt just about the weight gain itself i feel like ive lost the discipline i once had and my selfconfidence just keeps slipping away. its been a week or so after a stressful life season and im attempting to start this process again. im now 3 days into my new routine of encouraging myself to get out more as well as eating healthier and reducing portions and ive been seeing some good calorie deficits without even feeling too worn out. i hope i can keep up the progress this time. i need to do this for myself not only for my physical appearance but my mindset and to reinstill discipline. im not trying to make excuses just ranting about everything here to get it off my chest. if anyone sees this thanks for reading!,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 16:48:47 UTC,44,62,0.96,,,0,0
1j46iy7,i am in a situtionship and dont know what to do,i 14m and my friend 14f have been friends since childhood. people say that we are both attractive for our ages and because of that we often get shipped as a couple by our other friends. it doesnt bother me that much because i am used to hearing stuff like this. my father however gave me some requirements for marriage and they are odd. one of the requirements is my partner cant be the same age or older than me. the thing is when we started talking over text things escalated. now we call each other romantic names. and the topic of us having children came up more than once. and there is also my friend 2 years older than me. lets call him william and william has feelings for my friend f. but the guilt is eating me out. my parents gave me freedom and i am misusing it. though we read in different schools our friends and mutual friends know about us. her friends often flirt with me for being very handsome. though my face is one of my biggest insecurities. yesterday i was in the bathroom of our community hall. and i saw her. she said hello i said too. we talked and she started flirting with me. i didnt find it weird since she has done it more than once so we were in the bathroom and she suddenly asked me will you kiss me? i paused. and when i did she came over and gave me a kiss on the cheek. i blushed so hard that when my mom noticed she said what happened why are you blushing? i couldnt tell her the real reason so i made one up. next day she messaged me to meet in the same place. i went thinking she surely couldnt do it again. when i met her we talked for a few mins and she asked if i could kiss her as well. i didnt wanna hurt her but at the same time i am afraid of my parents. so i kissed her on her hand. she was happy i was too but deep down i was dying. now i am sitting in my room thinking should i confess my feelings for her or should i tell abt my feelings to william. i have to make a decision quick because this secret is something i cant hide forever.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 16:07:06 UTC,0,2,0.2,,,0,0

1j45g1n,im sick of being alternative different and miserable. am i finally maturing?,i 14f dress in a more alternative style im goth but when trying to be comfortable switch over to grunge. as we all know a lot of alternative music is very depressing if you can call it that i think everyone understands. a large portion of alternative teens is also.. severely depressed. i met most of my alternative friends in the psych ward or through friends of friends. i love them theyre fun and i used to feel like they understood me. i was in said psych ward for self harm and suicide about a year and a bit ago and yes i still have my moments but i have learnt to manage my emotions weaned off self harm and am no longer suicidal. i have been taking meds for depression and anxiety but i got taken off a while ago and i am doing fine. i no longer have that whats the point of anything outlook on life. i look forward to graduating getting married becoming independent and having children. i still have my fleeting problems with anxiety but as mentioned in the long run im fine. a lot of those friends have not gotten better. but not in the sense that they havent been able to. i have been speaking to them and they have expressed that they dont want to get better. they are content being depressed. they also consume sad media constantly like movies and music and theyre okay with that. i though have grown not so fond of it. i love them but i feel like i cant be around people that dont want to get better. i dont think its a good influence to hang out with severe addicts. i dont want it to seem like i am abandoning them because theyre too hard to deal with but i dont want to put myself in friendgroups with alcoholics people who are severely depressed and people who are constantly negative. i came to this conclusion when one of my friends reccomeneded smoking to get rid of my problem and i think thats when i knew that this is not the enviorment i want to be in. i just cant keep listening to the same problems over and over again when they dont want or care to fix them. im also starting to grow out of the alternative style. id rather wear bright colours and make myself look as colourful joyful and feminine as possible. the goth make up is something im not into either anymore i just dont like having people stare. now i recently turned to god and my friends have been.. not accepting. i told my best friend i wanted to try religion again and she got mad. she said i was abandoning her in atheism and who will we hate on christians with now? she doesnt like the idea of me going to church or ordering a bible. we have had multiple arguments about this. she also recently did something controversial that i wont get into. i said i was reconsidering our friendship because of it and when she asked why i stated my reasons and added that i dont think her actions align with the type of people i should be surrounding myself with according to scripture. she got mad and blocked me. im sick of being misreable sick of acting like nobody understands and sick of acting like im some tortured poet. im not. theyre not.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 15:20:28 UTC,0,13,0.5,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0

1j45av7,coworker shared with me that her niece is being molested and no one is doing anything about it,this happened two years ago and i still cry when i think about this. i had a coworker at one point who had very thin boundaries she would consistently causally trauma dump at work without regard to how it affected others and mostly coped with her trauma through drinking. im fairly certain she was drinking at work but never saw her take swigs. just saw her acting intoxicated and smelling like alcohol. i grew up with an alcoholic parent so her behavior was fairly uncomfortable for me to be around meaning i did not get close to her even though she shared many very private things with me. i almost wish i had invested in her more just so i would know more about her family maybe i would have had enough information to intervene if i had befriended her. one day her niece came in to work with her. this little girl was probably about 5. when she walked in the door she had her hands cupped around the sides of her face so she could only see the ground in front of her. she made no eye contact and would not verbally respond to anyone including her aunt. this was the angriest child i have ever seen. she glared at everyone held her hands in fists for almost the entire time she was there stayed completely silent and kept her back to the wall for the majority of the time she was in the shop. ive been through a lot of trauma therapy and it was very obvious to me that this child was hypervigilant if not in fight or flight. after the child was picked up by another family member i stepped outside for a smoke. my coworker the aunt of the child was already outside smoking. i sat down next to her and she casually said to me my niece told her friend that someone licked her hooha. it was like cold water had been dumped over my head as she told me more about it. i felt so sick for so many reasons. a five year old told their friend that someone licked their private parts that friend told her mom who told my coworkers nieces parents. and no one was doing anything actionable. no therapy no intervention no questions. just shrugs and hope thats not actually happening. after my shift i called child services and went to the police station by my work. i tried everything i could to get a report filed a welfare check done literally anything. because i didnt have the name of the childs parents the police and child services told me i didnt have enough information to complete a report. i called so many times with different ideas of how i could make a legitimate report but i simply didnt have enough information. i think about this multiple times a week sometimes every day for the entire day. i myself am someone who survived csa. i have complex trauma and i know what its like to be a child in a setting where no adults are protecting you even when they know whats going on. our boss commit suicide that same week so everything at that work place became even more chaotic very quickly. i left because i could not cope with the instability. part of me wishes i had stayed just to garner more information but that work place was so toxic that i started to experience suicidal ideation. i had to leave for my safety. now that im farther removed from the experience i feel like i could have pulled myself up by my bootstraps and stayed long enough to get more info for the sake of this little girl. im not sure why im sharing this. yesterday this popped up in my head for the millionth time and i had such a strong reaction to the memory that i vomited. i will never be able to get the image of that little childs angry face out of my head. i dont think ill ever forget her and i will always wonder if there is something i could have done to help.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 15:14:05 UTC,10,6,1.0,,content warning sexual assault,0,0

1j448cy,i have an irrational fear of my own eyes,ive been having some pretty bad existential ocd recently which thankfully im beginning to overcome slowly. but one thought that came during this experience just wont leave my mind. the fact that im able to see and perceive things and have eyes in general is really fucking weird to me. i dont like having eyes. i dont know why this happened or why im even thinking like this but when i think about the fact that i have eyes it makes me so uneasy. does anyone else feel like this?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 14:25:06 UTC,0,1,0.5,,,0,0
1j446sl,been crying myself to sleep,i just have to write this down and the things i have been feeling for the last 4 weeks. i think that my mental health has been plummeting really bad and i just dont know who i can talk to anymore. it started when i have been having chest pain for the last two months or so then about three weeks ago i was hospitalised due to that chest pain. the diagnosis given was due to gerd and i have really severe case of gerd. hospitals in general has always been very depressing for me and while i was stuck there it definitely feels lonely. my loneliness amplifies when the people i am surrounded with doesnt acknowledge me as much anymore. i am in college and i have a group of friends including me theres 5 of us. while i was not with them the 4 of them did stuff together and went on to have sleepovers. i think what hit the most was that none of them says they wished i was there. it was simply a thing they did between them and then it was never brought up again. it becomes more evident how used they are already without having me around. they made plans without including me. even though i was there. it would be nice just to get an invitation. i assumed they didnt ask because i might not be able to make it due to transportation issues. i wish i was a little more seen. im sorry if this is all over the place i just need to let it out somewhere.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 14:23:02 UTC,5,2,1.0,,,0,0
1j440kq,dear i,i wish i could tell you how i see everything much clearly now. i know i became very abusive towards the end and i was trying to be better once i realized but it just wasnt enough. even though i was holding on to past hurt from you and others there was no reason for the way i started to treat you. i was verbally abusive to you and that wasnt okay dumping my emotions on you every time things didnt go my way wasnt okay. and i deeply apologize for everything i ever did to hurt you. i understand why you never want to hear from me again and that crushes me everyday. i wish you had the same realizations of how you were hurting me and i wish we couldve moved past everything before it went this far but i was stubborn and selfish. the way we ended i couldnt have ever imagined and ill remember this feeling forever. you included an unknown third party in our break up and i will never understand that but maybe it had to happen that way. thank you for loving me the best you could ill remember you always.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 14:14:55 UTC,2,0,0.75,,,0,0
1j43w5m,he cheated on me again.,i dont know where to start. i found out two hours ago and my emotions are everywhere. my minds racing and my heart is breaking all over again. this man i so badly wanted us to work out. i so badly wanted us to grow old together have more kids have more stability find peace within each other. but i was wrong again like the two times before. hes never going to love me the way that i love him. hes never going to respect me the way that i respect him. i love him so much and all i want to do is sweep it under the rug again but i dont think i should do that anymore. i dont know. this information comes at a time where i am questioning if i should be alive. my kids deserve a better mom. they deserve a happy one that doesnt constantly fight with anxiety and depressing thoughts. maybe thats why he cheated? maybe thats why he went out of his way again to look for more women to find someone who is everything he wants cause clearly i am not that someone. i am nothing and he just reminded me of that. i hate myself for being so weak. i am so scared. i am terrified of confronting him when he gets home from work. i am so afraid of tearing apart my family all because he cant be loyal. why cant he just be loyal? why do this to me again? what did i do to deserve such treatment and lack of care? what is so wrong with me that he just cant be loyal to? maybe its because im a stay at home mom? i dont have a career and thats the women he chases. everything i own he bought for me. weve been together for 4 years. im so tired. i know this seems like im being dramatic but i loved this man. he was my person. i could take hurt from anyone but him. i couldve braved any storm with him by my side and now i have to go at it alone. i dont know what to do. someone please help me. i dont want to kill myself but i want to die. i want to disappear. how do i stop these feelings? these thoughts? im so fucking sad.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 14:09:04 UTC,37,50,0.73,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0
1j43sjb,i hate my circumstances right now,i am so frustrated with myself and my life right now. everything came crashing down in december when i was let go from the job i had and loved for almost 10 years. the reality of my situation hit me like a bucket of cold water and has left me shocked and almost paralyzed into such a pit of despair and depression. i feel worthless and useless. i have applied to so many jobs that i have experience for education and certification on and even used chatgpt to modify my resume countless times. i have received 0 interviews! nothing! nada! what the hell man?! how can it be that i am good for absolutely none of these jobs? i am so frustrated. i never considered going into business for myself until now but i am scared. if i fail i just dont know what i will do. i have a family kids that look up to me and a husband that has been incredibly patient. i just dont understand what im supposed to do now or where to go from here. im sinking. i can feel myself falling into a void. and im scared of whats to come if i dont find a way out of it.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 14:04:16 UTC,11,11,0.92,,,0,0
1j43ek1,i feel betrayed by my friends over something stupid am i wrong?,so today my friend called me while i was in an online game mobile legends. the problem is whenever i get a call my 4g drops to h and my game starts lagging which is a huge deal in a game like mlbb where being afk can ruin everything. so i hung up. he called again and i hung up again. now for some reason both he and another friend are acting weird toward melike theyre purposely cutting me off. they avoid me walk ahead of me but constantly look back to check if im gone and just overall act distant. the part that really got me was when i asked for a cigarette. they claimed they didnt have any but they were literally heading to our usual smoking spot. another friend who isnt aware of whats going on also asked for a cigarette and i saw them looking back at me almost like they were waiting for me to leave before giving him one. at that moment i knew they were avoiding me. so i walked up to them quickly and made an excuse that i needed to go cook. one of them realized that i had caught on and started feeling bad. as i was leaving he suddenly said wait maybe he has some. it was like he was trying to make up for it but it just confirmed that they were avoiding me in the first place. what bothers me the most is that ive always been there whenever they called or asked me to hang out. but the one time i decline they start treating me like this? i dont get it. if they were upset that i didnt answer why not just say something instead of acting all passiveaggressive? am i wrong for feeling betrayed by this?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 13:45:50 UTC,1,9,1.0,,positive,0,0
1j42ewg,it feels like i was sad even though it probably wasnt sa,the whole thing happened over 10 years ago and i had actually repressed the situation pretty well until my ex messaged me again recently. now i think about it every day and have panic attacks because of it. back then we werent together yet but he knew that i was in love with him. one evening we were at his best friends place and the two of them were smoking a bong. they wanted me to smoke as well. i asked what it was and they said weed. being stupid i took a hit but whatever it was it definitely wasnt weed. at first i got extremely dizzy then i couldnt move anymore and i started panicking inside because i couldnt speak or even breathe. after about 10 minutes his best friend told him to check if i was still breathing which he did. when he confirmed that i was still breathing the other guy left the room to go to sleep. thats when my ex started undressing me and then had sex with me. it must have lasted for several hours and towards the end i was somewhat conscious again and could have said something. but i didnti just couldnt. at some point he stopped and i went home. i had never felt as horrible lying in my own bed as i did after that night. afterward i desperately wanted to be with himprobably because i thought it would somehow undo what had happened. about a year later we actually got together. but maybe im overinterpreting the situation. after all he knew i loved him so maybe he thought i wanted it too. ill probably talk to my therapist about it but im afraid im making it into something bigger than it actually was. besides it was my fault too. i dont know i just wanted to get it off my chest.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 12:55:19 UTC,0,4,0.25,,content warning sexual assault,0,0
1j42a49,i resent my parents too much to have kids,i have never really thought about kids. for me having kids is not the goal but rather the outcome. like i want to have kids with a loving partner whom i have a healthy relationship with. but how would i be in a healthy relationship if i dont even know how one looks like? my parents had a very toxic marriage and my relationships with both of them are bad and getting worse. i dont respect either of them. theyre both very hysteric and unstable. i can not forgive them for how they used and continue to take everything out on me specifically since im the eldest child. i have major anger towards them. i have almost given up on the idea of meeting anyone cause im not even sure im capable of being a loving partner or interested in having children who might resent me as much as i resent my parents. its a constant thought loop that i cant get out of. a loop of shame anger and hopelessness.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 12:47:59 UTC,35,19,0.95,,,0,0
1j428ri,my dad passed away two days ago due to alcohol abuse.,i posted on here about four months ago.you can go read my other post before this one if you want my dad had cirrhosis of the liver due to years of alcohol abuse. he was diagnosed with it back in september of 2024 and has been in and out of the hospital since then. it started off with his liver failing and slowly went to his kidneys starting to fail. his feet legs and stomach were pretty much always full of fluid that he was constantly needing to go get drained and he was always in pain. he went into to hospice about a week ago and one of his last wishes were to be at home so my grandparents had the hospital bed and all the equipment set up at there house. once he was at home in hospice he went down hill really fast. he was confused most of the time and the rest of the time he was sleeping. i got a call from my grandfather around 830am on monday that i needed to get over there as fast as i can because they didnt think he wasnt going to make it much longer. i got over there around 1030am and honest to god wasnt prepared for how horrible he looked. he went down hill so fast. his oxygen levels were at 30 and his heart rate was 45bpm. my grandma cranked up his oxygen and was able to get it back up to 94. his eyes were open but you could tell he really wasnt seeing anything. he could hear us but couldnt talk he could hardly breatheevery breath he took was a gasp and then nothing for a second and then a gasp again. all the immediate family was there talking to him to let him know that we were there and that we loved him. it got to the point where we couldnt even get a bp reading on him and his finger monitor for his o2 and hr werent getting readings as well. he passed away about four hours after i got there on monday march 3rd at 202pm. him taking his last breath will forever be stuck in my head. thank you to whoever decided to read this i just really needed somewhere to write down what happened. it still doesnt feel real.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 12:45:46 UTC,85,22,1.0,,content warning violencedeath,0,0

1j41czf,my boyfriend 26 m was cheating on me 19 f. i feel im actually losing my grip on reality.,for the context our love felt more beautiful than anything id read in books or seen in movies deeper and more real in a way thats hard to explain. part of it was because we both had real trauma growing up which made us so similar. we bonded so purely and beautifully expressing our truest selves to each other. it was more than i ever couldve dreamed of. even our first kiss after nearly a year of waiting was unlike anything else the world didnt just feel like it stopped it did. we trembled overwhelmed and he cried like babies as he kissed me tears streaming down his face. thats how strong our connection was. i never wanted long distance so he promised hed move to my city but he never did mentioning financial reasons. still he visited every few months and we always looked forward to those moments. he even deactivated his socials on his own though i never had any problem or concern with them. of course not everything was perfect. his one toxic trait whenever things didnt go his way or we argued hed start disrespecting and insulting me. it was a dealbreaker but i still tried to be understanding. he had no real human connections all his life. he never even got to talk much to his family because of it being dysfunctional no close friends zero experience in relationships. i told myself he just cant do any better or could be because bpd runs in his family or maybe because of the traumatic environment he grew up in. but now for the last four months things were rough. we even broke up for a few days ironically after our first intimate experience. i felt insecure or anxious afterward he was my first boyfriend and i have a bit of sexual trauma too but he misunderstood it assuming i didnt like it or didnt want it again. after that he changed became indifferent stopped reassuring me and didnt seem to care about the relationship at all or even if we break up. it reinforced my fear that he didnt feel the same anymore trapping us in a cycle of blame and misunderstandings. i had spent so many nights crying during that time. he eventually felt sorry and we fixed things but i had already noticed a red flag he seemed to care about physical intimacy more than anything and shut down when he thought he wouldnt get it. so then i started noticing more. during this rough phase he reactivated his accounts made new ones and never mentioned even after we patched up and tried to hide them when asked. it also started needling me for the first time that why had he never added me on his instagram and its been so long were together and i once saw a text from a coworker that felt off. i couldnt ignore it all anymore. so i decided to have a sudden intense conversation with him hoping his reactions would reveal the truth. then his reactions did reveal. a lot. not just cheating or anything but about his whole identity. i started asking he was so confident with his grand words and said that i can have his passwords and his phone because he knew id never do that i dont believe in invading privacy in a relationship. he kept manipulating me into believing there was nothing and i almost fell for it he was that good. but then we stumbled upon the conversation with his coworker. he initially refused to let me see it then tried to manipulate the situation. when i finally read it i noticed he had tampered with it. the last text had originally been 12 weeks ago but now it showed 17 weeks ago. and then the part that made my heart sink them talking about how fun it would be when he will move to germany and how she would be waiting for him. that explains why he was so obsessed with moving to germany. for his remote job? just to connect and work together with all his coworkers there? those texts were from months ago right after he started that job. now five months in i believe they must have something concrete going on. its pretty clear from the way he provided no further clarifications when i saw that and refused to show anything else they converse usually on discord which he didnt even show. but what struck me even more than the cheating was seeing in real time how good he is at manipulation. my friends warned me but i never believed it. he seemed too purehearted. but that day i saw it how effortlessly he lies. ive never seen anyone lie that efficiently. even when i was trying to ask he turned down all of my questions with so great replies that i started feeling like what am i even thinking? he was even at that time making a grand gift for my birthday. it included multiple handmade beautiful gifts including a giant scrapbook different boxes each with 50 different kinds of letters and tapes in it for different situations and a painting which he painted himself. he was even better with words the things he said and the way he made me feel. its driving me insane. how can someone be that person and be cheating at the same time? for an example he kept repeating that he wanted to move here to strengthen our relationship that i was his life dream that after being with me he needed nothing else from life. but now hes moving for her instead? its giving me a complete identity crisis. if hes really this good at manipulation like i saw yesterday then none of his words were real. his entire personality was fake. he was standing there so willing so confident about giving me passwords or proving his loyalty. but the moment i actually asked he changed completely. he stalled started arguing and gaslighting clearly anything to buy time. he tried deleting chats right in front of me thinking i wouldnt notice thinking he could gaslight me again. maybe he was too frantic to cover his tracks this time but it was so obvious. this time he was maybe too much in a panic to realise how evident his manipulation is or to control what im thinking. and i know the coworker thing is just the one thing i happened to catch. the way he deleted other chats before giving me a bit of an access it all proves there was so much more happening in those months. until now. this has traumatized me to the point where i feel like nothing is real. like ill wake up and everything around me will be gone like everything is in my head. i know this is just the trauma speaking and hopefully ill be okay soon. but it has shaken me to my core. if this is true then everythinghewas a lie. how can someone be so convincing so manipulative? for the first time in my life ive seen deception on this scale and its terrifying. in a nutshell i observed so big of a contradiction between what he is portraying so confidently and the real truth. and now i dont know who he is.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 11:54:22 UTC,0,48,0.5,,,0,0
1j41b1z,i liked this girl and now i cant get over her. its making life unbearable.,ive 17m liked this girl for far longer im willing to admit. shes the most intelligent its actually incredible shes sweet as pie with a sense of humour as good as silver and shes gorgeous. shes objectively the best. shes in a league thats hers alone. but what actually makes her special is the sense of bliss and hope her presence creates. in june 2024 my thenbest friend started talking to herintimatelyjust two weeks after he stopped begging his ex who hed been super manipulative amp toxic to to take him back. i trusted him when he insisted i was just being paranoid. then two weeks in he became her first boyfriend. she had once hated him but dismissed his past behaviour as just alcohol and family problems. she believes hes the only one who understands her. he lied repeatedly told her i liked her just before asking her out and even lied that i had slapped him. i was humiliated. looking back he was always a sleazy friend. its been 9 months since. ive become increasingly lonely as i have to avoid most hangouts because for the sakes of my mental stability i cannot bear to be around my ex friend. the rest of my friend group seems unbothered. neutrality is king. i feel ive been unremorsefully abandoned by everyone close to me in favour of some weasel who solely acts in selfinterest with no regard for morality or empathy. i feel so disposable. it feel purposeless and as if the world were mocking all which i believe in. its killing me. every breath is exhausting. living like this makes life itself unbearable. the worst part is its all my fault. i hate myself for it. i had so much time to be the one to connect with her or even to just admit my feelings but i never did. i promise it wasnt a lack of will but one of wit. i wouldve done anything but i didnt know anything to do. i still dont really get the whole emotional connection thing. maybe thats why im disposable. i dont know what to do with myself anymore id appreciate any advice.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 11:51:04 UTC,44,32,0.75,,,0,0

1j40w00,sad and stuck,throwaway acc. i f29 feel stuck in my life and feel sad. ive felt like this for a number of years. in fact it started when i started my current role in healthcare after qualifying form university. ive thought about a career change so many times and have dabbled in a few things but havent fully dove into anything bc as much as i dislike my job im good at it and earn a decent salary. its also a safe job. long story short i come from a poor working class background mum with mental health issues parents divorced and live separately. mum is on benefits and dad works a minimum wage job. i come from a background where we dont just abandon our parents and i love them and want to help them. im however an only child. ive been married to an amazing person a number of years ago and as amazing as he is he too is burdened with family issues. we also live with the inlaws. his mother became disabled last year and a lot of her care is depended on him. he also holds responsibility for his disabled sister as well. he does a lot for everyone hes practically had to be the dad of the family since his dad wasnt around much when they were younger. but now i see it taking a toll on him and he wont admit it only in snippets he says i sleep so much bc im so stressed. i try to support him as much as i can but hes doesnt want me to get more stressed with my family stress too. i believe my stress comes from having a poor relationship with money. but lets not deny that you need money to survive in this world. however i feel this huge financial burden that i need to provide for my parents especially as they near to pensioning ages and i really dont want their financial stress when we have children bc no doubt it will happen. i had a plan of my job role for this year and it was going to allow me to be in a higher position and earn more money. however this now is either not going to happen or will be delayed. then i questioned myself do i even want it? or am i doing it to save my family from poverty. the problem is that i dont want know what i want to do. i went into this career path when i was younger but i regretted it so much. due to stress ive developed pcos and im 2st heavier than my previous baseline. im always tired my husband is always tired and i feel that we dont enjoy life as much bc of all responsibilities and we dont even have children yet!!! adding children onto this will just cause misery im sure of it i just dont know what to do. were all trying our best but before being married even in a relationship when i felt stuck i would change my environment and look for things to do. i cant do it as much anymore bc its not a me decision anymore its a we decision and although we have plans to move out were saving up and you know what the housing market is like so it will take a while. anyways thanks for reading this if you got to the end heart_hands_medium_skin_tone,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 11:24:13 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j407fn,sometimes late at night i miss things when i was a kid and it was me and my siblings against the world,we used to run around everywhere and play. there are 8 now but when i was a kid it was 56 depending on my age. when it was the 5 of us and i was having troubles keeping up with the older ones we would run around each town we lived in and just have fun. wed walk to stores and parks we even lived in a rural hot valley area basically a desert and would roam around and tell each other stories. wed have hang out spots with other kids and play until sundown. then wed sprint home because mom told us to be home by the time the street lights are on and they were already on. i miss when my brothers were into drawing so we would all sit at the table and draw together. wed also play board games card games even poker lol all day and have a blast. when we got a console we would sit and watch my brothers play games like skyrim fall out or we would play halo 4 together. i hold all of these moments so close to me even though i dont talk to any of my siblings anymore. i cant bring myself to not after the trauma we all went through. my mother was terribly abusive. it was always us against her. then it became her against me because my older siblings moved out all at once and i became the focal point for her negative emotions. id be lying if i said i wasnt a little resentful about that. but i understand it now. i dont have any emotional connections to my siblings anymore last time i was around all of them they all felt like strangers. i guess im emotionally estranged. my family is just really broken. i miss how it was before we all realized it. i think it was the realization that made everyone leave. i know the abuse was happening my entire childhood but i miss what its like having a sibling. i crave familial connections its why im so desperate to have my own family but not with my mother and siblings. i guess i feel as if things are too fucked up to try to start over with them. i feel bad about it tho. i tried getting involved when my younger sibling went through horrific abuse but there was only so much i could do. being able to do nothing except watch it unfold broke me again and gave me an even bigger reason to never talk to my mom again. but i cant even bring myself to contact that sibling. anytime something bad happens to one of us it makes it harder for me to reach out. im not sure why but i know its not normal i just miss being a kid and having people to depend on. it used to be us against the world but now its just me. it just gets lonely sometimes.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 10:35:42 UTC,3,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j405cd,i f18 got broken up by my 18m boyfriend,i just got broken up with by my boyfriend of 1 year and 2 months. we were in a longdistance relationship and i honestly feel like my whole world just crumbled. we had plans to meet up in april but now thats not happening and im struggling so much. he said he doesnt love me anymore and cant handle the long distance. i get it its tough to be apart like that especially when you cant be physically together like others. but its still hurting so much. he sent me this breakup text while i was taking a nap and i woke up to it. now im terrified to sleep because it feels like its really over. heres part of what he said lately i have realized a feeling i didnt know i had... when im in a longdistance relationship i feel chained to my setup. its not your fault but the freedom i have felt when going on photo walks and disconnecting from my phone is something i cant go back to. i know i have attachment issues and he was aware of that when we started dating. he was everything to me and i cant imagine my life without him. he was all i thought about every day and i would wait for him to get home. now im just here and i dont know where to turn. i just want to know is there any way i can get him to love me again? i feel like i cant live without him. he was my everything and now its all gone,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 10:31:24 UTC,1,18,0.53,,,0,0
1j3zzwd,i recently discovered that i was the side piece,well yesterday i was hanging out with a friend of mine who happens to know my ex and some of his friends. for context my ex and i were on and off for two years and then we started to see each other as friends with benefits which has lasted for quite some time. yesterday my friend revealed to me that hes absolutely sure that my ex had a girlfriend he has been with for a variable time span it could be three months but also ten surely less than a year though. this girl was the classic friend i didnt have to worry about and shes absolutely beautiful and also a really kind person. obviously he didnt bother to tell me and he cheated on her with me at least two or three times. this happened more than a year ago and now i have a boyfriend different friends and my life got significantly better but i cant shake the feeling that hes treated me like a fool and he has been basically using me when ive always thought he respected me. i dont know if i should tell her not my circus given that theyre already broken up and that me and her are not friends just acquaintances. moreover ive always felt insecure about her and inferior in a certain way so i would just like to put this all behind me and forget about it. i dont know how could he do this to me the one person who was always by his side even when he had nobody else.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 10:20:37 UTC,0,1,0.5,,,0,0
1j3zqqm,my step dad sucks,this is my last day on this house and leaving is not even bringing me the peace ive been desperately wanting for years because this man can not stop himself from ruining everything. let me start by saying the following. me and my mom got stuck on the road because of an accident and we had to turn back to a city that is not ours or wed have to spend the night on the road. mom called step dad asking him to feed our cat that is not even a year old yet. he was laying in bed and refused to do it. a task that would not take one minute. he also said that if he let the cat out of the room if he fed her he wouldnt do an effort to bring her inside again. mom and i strictly believe cats are animals that should 100 stay indoors and any time outside should be supervised. it took me a few years to convince my mom that because my step dad managed to convince her first that cats need to exercise their wild instincts outside and if they die because of that its because its destined to. he truly thinks cats belong outside and me and my mom are abusing our cat by not letting her outside unsupervised. even after our cats have gone missing before because he didnt support me keeping the cats indoors and after his cat got mauled to death by street dogs. he found her on his doorstep bloody and dismembered. yet he thinks thats just how things should be. today i will be moving away for university. this is the first time ill be living by myself in a huge city as an autistic person with a lot of social anxiety and a bit agoraphobic. i also depend a lot on my mother. shes going with me for a week to help me and support me. she asked my step dad to feed the cat for this whole week. he doesnt want to. he says he will not touch her litter box and wont feed her because according to him the room will smell like death. i found my mom crying today because of this she thinks hell leave her to die or set her outside and shell go missing or die outside too. we have no one else to ask for help. i told my mom that she may have made me forgive this man who was homophobic towards me made a bunch of weird sexual comments about me even when i was a minor talked shit about me to my own family and his family threw away two week old kittens out of the house to another side of the road in front of me cheated on my mother multiple times and told us to pack our things and get out whenever he felt like it but if anything happens to my cat i will never ever forgive this piece of shit. i hate this man. he has made my life miserable for years. whenever i think he cant step lower he does. this is a life for gods sake. its an innocent life that cant take care of itself. my mom thinks hes doing this out of spite for her. i hate him. i hate him so much. im so tired.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 10:02:18 UTC,2,1,0.75,,content warning animal abuse,0,0
1j3zool,i think my family wont treat my kids the same way they treat my nephew,this is gonna sound completely irrational it most likely is but the title pretty much says it all. my partner and i have been talking about trying to have kids at some point in the near future. i am very much excited at the idea of being a parent. but i have this... i dont know how to explain it feeling of dread or apprehension that my children would not get the same treatment my nephew my older sisters son gets. hes very much the baby of the house which fair hes 3 years old. and i love him very much too but i feel like he gets spoiled. a lot. hes very very possessive and his bad behaviours rarely ever get corrected because my sister goes ahead and makes a big scene about it any time someone thats not her tries to even calmly discipline her son. my mom and dad absolutely adore him and do everything they can for him. i have no idea why but i have this fear my kids would not get the same treatment and affection he does. i know i sound completely insane but i am genuinenly really struggling with the thought.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 09:58:21 UTC,1,7,0.99,,,0,0
1j3ydnr,i wish i had the life of the woman im dating,for context im 17m a student who studies maths physics and chemistry i recently started dating someone 17f an artist. her subjects are all art related except for business. in spending time with her ive started to resent my own what crushed me was that her work was something she enjoyed and that brought her success and recognition but my work is something that drains me and that ive been unsuccessful in for a long time. i keep comparing my life to her and saying i wish i had her life to her which puts a strain on our relationship she said she finds me less attractive when im like that but i cant stop thinking about how much better her life is to mine. edit thank you for all the responses ive already spoken to a school counsellor and she gave me the bare bones dont compare yourself to anyone advice which is easier said than done. secondly by success and recognition i mean that she won an art competition on national tv at a young age and is currently working on art piece that will be displayed in a museum. in recent times ive been feeling hopeless about my own future because i dont think i enjoy maths as much as i used to and she made me realise that life would be a lot better if i enjoyed what i did i just feel really depressed right now about it all,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 08:17:19 UTC,174,69,0.84,,,0,0
