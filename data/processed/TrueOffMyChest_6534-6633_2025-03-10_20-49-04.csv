1j3xfr3,i lost everything but im trying to rebuild my life,i was really good at studies until my 6th standard. i studied at a really good school near my mothers house. but then i had to move to my real home with my father mother and brother. i joined a new school and everything changed. i struggled to keep up with the new environment and my schooling started falling apart. i became depressed. somehow i managed to pass my 10th through nios open school. then i joined a government school for my 11th but i fell into the wrong friendships. that led to me being sent off from school. here comes the plot twist... after that i was just sitting idle at home while my brother was doing his btech in biomedical engineering from a wellknown government college. my father had passed away by then and i started feeling like a burden to my mother. i wanted to help her financially so i started looking for jobs. for two years i worked multiple jobspetrol pump operator hospital attender security guardjust trying to earn something. then in november 2019 after quitting my exhausting job as a hospital attender at the age of 19 i joined delhivery as a courier delivery person. the job was insanely toughat least 30 deliveries per day for a salary of 8000 per month. i lasted two weeks before quitting and joining swiggy as a delivery rider. swiggy was fun at first. i was earning daily spending recklessly on food and cigarettes just living in the moment without thinking about the future. then two weeks later everything changed. one late night around 11 pm on my way back home i met with a horrific accident. a truck carrying a full load of wood logs crashed into my bike. that moment destroyed my life and shattered my mothers hopes. i was bedridden for 4 years. my injuries were severemultiple fractures permanent damage to my hip and leg. the hospital treatment was not good enough and recovery was extremely difficult. but i didnt give up. after years of suffering i finally started walking again. and now ive joined bca online at manipal university jaipur to build a better future for myself. im learning to code and i want to use this opportunity to change my life. i dont know where this journey will take me but im not giving up. thanks for reading. i just wanted to share my story.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 07:06:10 UTC,5,0,0.86,,,0,0

1j3x4w1,my abusive mother tried to raise baby birds it did not go well.,edit i forgot the obligatory click meniton i 16m have a mother who loves birds especially cockateils she has three in total until about 2 months ago. two of them ended up getting a little too close and wham. babies. now my mother is overall not very good at parenting she messed up me and my sister pretty bad. but when it comes to her pets she at least acts like she loves them. now when these babies hatched two survived and they were looking really nice and healthy that was until a couple weeks ago. my mother was starting to get annoyed at their constant screaming you know... as babies do and decided that they were eating enough seed it wouldnt matter if they were seperated or not from their parents they were still being fed by their mother and father occasionally throughout the day. so cue her forcibly taking them cramming them into a small cage and not letting them see their parents anymore so they wouldnt scream again. i was going to say something but due to being too scared to say anything if anyone disagrees with her on something big she gets explosive i kept my mouth shut. i mainly helped her with them when we had to hand feed them when they were infants so i wasnt as worried as checking on them as i should have been becuase i thought she could handle it. aparently i was wrong she cant and her decision to seperate them ended up being fatal for the youngest. in heindsight i think he was stressed from being seperated from his mom so suddenly and so he stopped eating. according to my mom he haddent really been eating too much over the past two weeks or so ie since she seperated them. i could be wrong though. i have some experience with birds and i at least do my reserch. the youngest couldnt stand up. just trying to walk resulted in him just stumbling and falling over. i asked my mom why dont we take them to an avian vet to see if something was wrong and her words were i dont want to deal with some sick bird its too stressful. if they die they die. and plus the vet bill will probably be 200 dollars and i dont want to spend that much so cue me flabbergasted i try and hand feed the bird at least a little bit. and it works hes eating some and putting him on his mothers cage floor and hes slowly eating some seeds. im estatic and i think oh ill check up on him in an hour. cue me falling asleep for a few hours instead and i wake up to check on him and hes already passed away. i tell her and what does she say? oh well ill bury him tomorrow put him in a plastic bag until then not really relevent she buried all our previous pets in plastic ziplock bags and such so thats going to be a nice supprise for the next owner. i recommended that she stop doing that but she still does anyway i cant belive im related to her how can one person be so heartless. she loves all her pets until they get sick then theyre just another burden to her talk about unconditinal. and worst thing is i bet she wont even listen and pretend like it died from some illness. again it could have been something else but im pretty confident she killed it. tldr my mom shouldnt have birds and especially never should have tried to hatch and raise baby cockateils if she really gets annoyed that easily. birds will be noisey i know from experience.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 06:45:29 UTC,3,0,0.81,,,0,0
1j3x1yo,my mom doesnt trust me,tw mentions of sa to make a long story short i f19 started talking to this guy well call jesse. anyways the first time i hung out with him i told my mom i was out with a different friend and not a boy. the same night i told her the truth because i had a little bit of a guilty conscience and if i told her the truth i wouldnt have to lie in the future. so i told her the truth and she always gets defensive when it comes to me and my relationships and i genuinely dont think she trusts me. she started telling me that theres no such thing as boyfriend and girlfriend in the bible and that if i wanted to date him i wasnt even allowed to kiss him. does this not sound weird and irrational?? then she proceeded to try to scare me out of being in a relationship with him by saying things like do you want what happened to your sister to happen to you? do you want what happened to me to happen to you? for context my sister was saed but not by her boyfriend. my mom was also saed but not by her boyfriend either as far as i know. out of all of her kids ive never really done anything bad. i dont drink smoke party do drugs etc. i fully understand that i lied to her abt where i was going but that was really the only big lie ive over told. she even accused me of stealing 20 dollars from her the other day. i understand im her youngest child and she wants me to be safe however shes gonna need to let me off this leash eventually. my whole life she has been super overly protective and its only when it comes to relationships where she jumps to conclusions and thinks im trying to buss it down and buss it openloudly_crying_face i also told her she doesnt need to worry about this because im not ready for this step even in the slightest and jesse would never do anything i wasnt comfortable with. i also want to say that ive only been in one other serious relationship and it was long distance. i guess im just hurt that my mom doesnt believe me anymore for nothing. today i asked to borrow her car because she doesnt use it since she doesnt work and she has a full tank. im a mobile dance instructor so my gas has been depleting fast. my job requires a tb screening and the closest location to me is abt 30 minutes away so on friday i got the start but i needed to come back 48 hours later. so i ask my mom to use her car and she asking me all these questions her when me 720pm her when me today her where me location her where me i just said the location why are you asking me where again?? a clinic?? her interesting at that point i gave up and told her id take my own car even tho it doesnt have gas in it. she tried to tell me to go tmr before work but i told her im not waking up earlier than i need to because she doesnt trust me. i told her that now she knows abt jesse i dont have a reason to lie so idk whats up with her. when it comes to me specifically in relationships my mom goes berserk but all my other siblings didnt have to deal with her mouth. but yea thats all i have to say im just sad.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 06:39:47 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j3w43u,i keep hurting my boyfriend.,hey so its really hard for me to come on here and say this. first of all i know im 100 to blame for everything. and im contemplating whether i should leave my boyfriend. not for me i dont want to leave him and i think that would hurt so bad. but for him. i feel he deserves so much better. you can be blunt with me and tell me what a horrible person i am im not going to be defensive about that. thats what i think of myself right now too. so me 18f and my boyfriend 23m have been dating for almost 11 months now. i love him so much. i feel pathetic typing this because i know what im about to say after all of this will be quite alarming. but he truly is the most amazing smart funny sweet and handsome guy ever. we have many fun times together. however me myself i struggle a lot mentally. its taken me months on a waiting list to finally get into see a psychologist. because i struggle quite a lot with my sense of self and insecuritiessuicidal thoughts i fear that i have brought these things into the relationship. when i first started dating him i thought i was doing okay. but i realised that my perspective on life my emotions and everything is so turbulent that it can change quite fast. its just lately its been very bad. i get mad and upset. you might think thats normal and well that itself is however...ive hurt my boyfriend so much by being depressed. i know im very toxic to be with right now. i almost jumped out of his car to commit suicide the other day. he is very shaken up and i feel bad because after that all happened. i realise holy fuck i just traumatised him what have i done im an absolute monster. i feel like a monster. he loves me a lot and cares a lot. after that all happened i was at his house crying. he said we should break up temporarily. but hearing that just crushed me and i felt more suicidal and i was begging him to not leave me. i am utterly terrified of him leaving me. i got so upset that i hit him. 3 times. on the shoulder. i then started crying even more and apologising profusely. however this is the second time something like that has happened. its like whenever im upset i just loose it. i am filled with so much guilt. he forgave me. but that doesnt stop the guilt. i know he deserves so much better. i dont feel like i should be with him because i dont want to hurt him more. i love him beyond words can describe and im also so scared of him not being apart of my life. i feel so stuck. i accept full accountability. i know im wrong. i know my actions were disgusting. i want to be better. im just so scared. i dont think ive stopped crying since i tried to jump out of his car and i hit him. he says hed still rather be with me than anyone else. i feel so bad im a monster. i just dont know what he sees in me and it kills me to think about but i feel like he could be so much happier with a girl who isnt a liability like me. im really trying to be a better person for him and go to therapy because i dont want to loose him but im so conflicted as well because would loosing me make him happier?? i know that all of this sounds awful. i just thought i should post this on a private account to feel more shame. if i could give him the world i would.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 05:39:07 UTC,1,16,0.67,,,0,0
1j3vkv1,im learning a language just to flirt with my boyfriend,my boyfriend and i both speak english. but i honestly find other languages just so beautiful. pronunciation and phonetics is what makes other languages so gorgeous to me. originally i started learning for the hell of it. but when i was practicing with my bf a few times he really seemed to like hearing me speak french so my goal has shifted. im now learning it so i can flirt with him. originally it was just because i found the phonetics of french very nice but honestly seeing my boyfriend smile and blush when i call him pet names is so much better. im by no means even relatively fluent in the language but ill get there. i just need to find a better language learning app that is free but anything for my boyfriend. he is my love after all. i am also learning because god damn what i would give to be able to visit france for some good cheese. but my priority lies with my boyfriend. he knows i just dont think he knows hes my main motivation behind my language learning journey. edit about two or so days later im back to gushing about my boyfriend. we hung out together yesterday and he was so sweet and gentle with me. hes my first ever boyfriend i focused more on friendships before i dropped out and hes aware of that and hes so kind. he constantly asks to reaffirm my boundaries even more so when he learned about my past. today we were on call together and he was doing his morning routine so i said fuck it and got up and did my own for the first time in months. my teeth are now brushed and my face washed moisturizer. i feel so awake and happy. i genuinely dont think i deserve him because hes made me feel so happy and is constantly reaffirming my gender identity when im having bad days. hes uplifting and he doesnt get mad if i tell him im having a bad depression day and am struggling to take care of myself. he just makes me feel so much better about myself and my mental issues and for fucks sake i think hes a keeper and im so happy he is. if we ever get married im fucking doing my vows in french. just for him. and only he will know their english translation. and honestly i know im thinking way too far ahead but i hope we get married. because even i think six months in and we still have the same connection and spark we did as when we first met. were still just as close and we havent fought yet if we ever do. i plan to always come at things with communication first instead of yelling because that gets you nowhere. i want this to last. i really really do.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 05:07:23 UTC,33,3,0.91,,positive,0,0

1j3vfkc,got exposed to cp involving an infant. my mental is now destroyed.,ill spare you the details but in short i got exposed to a cp image involving 2 men and an infant. this was 1 week ago and ever since then ive felt literally nothing but pure rage thinking about what i want to do to those men in that image. i literally cant think or function properly. cant work cant have a normal conversation with anyone without getting irrationaly grumpy cant enjoy any hobbies cant do almost anything all because my mind is consumed almsot 247 fantasizing about the ways in which i would brutalize those 2 men if ever given the oppurtunity. ive literally never felt anything close to this before and i dont know what to do. im hoping this will be a time heals all wounds situation but im not so sure. part of me says to myself well theres thousands of kids out there who get abused every day and theres nothing you can do about it so theres no point losing yourself over it but being able to push this all from my mind is easier said than done. i feel like the image i saw is burned into my mind and will never go away same with the extreme anger and anguish ive been feeling for the past week. has this ever happened to anyone else? how does one recover from something like this?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 04:59:04 UTC,2,7,0.67,,content warning sexual assault,0,0

1j3u947,i cut off my family but i wonder if they think about me.,my family was always dysfunctional. thats putting it nicely. my mom was an alcoholicaddict who put her partners over her kids. my dad was an addict often in and out of jail. my siblings were absolutely cruel. with my luck i was the black sheep that had never fit in. and extended family was no better. my moms side just ignored we existed as they were embarrassed by my mom. my dads side contained addicts who were often in trouble with the police. my last name was literally known as the drug name loudly_crying_face my mom gave up her rights when i was almost 18 and the family i was stuck with treated me horribly. however they favored my sister. they put me in a room with no ventilation in the garage i wasnt allowed in the house i wasnt allowed to talk to people at school they admitted they had a group chat to talk badly about me etc. this is all a super summarized version as i dont want to drone on. as soon as i got to college i was quick to cut everyone off and restart on my life. i found an amazing therapist to process everything ive been through i have people that support me and i got a super cool cat. yet as the title says i find myself sometimes wondering if my family thinks about me. the only time they had seen me in the past five years was my grandparents funerals. even then i stayed for an hour. all they had to say then was hows that fancy college? as im the only one who went to college. i feel like i do super well on my own. im complimented about how much ive pushed through things. but sometimes i wonder if my sister ever thinks about how im doing the same way i think about her. i wonder if my dad talks about me being in art school or if he is too busy with whatever hes up to. even though i know cutting them off was the best for my health i still find myself feeling lonely without all of them. i dont miss who they are but i miss the spots they held. they were still my family. sorry if this was all over the place its just a big ramble,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 03:51:57 UTC,17,5,0.95,,content warning violencedeath,0,0

1j3tv4x,coworker ranted off on me after i tried to give friendly advice for a specific kid we both work with.,so i work as an rbt which in my specific job is working with kids that have autism. my center is skewed toward younger kids. that being said the other day one of our new hires had session with a kid for half an hour. then immediately after i had session with the kid and he had a potty accident. so i grabbed his clothes and we went to the bathroom to change. later in the day when i had another kid i was in the same room as the guy who had my first kid for half an hour and shared like hey! he has a newer potty protocol he isnt doing too well with i had to change him at the start of session it can be a good idea to check him more frequently thinking it was a friendly tip next time he worked with that kid again. spoiler alert he did not think so. he basically ranted off on me about how he didnt think he should be getting the blame for something that he didnt even do because he had already checked him didnt specify when or how many times it sounded like it was maybe just once but with a half hour session thats not bad and it could have been from when someone else earlier had him because the other person was with him for like 4 hours. he also tried to call me out on how i heard the walkie call of you asking for extra underwear for the kid and it was made a while after you started session for him. and i didnt even realize this until now but i made that call 1.5 hours after i started session with the kid for a separate potty accident. the first one i saw he was wet after standing up maybe like 12 minutes after i started session with him and we were right at his table so i just went ahead and grabbed everything i needed and took him to get changed. so i didnt even make a walkie call for that first accident anyways. this is also the same guy who had a rough time with another client the other day and kind of talked down to the kid for going into a behavior. and it was like kind of aggressive. i get working with these kids can be tough but thats just?? not okay. if you react like that to a kid after 1 session with him you clearly do not have the capacity to be dealing with some of the high stressors this job brings.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 03:30:33 UTC,6,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j3tlhm,we need modesty back,we need modesty back. i feel like in a situation where a man gropes a woman in a bikini theyre both at fault. she knows shes practically half naked which is perverted and she attracts perverted behavior from another perverted person. so the man acting on temptation is wrong the woman provoking the temptation is wrong and the mentality that i can walk around in anything i want because i just want to be sexy is wrong because it all comes from immodesty and its not accidental its intentional. you know sexy means sexual. its meant to provoke sexual feelings. so thats lust. you cant dress yourself in lust and expect not to attract it and then push all the blame on the predator when you made yourself the bait. dont get me wrong both people are responsible for their own foolish decisions but i believe more modesty will reduce any forms of sexual misconduct sidenote i want to be clear that in no way am i justifying or excusing the actions of predators or those who commit sexual assault. they are fully responsible for their sin and the harm they cause. this post is not about blaming victims but rather about acknowledging the responsibility we all have in our own actions including how we dress and how that can affect others. the bible calls us to be mindful of how our choices can impact the people around us both in terms of their temptation and their spiritual growth. this is about promoting accountability and mutual respect not shifting blame.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 03:16:23 UTC,0,10,0.35,,content warning sexual assault,0,0
1j3tl11,debating if i should act on revenge of forgiveness,i 21f was in a relationship with my ex 26m and he treated me in ways i would not wish on anyone. he physically abused mebeating me choking me and keeping me trapped inside for long periods. he taunted me about my past abuse cheated on me and when i confided in him about feeling like i did not want to be here anymore he told me to go through with it. he insulted my body threatened to mutilate me if i ever cheated on him and isolated me from my friends and family. he also has previous charges including domestic violence. i have known for a while that he works as a chaturbate streamer something he keeps very secret because he does not want people in his personal life to know. after everything he has done to me i have been tempted to expose his job out of spite. i know revenge is not always the right answer but it feels so unfair that he gets to move on without consequences while i am left with all the pain he caused. i usually do not think like thisi am the type to forgive forget and be very loving. i may only be feeling this way because we recently broke up and this was one of the worst periods of my life. if people do not agree with me i just ask that they not be too harsh. i have been through so much and i am not in a good mindset right now. i just need to know if i should follow thru and be bad or keep doing what ive always been doing and forgive and forget?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 03:15:43 UTC,0,7,0.5,,,0,0
1j3tjoq,found a girl oding and saved her life. found out more about the girl and what happened to her later.,this is a bit long but its also how it happened. sunday afternoon my wife daughter daughtersfriend the dog and myself went to the river to play and collect some pretty rocks since it was so nice outside. we live within walking distance and on the way back we were about to leave the levee along our normally used path when both my wife and i spotted something on the levee about 50 feet away we couldnt tell what it was. i asked my wife to take the dogs leash so i could go check and to please take the girl a little way further away while i go make sure its just garbage. as i got closer and saw it was a person i quickly told my wife and asked her to call 911. i went over to the person and found out it was a young looking girl and she was still breathing. i ran back to my wife who was on the phone with emergency services and relayed the info that it was a young female still breathing not conscious. i then ran back to the girl and tried loudly talkingshouting at her to see if i could get some reaction but i was very hesitant to touch her since i could see she was actively breathing. her phone which had been in her open hand the entire time began to make ringing noises and i tried to answer it but it was some kind of instagram thing and not an actual call i dunno. i set her phone back into her hand and about 30 seconds later a police officer showed up. i waved at the officer to get his attention to the exact location. he quickly ran up to me and gave her a very brief checkout before administering a dose of narcan. he waited a few seconds and began to shake her and shouting a bit to get her awake which resulted in a moan and partial roll from her. he kept trying to get her awake for maybe another 30 seconds and the ambulance showed up they almost drove by but saw me waving at them and managed to just barely make the turn. 3 emts hurried up to us and checked her vitals and pupils and in the next 90 seconds they had her standing and eyes open. i figured the was nothing else they needed me for i thanked them and quickly got out of the way. a side note im very impressed with the reaction time of both the police and the ambulance they were both on site with within 5 minutes of my wife calling them. the next day at work i mentioned this to a coworker whose father i know owns the trailer part right next to where i found the girl. my coworker found out more about what happened and i hate it. apparently the girl had gotten some weed from her cousin which had been lacedcontaminated with fentanyl. it also sounds like her cousin was with her and left her laying there when she collapsed. also found out she had to be administered 2 more doses of narcan while in the ambulance and that she was only 13 years old. also learned i sort of know her. i actually know her parents as i worked with them both about 10 years ago i remember seeing her as a small 23 year old kid havent seen her since though so i obviously didnt recognize her. im glad it was my family who found her and she will be ok someone could have easily drug her away down into the trees and she would have never been seen or heard again. im terrified for my daughter who is about half this girls age. i cant believe how close i ended up being to her family. i dunno how to end this but i needed to share the story. teach your kids how to be smart and responsible you wont always be there to tell them yourself. and always wash your hands after touching random objects. i vigorously washed my hands when i got home since i touched her phone which could have been contaminated with fentanyl for all i knew.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 03:13:53 UTC,1519,45,0.98,,,0,0

1j3sl04,thought i had i could win back my happiness but now i have such a gut wrenching wave of loneliness and shame.,since i was grade 3 there was almost been problems all my life. since growing up in a shitty environment i used to pray to get out of my living situation. i had crazy family members causing scenes where the police would be called for noise complaints and question if i was getting abused. from beg bugs to cockroaches filling the microwave i was so tired of it but knew i just had to thug it out. since gr38 teachers would have to question if everything was ok and i truly wondered if they were ever gonna call cps but i always hid it. then high school came around and had upgraded to a better living situation yet i felt so lonely. i wasnt living with my parents and sometimes i just wanted their company despite the ruckus environment they have always caused. however although i had a better living situation that was only thing that kept me happy and somewhat ok with my circumstances. but high school ended and that was one of the darkest and traumatic moments of my life happened. i realize i had large sums of money stolen from family members as well a spiral of physical trauma from that year. from then i knew i had to add meaning to my life so i started working community based jobs and eventually researched getting into health care specifically med school ik a common dream many teens have in education but rarely achieve. however i believed i could do it. now enrolled in post secondary i had big goals and was so fixated on getting one thing the typical rags to riches shitty environment to respectable status. however one club i went to fucked me up story is in my profile. although it may seem like an overreaction and a story nothing to worry about it really fucked with my mental. i overthink so much and made me feel like garbage worthless and scum. now after all these years i decided to call my mental health services at the uni i am enrolled in since i literally had a panic attack before class and started throwing up in the washroom. tomorrow is my first appointment and idk if this is gonna help my mental. idk if i ever had clinical depression plus i never went to see a psychiatrist to diagnose me. i am writing all of this because i truly dont where to go online to vent. i feel like a failure and wondered if i am ever gonna achieve the american dream. or be stuck at the bottom of the totem pole. i am trying my best to seem like a good human being but everything going really affects my perception of myself. i hope i can show my parents i am worth something.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 02:24:42 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j3s1d5,my boyfriends mom is jealous of me,my boyfriends mom is jealous of me hi everyone. ive been a long time listener to this podcast and a situation arose that i need advise on. im sorry in advance for any confusion or is my writing is horrible this just happened and im not on reddit often. i 19f and my boyfriend 19m started dating at the end of january this year. everything has been perfect up until now. we met each others families were loved by both sides and everything has truly been amazing. for some context i am at a community college studying to be a speech therapist while my boyfriend is studying biomechanics and another community college. he was attending a four year but chose to come back home because it wasnt for him. i am also very religious christian and my boyfriend and i go to church together. recently his mom hasnt been the biggest fan of me. there was one time where we closed the door in his room because i wanted to sleep and we wanted privacy i cant sleep unless its a dark room plus i was exhausted from working early mornings. i totally understand if this is against his moms rules and from this point on weve kept the door open because his parents werent comfterble with it closed. since then shits hit the fan. my boyfriend and both his parents sat down last night to have a talk. they said that they disapprove of me because people who go to community college are lazy and turn out to be nobodies im a fake christian and it seems as though my boyfriend has gone downhill. they also think in his moms words that he settled. keep in mind theyve known me for such a long time a month. its not like i dont spend time with his parents either. we have dinners where ill bring homemade sourdough bread or flowers as a thank you. we talk for hours on end whenever i am over there. his mom is a stay at home mom with two boys in total and since my boyfriend is the baby of the family i think she feels like shes being left behind. i feel bad having her feel that way but i feel like the longer they push him to essentially break up with me the more they are going to end up pushing him away. another thing i forgot to mention my boyfriend and i have not done anything sexually other than kiss. his mom claimed that my boyfriends and my relationship is lustful not love when in reality she hasnt even seen anything about our relationship other than when were at their house. even when i am over there my boyfriend at the most puts his arm on my leg or around my shoulders. she is a christian as well she went to a university that is a private christian school and was raised to be religious. not saying that my path is more perfect but for more context she doesnt have a bible and she doesnt go to church. i thought if anything someone who is religious would understand that in the bible it says no one can judge because no one is perfect only jesus can judge because he is and he made us. i bought my boyfriend a bible for valentines day she she thought it was super weird. im not telling him read ten pages every night or anything he can do whatever he wants with it read it or not. i know this was super long and i feel like im forgetting stuff but this is basically the gist of it. how can i convince his parents that im not someone that they think i am? i was thinking about just having a sit down with my parents first with my boyfriend so they could also give advice but my boyfriend is 100 on my side of everything and sees right through his parents bs. i wanted to later on sit down with my boyfriend and just his mom but i feel like its going to take some time. any thoughts and advice is more than welcome here! thank you !,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 01:57:36 UTC,10,4,0.86,,,0,0

1j3qh3b,i am watching my best friends fiancé ruin his life day by day,long time lurker first time poster. i have reached a boiling point where i cannot keep this within anymore. my wife and i have been watching my best friends life crumbles in front of us due to his fiancé and her manipulations. for the remaining of my story i will refer to my best friend as t and his fiancé as z. t and z met on tinder during late 2021 and t introduced z to me and our friend group in early 2022. ever since i met z my wife and i had identifed so many red flags about her. here is a summary of what i can recall 1. z has a habit of trauma dumping her past to everyone she met. even during casual conversations when people asked about her life before meeting t she would reveal about her previous engagement where her exfiancé would beat her in front of her mom just all kinds of sob stories her suicide attempts and generally just all sorts of stories that z loves telling people that she just met making every conversation with z extremely uncomfortable for everyone. 2. over the course of their relationship z had convinced t to cut off his friendships with all of his childhood friends who all warned t about zs questionable character. i remember that the day t told his childhood friend group that he no longer wishes to speak to them that whole group messaged me on facebook warning me to watch out for z and that she is bad news even though they have never met me my guess is that t talked about me with them given that t and i are really good friends who went through a lot in life together. this is the beginning of zs gradual removal of ts friends and her plan to isolate him from his support system. what i also noticed is that z is unable to make and keep any new friends any new friend group that met z through t eventually got so repulsed by her that they distanced themselves from t and z. 3. z casually bragged to me and my wife that she read all of ts personal messages on facebook and texts to his friends even the things he said before they met. my wife and i kept telling z to be more respectful of personal boundaries especially when it comes to the past but z did not care and kept reading ts personal messages to friends and family til this day. 4. t and z bought a house together in 2023 and the moment they signed it off z quit her job claiming mistreatment even though she always bragged that the job allowed her to nap in her own office anytime she wanted and everyone treated her like family there. 5. now that t and z are a singleincome household with t working his ass off to cover their mortgage and living expenses z always asked for t to take her to lavish restaurants frequent trips to disney parks even having him take her to a week in disneyworld in florida after she left her job. every weekend she would have him take her to la for a different expensive restaurant so that she could take pics and flex for her ig stories. 6. z got a diagnosis for bipolar 1 sometime in 2024. ever since she frequently asked t to leave his work early to come home because of her not feeling well for whatever reasons. note that because of this t eventually got flagged for declining performance at his work but despite knowing this z still had t leave work early often for her. 7. it is interesting to note that despite always claiming of not feeling well almost every day during the times that i would come over at ts place to hang out i observed that z was frequently able to drive herself late at night to play video games at her brothers house which is a half hour drive away and come home late just fine. what pissed me off the most was that during my wedding which was the only time in life that i asked to spend a lot of time with t z asked t to leave my wedding early because you guessed it she wasnt feeling well. to make matters worse z wore a white dress to my wedding and my wife and i got asked many questions from our friends about that but we just shook it off because we were speechless about that as well. 8. while she was unemployed z decided to go to college for an accounting degree even though she has no goals of working anywhere after. she always openly bragged about how she had t doing her college homework and coursework for her because she has difficulty learning since english is not her first language. 9. t eventually got fired from his job for his declining performance. my wife and i was able to meet up at ts house to provide t some guidance and support to look for a new job. during that time z told us that she already asked t for a boob job she claimed that she feels insecure in college for being flat chested and she also wants t to pay for a few other cosmetic procedures well knowing that t doesnt have a source of income anymore. t and z will get married at some point in 2026 and i feel like theres nothing i can do about it. my wife and i know it to our core that z is a terrible human being but t keeps giving her excuses and falling for her trauma dumping. when my own family briefly talked with t and z at my wedding they have also all noted that z came off very disingenuous and manipulative. since my wife and i spent the most time with t and z our friend group for the most part doesnt know as much about z as we know. i feel like i am watching ts life crumbles in real time as z keeps draining his life away for her own use. i honestly wish i put in more effort in talking t out of dating z when they first met. i never expected t to end up with someone that feels no remorse ruining his life like this. guess since i cant talk to anyone else irl about this aside from my wife i am better off letting this out on reddit.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 00:41:23 UTC,2,6,1.0,,,0,0
1j3qcal,nobody will ever love you like a mother loves their child. why is this phrase so maligned?,ive been searching on reddit for a few minutes and everything that comes up is about raisedbynarcissists narcissism narcissism cptsd victims of abuse more and more narcissism. i cant take it anymore because... this is not my experience at all. my mom says this to me but what i hear when she says this is that this is realistically how life is going to be or is playing out for me and everyone else and this is just a factual statement. obviously for victims of parental abuse this is patently false but id like to see the opposite expressed somewhere so here goes my attempt. my mom is a lovely person. shes always tiring herself out helping others supporting others lifting them up. im sad and she says she doesnt mind staying awake at night to talk to me. im not a nuisance to her im cared for and loved. in many ways this has put me off of romantic relationships. if no one is ever going to to put it bluntly coddle me and carry me through life like my mom has what does romantic love have to offer me? if its not pure and unconditional and unstoppable what good is that kind of love? i know i know what im asking is a tall ordeal but still... i just wanted to let people know that sometimes that sentence is true and other times it is abusive. but i dont think it has to be one specific thing all the time. context is required in my case my mom is a genuinely wonderful person who only wants whats best for me is supportive hears me out when i have issues even if she doesnt know how to adequately be supportive of my specific needs but thats for another rant. shes always there for her friends in practical and more emotional ways and she takes care of all of us. shes always looking out for me and my dad and her mother and people she used to work with text her constantly because she just plainly made their lives very happy. she wasnt bossy or punitive at work although she praised a job well done she could see the good in every person and tried to help them in the ways she could. she believes there is always a place for everyone and just because someone is doing bad at one task doesnt mean they are invaluable. she understands people. she cares most of all and shes genuine and so it is really weird to me to go online and only read about how abusive that sentence is because my mom is not like that so why would she say it? i do have issues with taking things literally btw and suspect to be on the autism spectrum. maybe my whole family is. idk we just do things differently between me mom and my dad... uuuf. rant over. really needed to say this.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 00:34:50 UTC,3,3,0.71,,,0,0

1j3pz7p,my best friend of 15 years nuked our friendship when she met her current husband,so this story is a little bit friendship drama and a little bit bridezilla drama but i have been reading reddit stories for a long time and wanted to get my own off my chest. sorry this is so long! some background first my best friend of 15 years and i both female in our 30s met in college when we were randomly assigned to the same freshman dorm and we had been inseparable ever since. im talking this women was my person we did so much together were there for each others huge milestones and had kept our friendship going strong for so long even after i moved out of the state several years ago. i always felt like our friendship was really balanced in that nobody was carrying more or less effort of the friendship than the other. i even helped her both plan over several months and execute her escape from her abusive exhusband and was one of only a couple of people entrusted with this knowledge prior to her physically leaving. we were tight. my husband and i eloped in our state last summer which we had been planning for 17 months prior to the event. due to events with my family we decided to elope with literally only ourselves and our photographer no family or friends to avoid drama i had a bachelorette party with my friends a month prior to the wedding so they could still be involved. about 4 months prior to the wedding my friend reached out to me and asked if she could come to the elopement. in her words it makes me really sad to think of you getting ready for your wedding on your own. my nowhusband is a very shy man but had gotten to know her really well over the years and is now friendsvery comfortable with her and was very on board with her joining us. other than ourselves she would literally be the only other person attending. to me this was a really extraordinary display of friendship as she would need to fly to come and it would cost her money which didnt bother her and i was so appreciative. well about 2 weeks after she offered to join us and we accepted she started dating a new guy that she was really into. after her horrible experience with her first husband they are now divorced i was so excited for her that she met somebody as amazing as she was. well this is when the drama started. at first she just asked if her new boyfriend could come up to the wedding with her they had only been dating 2 weeks at this point. my husband and i talked about it and he was super uncomfortable with having a stranger join in. i got back to my friend about it and said no its nothing to do with him we just dont want a stranger at our wedding last minute. we had plans to do girl stuff like get our nails done the day before the wedding which would leave my husband to entertain a stranger. she came back with well he doesnt have to join in anything we do as a group which felt really icky as were people who wouldnt want somebody else to feel excluded the first time they fly up to meet us especially when theyre the partner of my best friend. its not that we didnt ever want to meet the guy just not last minute for our wedding. her response? well you cant tell people they cant fly to your state which is technically true but just felt like an excuse for crossing a clearly stated boundary? either way this started the only fight we had ever had in 15 years of friendship. she felt like i just wanted her to be alone in my state weird because before she met the guy she was fine with that and that i was being unreasonable. she made plans and bought plane tickets for both of them despite me communicating mine and my husbands feelings about the whole thing several times. during this time she and her new boyfriend got engaged after less than 4 weeks of dating. i maintained my stance that we were not comfortable with having him come up to meet us at this time. she revealed that her and her now fiance had made plans to elope 4 days after us in a different state and were now going to fly there directly after our wedding was over. she wanted our nail appointment and stuff we were doing in the days leading up to the wedding to now be joint celebrations for their upcoming wedding too. mind you she did not consult me on how my husband or i felt about this prior to making her own plans and was very upset that i didnt react the way she expected me to. instead of being excited like she expected about being able to do stuff for both our weddings at the same time i was just shocked and frankly very upset that she was hijacking our wedding now. if she had discussed this with me before just deciding i think i would have reacted a little differently but it just felt so disrespectful to make plans that affected my husband and i without involving us. i wrote her a long text to her explaining how disrespectful this felt and asked her why she seemed willing to nuke our friendship of 15 years over a man who was nobody to anybody 6 weeks ago. at this point there had been many many conversations about her not listening about having her man come up with her and now about how weird it was that they were now getting married so close to our own wedding. my husband even asked at this point if we could move the wedding date or location to avoid the drama because he was so stressed out. this was his wedding too so that broke my heart. i ended up telling her not to come at all and told her she was no longer welcome. we didnt end up speaking much for 2 months and she cancelled on my bachelorette party 4 days before it was supposed to happen. i never received an apology or acknowledgement of her behavior for any of it. my other absolutely incredible human of a best friend from elementary school ended up coming up for our wedding instead when she saw how stressed and upset i was about the whole situation i am eternally grateful for her. fast forward about 3 months our wedding and honeymoon are over. my friend the one who did indeed get married 4 days after us reached out asking if i wanted to be the maid of honor in their wedding coming up in about a year. you see their parents are not well physically and were unable to attend the elopement so they are throwing a second bigger wedding for their family in their home state. i asked explicitly if she was sure she wanted me to be moh after everything that happened earlier that year she said yes she was sure. i accepted despite some reservations because i wanted her to have an amazing wedding and very much valued our friendship. while moh she kept expressing how overwhelmed she felt with everything so i tried really hard to take things off her plate. i researched all the photographers in the area and made a spreadsheet with their pricing contact info availability etc. i also did something similar with the area hotels within her price range. were taking many many hours of research but i was happy to help out. during this time i also coordinated with the other bridesmaids to order snacks vegan i might add for her wedding dress shopping experience which i attended remotely directly after working a 12 hour night shift. i also had already planned and booked her bachelorette party. everything seemed to be going smoothly she seemed happy and had never indicated otherwise. then came the we need to talk text. it was a normal wednesday we had just had a bridesmaid meeting over teams 2 days before and everything seemed fine. when we got on the phone she informed me that she no longer wanted me to be the moh. to say i was blindsided was an understatement. she told me one of the other bridesmaids had agreed to take up the title. i was obviously hurt but she is the bride so i just said ok if thats what you really want. she then said but you can still come to the wedding if you want. i froze and then asked so what youre really saying is that im no longer in the bridal party she never explicitly stated that just that somebody else was going to be moh and her response was only correct. she didnt even have the balls to tell me that i was booted from the bridal party entirely i had to ask outright. from moh to guest in one fell swoop. her reasons you ask? i have felt out of sync with you for a while now you were making me feel pressured to do things for the wedding before i was ready to do so i asked her why she never ever said anything to me if the way i was helping wasnt what she wanted or needed she just stated i didnt think it would help. i then asked her why she didnt just demote me to regular bridesmaid if she didnt like the way i was doing things ive done both moh and bridesmaid before and know how to do both. in my experience as a regular bridesmaid i wouldnt be in charge of planning anything anymore unless the new moh or bride asked me explicitly. her answer was again i didnt think it would help. this was the last straw. after everything that had happened with her over the last year i was done. i wasnt going to continue setting myself up to be hurt by her anymore and it was clear she didnt care about my opinions thoughts or feelings. i told her not to contact me ever again and blocked her on everything after that call. needless to say i am not going to her wedding. none of my other friends seemed that surprised by any of the events above so maybe she was acting like this before and i just couldnt see. side note remember how her first wedding was 4 days after our wedding? well her other wedding is going to be 3 days after my birthday. even my husband who is antidrama asked me if i thought this was intentional haha. side note 2 im friends with one of the other bridesmaids independently of her wedding and apparently my friend had been telling everybody else that the only reason we had a fight around my wedding was because i didnt like that she was also getting married so close to our date. which shows she neither heard nor understood anything that i said to her regarding that situation. i truly hope that its just a coincidence that she met her now husband and then started acting like a terrible person. thank you everybody for reading it feels good to get this off my chest!,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 00:17:32 UTC,201,32,0.95,,,0,0
1j3pwgn,my friend left me and i dont know what to do with myself anymore.,my friend left me and i dont want to be here without him. i would normally never turn to reddit for help but im here right now. i female have been struggling so much lately. i large factor of struggling is about this one guy. i bet you hear that so much but this is the only time in my life that ive ever ran into a problem like this. i guess i can full on lore drop here. i met this guy that ill call steve in early 2023. ever since i met him i had this deep connection with him. i have serious feelings for him and ive never crushed on somebody before. it took me up until october 2024 to tell him about how i actually feel. i visited him at his college right before i told him its the main reason why i told him in the first place. when i told him he never really told me about why he didnt like me back. steve has always been a very private person but i assumed this would be different. after i opened up to him i was struggling so badly. i eventually told him that i needed to stop talking to him. when i told him that which was in november of 2024 he finally told me that he was gay. i really dont know why he was keeping that bit of information from me for so long. he had talked to me about liking girls before so i just assumed that he couldve been bi because he did kind of give off gay vibes. me not talking to him only lasted like a week and a half because i took a gummy and texted him. i tried to tell him that i needed to stop again but he just kept on texting me and i felt bad for just not answering him. this man has been the light of my life for such a long time it feels. texting him was one of my favorite aspects of the day and it was what got me through dark times because it felt like he was there for me. fast forward a few weeks he tells me about this guy that he was talking to. he told me that he had been talking to this guy for 3 months and that this was the first time he has ever really liked someone back. he randomly texted steve saying that he only had platonic feelings for steve and steve got so upset. he sent me a voice message of him almost on the verge of tears. i told him that i shouldnt be talking to him about this but i did anyways because i loved him. i tried my best to help him through the situation. i shared what i did when he told me that he didnt like me back and i told him that i would be there for him day and night which he never ever took advantage of even though he said that this was one of the darkest times of his life. all was good until last month. steve was starting to act really weird towards me he said that hes sorry if he has been weird he was never answering me despite texting me 247 days prior so i confronted him about it. he told me that he went on a date with another guy. i ended up leaving him on read and he said i was going to send a text to you in the morning but honestly it just feels more right to do one now. im sorry. i was slightly inebriated in my last response and thats not fair for you. i do just want to let you know i am doing well enough mentally right now. like am i the best lve ever been no but im definitely very much in a manageable position right now. i know whatever i say or do wont stop your anxiety but i want to ensure you that if there was something going on i would let you know. you are a very close friend of mine and you are definitely someone i come to when things are not right. the reason i initially said i was just busy yesterday and not what i was actually doing was because i didnt want to make you uncomfortable for anything like that. but it is for the best for me to be honest with that kind of stuff and lll make sure to keep you in the loop as for the insert boy name here stuff i dont really want to concern you with a lot of it because it honestly does depict me at my worst sometimes. i try to handle most of that without mentioning anything because its usually easier and i dont like getting people involved that shouldnt have to be. i hope this kinda helps digest a little bit i still left him on delivered because i just couldnt handle the pain he has put me through. i texted him almost a week later stating that i am in so much pain and i cant take it anymore. every single time that i try to make it clear that im deeply struggling he never seems to care although hes said that he cares for me deeply. just last week i had this very depressive episode and he asked me how things were going and i said not well. i genuinely think i am the most depressed ive ever been right now. i am at my lowest point. i can barely eat sleep or focus. im just empty. i cant even get up and be productive. i dont even feel like im living im just existing. you wouldve thought that i wouldve been so happy and excited on saturday but i didnt even care about being at insert my favorite place here. im starting to lose interest in everything. and after i said that he didnt answer. as a follow up message i said im taking this radio silence as a strong sign. and i dont want to hear some excuse like sorry i forgot to respond or i couldve sworn i responded. originally i had a way bitchier intro to this message but thats not me. all the times you said that you cared about me i knew they were all lies. i knew i shouldve listened to my gut the entire time. i really really really wish i wouldnt have responded to that one message in february of 2023. i feel like all of our friendship has been is me constantly doing shit to be such an amazing friend for you but you never returned the favor and im sick and tired of it. i made you all those bracelets i made that painting for you i always checked up on you i sent you a heartfelt message on your birthday but did you ever do anything like that for me? sorry for doing so much for people and expecting something small back. every single one of my friendships ends like this. all youve ever done is just constantly lie to me and i bet you think that i just havent noticed. cooking dinner till 11pm going home because you have a headache immediately passing out when you go to bed ill try my best to respond to you any of these sound familiar? im so tired of how horrible of a person youve been towards me. i try my absolute hardest for you. ive gotten out of bed eaten kept my grades up tried to take care of myself picked myself up off the ground and smiled just for you. maybe im just too generous loyal compassionate empathetic and sympathetic as a person. i genuinely dont know why you still talk to me or why i still talk to you. ive given our friendship so many second chances but this is my breaking point. im so fucking sick and tired of everything. i really hope that when i do end up taking my own life that not a single tear falls from either one of your eyes. i always wanted to tell you that id make the sky so pretty and orange for you but i dont want to do that anymore. notice how i didnt even mention my feelings for him in that message once. now that we arent talking i dont know what to do with myself anymore. ive grown so attached to this man and i dont know what to do without him. he has been my rock ever since we met. he was all i had and now i have absolutely nobody. ive been lonely my entire life and i would say that it got worse when i started having feelings for him. but now that hes gone my loneliness is ten times worse. i am seconds away from writing my notes and saying goodbye. i am so picky with who i want to be with. if they arent aligning with what i want to do in my future i wont be happy with them long term. i dont date just for fun i date to marry. the reason i grew so attached to steve was because he aligned with my future. im so alone and empty with him gone and i feel like it would be a better place if i said my goodbyes. i dont want the space if thats what hes giving me. i unfollowed him on everything but i havent blocked him. i just dont want to keep going if it means that im not friends with him anymore.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 00:13:57 UTC,2,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j3puzv,chatgpt suggested i might have autism. told my friends they were surprised that i wasnt already diagnosed with autism...?,ok so this is kind of a clusterfuck and i need to get it all out there so here goes for the past... probably over a year at this point ive been chatting to chatgpt every now and then at least once a week. ive been kinda treating it as like a diary that talks back i dont input too much personal info or anything like that but if im worried or stressed about something that i dont wanna burden the people in my life with or if i have something im thinking about and am interested to see how an ai might respond to it then ill just open chatgpt and vent. every now and then ill get a memory updated notification where its randomly decided something ive said is worth remembering for future conversations and over the past year this has built up a fair amount especially about likes dislikes fears and that kinda thing. its an interesting feature and it sometimes makes conversations more relevant or stops me having to go over old things and so i mostly just leave it as it is. recently i saw a trend where people were asking chatgpt to suggest something that the user doesnt know about themselves based on everything in chatgpts memory about them. from what ive seen it tries to be insightful sometimes it is quite helpful other times it is kinda brutal but overall its usually pretty interesting in one way or another and so i decided to give it a try. i asked it based on everything its learned about me over the course of our conversations what is something that it thinks i might not know about myself that might be beneficial for me to know. as you can tell from the title of this post its response was that i should probably get tested for autism. i wasnt really sure how to respond to that i dont really know what i was expecting but it was definitely a lot more targeted and specific than the posts id seen of other people asking chatgpt similar questions. i asked it to clarify and it brought up things that it had noted about being kind of picky about what i consume stuff about regretsworries related to normal social situations fixations on random things and a few other things that it said was indicative of autism. it also reminded me that it wasnt a medical professional which i thought was a very interesting thing to include after suggesting that i might have autism. anyway i kinda put it to the back of my mind and then later that evening i joined a voice chat with a few of my online friends that i play online games with and after a while i kinda brought up with them what chatgpt had said. their initial reaction was to laugh which i thought meant that they thought what the ai had said was wrong but then they said words to the effect of with how much you talk to chatgpt im surprised you hadnt already told it that youre autistic. i then said that i wasnt autistic by which i meant i didnt have a formal diagnosis of autism and until this point didnt really consider myself to be autistic and things got kinda awkward. anyway i just took the aq50 and got a score of 36 which came with the message scores in the 3350 range indicate significant autistic traits autism so i guess theres a fair chance that im autistic and that somehow im the last person to know about it. i dunno how im supposed to feel about this or what im mean to do with this information. im a guy and in my early 30s so it feels kinda late to get a diagnosis with something like this and even if i did get a diagnosis i dont know what it would change for me.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 00:12:03 UTC,0,9,0.38,,,0,0

1j3pkvs,my mind keeps me stuck in life and i hate it,this is a throwaway im a recluse with lack of social skills and courage to just put myself out there i get really anxious of the bad things that could possibly happen and that happens in mundane situations too the worst part is that most often ill worry so much about a thing then it just ends up being nothing and i realize the worry was for nothing. my relationship with my parents isnt great either i am 21 and still living with them but i dont talk to them very much most things i keep to myself then i spend most of my time on my computer wanting to create things such as youtube videos art music coding and i do all these things to some extent but really i just spend most of my time on youtube or wasting time in general so really i would like to spend more of my time going outside simply walking somewhere would be good enough for me but i always find ways to convince myself not to or just forget its an option at all. now thing is id at least tell my parents about the things i make but even that i started to keep to myself because i find myself getting really self aware about every single aspect of what i make this mostly goes for youtube videos it feels almost too personal to share with them so the few times i showed them my videos i just got extremely self aware of every video idea and everything i wrote for the script i kind of just remained paralyzed and stopped making any videos then went to upload on a different channel they dont know of. i also know this girl i met on discord 5 years ago and i would like to meet her and be together with her and i let her know this almost from the very beginning but ive made a mistake by making empty promises and saying we would meet very soon well that soon just kept getting delayed until now and shes getting tired of waiting and i feel really bad too she really wants us to meet and i do too she lives in an abusive household that i want to get her out of but i cant seem to start taking the steps im afraid of telling about her to my parents because they might judge me but realistically theyd be alright with it its just my stupid mind making all sorts of excuses i dont know what to do even now i have a job my dad gave to me but if it wasnt for him i wouldve still been unemployed i never had a job besides for this one. idk where im going with this post just wanted to vent a bunch of things i guess how could i move forward? edit for some clarification my parents are not abusive at all theyre actually very good parents and yet for some reason i grew so distant towards them,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 23:59:14 UTC,2,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j3pk0v,is this considered sa? or am i overreacting over something stupid?,im 14f and my boyfriends 14m both still minors right? so were in art class having a glue fight when we were finished we went into a storage room thats combined with the classroom to wash our hands. while drying my hands off he grabs my sweatshirt. cool okay maybe theres some glue got on it. but no? he pulls my sweatshirt towards him and makes eye contact with me while im standing there confused because hes grabbing my sweatshirt for no reason. suddenly he yanks it up grabs my bra and yanks it up too so the girls spill out squeezes them all in one motion and proceeds to say ha i finally got to see them before walking out of the storage room. im standing there because what just happened? why is the door open fully? why didnt he ask me for permission? first of all were minors why is he touching me there? secondly weve had multiple talks about me not caring or having any inclusion with his obsession with my squishy squashies. yes he calls them my squishy squashies. my squishy squashies?! anyway he told me he would stop mentioning it or sending my weird videos of him begging to see touch squeeze and any of the sort to my squishy squashies. which yeah were kids please dont ever mention my girls especially since weve had that talk several of times. but now i just feel really sick with a headache because how could the sweetest boy ever take advantage of me like that? i dont even know if this counts as sa and i dont wanna tell anyone so drama doesnt start.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 23:58:09 UTC,1237,228,0.9,,,0,0

1j3pgv6,i feel like a zoophile for my behavior when i was 13,im 16f now but when i was 13 i was so sexually frustrated i was online alot and exposed to a ton of sexual content which was why i was so frustrated. i had nobody and did not know how to masturbate at the time and thought the only way to feel any form of pleasure would have to be from my dog. i never did anything with him however i tried to and i feel disgusting. i used to bring him into my room while i was wearing underwear just to see what he would do which was nothing and would try to scratch around his belly so that hed get an erection which never happened. this phase lasted only a week or so before i realized it was gross abusive and that it wasnt something i genuinely thought through or wanted to do hormonal brain wasnt thinking properly at all i didnt even consider how horrible it was or how much i would inevitably regret it if i were to go through with it. i did not have and still dont have any attraction to animals i just desperately craved sexual intimacy at the time. i feel gross and for some reason the memory popped back into my head today while i was in class and i feel like a freak. im scared what my family or friends or girlfriend would do if they learned about my past. i know ive grown since then and that its not like i did anything like awful to the dog but it still feels weird to have the memory in the first place. sorry if this post is weird i just need to get it off my chest to feel better.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 23:54:09 UTC,1,3,0.67,,content warning animal abuse,0,0
1j3p7rc,spinning the wheels,fighting off a depression spiral as i type this itll probably be pretty a disjointed post with how my mind is jumping around sorry. im so...frustrated exhausted and beaten down with how my brain has and continues to affect my life. im in my late thirties adhd likely autistic have taken the radsr several times and got the same results repeatedly but medically undiagnosed as of yet have anxiety depression. yknow the classic millennial brain juiceless cocktail. the trigger isnt even that big of a deal in the grand scheme just finally built up the willpower to break through all my mental blocks to ask out a girl ive been talking with but before i could she mentioned to someone else that she was on a date last night that went pretty well. honestly not a big deal im happy being friends with her. its more that this scenario is representative of the cycle that governs my life. i have many many things i can and need to work on in my life finances weight tidiness love life etc etc etc. the problem is i keep tumbling through the same cycle of depression gt get some inspiration gt start feeling pretty good gt do one thing andor get some sort of discouragement gt retreat back into depression. it physically hurts my chest thinking about it as i type. i just feel like i can never get ahead and all my issues material and mental are in such a tangled web that whenever i make any progress i just find more knots and i retreat again. i know i had more thoughts floating around but i cant reach them anymore and typing this is putting me on the verge of tears so i think im gonna stop. thanks guys,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 23:42:24 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j3ozsn,a former homophobes guide to pride,below is an excerpt of my story about my coming out process and how i was baptized to save myself from my sins of homophobia. a link to the full story can be found here a former homophobes guide to pride yes the title is clickbait but it will be worth the read and maybe you even get a few laughs from it. once upon a time i was homophobic. at a young age i knew that my brothers homosexual tendencies a euphemism that might be more familiar to some than others was going to be problematic given my familys and my own worldview. my worldview believed that a he could change because homosexuality is a choice b if he acted upon his sexuality it was a sin love the sinner hate the sin. this worldview allowed our family to isolate ourselves from the truth about the core nature of at least 10 of the population including one of our own flesh and blood. ... one day we were hanging out at a reggaethemed party with a buffet of cannabis infused edibles and libations. he hadnt had much exposure to cannabis so as i watched him eat about three brownies and a glass of thc lemonade i grew a tad concerned. i failed to stop him from eating that third sorcerous pastry and the situation soon turned to the classic i dont feel anything these edibles aint shit then holy shit what have i done. having been there before myself more times than one should after such an uncomfortable lesson i grabbed the reigns and became his spiritual guide or trip advisor. i took him on a walk away from the crowds and instructed him to look at the stars. he would bounce between they look like litebrites remember litebrites brian? i loooooooved litebrites! then to what if we only die because we accept that we die oh my god we are all going to die! whenever we got to the latter half of these dopamineinfused thought obsessions i would coach him to focus on different topics like back to the litebrites or the beautiful design of a parasol and why arent parasols popular anymore he loved umbrellas as a kid. eventually and what probably felt to him like an eternity we got to the point where we could coherently talk about deeper subjects such as our upbringing. we talked about when we first started jerking off how we would hide our porn downloads from kazaa how one time i was looking for my downloads and i stumbled upon a very different type of porn than mine. in a single night we tackled topics that are typically done over years of bonding moments between brothers who share the same sexual orientation. we were both blown away that we had never talked about this stuff we had so much in common but with a slightly different hue to our stories of puberty. that night will go down as one of the greatest moments of bonding and connection ive ever experienced. ill cherish it for the rest of my life. ... one day while visiting my brother he asked me if i wanted to go to gay bro dinner party. i asked him what gay bro dinner party was and he simply laughed and said i cant believe im taking you to this. well gay bro dinner party is a dinner party with gay bro friends much like a bbq or dinner with straight bro friends. the conversations that go on at both of these dude parties are exactly what you would expect but more talk about cocks balls and asses actually thats not true the frequency of these topics at straight bro dinner party is equal to that at gay bro dinner party.but the context is slightly different.kind ofagain we are all just a little bit gay deep down inside. when i arrived at the party his friends immediately said you brought a straight person to gay bro dinner party!? what were you thinking!? in hindsight i think it was their way of warning me that they werent going to tonedown the banter and the thematic schema that goes on at gay bro dinner party would remain the same. they were going to thoroughly enjoy watching me crawl in my skin. in fact in my first effort of small talk i asked the bros how they all knew my brother and they responded in brofashion at a gang bang. i gave a nervous laugh doing mental gymnastics to figure out if this was a joke. i decided to just roll with it and pray they werent testing how committed i was to being openminded. and with that icebreaker i signaled to them with my nervous laughter not knowing whether this was a true story or a joke that i was one of the cool straight guys they could trust. looking back im pretty sure they were joking i think i mean thats something i would say to someone clearly on a journey to rectify their former antediluvian worldview. but i digress. ... for the full story you can visit this link,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 23:32:21 UTC,1,5,0.67,,,0,0
1j3okoo,i have the last ride video of my friend who died in front of me.,my friend died last year. he was only in his 20s. we were out on a ride and he had been asking me for a while to get some footage of him in a certain spot. he wanted to see how he looked on the bike. i finally brought my camera and we went for a day trip. i recorded his last ride. i didnt know it at the time obviously. we stopped for gas and my camera was almost dead so i put it away. not even ten minutes later he crashed. he died on the scene. he never got to see the footage. he was so excited about it. i still have it and i dont know what to do with it. i finally sat down and watched them. i dont even know why. i guess i just needed to. i dont know if i should send them to his ex girlfriend or his best friend or just keep them. i dont even know if i want to share them. its just been sitting there all this time. just like that day. like time stopped for a second and then kept going without him.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 23:13:46 UTC,105,5,0.99,,content warning violencedeath,0,0
1j3o0z9,selfhelp culture is built on guilt not actual happiness.,hello reddit here is something that grinds my gears. why do so many selfhelp gurus push the idea that every fun thing in life is an addiction that needs to be cut out? stop playing video games theyll make you addicted. stop drinking itll ruin your life. stop doing this stop doing that. and then as if thats not enough they push this pseudostoic mindset of just focus on yourself and become the best version of yourself whatever that even means. it all feels incredibly narrowminded and honestly kind of boring. these people act like the only thing that matters is selfimprovement and constant progress. but what if i dont want that? what if i just want to be me? what if i just want to relax and enjoy life? life is already hard enough as it is and it feels like these gurus prey on peoples insecuritiesespecially those who are strugglingand make them believe that the things they love are actually holding them back. theres this obsession with selfimprovement that often feels less about genuine growth and more about selling an idealized almost robotic version of existence. its weird because its marketed as freedombecome the best version of yourself!but it actually sounds more like a prison of constant selfdiscipline. like whats the point if you cant just exist without feeling guilty for not grinding 247? take guys like andrew huberman for example. sure he knows his neuroscience but does he really have life all figured out? because the way they present themselves youd think they had unlocked some secret formula to existence. but to me it just seems sad. humans are so obsessed with being ultraefficient that they forget we only have a short time on this planet. and after that? a whole lot of nothing. so why not enjoy the things that make life meaningful instead of obsessing over sacrificing everything in the name of selfdiscipline? i get that addiction is real and obviously some habits can be destructive. but whats the point of living if you cant just enjoy things sometimes? why does everything have to be about optimizing every aspect of yourself? i think its okay to make sacrifices when they actually make sense but its also okay to say screw it i just want to enjoy myself. i dont knowthis mindset just annoys me. anyone else feel the same way?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 22:49:32 UTC,7,3,0.89,,,0,0
1j3nymy,your local depressed wannabe,what are the thoughts plaguing my mind today? should i continue with that book.. one day it sounds good... others i sound like those stupid wattpad romance books that make me cringe harder than your local creep soooo i did a thing yesterday... i somehow started writing a book! the other night i am lying in bed falling asleep when all of a sudden i have this visceral need to write a book. these thoughts an images come to me about this potential book and the feeling of writing it. i imagined myself sitting at my computer for hours typing away pouring my heart out in this book based on me the person i wish i was and all of my pissed off thoughts i wish i could say then as i sit down to write the book i try to come up with the characters name or the plot a nothing nada!! i thought about writing what ive been feeling but lets be honest if i put those thoughts onto paper... id literally be hauled away in a straight jacket like the early 2000s movies im thinking i want to take the book in the direction of a billionaire or mafia but i am leaning towards billionaire dark romance... although i have no idea what the hell that even means. i guess ill just start writing what i think i would want to read as a writer and just go from there. at the end of every chapter i will reread n make corrections and add any additional information. i need someone to talk to about this stuff but my friendship with bestie always seems onesided... me always texting first. only time we speak is when i call her.. if no we dont speak at all. starting today i your local wannabe will not reach out first to my best friend first 03042025. since i cant go to bestie with this.. who can i go to? i am not close enough to share this with anyone... i cant see a therapist again refer to point 4 as to why so i guess i am stuck here typing to myself i wonder if people do vlogs anymore if they did would anyone to hear the highest of highs i go through or the unbelievable suffering i feel most days just dreaming of falling asleep and not waking up. however i cant leave son all alone along especially not with my mother and i cant take fathom taking him with me soooo i am stuck trying to claw my way out from wanting death to living the life i want.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 22:46:43 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0

1j3nkk9,im worried about the day i wont be able to game anymore,some people think i should have already stopped playing video games. im turning 29 this year so i mean really i should be doing more adult things. video games became the highlight of my days in my late teens and early twenties. i got to connect with people during a really shitty time in my life which culminated in me meeting my so and many of my friends. i know that one day i wont be able to game anymore. ive been thinking about that day a lot recently while i play my favorite mmo final fantasy 14. i have over 13k hours poured into the game according to steam. my boyfriend and i never want children this decision is reinforced by his vasectomy. we plan to get married and live our quiet lives together with whatever pets we choose. we game together as well. i guess im sort of pregrieving the loss of my beloved character. one day i simply wont log in anymore. i wont hop into voice calls on discord. i simply wont be. mortality is a beautiful and hard thing to deal with. edit sorry i dont think my point came across clearly! i meant that one day i wont have a choice in the matter. ill be gaming until the day i cant anymore! ive just been thinking about the day that i physically wont be able to anymore. my apologies for not making that more clear.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 22:30:04 UTC,58,98,0.87,,,0,0

1j3n9k4,i feel guilty for getting a dampd session cancelled,throwaway cuz i dont really use reddit but ive been feeling particularly guilty about this and wanted to get it out there. a bit of context this winter has been rather challenging to say the least. i have struggled with mental health issues related to major life changes as well as complications in relationships and friendships. all this to say ive been having a rough time but ive been trying to manage and for the most part have been getting better albeit there are still some harder times. with that established back to the main story. i am in a dampd group of eight people all in our early twenties. scheduling as im sure many of you can imagine can be a bit difficult. this past weekend we managed to find a time that worked for enough people so that someone in the group could run a oneshot. he has put a good amount of time into preparing for it and seemed very excited. we had chosen sunday as the day to get together. that saturday i had planned to travel out of town for a day trip to visit family. while i was there i started to struggle quite a bit. like i said it happens sometimes where certain days are harder than others and saturday it hit hard. i felt as though all my motivation to do anything had disappeared and i just wanted to crawl into bed and sob for a while. i obviously couldnt do that on the spot and forced myself to power through trying to have as good of a time as i can with my family. here is where i did something i feel immensely guilty for. i decided to message in the dampd groups discord saying that something came up and i wouldnt be able to make the session. really i knew i just wanted to take the day to myself as i knew with the way i was feeling i most likely would not be engaged or having fun during the session and flat out just didnt want to be there while feeling like that. shortly thereafter the person running the session decided to cancel moving it to this next weekend. some of those in the group responded to my cancellation message with little angry emojis. i also was contacted by the partner of the person who was running the session. they asked what happened and mentioned the prospective dm was upset that i had cancelled. i said my family decided to extend the daytrip throughout the whole weekend and i couldnt get away. this was a lie of course but i felt like i would seem weak if i had said yeah im just feeling too depressed to play dampd this weekend and i thought a more concrete excuse would be more easily accepted. since then i have felt very guilty for this. i understand why people would be disappointed they have every right to be and i really did not mean to hurt or upset anyone. i just know i would have had an unpleasant time during the session and really did not want to be there feeling how i was. i know this isnt exactly the most exciting story but i just felt like i needed to get it off my chest its been eating at me so hopefully saying this out loud so to speak will help me feel a bit better.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 22:16:58 UTC,4,3,1.0,,,0,0

1j3m1c0,called out my boyfriend feel a little guilty now,so let me f19 start this off by saying my boyfriend m22 is most likely autistic and also very socially awkward. he doesnt have any irl friends and pretty much only talks to me and his mum. his mum is an alcoholic and a lot of the time they fight because shes drinking and he has to raise his voice and be stern to get any point across. he hates that he has to and does try to talk to her normally. i understand this. however he does kinda do it towards me too. i mentioned hes most likely autistic i am autistic so he could entirely not be i just think he is as well and this very much presents in the way he gets irritatedoverwhelmedupset when he doesnt understand something or something doesnt have a logical answer or fit the logical answer he has in his head. i put up with this because i understand getting frustrated when things arent how they should be but last night i really just couldnt handle it. we got into a stupid disagreement over a movie he wanted to show me because he likes the perspective its shot in. he asked if i knew what he meant and i said yes i just couldnt articulate it out loud. i do have a problem with that where i can know the answer to something but the more someone prods at me to say it it ends up just completely leaving my mind and it makes me feel stupid. he asked if i just said that because i didnt know but didnt want to sound dumb and i explained the above point and told him i learned perspectives in drama class. now this is not the first time ive mentioned to him that i had to learn basic cinematography in two of the 4 years i took drama in high school but he either forgot or just got too in his head where he was making me seem stupid and he kept saying things along the lines of drama is acting. cinematography is filming. theyre different. i even tried to remind him multiple times about the fact i needed to know it for class but i kept getting interrupted which annoyed me since he gets so aggravated if anyone interrupts him and says interruptions only lead to arguments until he finally just pretty much said the point i had been saying and ended it with him yet again reminding me drama isnt cinematography and asking if i saw why he was getting misled. i ended up saying he needed to stop calling me stupid which at first he tried to defend because hes never outright called me stupid which is true just the way he treats me occasionally makes me feel lesser and he ended up getting upset because his defence turned into him saying he didnt get why people always made him feel like an asshole when thats just how he is and i told him this might just be the way he talks but its disrespectful and thats why he feels that way. i also dont really get this because he always says hes changing but nobody else is and while its true hes growing as a person losing weight got a job gaining confidence and setting goals his behaviour does need work and he cant expect everyone else including me to immediately change when he doesnt like certain things but then use the excuse of thats just how he is. we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and while i do feel justified in what ive said i do still feel guilty for making him upset. i was kinda hoping he had work today so he wouldnt be in a bad mood until i say something he really likes his job and also doesnt have a specific schedule he kinda just goes as hes needed but as guilty as i feel i dont want to apologize for anything.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 21:25:52 UTC,0,2,0.4,,,0,0

1j3l7la,caretaking sucks,i love my wife. but she has a chronic illness. im so lucky that most of the caretaking she needs is of the call this place or do these errands or other things that are pretty simple. no body care shes able to talk and move and function at least right now. eventually itll get worse and then kill her. but god i am so tired of it. i spent three hours on the phone today pursuing different government issues. yesterday i called three different pharmacies and fielded calls from multiple medical providers. last week i figured out how to get her airport assistance as she had to do work travel. the biggest issue though is that she will not just straight up ask me to handle things that she cant do. she hints should we do this? do you think we need to handle this? maybe this a good idea? its all so noncommittal. just say that it needs to be done! then i can fit it in before its actually an issue! i wouldnt have had to do the crazy calls today if she had just told me it needed to be done! and then when i do handle something based on her hints she says she didnt ask me to. oh you didnt need to do that! i get what she intends to say to be expressing gratitude in the roundabout midwestern way. but i did need to do it because she couldnt. just say thank you! admit you needed me! i dont need gratitude i need acknowledgement. yes ive talked to her about this. eventually maybe well go to therapy. most days this isnt a problem caring for her doesnt interfere with my ability to pursue a career or hobbies or friends. but the mental burden is so exhausting. i need a verbal hug.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 20:51:27 UTC,4,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j3l2lo,i went on web cam sites and i still wonder if i did something wrong.,sorry for the vague language but i had to comply with the rules. i have also posted this in a other subreddit. i started going on webcam site similar to omegle to help with my social anxiety and practice interacting with people. i hoped this would help me become more comfortable in social situations. over time i began to encounter people who were engaging in intimate or suggestive content. this caught me off guard and i wasnt sure how to react. i became curious about the behavior and started interacting with others who seemed to be open to these types of discussions. one day i was matched with a person who mentioned that they were looking for an intimate conversation. i felt curious. later i was matched with someone who was revealing more of their body on camera. i asked is this real? and she replied yes this is real. i asked can you show me more? she said no what the heck. im not going to do that! and skipped. soon after i discovered an adult website with private oneonone chats and began talking to women with intimate intent. i started asking them to reveal more and some did without hesitation. afterward i went and did the deed to the imagination of what i saw. shortly after i suddenly worried what if they were underage? i got extremely concerned and wanted to find them again but i had no way of doing so. i initially thought that if people were engaging in these kinds of interactions they must be adults. i investigated the website and found out that they verify users ages with id. i returned to the platform and began asking women how old they were. they all told me they were over 18. i reported the site to local authorities expressing concerns about potential illegal activity although i didnt have solid proof. the authorities investigated the site and found no evidence of any wrongdoing. interpol did an investigation on the site and found no evidence of wrongdoing either. the anxiety grew worse and i seriously considered reporting myself to the police in hopes that they could investigate and determine whether i had interacted with anyone underage. i also began questioning whether i had at any point unknowingly gotten exposed to minors in that way. i began taking ssris and anti anxiety meds to manage my anxiety and started therapy. when i felt better i returned to the site the one that is similar to omegle again to engage with people. shorty after i was again matched with people who were wanting to have suggestive conversation and revealing more of their body both men and women. i initially skipped but got curious and felt excited again.i promised myself that i would never ask anyone to do anything and if i had any suspicion that someone might be lying about their age i would immediately skip them. eventually i was matched with someone whose video was black but they seemed to be suggesting that kind of behavior with emojis. i asked them how old they were and they responded 15. i immediately skipped. i got matched with someone after. she had her torso visible and then she lifted her shirt exposing part of her body. i asked how old are you? but she skipped me immediately. i was left feeling distressed i was using the site without clear age verification hoping to meet people who were showing intimate content while also being aware of the risk that there could be someone underage experimenting. the next day i reached out to a sex counselor and confided in her about my concerns. i started crying on the phone realizing that i had crossed personal boundaries in my behavior just because i was curious. despite this i still find myself wondering whether any of the women i interacted with on the webcam site were underage. my anxiety continues to distort my memory and i wonder what if they were 17? or 16? or even younger? sometimes these thoughts become overwhelming and i question whether i might have missed signs that would have indicated their true age. someone might say you would have noticed if they were much younger but what if i didnt?? i think what is the hardest is while struggling with this i dont know how to reach out for help. dont get me wrong i brought this upon myself. how would others react to this?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 20:45:28 UTC,1,1,0.99,,,0,0
1j3l2cd,im spiraling out again,i dont even know how to explain this. i was doing so good until january im forcing myself to feel good and have nice and positive objectives and following all the good trends on the internet because thats what inspires me the most. i follow those seasonal trends that are useless but they make me feel nice and help me romanticize life which feels so good sometimes. other than that i feel like nothing is holding me up from falling through this vortices of bad habits. i feel joy when im with my boyfriend but as soon as he leaves and im not out and about with friends i feel so empty tired sad sometimes even terrified. i dont know what to do i want to build good habits but im not strong enough to do so. i cant help myself. i cant afford therapy i cant tell anyone close to me about this. i dont even know what help im looking for.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 20:45:08 UTC,3,0,0.81,,,0,0
1j3l1jy,my brother 32m keeps setting me 26f up for abuse from my mom 60sf and i dont know if its intentional.,for context my mom hates my dad 65m with an extreme almost irrational amount of resentment. i was never allowed to see him after their divorce and my mom has always been abusive toward meaccusing me of trying to steal my dad from her even when i was a child. meanwhile she worships my brother and treats him like a king which is common in our culture. growing up my brother bullied me but as adults he seems to have changedor so i thought. he encouraged me to reconnect with my dad even telling me to sneak out to visit him knowing full well that my mom would explode if she found out. recently my brother has been spending a lot of time at my dads restaurant lets call it bos because he gets free food there and he kept inviting me to come. i resisted at first but eventually gave in because i needed a break from home and i could actually study and eat there. but heres the problem every time i go my brother immediately tells my mom. he asks me to go waits until i do and then betrays me. the first time he blurted it out in front of a cousin and my mom lost it on me. i blocked him for a week but had to eventually forgive him since we still live together. i thought maybe it was a mistake. then it happened again. this time he acted super nice to me all weekend made me breakfast and even walked me to my car before we were supposed to meet at bos. but then at the last second he bailed on me saying hed study at homesomething he never does. i went to bos alone and four hours later he called me. as soon as i picked up my moms voice came through his phone asking where are you? before i could even lie he said shes at bos. i dont understand why he keeps doing this. he used to hate my mom and call her crazy but suddenly hes been defending her saying shes just mentally ill and that we should pray for her. its a complete 180 from how he talked about her just weeks ago. ive given him the benefit of the doubt because he struggles with school and responsibilities and i suspect he may have a learning disability. but at this point im not sure if hes just naïve or if hes actively setting me up. what do you think? am i overreacting or is this deliberate?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 20:44:10 UTC,64,36,0.88,,,0,0
1j3kz2n,it hurt and i will never forget what they did.,i was about a freshman when it started. i went to a school and said school was a christian school. but it really was anything but what youd expect. i will never forget what happened in those 3 dreadful fucking years i stayed in that god damned school. they made me distrust anyone who worked in education they made me hate anything relating to going to school. in the span of 3 years of being suicidal and slicing my arms they only started to give a damn when my grades went up. freshman year ignored. sophomore year ignored... junior year? seen but only because my grades went up. i admit i didnt have the best grades i didnt get medals like my classmates but thats not the point. in sophomore year we had a new student... first thing they did? announce that they should help the student take away all the sharp objects from her. they didnt do that with me. they didnt announce jack shit. they let me hurt myself. by the end of the year my own best friend even got help. i didnt know she was struggling we were always the outcasts. but then she got help. the principal came in on the first week my best friend didnt come to school anymore and told everyone to make little notes that are positive addressed to each other but in reality it was really just for my best friend. the principal told everyone to make friends with her so they did. she was involved more but i wasnt.... anytime she had announcements about me it was reprimanding the other students for speaking in our mothertongue with me and not in english because notawintertale can only speak english. which is false i speak 5 total languages. they never set up a guidance councilor for me. anytime i tried to look for one i got brushed off and was told to just pray to god. ... that was the only thing they ever tell me pray to god of course. that doesnt address anything. the principal talked to me told me a story about a deceased student. she was physically disabled but always came to school happy. she told me that she had it worse than i did and i should be happy for that. the principal in the same day told me to stop crying otherwise she wouldnt talk to me anymore. she also told me all the professors thought i should be in a different section. the one where they put the dumber kids... which i found very insulting because they hadnt even tried to help me in any of my problems just ignored me and moved on. it was painfully obvious when a professor didnt like me. they never responded to me or acted with me the same way as other students. but still really fucking disgusting to me. how dare she compare my problems to a deceased student? that was extremely disrespectful and told me all i needed to know i couldnt trust the principal at all. every fucking day for 2 years i came to school with new scars. they never checked on me that responsibility for some reason befell my own few friends. other students. not the teachers the students. 4 people who saw me. but then the pandemic came and we were all forced to go to school online. my grades went up. it only got easier because i didnt feel any pressure. nor did i have to work with others who only wanted to delegate me stupid tasks or have me do nothing at all or some professor not answering my question properly but just making it more complicated it was easier because i could search up the topic at the same time and get the answers i needed. but then they my grades went down again. i was called in for a private meeting with the principal a professor and two guidance councilors. i am not ever forgetting what they told me. is there something wrong notawintertale? you know that you can talk to us. your grades are going down. your grades in the first and second quarter were really good and it concerns us that it went down again. if theres anything we can do to help tell us. i had never felt angrier at them. two fucking years of being ignored of cutting my arms and being suicidal enough to have nearly jumped off the damn building they only started to give a fuck the year they see i fit their expectations of being smart. i never forgot what happened or what they did. that stuck with me for years. im still crying about this years later. because of them i feel like i dont deserve help unless my performance is above average that i meant nothing all because i struggled and couldnt do it. they always made me feel ashamed that things didnt click for me. now i feel vindicated now that i know i have audhd and while i know it probably isnt an excuse i feel happy to know its not because i was stupid and didnt try hard enough. i am told i deserve what they never gave me but sometimes those words arent enough to erase the pain that school gave me.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 20:41:10 UTC,3,0,1.0,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0
1j3kqfp,its not that bad you can ignore the tag,for context im a cis girl and my boyfriend is a trans dude thats pre everything im conflicted. so ive been in this relationship for around 4 months and ive been having some mixed emotions. on one hand im happier than ive ever been on the other i low key hate myself much more nowadays. he makes me feel so loved but so disgusting. ive always been pretty insecure thats not new but from what ive heard a mans supposed to make u more confident. all hes done is make me love one singular part of my body just to make me despise 11 moreyes i counted. the worst thing about it is i know its not intentional. my partner is really pretty as a girl even tho he hates it. for example he has sorry for this description bigfirmand perky boobs. as a trans dude he obviously doesnt want them and is planing on getting top surgery as soon as possible but it has made me think im some sort of glob monster now while i was very proud of my girls before i met him. anyways moving on from my body dismorphia theres one more thing that bothers me in this relationship. hes had a very hard life bad partners abusive family and relapsing sh and whenever i try to talk to him about my lore its bad but not as bad his expression show the mindset of here she is acting like shes got anything to complain about and it really bothers me. also when i try to bring up any complaints i have to him he low key starts guilting me into forgetting about it like a dog when it eats your sunglasses. i just feel like he really undermines my experiences and unintentionally makes himself the victim of the relationship. like weve gone through some things in this relationship but he acts like what he does had no victims. im just really sad and happy while dating him and i dont know what to do. sorry if this is incoherent im writing this at 3am and not really focusing on writing just ranting,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 20:31:09 UTC,0,4,0.5,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0
1j3kk1x,i have a fetish for women farting,ever since i was like 12 ive had a fascination with women farting. i discovered fart videos on youtube originally and found that i liked it. i also had an experience with a childhood friend that involved farts that helped me realize i was into them. its always been a weird thing about me that ive kept secret for a long time but as i got into college i got more open with it to my female friends. surprisingly they were cool with it but of course they would never fart around me which is understandable. eventually i got curious and started offering women to fart for some money and some did try it some just straight up blocked me. some of the ones that did decide to do it ended up becoming internet friends with me and would just randomly hit me up and say hey im gassy i can send you some videos. all that to say i know its a weird fetish but i didnt choose to have this fetish it just kinda happened. but now a days im just tryna find a woman that is accepting of this but its hard to find.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 20:23:50 UTC,0,41,0.48,,,0,0
1j3ke4k,i wish i were skinny,idk. i just wish i were different. i weigh 60kg in the morning. usually 62kg after eating which i fully realise isnt overweight but i look...wide. i cannot muster up the courage to wear a tight fitting top but oversize always looks weird on me. i have an event to go to this friday so i was trying on a few dresses and recording with the back camera and... its just not pretty. my face isnt pretty either but if i was at least skinny it wouldnt be so bad. im on a 1600cal high protein diet and i go to the gym. i do one full fasting day per week so thats why i eat 1600cal and not less my maintenance is 1900cal and try to get 130g of protein in a day to account for the fast. but its been hard. idk i just am sick and tired of looking the way i look. the worst part is i dont rven want to look like another person i want to look like the image of myself that i have in my mind. my nose is big and grecian too. i have a slightly recessed jaw and my hair is very thick and is wavy but its really hard to take care of so its just frizzy all the damn time. and i used to die it so a part of it has red undertones which also look awful. i just look awful all the time. and my skin which always used to be crystal clear has pimples now. idk i just want to cry right now... why dont i look like my friends? theyre all so skinny and pretty. i think im the duff designated ugly fat friend. i dont know what to wear to the party and i really want to look and feel pretty. please help. or dont. i mainly needed to vent so there being a space to do so is helpful as well. bye p.s when i was like 1516 now 18 years old one of my class mates told me he could never imagine me in a bikini. im not sure what it means but ive never felt uglier as i did in that moment and his voice always rings in my head. i also cant talk to my friends about this because theyve been skinny and pretty all their lifes they wouldnt understand. one of my closest friends also always says how happy she is with herself and im happy for her but i just nod and smile usually or say that its very good and she should feel like that but i always get this gut wrenching feeling when she says so. im very jealous if you cant tell lol.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 20:16:57 UTC,0,0,0.43,,,0,0
1j3k2r8,my fathers image,when i was little i had a very grand image of my father shaped by my family since he was rarely home. they often told me about his good looks intelligence and how much everyone admired him. much of what they said was truehe was handsome excelled in his studies and graduated from university with top marks. but i never really interacted with him directly. growing up i always felt i couldnt match his intelligence or other qualities. even as an adult after a lot of studying and mental development i felt i wasnt close to his level. recently i started talking to him more to try and build some connection now that im older. im a programmer and wanted to discuss a complex new app im working on. i hoped he would listen and offer some advice. the app is detailed and sophisticated but since hes a mechanical engineer unfamiliar with the latest technologies i focused on explaining the user experience to show him what the app would do. however during our talks i realized there was a significant gap between us in reasoning logical thinking and the speed of processing information which may be due to his age i dont know. surprisingly instead of feeling proud of my advancement i felt sad. i wanted to share this because its a new and unfamiliar emotion for me.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 20:03:56 UTC,1,0,0.67,,,0,0
1j3jx39,let my girlfriends cat out because it didnt like me and now i feel guilty about it.,posting on a throwaway for very obvious reasons. the cat is fine i do see it roaming around from time to time. ive been dating my girlfriend for roughly 4 years. we dont live together but we are looking for places. however i was so apprehensive because i hated her cat and her cat hated me. im not much of a cat person and i understand my energy was probably off putting to the cat. but ive always tolerated it the best i could despite its dislike of me. she went on a week long work trip 2 months ago and asked me to just stop by and feed her cat as well as check on her apartment to make sure all is well. sure whatever i agreed. her cat got nasty with me day one and i ignored it. second day same thing. by the third day i couldnt take it and i just couldnt imagine living with this stupid cat. so i grabbed it and let it outside through the window. she lives on the first story so the cat was fine. i placed it on the ground and let it leave. im not a total monster. the next day i went to the shelter when they had an open appointment and looked for a cat that looked identical to her cat. she had a generic black cat so it wasnt hard. i brought it to her apartment and left it at that. she came back and everything had seemed fine. shes only noted that the cat was skittish at first but we both just chalked it up to it being the first time she was away from home for so long. i dont necessarily feel guilty because she seems happy but i do feel slightly guilt over my actions. i needed to tell someone even if its the online void just to get it off of my shoulders.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 19:57:47 UTC,0,27,0.11,,,0,0
1j3jv17,i am in group chats and i think high school me would be proud,back when i was in highschool i was a bit of an outcast. i wasnt bullied not to my face at least was okayish socially kinda liked. always sort of something. i had friends sure but i was never the number one choice. group projects? i had to ask for partners no one ever asked me. same went for field trip sleeping arrangements and anything that had to be in pairs or above. if we were a five people group and the project was for four id be the one left out almost every time. it would have been one thing if i was a lousy student but i had great grades so i know it wasnt about that. i was also always the one to create all the group chats and always learned that there was one without me as well. and sure people can do whatever they want but it still hurts when you find that out. some of these people are ones i kept in touch until today i am 24 now but again never the first choice. and it might feel or seem small but i was never the one people set next to. i didnt smell bad i asked about it wasnt an annoyance just another part of never being first. now dont get me wrong. they were amazing friends that point aside. always there for me when i needed supported me when i came out and through a couple of years that were practically hell for my mental health defended me when i didnt know i needed defense. they still support me to this day too. its safe to say i literally wouldnt have been here today without them. then college happened. i started this year and the social aspect was my major fear. will i even have friends? or is it really something so awful about me that makes people feel less for me every time? but college couldnt have been more different. i found people that actually like me. when we have classes together they search for me. when i miss a day i get a text asking where i was because i never skip classes. and even if they were a group before i joined they added me to their group chat without making a big deal out of it. they didnt open a new group they just added me to their usual one. we plan our schedules together so we share most classes we make plans i dont have to start chats... i guess i am being chosen for the first time and not being left behind. its a point when i am positive that even if i dont have many classes with any of them in the future we will still keep in touch and stay friends. there isnt much to this post aside from happy at where i came to but i felt like i had to get it out and tell someone,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 19:55:21 UTC,12,0,1.0,,positive,0,0

1j3irtt,i hate my brother,my brother is 30 and im 22. when i was 1314 he said if we werent related we wouldnt be friends. my brother is an entrepreneur so he hasnt had a real job in a while. he has a team of developers working for him. one of his developers is prostituting herself twice a week. another one of the developers had to move in with his dad because he couldnt afford living on his own and his dad told him to stop working for my brother. my brother convinced him to not listen to his dad and to follow his dreams so hes moving in with my brothers business partner. his business partner house hacks. house hacking means he puts his name on the lease and has people move in and splits the payment between them without contributing anything. im in a long term emotionally and financially abusive relationship that i dont want be in anymore. however i dont have anyone to turn to in my area and i cant afford to move into an apartment based on my income. im a student so i cant move back home. i spoke to my brother about the situation and hes like yeah you can either move with me or my business partner. my brother and his girlfriend are moving to the same city as his business partner. i dont wanna live with my brother and his girlfriend because she has a cat and i do too but her cat doesnt get along with other cats. so i told him his business partners place would probably be better. i asked what the rent would be and he said probably altogether 1150. i thought that was pretty high because it was supposed to be split between four people. my brother told my mom that his business partner house hacks after we had had a conversation about how much rent would be and she asked me if he told me that and i said i have no idea what that is and she found out from him and let me know. and i currently live with my boyfriend for free. the reality of the situation is i cant go from paying nothing to paying 1150 just so i can pay this guys way while he cant even pay the people that are working for him a decent wage. i told my brother this and he was trying to shame me he was like so youre not ready to jump ship? after i explained i want to visit first i dont want to move yet and put school on pause just to end up not even liking it there. and even if i did i might struggle to find a job too. ive lived in this state my whole life. he was like well thats unfortunate but alright and then said i need a hard yes or no by april 5 no later. he treats me like im some bitch employee. or like everything has to be transactional and a business decision. at this point i just feel like going contact.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 19:10:50 UTC,1,0,0.67,,,0,0

1j3htcn,cant afford to break up,i have been with my bf for 3 years. we are living in another country with our dog i had the dog before i met him so shes technically mine i work overtime and im also studying for my postgraduate degree. because i self fund my degree i cant afford to move out. my degree finishes in summer 2026 or if i do move out i will struggle to the point i risk not having enough money for transport or supermarket. i have looked up shared accommodation but it wont save my much more money and i will also keep the dog which...makes everything worse. not many houses accept dogs i will probably have to pay extra as compensation to have her with me a dog is also an extra expense which now will no longer be shared and on top of all that i work long shifts 14 hours and once a week i do 30 hours straight which means i will not be able to walk my dog. i dont have any family or friends here. so i dont have anyone i can lean on he offered that we stay roommates but i honestly dont want to. i think its emotionallymentally unhealthy and i would also feel like hes doing charity for me because he can afford to live alone. also. two of my very close friends are getting married in 2 months. and i will not be able to attend because of this. i will have no one to look after my dog and i cant afford a dog sitter as well as plane tickets and gifts etc. i am almost 27. and my younger self would be embarrassed of me. i am 27 failed my relationship dirt poor and cant be independent. sorry for the rant. did anyone go through anything similar and can suggest anything?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 18:32:14 UTC,1,5,0.6,,,0,0
1j3hhw4,i really hate pennises. im scared i might never be in a fullfilling relationship.,im 23 and my whole life i was very boys crazy. even when i was in kindergarten. i always loved boys. but when i grew into a teenager and was almost sleeping with a guy i just couldnt even touch it. it was just very disgusting and the thought of that thing being near to me was generally scary. i never had any trauma and had a rather good relationship with most males. since then i just cant seem to enjoy male genitals. ive never slept with a man and i never see myself sleeping with one which is sad because i do feel horney and even watch adult movies. i just feel like sometimes i just never will have a fullfilling relationship. i cant physically have sex with a man. sometimes i wish i would be into woman because the thought of a vagina is so much more pleasant. i was in multiple relationships and i try to not think too much if sex or anything but i am always the one breaking up when it comes closer to having actual sex. then suddenly everything on my partner is an ick and i dont even find them physically attractive anymore. its never any of my partner fault because they were all great people. idk what to do. did someone else also had that and how did u deal with that? im nkt asexual thats one thing for sure. i just think i hate male genitals.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 18:19:24 UTC,0,24,0.33,,,0,0

1j3gu7w,i think im a lesbian but i can never tell anyone,im currently 21 and all my life ive grown up in an extremely conservative environment. my parents are not accepting at all and my dad would probably disown me and never talk to me again if he knew that i was thinking this. i think if my mom wasnt married to him she could come around to be accepting and potentially more progressive too. i know lately her thoughts on abortion have changed going from the no abortions should be allowed ever unless its life threatening stance to the i realize people will get abortions anyway and outlawing them will only lead to people turning to unsafe ways to have them and people will die stance. thats not very relevant but im just trying to explain their dynamic. my mother is genuinely a very good person shes just so easily influenced especially by my dad. they all wonder why ive never had a boyfriend. they think its just because im focused on academics and my future but its really that i dont want a boyfriend. i dont want to marry a man and i cant see my life with one. i am attracted to women and can only see me spending my life with a woman but i know that if i ever got married it would have to be with a man. i have no choice because i love my family so much. they are the closest people to me and i cant stand the thought of them not being in my life anymore. and i know that if i ever came out to them it would cause i huge rift. my mom and my siblings are some of my best friends and i know with 100 certainty that my siblings would support me and love me regardless. theyre progressive and more left wing. my mom even though she wouldnt quite understand it would still love me too. shes such a genuinely sweet person and we have too good of a relationship to be ruined by that. this would lead to a huge argument between my mom and dad. theyve always had a rocky marriage but this would absolutely tear them apart and i cant do that to them. they do love each other and my mom would have absolutely no idea what to do without him. shed be lost and lonely and i dont want that for her. and i dont want my dad to hate me. i dont want him to hate me for something i cant control for something thats a part of me. the confirmation of his conditional love would hurt too badly. everything would change and my family wouldnt be close anymore. theyre all too important to me and in order to preserve that ill have to keep this part of me hidden forever. so here we are. its 2025 yet i have to live like its still 1950. it hurts more than anything and god its so heavy carrying around this secret but theres nothing i can do. i love my family too much to do that to them to ruin and change their lives forever just because im attracted to women. its just better for everyone if they never know and i never allow myself to find love in a woman,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 17:53:04 UTC,13,24,0.66,,,0,0
1j3go52,girls are so emotional! i just made a simple thing why all this tears and all this thanking circus?,not an english speaker. i still dont get it and i still genuinly dont understand it at all it was just a simple act that i made. its not like i saved the fucking world.if it was to me i wouldnt save the world anyway so it all happened 30 minutes ago. i was at the supermarket trying to buy something for dinner and was looking there for some vegetables when i firstly saw this girlaroud my age i guess but im horrible at giving people age panicking around and looking behind her like someone was about to kill her and i saw an old man following her but i ignored the scene. 10 minutes passed by and i went to take some healthy snacks and while i was there looking for them i never understood why they always move things from the shells for fucks sake when this girl reappered again panicking and looking around like someone was about to kill her but this time she was crying and sobbing. when she saw me there trying to look at my snacks she run towards me and went behind my back like she was trying to use my body as defence from someone or something and then again the old man showed up looking for her. i turned my head around to the girl and asked her what the fuck was her problem and she told me that the old man was trying to abuse her and he already touched her. i asked her why the hell she placed behind me and she told me that she was scared and because im a big guy and i could defend her. i just sighed cause i was already tired of the day and went straight face to face to the old man and just told him to leave that girl alone or i would end in prison and he in a grave. he just stared at me like i was some kind of ghost and looked at the girl and then went away. i came back to the girl and told her next time to kick him or anyone else herrassing her to the balls and then run or call someone and when i was about to go to pay while crying she asked me please dont leave me alone can you stay with me while i buy a few things? i sighed again and accepted. so she bought the things she needed and then she even wanted me to be there for her at her car so unfortunetly i did. she hugged me too tightly and gave me her number because i need to offer you a drink after today because you saved me and without you i dont want to imagine what would happened. i just sighed and said yeah yeah whatever and apparently tomorrow night i have a free drink with this girl.tanya now sincerly i didnt made anything of special or so particular to me. i just did what i had to do to avoid any type of drama or crying or all this pathetic scenes that i hate. im always ready for death or prison so it wasnt exactly a menace but more like a straight fact on what would happen. i dont get why all this cries after i took her to the car all this thanking and all this you saved me. i just did it because i hate drama and all this shit. more simple than this is impossible. girls are so dramatic...,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 17:46:10 UTC,0,14,0.25,,,0,0
1j3g5dd,from zero to something. this is to those that is going through hardships do not give up!,hi everyone i have always read other peoples stories. i figured i want to share my story with everyone to show that no matter how hard your life is there is always a way. i had reasons to give up but i chose not to. i hope this story can help other people who is going through hardships. i had nothingso i built my own future there was a time in my life when i had no financial security no degree no legal certainty and no real future. i had no backup plan no connections to rely on and no one to help me figure things out. i had to navigate everything on my own making difficult choices to survive. early life amp family background my biological father left when i was two years old to become a monk. he was completely absent from my life never attempting to reconnect. my mother overwhelmed with life was also absent for long periods. when she became pregnant with my stepbrother she left for malaysia and was gone for nearly a year. during that time my grandmother took care of me and my elder brother. she was everything you could hope for in a grandmotherkind nurturing and always present. then one day my mother returned and took us to malaysia without telling anyone. my brother and i didnt understand what was happening we simply followed instructions. like anyone leaving home we missed brunei but we had no say in the matter. life with my stepfather at around seven years old my stepfather entered my life. i was excitedi had always wanted a father. he owned a business selling screen protectors and phone covers and as it grew our financial situation improved. but despite his success he was abusive. mistakes were not tolerated. he beat us for small things like forgetting to turn off a light. no matter how well we behaved we were constantly reminded that we were not his real children. as his business boomed he became more absent but his abuse never stopped. when his business thrived we moved to johor bahru and for the first time we lived comfortably. but the abuse continued. at 14 we moved to kuala lumpur. i had no idea that my life was about to take a drastic turn. australia amp the first collapse at 16 i was sent to australia to continue my studies. i enrolled in year 12 at taylors college diploma of business at deakin university bachelors degree in psychology applied science in early 2013 my stepfather suddenly announced that we had to return to malaysia. his business had gone bankrupt. i didnt want to leave but i had no choice. returning to brunei amp struggling for direction back in brunei i took a job as a marketing executive at a magazine company. it was straightforward work but i realized that bruneis work culture and lifestyle werent for me. at first brunei made sense because i didnt have the right documents to stay in malaysia. but after working there i knew malaysia was where i wanted to be. so i left. returning to malaysia amp facing reality i was jobless for six months before landing a job as a private investigator. during this time my stepfather did not support us financially. he claimed to be paying our rent but we later found out he wasnt. one day our landlord told us the rent hadnt been paid for months. if we didnt leave immediately he would call the police. that night we quietly packed our essentials and left. we were shocked terrified but also relieved to get away from the lie we had been living. later i found out my stepfather had another family. his former business partner secretly told my mother that he had two daughters in their early twentiesmeaning he had been maintaining a second family for over 20 years without telling us. survival mode private investigator amp visa struggles i found my pi job through a newspaper ad. it was advertised as a market researcher position but when i went for the interview i realized it was for a private investigator. the work involved tracking down counterfeit products and investigating individuals. i struggled at first but got better over time. still the job was stressful and i knew it wasnt my future. on top of that i had major visa issues. i was forced to travel in and out of malaysia every two months to renew my stay. eventually immigration warned me that i would be blacklisted if i kept doing this. desperate i turned to an unconventional way to secure my visa. but it backfired. the person handling my passport ran away with it for years. i was trapped in malaysia with no legal identity. i was terrified. i wanted to report it but i feared i would be deported. i had to stay quiet and find another way. the turning point finding my strength in teaching my wife now saw what i was going through. she offered to marry me so i could get a spousal visa. when she said that i broke down in tears. i had been fighting for so long and finally i had a way forward. i knew i couldnt continue the pi job so i looked for something more meaningful. i found a job as a special needs educator and quickly realized i was good at it. i understood behavioral strategies like the abc chart and could see real progress in my students. i also took a side job at a tuition centre teaching english. i worked from 8 am to 9 pm every day. it was exhausting but i kept pushing forward. soon parents started coming to me directly. word spread and i had so many clients that i had to hire another teacher to help me. building my own centre amp surviving covid19 i always wanted to run my own business. when the tuition centre owner tried to take control of my earnings i knew it was time to leave. i gathered my savings and opened my own special needs centre. it was terrifying but i knew i had to do it. then covid19 hit. i lost over half my clients overnight. i had to choose check_mark let the business fail or check_mark adapt and push through i transitioned to online teaching and borrowed money to keep my employees paid. i sacrificed my own salary to keep the centre alive. it was the hardest time of my life but i refused to give up. moral of the story do not give up despite all the adversities. if you hit rock bottom and felt aimless. always remember to do with what you can and progress forward.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 17:25:28 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j3e9n1,my mom cant hold a job and im not willing to finance her lifestyle.,so i realize i sound like an asshole. i grew up in pretty bad poverty. my mom had a really hard time holding a job and when she was able to had a spending problem. as a result ive been working full time since i was 15. i worked multiple jobs at a time to get around labor laws so that i could make and save money. by the time i graduated high school i had enough money to buy a car in cash and pay for a majority of my college expenses cash flowed first 3 years with absolutely no help. i continued to work through college and eventually ended up in a high paying job. from the age of 17 to now ive worked around 5060 hours a week in addition to going to school. i had no free time. i missed out on a majority of being young i never got to go to parties i hardly ever hung out with friends which caused me to lose a majority of them and i was always exhausted while i should have been young and lively. regardless i went through the grind and came out on top. i now dont typically have to worry about money. im in a relationship with a fantastic man that i plan to marry and start a family with. everything seems to have worked out. my mom has always had a very hard time working. she has problems with all of her co workers everywhere she goes amp she seems to struggle with taking direction. as a result she tends to leave jobs quickly usually without another job offer. she decided when i was around 19 to stop working to care for my elderly grandmother. while i understood this decision there were still times she could have held a parttime job at least and chose not to. my grandmother was in an adult daycare program for about 2030 hours a week which could have been spent working. instead my mom chose to go out and spend what little money she had gotten from various loans and wherever else she was getting money from. she also complained constantly about having to take care of my grandmother. my grandmother passed away a year ago and my mom was left with no choice but to go back to work and again the cycle starts over. everyday i hear constant complaining about how much she hates her job and everyone she works with. she makes very little effort to find other work and writes off entire industries for silly reasons i wont work in food service because i wont wear a hair net. i wont work in retail because i dont have any experience. etc. she is also not saving any money not towards retirement not towards an emergency reserve nothing. she claims she doesnt have any money left after bills to save but she frivolously spends. every space in the house is occupied with something. she purchased a freezer full of steaks that have been sitting uncooked for months. she pays someone to wash her hair every few days because she doesnt feel like doing it herself. she has so many things she doesnt need and every time i visit her there is more yet bills are being paid in increments because she cant afford to pay the full bill. i even cover some expenses by putting her on my plans and yet she still cannot manage very basic expenses. meanwhile i work i live very well below my means and my partner and i save a lot of money both for retirement and for our future together. i know my mother is planning on being able to live off of me and i wont allow it. i dont know what she is going to do and i know it sounds cold of me but i worked too hard to hand over everything to someone who has never tried to better themselves or their life. im done. edit just because im frustrated i came to visit her today and discovered receipts for various retailers for the past couple of weeks strewn about totaling over 700. she just complained to me about not being able to pay property taxes to stay in her home. its just so bad and i needed to vent more i apologize.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 16:09:29 UTC,172,60,0.97,,,0,0
1j3dijb,my dad that mlested me growing up isnt my dad,forgive my formatting im on mobile. do not share my story anywhere. tw death incest pdophilia i dont honestly know where to start so i guess the beginning is where ill go. when i was very young my dad began molesting me from what i can remember i was around 3 or 4. i have three younger sisters that i grew up with and he molested them too as they got older but it was mostly me that got the brunt of it. last year my mom passed away of a stroke. it was a very complicated time for me because although my abuser was arrested for what he did my mom had convinced my sisters and i to drop the charges right before she had passed away. she would say awful manipulative things like you dont want your dad to die in prison do you? to guilt us into dropping the charges. she then proceeded to invite this man back into our lives by moving him back into the house we all shared at the time and my discomfort was ignored and brushed under the rug. when my mom passed my dad went crazy and forced me out of the house. my mom was a buffer between everyone and with her gone i didnt feel comfortable at the house at all and i had my boyfriend stay in my room with me because i felt safer that way. cue raging dad cussing me out for inviting another man over and threatening to call the cops and having him trespassed all crazy erratic shit i didnt understand. so i moved in with my boyfriend yay. all that drama didnt even end up mattering though because dad remarried and moved to a new state just 3 months after my moms passing. currently all my sisters are still living in that house together. now heres the fun part im the eldest. growing up i was always told that my parents got married at the courthouse and had me before they officially hosted the wedding. i was born in 99 and the timeline i was told was met online in 97 courthouse wedding in 98 i was born in 99 wedding i was pictured in took place in 2000. i always knew i was in their wedding pictures and i never questioned what they told me they said the ceremony was delayed until my grandma could get back from doing government work overseas. it all made sense to me growing up i never questioned it but it was all a lie. so this weekend was a the year anniversary of my mothers death and i decided to get dinner with my sisters. were having a good time and everything but i forgot my jacket and my boyfriend stopped by the restaurant to bring it to me. i get back to the table and my sisters got all quiet and said hey weve got some news for you and its really heavy. long story short this man that ive thought was my dad my whole life is not my biological father. my sisters have been going through all of our moms things over the last year and kept coming across weird pictures and documents relating to me that didnt line up with what wed been told. i wouldve thought they were trolling me if it werent for the fact theyd confirmed everything with my aunt my moms younger sister. who i just found out yesterday didnt know that i didnt know because my mom was not only lying to my siblings and i about it but lying to my aunt and all of our extended family too saying my siblings and i already knew! im going to visit my aunt in a couple of days to sit down and talk all of this out get the real scoop on my life because my whole worldview has been shattered. on one hand im grateful i was finally told but i turn 26 this month and thats an insane age to learn your dad isnt even your dad. not to mention what a horrible dad he was. i feel this information to be both heartbreaking and freeing im not related to this monster. if i have kids i wont be passing along his dna and thats comforting to me. i dont want to make my half sisters feel bad for being related to him but i cant help feeling like this ive always told myself i wouldnt have kids because this guy doesnt deserve his dna being passed on and now i find out i have none of it. this information was a gift to me. on the other hand im angrier at my mom than ive ever been. i mourned her death so severely i suffered because i felt so guilty that our relationship was so tumultuous in life. and yet we never could have had an honest relationship because i now know she was never honest with me. about almost anything. i feel so much better and at peace knowing that it really and truly was my mothers fault that our relationship was so rocky. how can you have an honest relationship with anyone that could lie about something so big? not to mention the fact that she was so manipulative and greedy doing everything she did just to invite this evil man back into our lives just because its what she wanted for herself to retire on his dime. none of this is on me anymore and i feel so much lighter. and before anyone asks yes a dna test is in my future and im starting therapy again soon. i have no idea if my dad is even alive or still out there but im going to find out. im not sure how to end this but let me just say this has been the craziest year of my life by far and im glad i dont have to interact with either of my parents anymore or feel guilty about how i handled things when my mom was alive.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 15:37:25 UTC,9,8,0.91,,content warning sexual assault,0,0
1j3di7y,a cry for help,i saw a post that included a boy my age who got support and security by someone in his life and i feel so jealous i feel embarrassed to admit it but i am i went through so much on my own and really fell apart in the process im not saying that he doesnt deserve the support or that i deserve it instead cause i went through more no i know everyone has their problems and deserve support regardless and should be taken seriously but i never got support and its why i feel so hurt and jealous but really i dont wish him any harm it just hurts seeing other people get the love and support you always craved and wanted. ive been hit kicked beaten up screamed and yelled at and got threats regularly verbally and emotionally abused by getting gaslight and cussed out in every way and spat on and death threats once when i was 11 by my dad after getting beaten up and at 14 too by my mom and i got my nose broken by my aunt and never got justice or any support at all. not emotionally or physically my mom at the time where i was having a breakdown right after the incident told me i deserved everything that happened to me and reminded me when my dad used to beat me up on a regular basis when i was 11 and that i was stepped on and teached a lesson by my him and my aunt and called me names cause i snapped at her during the breakdown when she refused take me to the police and i didnt stop bleeding for 17 hours. i spat more blood even days after and i was never taken to the hospital or reported my aunt and when i was 12 my mom attempted suicide and i watched that all and saved her from it my mom was always manipulative and neglectful and shitty and gaslight me into thinking she was the better parent when she wasnt anything close to that she sent me to my dad when i was 7 even after she knew he saed me. throughout my childhood since ive been a toddler ive been abused so much by both my mom and dad and their families and i got no support or help by anybody idk how im still alive i wish i wasnt i stayed alive just to see others living better without carrying this whole emotional burden i have and just to get physical issues a heart condition i got last year that can kill me and the worst part is my physical issues are probably caused by the stress ive been under and one thing led to another and all this at just 14 years old why am i even still alive? i dont want this life i cant stand this anymore everyday just gets more unbearable and i fear death less and less if an angel came down from the sky and told me ill die in my sleep tonight i wouldnt care and if anything i would be relieved to be free from this hell,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 15:37:01 UTC,2,0,0.63,,,0,0

1j3day5,i have to watch my grandma die because she wont get a blood transfusion,last monday i watched my grandma from my dads side pass away early in the morning. now yesterday my grandma from my moms side landed in the hospital due to passing cysts and having a mass in her bladder. she keeps passing a lot of blood and her option is basically surgery but since she is too weak for anesthesia she has to have a blood transfusion. she is a jw jehovah witness and their big thing is they can accept any medical procedure or help besides blood transfusions. we are in a small town and we have limited alternatives. my grandma gave partial power of attorney to a couple people in her congregation including her brother which he is also part of that but more level headed. we have a random guy from the kingdom hall that keeps coming to check on her but in reality he is making sure she doesnt accept the transfusion. my mom and aunt are tired of him. i talked to my grandma yesterday before leaving her and basically reassuring her even though she is 84 she still has an outstanding quality of life she drives lives on her own sees friends etc. amp it would be okay to look the other way if it could save your life. my grandma said maybe if i was younger. after some thought i get it. the kh is her community if she accepted the transfusion it wouldnt be a secret and i am sure they would disfellowship her and that would cause more harm i am sure. i am just angry i am angry that i am losing another grandma in a 2 week span i am angry at her faith and the people in it. i am just mad. i havent dealt with a lot of death and now it feels like i am getting the ringer. i learned a lot about these medicalethical dilemmas in school but i never thought itd happen in my family. i always knew about the blood thing but id never thought my grandma would be in this situation. tldr i lost one grandma last week now my other grandma is in the hospital for a life threatening thing and she wont accept a blood transfusion because of her religion and her congregation put eyes on her and us to ensure we dont persuade her to do it. thank you for reading i just had to get this off my chest. everything will be ok in the end i know. death is apart of life. edit thank you everyone for your condolences and sharing your lived experiences around this. a couple of things i know this religion was my grandmas whole life. if she wants to go this way then in the end ill support her. i just cant fathom the influence of religion but i know that its not me. i know she is at an old age and she will just get worse as years go on. i guess it just kind of sucks that a religion is dictating on her medical problems. but if she is happy then thats all that matters and i need to find a way to not be angry at her for it.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 15:28:15 UTC,120,51,0.91,,,0,0
1j3d6a0,the first time i ever hugged my dad was to stop his suicide attempt,this happened just a few months ago but everyone around me hasnt mentioned it since the night it happened. my dad was neglected physically and from what ive gathered in conversations sexually abused as a child. his mother started him on hard drugs before the age of 10. by age 14 he was dealing to her. he hasnt had anything close to an easy life. but he wanted nothing more than to turn his life around when he had me. he and my mom had me at 18 and 19 and were married about 4 months after my birth. as far back as i can remember their marriage always had issues. it wasnt easy for my mom being married to an addict. he stayed clean for the majority of my childhood but i know he had relapses along the way. despite the issues my parents have built a good life for me and my siblings. moneys tight sometimes but we never are in need of anything. my dad is clean and works a good paying job my mom works at the elementary school in our small town. but the last two years ive seen a huge change in how my dad was acting. he was irritable constantly arguing with my mom and threatening divorce. this all came to a breaking point one night when my parents both considerably drunk were having some meaningless argument fueled by alcohol and resentment. in the middle of the argument my dad just got up and left the house. i watched him walk into the garage shutting to door behind himself. i figured he was just taking some time to cool off so i didnt think much of it. about 20 minutes later my mom came to me crying telling me to go check in on him. i now know that he had been mentioning taking his life to her in private. i went and opened the garage door and found my dad crying at a table with a ladder and rope in the middle of the garage. i didnt even look at him i was staring at the ladder. i didnt know what to say. his first response to me walking in was being angry with me. he told me if i thought that he was going to kill himself that way i was wrong. he said he had much better methods of doing so. i didnt leave and i didnt respond. i sat down on the other side of the garage and we sat in silence. eventually he began crying profusely and telling me he didnt know how to deal with himself anymore and i started crying too. he told me i didnt have to worry about him put the ladder and rope away and told me to go back in the house. but it still didnt feel right to me. before i went inside i walked over to him without saying a word and hugged him. we stayed that way for a few minutes both crying. when we stepped back he grabbed a pistol from his waistband and handed it to me. i took it inside without a word and made sure it was put back into the safe with the ammo separate. we never mentioned this night again and its been eating me alive from the inside out.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 15:22:38 UTC,0,2,0.5,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0
1j3co94,you know what to do,ive been following this community for quite some time now and i can finally come here to get something off my chest most of the posts in here or other communities that ask for an opinion or advice of what to do in their romantic relationship you know what to do. you are searching reassurance which is very important and valid sometimes we just need to feel validated to fire in us the courage to do whats needed to save ourselves from a bad situation. your post is important. however 9 out of 10 you know what needs to be done. tbh if you needed to come to reddit post a personal problem youre having with your partner because you tried several times to talk to them or you are afraid of their reaction to say xyz.... i mean if your voice isnt enough for your partner to care about you and really try finding a solution together or if you are walking on eggshells with your partner or if you been through the same discussion time and time again with no change nor even honest attempt to deal with said issue you have a much deeper problem than the problem you came here to solve with our help. when communication is staled cut avoided or violently pushed away this is the main factor to end any kind of relationship. its not that redditors like to say break up to all postsits just that there is really no one can do if your relationship is oneway street in communication. really. we would love you to thrive and be happy with your loved one but if your partner doesnt consider you enough to try to solve a problem after you offering solutions and all what other advice can we give to you? and you know it. do not feel discouraged to post though. we will reassure you and most of comments really want you to have a good relationship and be happy. wish you all the courage and happiness. for real.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 15:00:21 UTC,5,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j3cnos,i was terrible but my ex made me insecure.,im not a horrible person. im a flawed person and my insecurity made me act stupid. i fought with my fiancés ex threw a key at her and told his ex wife things that werent entirely true. their relationship made me insanely insecure and it broke me. they were always together in a way that made me uncomfortable. i grew up with divorced parents and they never spent holidays together or took me out as a family. it was always separate two houses two rooms two holidays. but them? they always went out together with the kids. i went a few times too but once a street vendor called them a beautiful couple. and what was i supposed to be? the babysitter? a friend? it felt like everyone saw them as a couple. were they physically close? no not really. i know i might sound crazy but it was the way they talked to and treated each other. i know i was wrong i know what i did to her was awful. but i got to a place i never wanted to be. i was so desperate to keep him that i was the one who proposed. and he just accepted. like he was agreeing to give a coworker a ride home. not like it was something he actually wanted. anything she asked him hed answer with more enthusiasm than he did to my actual marriage proposal. i know i messed up but im not okay. im gonna talk to him tomorrow about breaking up. i wanna be happy about starting a new chapter.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 14:59:43 UTC,0,6,0.4,,,0,0

1j3c1dj,i feel broken because of my socalled friends,i have been going through some issues. my mental health is broken i am emotionally unstable the fact that my 3 female friends just ignored me all of a sudden at first i thought it was nothing but when weeks passed i sensed something was wrong as i am very sensitive to change so i knew something was going on between them and me. i acted normal to make sure i was just overthinking but apparently i was wrong. even when my muslim friend wasnt there anymore they would still push me away and respond with very few words which is not their usual type. they would act normally with others but to me they were cold ignorant and hurtful one even pushed me and had a very judgemental and angry look as if i had done something and of course this broke me. the other day i tried to confront them and they ignored me and went away. because we only always see during the school day i told them that i would bring them to the guidance counsellor if they wouldnt talk to me and reassured them that i would reach out to our advisor first before even going to that extent. they finally talked to me. my muslim friend lets just say girl 1 told me that they were not talking to me because they were bonding as girls and that she was a muslim and of course i understand that. but she wasnt even there to begin with. she was not the problem but the other 2. we were close friends especially girl 2 who ive known since childhood. i told her that she wasnt the issue because ive been respectful to her and didnt talk to her nor get close to her after her transition. i exclaimed to them why didnt they tell me then instead of ignoring me and on top of that i asked them why the two were ignoring me when girl 1 wasnt there. she didnt say anything and didnt look at me ignoring me completely during my confrontation i told them that i was an open book and they couldve told me i said that they were like fake friends acting like they didnt know me and i was crying as we talked. part 1,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-04 14:30:45 UTC,1,3,1.0,,,0,0
