i felt like an interviewer. for science and curiosity. i wasn't sexually invested at all, it wasn't like that. i just purely was incredibly curious.


two weeks of talking and he says hey, we should both piss ourselves. i didnt feel up to it. but i encouraged him to if he wanted. but time goes by and he asks again and encourages me. i have some weird piss dreams and he started to inspire my own curiosity. i wasnt necessarily sexually invested here but curious nonetheless.


we plan it out. i wait till my parents are asleep and its the middle of the night. its summer. i go outside in a t-shirt, shorts, and underwear. and i text him and hes ready too tho i don't remember his situation and location.


and then i try it. i piss myself. and the very beginning was interesting but quickly felt weird and awkward mixed with shame and disgust. i was just a girl who pissed themselves on their lawn in the middle of the night. it was more than i expected. i was gross, so i penguin walked with my legs together back to the door, stripped my shorts off and ran inside and into my bathroom and quickly took a shower.


i didnt message him for a week or so because i felt weird. but then curiosity took over about his experience and i asked him how it went and sorry i dissapeared. he then told me how exciting and wonderful his experience was. it was everything he wanted it to be and more. so much more.


i was like oh cool man and battled curiosity while feeling like i wanted to close this chapter. at this point he trusted me more and volunteered more information. telling me how he started pissing his pants and just throwing that in his laundry hamper.


this progressed and he brought up the curiosity of shitting himself. this, i was quickly disinterested in. but i didn't want to shame him, i felt bad and confused. i had a self rule of no kink shaming so people felt they could talk to me.

he was estatic. it was his new thing. his favorite thing. at this point, i congratulate him and fucking dissapear lmao.

,2025-03-12 00:34:28 UTC,1j96ejp,,,5,2,,"So, it's a long story. I was in a long-distance online relationship, and we broke up about two months ago. When I was with my ex, he was never really sexual with me and barely paid attention to me. Anyway, we broke up, and since then, I've been feeling sexually frustrated.

About a week ago, I met another guy online. Initially, he reached out to support me after seeing my vent post, but after a few days of talking, things escalated, and we ended up doing a lot of sexting and phone call sex. He would masturbate on call with me. While we were masturbating together, we would talk dirty and moan a lot on the phone. Since then, we haven't stopped sexting each other. Last night, we sexted for about 2.5 to 3 hours, which was very liberating, honestly. I've never been sexually intimate with anyone like this before, so I'm glad I met him.

However, there's an issue: he keeps feeling bad about my situation and keeps offering to help me out financially. I keep saying no to him because, firstly, I don't want to feel like a prostitute, and secondly, I don't want him to think that I'm using him for money. I've told him that I appreciate the thought, but I don't feel comfortable accepting his money. He understood, yet there's something about him wanting to give me money that rubs me the wrong way.

In addition to that, he tells me that I shouldn't tell him if I'm seeing other men because that would make him jealous. We aren't in a romantic relationship, but he's already getting possessive, even though we're just in a friends-with-benefits situation. He also told me that he would get envious if he found out that I lost my virginity to anyone besides him, yet he claims to understand. Honestly, I don't know how to feel about this.

I haven't been this sexually intimate with anyone before due to my insecurities about my body. Also, I just don't know how to talk to guys in real life. I love talking to him and being myself around him while we sext. However, I can already see the red flags in him.

The mouse was stuck on a glue pad, screaming its little lungs out like it was auditioning for a horror movie. Naturally, I sprang into action, armed with the most heroic tool I could find: vegetable oil. (Move over, Captain America—my shield is a bottle of canola.)

I gently poured the oil, whispering sweet nothings like, “Hold on, little buddy, I’ve got you.” The mouse looked up at me with its beady eyes, and for a moment, I thought I saw gratitude. Spoiler alert: I was wrong.

As soon as its tiny feet were free, the mouse turned into a furry little demon. It lunged at my finger like it was the last piece of cheese on Earth and chomped down like it was trying to set a world record for “Longest Mouse Bite.” Fifteen seconds. FIFTEEN SECONDS. Do you know how long that feels when a rodent has a personal vendetta against your fingertip? It’s basically a lifetime.

I’m standing there, bleeding like I just lost a sword fight, while this ungrateful little gremlin is hanging off my finger like it’s a carnival ride. Finally, it let go, and I released it outside, where it scampered off into the sunset without so much as a “thank you” or a “sorry for the attempted murder.”

Now, I’m left with a bandaged finger, a bruised ego, and the haunting realization that I’ve been outsmarted by a creature with a brain the size of a pea. Moral of the story? No good deed goes unpunished, especially when the recipient weighs less than a slice of bread and has the temperament of a tiny, furry serial killer.

Sometimes, 
Sometimes….
I just wish I could either give birth or donate my eggs to someone from a specific country. 
I don’t want to be a mother : no. At least not yet. 
Donating eggs : seems horribly expensive and painful.
Giving birth too. But abandoning a baby holy moly is that even WORSE. 
I just want to have a descendant somewhere, over there.
Idk why, because it’s morally wrong. Maybe not the egg donation but wanting it to be in a specific country is merely just impossible, especially since it’s just horrifyingly expensive and I can’t be too old. I’m 26 and I’m just… maybe I’m wrong and hallucinating. Idk.  Maybe because I want a descendant ? Maybe because I can’t go to this country because it’s inaccessible ? I’m afraid of saying where it is here, I will be judged. I might read this and tell myself how wrong I was, that’s for sure.

I just wish I could either give birth or donate my eggs to someone from a specific country. 
I don’t want to be a mother : no. At least not yet. 
Donating eggs : seems horribly expensive and painful.
Giving birth too. But abandoning a baby holy moly is that even WORSE. 
I just want to have a descendant somewhere, over there.
Idk why, because it’s morally wrong. Maybe not the egg donation but wanting it to be in a specific country is merely just impossible, especially since it’s just horrifyingly expensive and I can’t be too old.

We talked for a couple of months during the holidays, but because he lives in a different state, we ended up never getting to meet in person. He followed me on instagram and we basically interacted every now and then (though he left me on read any time I tried to strike conversation).

He came across as such a sweetheart, and I'm not sure why, his smile and the way he seemed to interact with his loved ones really stroke me as someone special. It's like I've been hypnotized ever since I met him.

I decided to reach out anonymously, because any time I tried to send him a meme and start conversation, he'd just like it or leave me on read... And I'm REALLY shy, so the idea of coming forward as myself and him finding me too ugly or rejecting me for being too forward scared me...

I wanted to message anonymously to see if he was as sweet as he seemed to be, or if I could find out more about his personality--to either come forward as myself and declare my intentions, or just leave it be.

Well, he was freaked out and worried I was a stalker... I know it's a valid concern, especially given that I could only find his work email online... :(  
He still talked to me under his throwaway email for a few days, and I realized we have more in common than I could have ever anticipated. However, I realized he thought I was his ex that he still likes to this day after a while...

Every night we spoke anonymously, we would go to bed with him saying how special he felt that someone liked him this way, to the point of messaging anonymously. Then, in the morning, he'd wake up freaked out and delete me (only to re-add later on)...

In the end, I ended up calling him and coming forward. We had a really lovely conversation on the phone that lasted about 3 hours, and he wanted me to fly to see him, and that we'd make it work because he felt so flattered.

The next morning, he blocked me everywhere and said it wouldn't work. We haven't spoken ever since.

I think I freaked him out. He probably thinks I'm insane, and I worry that I came across as such.

He is a lawyer and was really worried this was some type of scam. Though, he did seem to enjoy when I praised him and I feel a little used given some of the things we talked about.

It's been 3 days, and I feel horrible. I still like him, and I don't even know why I like him so much...

I just have this feeling he thought I was prettier anonymously than I turned out to be. If I was prettier, he wouldn't have blocked me...

He also told me he had some complicated exes that he had to call the police on, so I hit a soft/difficult spot by reaching out anonymously...

I keep thinking: what if I had just come forward without the anonymous email? What if I had just flown to his city, pretended as if it was a coincidence and texted him ""hi! I happen to be in your city :) maybe we should grab dinner and catch up?""...

I’m 24 and I’m the oldest of five kids, parents are still married and all five kids are from both parents. I’ve always been a bit different, but overall I think I’m a normal person. My entire family treats me like the weird kid you tolerate until their mom comes and picks them up from the sleepover. 

I used to feel left out as a kid, and looking back I can see it’s because I had very different interests from my siblings and I was very oblivious to social cues. I was (and still kind of am) super nerdy, loved LEGOs (still do), and other kind of geeky interests. I always valued school really highly and my siblings hated school. I was a really outgoing kid and loved making people laugh, and I always seemed to have an easier time with people outside my family. 

I went out of state for college and became much better socialized. I grew a lot while I was there and I made a ton of friends through my degree program and my church. I graduated with honors and a good GPA and immediately got a job in my field. I stayed in the same state and met my fiancé, and we’re getting married this year. 

All of this is to say, I love my life. I like who I am. I have good friends, a good job, and a very loving fiancé who I am so excited to marry. 

And as soon as I’m with my family, the only thing I can think about it how they don’t like me. 

They constantly make jokes at my expense. They exclude me from everything. My siblings all take pictures together, go and do things together, and hang out together, and when I’m home or we’re all on vacation, I am not included in any of it. I have to fight to be included in things, which is the only reason that pictures of me and my siblings together exist. My parents make fun of what I wear. My siblings make fun of me for getting engaged quickly or for going to college (none of them have gone, which is fine, but obviously it helped me get a job, so idk what their problem is). Every single time I visit them I immediately want to leave. 

A few years ago when I officially moved out, my mom told me I was ruining her marriage (she didn’t want me to leave but dad supported me). When my sister did it she was “being independent.” When I was thinking about “sewage slide” in high school and early college she told me it was my fault. When my other sister was dealing with the same thing they paid for her therapy for three years. And now when I try to have conversations with my mom, she doesn’t listen or she starts conversations with other people while I’m mid sentence. I call her regularly to be a good daughter, and she doesn’t care to talk to me and degrades everything I say. My fiancé bought me a super cool LEGO set for Christmas (I almost never got LEGOs as a kid, even though it was the only thing I would ask for at Christmas or for my birthday), and my mom’s first response was, “Why doesn’t he buy you a down payment on a house?”

And there is no reasonable explanation for how I treat myself in private. 

But for the past year or more I cant recognize myself in the mirror. I have a porn addiction that i have been trying to quit for 3-4 years. This means using once up to three times a day.

 And before all you gurus come at me with advice like read the easypeasy method, watch these youtube videos punish yourself do this, do that. I have tried everything and i am not asking for advice, i know that i could quit if i wanted to but quitting is more about self image than anything else and how you change the way you see yourself is not simple and sometimes you don’t want to let yourself change it. I have at times gone weeks without using and crushing my goals only to think “if i really quit right now i dont see myself NEVER doing it again and the feeling when i relapse after however long will only be worse from here on” and so i do it and i cant convince myself otherwise. And it has affected me in so many ways people cant see.

For instance, i fell victim to sextortion, luckily nothing happened and i was let off the hook but it damaged me psychologically to an extent i still feel today, like a wake up call. Furthermore this addiction has damaged my sexual interest, my brain and more importantly my faith and some of the best years of my life. 

And everyday i ask myself how i would let me do this to myself but its always the same conclusion. I feel like an addict, and i don’t trust myself to stay consistent.

I have tried everything and i am not asking for advice, i know that i could quit if i wanted to but quitting is more about self image than anything else and how you change the way you see yourself is not simple and sometimes you don’t want to let yourself change it. I have at times gone weeks without using and crushing my goals only to think “if i really quit right now i dont see myself NEVER doing it again and the feeling when i relapse after however long will only be worse from here on” and so i do it and i cant convince myself otherwise. And it has affected me in so many ways people cant see.

For instance, i fell victim to sextortion, luckily nothing happened and i was let off the hook but it damaged me psychologically to an extent i still feel today, like a wake up call. Furthermore this addiction has damaged my sexual interest, my brain and more importantly my faith and some of the best years of my life. 

And everyday i ask myself how i would let me do this to myself but its always the same conclusion. I feel like an addict, and i don’t trust myself to stay consistent. And its not like i can reach out for help cause that would shatter this image that everyone has of me and thats all i have right now.

If anyone even cares to read this far, say what you want in the comments whether it be sympathy or advice i dont care..",2415,1,1,0.60681725

For context, I am from a Muslim-majority country where homosexuality is still illegal. I am Muslim, and my neighbor’s kid was Hindu. None of our families were strictly religious, but homosexuality is still very taboo.

Since we were around the same age, we used to play together a lot. I don’t remember exactly when it started, but I recall watching movies with my parents where the male and female leads would date and kiss, and I wanted to try that too. So one day, I convinced my neighbor’s kid to play house with me and roleplay as husband and wife. I didn’t like her or have a crush on her, but I wanted to try dating and having a boyfriend like in the movies. We weren't allowed to be around boys so that's why I was roleplaying with her. I convinced her to kiss and make out with me since we were pretending to be husband and wife. We played like this a lot.

We didn’t always play house. We also played other normal games that kids play, like hide and seek and board games. I wasn’t specifically targeting her to take advantage of her, but now that I’m older and can reflect on my actions, I see that what I did was awful. This wasn’t a one-time occasion.

Here’s a long story I’ve never told a soul. 

When I was 21, I was a junior in college. Not your typical college guy. I was shy, reserved, didn’t drink, didn’t smoke, never slept around. I had a girlfriend at the time I really liked. Typical college story though.. she met another guy on the tennis team and dropped me for him. I was devastated. 

I went with a friend on a trip, out of feeling so down from my breakup. I did something I normally didn’t do and went to a bar, where a lady older than me randomly came up to me very friendly and said that I looked like a “lost puppy.” She was 28 and married. She asked for my snap, then began to message me and nothing happened on our trip between she and I. But her messaging turned into about 10 months of a sexual affair. We lived far apart, so we’d just find random places. 

This lady told me I was her 3rd sexual encounter outside of her marriage. She told me she had cheated at a wedding a couple years prior and on another vacation years prior. 

She told me she was a “serial cheater” and had cheated on every single man she had ever been with, from high school until the present then. 

She told me how she had so much nostalgia for some dude she dated in college. She said she’d wait for her husband to get drunk and she’d go message this old college flame, while her husband was passed out drunk. 

I was so innocent then and idk, but I think her “bad nature” drew me in.. sickening to think of now

Since then, she moved even further away, left her husband and from my peeping of her socials, has been in at least one serious relationship since her marriage dissolved. 

All this to say.. I have never forgiven myself. I have no clue how I went from such a good guy, to doing such a heinous and evil act. I’ve never done anything of the sort since nor will I ever. Did we get caught? Nope, but I think that made it even worse because now it’s been YEARS, but every day I think of how awful I am and how much I just wish I could go back in time and talk to that 21 year old kid and tell him how things are.. How wrong this is, how he’ll regret is badly when he gets older.. Why is he ruining his innocence and hurting a sacred covenant? These are thoughts I still live with. 

I’ve been in therapy since and not to make this religious, but I’ve prayed so many times for forgiveness because I feel filthy and awful and unworthy of anything now. I’ve done volunteer work and am way less judgmental of people now, because I realize we all have something in our past we aren’t proud of. I’ve tried redeeming myself, but still feel awful. 

A little while back, this particular girl tracked me down and messaged me… I replied in a very matter of fact way, didn’t tell her a thing about my current whereabouts. I told her I didn’t have any desire to ever communicate with her again, I told her I forgave her and hope she forgave me, because we enabled one another to do an awful thing. She hasn’t tried reaching out since. I’d be happy if I don’t hear her name until I read her obituary.. Hopefully that’s a long time away, because I don’t wish her any harm, I just want to bury that behind me for good. 

FWIW, karma did get me good (which I deserved), after college graduation I had a very brief stint in the Marines and was dropped during induction for medical. Then came back to my home state and met a girl I was crazy over.. She told me a little bit into our relationship she had been cheating with her ex the entire time behind my back. I was devastated.. But, I knew it was karma and i deserved it. 

I’ve never told a soul of what I did (other than my therapist) nor do I plan to. It’s too shameful and my guilt way too high. I hope to take it to the grave. I just hope to live a better life and maybe someday I can meet someone good and make a life together, but I guess I’ll just never forgive myself for what I did at 21.

She opened my eyes to my own feelings and has even continued to support me in my journey of finding what's right for me. She has a beautiful family now and a loving boyfriend so it's no longer my place to share these feelings with her directly but if by some chance you do ever read these words I just want you know that I love you. I love you with all of my heart and more. I'll love you till the end of my days even if we never speak again.

I was trying to do IT so this was a step in that direction. 

After interviewing they took all my information and said I would be training during a 2 month probationary period and be paid in the end. 

They actually assigned me daily work over the course of a month and I was “supposed to be paid“ after my six weeks were up. But weird things started happening.

First, I got a call from a random lady from Texas, claiming I friended her on Zelle. Then I got an email a couple weeks later saying my banking information was successfully transferred to a new financial institution, which I never approved or attempted. And finally someone claiming to be with the FBI called me saying I’m under investigation for stealing $3000 from someone’s bank account. He was not an FBI agent. At this point i called my bank to report potential fraud. That email and “FBI” call both happened within 30 minutes. 

All in all, just in case the money was real I sort of did the work but didn’t expect much. I locked my account so nothing can be taken, but money can be added. 

I was wholeheartedly impressed by the scam I fell for so I wasn’t even mad. I usually play along with scams just to fuck with them but this was some next level shit lmao. 

The website they used and everything was falsified to look so real, with references and all.

And that’s where I met her. 

She was slightly shorter, long curly hair and a pretty smile. She wore that uniform like it she was doing it a favor. She was quiet but would talk tia. Few girls in that specific section and ofc how I’m out going and polite I was like why not she’s cute and she’s quite my top 2 things I like in a girl. I felt like she was the one and as the months passed I progressed little by little and thought about her all the time. 

 One night in august me and my homies from the stock room decide to get a big group and my close friend Alex was like yo dude this is ur perfect chance, invite her and try to get her social at the same time. I was scared but I made the confidence to talk to her and in the end she did. Sadly she did not go out with us for personal reasons but she texted me , i responded, she added me to her close friends, and we began to talk more and more. 

Looking back I think it was the fact she was darker then me that made me like her more lol ( I’m pale asf) and she was also a Salvi. When we college started we would meet up and it led to us revealing we wanted to get to know each other more. I still remember that day we sat outside , behind the science building at our campus. We sit next to each other after she says goodbye to her friend and we make eye contact. My hearts beating as we sit close together and I’m scared but I know what I wanna say. I honestly enjoy being with you and I wanna get to know you more if that’s cool with you. “ I wanna get to know you too. You look like the type of person I wanna get to know” 

2 days later we shared our first kiss in her car and I sometimes think about how smooth and sweet her lips were.( she vaped so it tasted like strawberries) as the weeks passed we progressed to… well I will admit I’m at fault I rushed a few things as in making out, and nearly having sex. I respected her wishes as in waiting or to do it in a better spot. ( we would mostly make out in her car cause both our places got people) regardless I started to lose feelings mostly due to the fact how she was really starting to… be a bit weird the more I progressed with her. I was also seeing her nearly 5 days a week 3 extra times in school and maybe 2 days to myself so this came into a factor as well. Also that… she looked different well not entirely different but she relied a lot on makeup. 

Her friends were interesting, mainly gay which does not bother me but most would be talking about stuff or cracking jokes that I did not  understand. I was always nice don’t get me wrong but I felt… a bit out of place and weirded out due to certain graphic topics that came up. 3 weeks in I told her I can’t do this and it did hurt… however I did not diss her or tell people oh cause of this. I kept it private and… well a month flew by and we tried again… but then again it did not work out well. 

Ik her very well and she’s a hard working individual and one of the most funniest. It’s been 5 months since and I still got her IG.

And that’s where I met her. 

She was slightly shorter, long curly hair and a pretty smile. She wore that uniform like it she was doing it a favor. She was quiet but would talk tia. Few girls in that specific section and ofc how I’m out going and polite I was like why not she’s cute and she’s quite my top 2 things I like in a girl. I felt like she was the one and as the months passed I progressed little by little and thought about her all the time. 

 One night in august me and my homies from the stock room decide to get a big group and my close friend Alex was like yo dude this is ur perfect chance, invite her and try to get her social at the same time. I was scared but I made the confidence to talk to her and in the end she did. Sadly she did not go out with us for personal reasons but she texted me , i responded, she added me to her close friends, and we began to talk more and more. 

Looking back I think it was the fact she was darker then me that made me like her more lol ( I’m pale asf) and she was also a Salvi. When we college started we would meet up and it led to us revealing we wanted to get to know each other more. I still remember that day we sat outside , behind the science building at our campus. We sit next to each other after she says goodbye to her friend and we make eye contact. My hearts beating as we sit close together and I’m scared but I know what I wanna say. I honestly enjoy being with you and I wanna get to know you more if that’s cool with you. “ I wanna get to know you too. You look like the type of person I wanna get to know” 

2 days later we shared our first kiss in her car and I sometimes think about how smooth and sweet her lips were.( she vaped so it tasted like strawberries) as the weeks passed we progressed to… well I will admit I’m at fault I rushed a few things as in making out, and nearly having sex. I respected her wishes as in waiting or to do it in a better spot. ( we would mostly make out in her car cause both our places got people) regardless I started to lose feelings mostly due to the fact how she was really starting to… be a bit weird the more I progressed with her. I was also seeing her nearly 5 days a week 3 extra times in school and maybe 2 days to myself so this came into a factor as well. Also that… she looked different well not entirely different but she relied a lot on makeup. 

Her friends were interesting, mainly gay which does not bother me but most would be talking about stuff or cracking jokes that I did not  understand. I was always nice don’t get me wrong but I felt… a bit out of place and weirded out due to certain graphic topics that came up. 3 weeks in I told her I can’t do this and it did hurt… however I did not diss her or tell people oh cause of this. I kept it private and… well a month flew by and we tried again… but then again it did not work out well. 

Ik her very well and she’s a hard working individual and one of the most funniest. It’s been 5 months since and I still got her IG. I message maybe once in a while but stopped to not let her catch any feelings. We both have this bond or… I guess work bond you can say? Looking back I feel like “ did work make us do this?

I have a really terrible childhood that if I was to tell the story it would need to be a whole other Reddit post cause of the amount of shit I been thru. However when I turned 18 my aunt was beginning to hit me over little things that no family member should do. As I mentioned they are Jehovah’s Witness and my aunt who i was living with at the time is  related to is my mother. Aka my Tia abuela or grandma aunt. 

Anyways my family especially from this side i was raised in have a ton of anger, depression and mental issues and often the old heads just bury there feelings or trauma with something. Claiming that mental health ain’t a thing that your just lazy or don’t believe in god.  this aunt I was with used this religion to cover up her trauma and just leased it out on me. 

Once when early Saturday morning, before the people came to our house for service my aunt got mad for something and grabbed me by the collar while dressed up ready to go preaching, she grabbed me so hard she ripped a button off and later got mad when I told her while it was ripped.

One time she got mad at something I did and grabbed me by my collar and broke my chain my grandma gave me and I cried later cause I had to use a string to fix it… I was 13 both times 

Once I called my mother the 2nd year I was with them cause my aunt  and her husband were so old school that they would hit us thinking it was right. Was about 8 and eventually gave up after a fight broke out with them both…

I felt growing up with her it was eggshells and ofc she took the basic stuff to take care of me and my sister like food and shelter but I felt… like that love was not there. You ever speak to someone and be open? Like you tell them how you’re feeling and they add on to it? That’s something I did not feel like I could do with her cause she scared me..

In 2023 when I turned 18 she placed her hands on me more cause I would speak up or back at her. What confused me more was that she would hit me or slap me and take it as a challenge if I put my hands up which was just a basic mechanism to protect myself.  I would tell her how can she be acting like this before or after church? It made no sense for a women to be the wife of an elder to act so innocent and happy but say the harshest things to me and cover my arms in scratches.

Once we had a special circuit overseer ( a traveling missionary in that religion ) come over for dinner. It was a Saturday so I was studying and while my uncle was cooking steak outside she was like go watch him cook and learn. I said: I know how to cook, every time I’m with the people from the English congregation they always let me. Tio does not let me. 

She got mad and told me to go do it and so I walk downstairs and grab my shoes and toss them on the ground after she yelled something. When the I tossed my shoes she slapped her dishes and walked up to me and grabbed my wrist and yelled at her to let go and she scratched my arms so bad that even my friends at my part time job were concerned about me. It was bad… whats crazy my uncle never said anything to her after he asked me what happed to my arms cause he saw the claw like marks and my aunt that night was just smiling and happy talking to the missionary’s and his wife…

My final straw was when she started to hit me early in the morning after she saw me sleeping in after our 3 day convention which are like 8 hours max and for us cause they were both high ranking officials so I had to be there early asf with them and what I found crazy this woman was slapping and hitting me in the head like I did the worst thing in the world just for sleeping in 1 day  during summer school and what’s funny I told her I can just take it online here at home. 7:00 in the morning she’s yelling and I get up as she grabs me and yell at her how is she acting like this after a the convention?

Hey reddit! 
So I’m not sure on how to really write this and I’m very emotional right now writing this but anyways here it goes

So I (20F) was at my best friend’s house about a week ago and his cousin Jake(fake name)(30M) was there. Now I have liked Jake for a while and i have known him since i was 15 and he was 25. we were both drinking and we kissed. He wanted to have s3x and he told me he has wanted to do this since we met (which i found a bit creepy since i was 15 and he was 25)

Anyways he kept asking and i said no and he continued to ask while attempting to undo my pants. I said no a few more times and eventually allowed it to happen. 

After that night i was taken to the doctor to be tested for any STIs/STDs for it was unprotected. And i had so many invasive tests done in the trauma unit. 

I have been in an emotional state since and im not sure why 

My parents and friends are saying i was assaulted but I’m still not sure
but i did feel like i was taken advantage of. 
Im so confused on if i was actually assaulted or if I’m being dramatic because i feel guilty because my body enjoyed it. 

I don’t want to get the police involved or to get a case. I just want to forget about it. 
And also the fact that I’m not sure if it was sexual assault. So i don’t want to ruin someone’s life because of something i may have overreacted to. 

So i just wanted another opinion

When they weren't fighting, they would rather go outside, leaving me alone with a babysitter. The neighbors didn’t like it when I played with their children due to my family’s condition.

I found it difficult to study and I had trouble staying focused on the topics in class, which led me to be the dumbest kid in class. Other children didn’t want to play with me because they thought I was odd. The only time they let me hang out with them was when I promised to carry their bags wherever they went. I will please everyone, lick their shoes if I have to as long as I can be friends with them, but most of the time I just sat alone on the swing in the school playground.

During my teenage years, I was bullied because of my appearance. My hair was tangled, falling out, and thinning due to stress. My skin looked dulled and I had acne. My body didn't fit the beauty standards in the place where I lived. Oh right, I forgot to mention that I’m still struggling academically. I have short attention span, I get distracted very easily and it’s difficult to concentrate.

I lost my Dad 5 years ago to alcohol abuse. He drank himself to death and it was a difficult time for me to put it mildly. He lost his job and started drinking away as a means to cope and he would hit me if I tried to take the alcohol away. In the months before his passing he would tell me that he would pass away eventually and I was in so much pain. 

I remember coming home from school and seeing him collapse and pass away, it was the most painful and difficult situation of my life.

Everyone in my neighborhood made fun of me and tormented me following my father’s passing. My neighbor drove drunk into my driveway and started harassing me calling me the N word and saying I didn’t belong in the neighborhood and that my dad died because he hates me. She knew where I went to university and while I was there she falsified a report to the police that I was dangerous. Campus police pulled me over and put a gun in my face, I thought I was going to die. Furthermore due to PTSD I crashed my vehicle a month later however I got it back through insurance. I continued having mental health issues.

A few months after this I started working in IT and it was the most fun job I ever had, I love technology and solving issues related to it was so much fun for me. I met this girl I really liked and we started dating. The friend group I was in felt that I wasn’t giving them as much attention as I should so they started putting me down and talking negatively about my relationship and myself in hopes of gaining control of me and keeping me within the confines of the group. 

Around the time I started working in IT, I lost 40 pounds and got dreads. My friends commented initially that I started to look more attractive and they liked the look and my girlfriend agreed. It ended up being a point of contention when my friends realized my girlfriend was White and I was African-American. They used to talk down to me and kept saying “You think you’re better than all of us” when I had never said that in my life.

The hispanic friends within my group had the most vitriol and hate for my which I will never understand. The last day I ever hung out with these people I was dropping home one of them and he asked me if I wanted to hang out with him and I said sure. He took me to a nightclub without telling me and gave me alcohol, I drank and this girl came up to me and we started talking in the club. He was on the other side of the room seething in anger and later that night tried to rob me. When I realized the situation, I left the club and took an Uber home. After his failed attempt to rob me, the group chat was filled with constant threats against me and racist remarks. I decided at this point to leave the group and never look back. The guy who tried to rob me later attempted to break into my house at 4am and my mother called the police and he was placed on a criminal trespassing charge. Following the charge, as retribution he attempted to sue me in court for harassment however this did not go anywhere and the case was dismissed for insufficient evidence.

Throughout my life I treated everyone as human beings not by their colors, it only made sense with ancestors from the civil rights movement. Thats the way I was raised and I care more about respect and character than the appearance of a person.

I want to become a software engineer and applied for a Master’s in Comp Sci program online. Hopefully I get in.

I always had trouble managing the little money i had. So when i received the benefits affair i got really excited. The first few months i really saved alot and only spent 1-2k of the money. I wanted to save for my drivers license and the future. At the end of 2023 somebody told me about this escort site. I thought about it but let it fade quickly cause I wanted my first time to be special.
Few months later i was failing school and had trouble passing my school and driving exams.
All of my friends where throwing their sexual lives in my face which made me insecure and they didn’t know i was a 20 yr old virgin. I’m good looking so i was told and in my life 2 girls approached me but i was too shy and insecure. I remembered the escort site and decided to go since i felt ashamed for being a virgin and im too shy and insecure for a relationship. I became addicted and in total i slept with 100+ i think. I spent all my money so i searched jobs and worked. On work a few colleagues were gambling on breaks and was making money. Since I didn’t had much i thought i could make it through sports gambling wich seemed easy. I think you know how that went. I won like 500 and since then it went all bad. I quit my job cause of depression snd suicidal thoughts. I told my mom about the gambling and now im seeing a psychologist. Im still very depressed and worried about my future. I never had a relationship cause im afraid to get cheated on and get hurt. But i made some goals for myself like going back to school and doing social work maybe. Just wanted to vent. Thanks

I have witnessed this and I have heard rumors about it, at the last party we went to she drank as usual, we drank, we danced and being very drunk we kissed in the bathroom at the party, that was when another friend arrived and told me that it was a shame to stay in the bathroom sitting vomiting and too drunk to let her go out in a taxi, I told him that there was no problem that I was going to go with her but he and other friends who were also seeing the state she was in. My friend insisted that I spend the night at the house of the colleague who organized the party. Then between 2 boys and 2 girls they put her in the room.

When I wanted to go in to see it, they told me to stay outside, I insisted but the others pushed me and left me on the couch. It was very suspicious that they wouldn't let me in. I told another friend what happened and she told me to calm down that she would be fine. I listened to her and the party continued.

When it was time to leave, I asked about my friend and the girl told me that she would stay with her and her boyfriend. I wasn't too sure about leaving her, but my other friend lived far away and asked me if I could accompany her, I went with her and I didn't hear from my friend until Monday. She arrived at the university normal, I told her that she was fine and she responded that yes, she seemed normal until on the way to the lockers I heard those from the party say ""she was so asleep that she didn't even realize, I took photos and videos of her"" you could hear the boys and girls who in theory were going to take care of her laughing.

 I told her what I heard and she went to confront them but they denied everything and apparently deleted all the photos and videos. She asked me if I heard correctly why I lied (I didn't). She stopped talking to me for a while because of these flyers telling her lies about me that maybe I did that.

Days passed and I told a friend about it and with a slightly worried look she told me ""that's not new."" She told me that at all the parties she went to they did that to her and then I understood why she told me that whenever she drank she lost consciousness and didn't remember anything. Those bastards forced her to drink on purpose.

I was shocked, I didn't know what to say, but it was no use telling her since she wasn't going to believe me without proof and she also stopped talking to me a few days later, that happened a year ago, I haven't spoken to her since then, I'm not going to lie, I feel bad for her.

Ten years ago, when I was 16 years old, this new kid started at school. I was really into Minecraft back then, and he was wearing a Minecraft t-shirt. I didn't have anyone to play with, so I approached him and tried to start a conversation. He was really hesitant and shy at first, but when I asked him about the shirt and complimented it, he lit up. We got to know each other a bit and planned to play together.

We played together for quite a few times and had fun, but eventually I got bored of the game and went outside with my friends instead. My friends didn't like him, so we never invited him; and that's when he started to get a little clingy, he would constantly keep asking to play and wouldn't take the hint if I said no. He had also asked our friend group if he could play outside with us quite a few times, and I didn't mind him and would have welcomed him, some people in the group didn't want him there, so I went along with it.

He started following me around a bit later and pestering me quite often. He would follow me around and talk about memes, YouTube videos, and Minecraft, often talking about it nonstop for up to 10 minutes without even giving me a chance to speak.. This kept going on for quite a while, and the whole time, I was getting more and more irritated, yet the more we spoke, the more I was getting irritated. I was too scared to back out of the conversation politely, which led to my irritation building up over time.

*Then I had one bad day, which took away a life.*

One day, we were at the bus station, and he approached me and started chatting. At one point, all the anger built up over time inside me exploded, and I snapped and I told him:

 ***""Just shut up! I was never your friend; we just played Minecraft together a few times. You are extremely annoying and nobody likes you""***

The next day, the teacher sat us down and told us that he had committed suicide, my entire world shattered. I instantly knew that what I said caused this and that I had caused him to commit suicide.

I was invited to the funeral, during which his parents spoke to me and revealed an extremely important detail about him. It turns out he was very autistic and had severe trouble making friends all his life, and he was obsessed with MC. When he met me and we played, he became really happy and wouldn't stop talking to his parents about how he finally made a good friend, they knew me as his best friend. 

This shattered my world, I didn't know he was autistic and considered me his only friend, I didn't realise how important our sessions playing together were for him.  But that doesn't justify what I did, I should have never said that. I still can't play Minecraft after a decade.

So I walked back across this massive field, full bladder. THERE IS NO BATHROOM ANYWHERE. NO BUILDINGS. NO FRIENDLY LOOKING HOUSES.

She then invited me into her car and offered to drive me home, I never told her I had pissed my pants. I sat in her car, slowly soaking her car seat in my piss. Oh and guess what, I came home to realize I was on my period. So not only was my piss on her car seat.... my period blood too. I *would* tell you the cover up story I told everyone to protect my shame, but, I'm so scared that they'll somehow see this. I'm so embarrassed.

After absolutely soaking my pants and shoes, I knew I had to get home ASAP. My phone was dead, and it had BEEN dead for the past DAY. I was staying the week at my friends house and halfway through the week my phone gave up on me, meaning, I was fully dependent  on my friend and *his* phone. I happened to cross paths with a very kind lady (F maybe 26?) and decided to explain how my phone wasn't working and how I didn't know where tf I was. She then invited me into her car and offered to drive me home, I never told her I had pissed my pants. I sat in her car, slowly soaking her car seat in my piss. Oh and guess what, I came home to realize I was on my period. So not only was my piss on her car seat.... my period blood too. I *would* tell you the cover up story I told everyone to protect my shame, but, I'm so scared that they'll somehow see this. I'm so embarrassed.

TLDR;; I pissed my pants in a field/park, located in an area I didn't know. My phone was dead and I had to ask a random lady to take me home, I proceeded to sit in her car with my piss pants whilst she was oblivious of my accident. Came home to find I was on my period. Piss and period blood, embedded into her car seat.

Life Lesson;;; ALWAYS PEE BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE HOUSE. EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU DON'T NEED TO. EVEN. IF. YOU. DON'T. THINK. YOU. NEED. TO.",2680,2,1,0.6123411

He’s so boring, and it takes everything inside of me to not step out of this relationship to feel another person’s touch to be fucked. 

I feel like I am stuck in this relationship. He wanted nothing more than a family, and I don’t want to take that away from him, but my god, do I hate my life.
