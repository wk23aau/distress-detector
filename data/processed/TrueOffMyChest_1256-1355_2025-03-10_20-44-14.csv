1j6ruyf,my dog just died,he was 3 years old. just a regular morning nothing out of the ordinary. come noon he started vomiting. i call the doctor immediately and he tells me i have nothing to worry about. i called every one hour when his symptoms got worse and he told me not to worry. my dog couldnt move and he told me that catatonia is normal when facing such an infection and that he should be up and about in the morning. 30 minutes later i watched him choke in front of my bare eyes and there was nothing i could do. me and my gf rushed him to the hospital immediately and disregarded the orders from the vet but it was too late. i dont know what to do i dont know how to move on. i feel so numb. so im over here on reddit for advice how does one learn to cope with such a loss? what helped you fellow redditors overcome this feeling of hopelessness? any advice is welcome please help me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 21:46:33 UTC,14,10,0.79,,,0,0
1j6roh8,im a culturally assimilated hispanic and i see more people struggling because they arent. does assimilation really offer an advantage?,ive been thinking a lot about how cultural assimilation impacts opportunities especially in the workplace. i was raised in a predominantly caucasian church group in the midwestsouth where my mom worked multiple jobs and members of the church helped babysit me. because of that environment i never learned spanish and i became a native english speaker without an accent. my name and skin color make it obvious that im hispanic but everything else like my speech my interests even the way i present myself is very much in line with mainstream american culture. i never really thought much about this until i started noticing a pattern in my jobs. ive had no issue moving up. ive always been recognized for my abilities and promotions have come naturally. but people i know people who are just as educated and capable tell me theyre being overlooked for management positions or even treated differently at work. most of them have thick hispanic accents and many were raised in predominantly hispanic communities even if they were born here. i live in a primarily caucasian area and its become clear to me that how you present as hispanic plays a massive role in workplace opportunities. whitewashed hispanics whether they grew up like me or are half hispanic with white first names seem to have a much easier time getting ahead than firstgeneration or immigrant hispanics who retain strong cultural ties. i dont think this is talked about enough. people love to say that discrimination is just about race but i think its also about how comfortable people feel with you. if you fit the dominant culture and dont challenge their perception of whats normal you get a pass. if you dont you hit a wall. has anyone else noticed this?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 21:38:14 UTC,1,2,0.6,,,0,0
1j6rl5a,i dont know what to do!! and i need advice,i 27 father of three lives alone with my three children. thanksgiving month of last year the mother and i got into a heated argument which led to a back and forth physically the most i did was push her to get some space to walk away because i truly dont believe in hitting women unless its life or death. before that even happened two days prior to this she was already putting her hands on me which led to a big bruise on my back. and a long scar going from my neck down to my back. once i pushed her away from me she instantly called the cops and said i was the one being belligerent and she wanted me removed from the house. the police arrive and she!! yes she showed them the camera footage of what had been going on and ofc she was deemed the main aggressor and was taken to jail. once she got out apparently she has a court order to stay off of the property and to have no contact with me. her name is still on the lease so she helps out by paying her half of the rent and once a week will ask if the kids need anything she has a friend that reaches out for her. she currently has no where to live but she stays with a friend and still has her job as a nurse and is in school during the day. she gave me the option of getting a hotel room to get the kids because its going on four months since she has seen or talked to any of them. i thought the hotel option was a good idea and i even offered to pay for half the expenses. but it never happens because she either to busy with school and work. i would like too take her to court so she can at least help me by getting them and keeping them for a week. i have managed to do what i can with childcare and anything else the kids need so i can work my self and i have managed to do this alone. what do i need to do to get her to court so we can have our time with the kids individually? i understand she is in a situation but i shouldnt have to suffer because of it. i hope this doesnt sound bitter on my end but we are not together anymore so she is going to have to start riding her storms out alone now. im not complaining about taking care of my kids because i love them dearly and i dont find anything manly about complaining about something you helped bring into this world but i need a break some times and im only asking for a week.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 21:34:05 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0
1j6r9ab,my one attempt at healthy communication ended horribly and i feel like the worst friend ever,i was heavily bullied via social ostracism as a kid. it also didnt help that i am very likely autistic and i have a very hard time picking up on unspoken social cues. i also grew up in a bit of a turbulent environment where speaking my mind often ended in punishment. therefore my own communication habits are not the healthiest i tend to bottle things up for months and then crash and bedrot for days on end when it all becomes too much. but i have a best friend who i finally felt comfortable attempting more immediate healthy communication with and its blown up so badly that im almost wishing id just kept my mouth shut instead. theyve been getting really into a tv show for about 5 months now which is great and im truly happy for them. a lot of the time theyd send me voice notes about it or wed call and theyd end up talking about it to the point of apologizing for overtaking the conversation and id always say they had nothing to be sorry for because i love listening to my friends be happy about stuff. genuinely i do and it was literally all fine up until last week. after months of searching due to unemployment i had a job interview lined up for the next day. of course i immediately texted my best friend and they congratulated me and said theyd send me messages of encouragement before the interview. i thanked them and then they immediately proceeded to talk about the show again. i didnt think much of it and listened as always because i enjoy it. the interview day comes the next day and its hectic i was so busy that i was literally going from 530am to 530pm and by the time i got home i was ready to crash. my interview was scheduled at 4 and theyd been texting me about the show prior to it so i figured id get my messages soon. well long story short they never came i got home at about 530 immediately crashed and took a 2 hour nap and then woke up to chat with them only to have another conversation about the show. admittedly i didnt feel great about it but i thought it was just the lack of food and sleep talking so i brushed it off. over the next few days though i noticed that sometimes the things id send them would just get liked and immediately moved on from in favor of talking about the show eventually i realized that this wasnt making me feel great so i decided to ask them if we could maybe tone down the conversations about this show and explain how it made me feel. sounds like a healthy way to communicate right? wrong. as soon as i sent the message i realized how badly i fucked up. they were rightfully upset that id waited a week to tell them this and didnt give them the opportunity to correct themselves in the moment and for that i apologized i genuinely thought a week wasnt that much time and it wasnt something i was even mad at just mildly upset. but then the whole conversation kept spiraling and i literally feel sick at the way i made them feel. i thought that i was avoiding bottling it up and actually doing the right thing because i was communicating a relatively minor on my end issue early on but it turns out that by not saying anything immediately ive basically reinforced their worst fears about themself. theyre now scared to talk too much to anyone about anything and now any mention of the show makes them feel sick. they said they feel like a bad friend and part of them feels lied to because i always said it was alright how much they talked about it but it wasnt a lie. it really was alright the job interview was literally the only incident that made me feel not great about it. i kept apologizing because i never wanted them to feel like that around me but theyre still really hurt and now weve been taking some space from each other for about four days now. i feel sick. i feel like i ruined the one friendship where both of us felt safe to be ourselves. even if we manage to move on from this i know itll never be the same and its all my fault theyll never talk to me again without worrying that theyre being too much and thats the one thing i never wanted them to worry about with me because i know what its like to be too much for the people around you. i wish id kept my stupid mouth shut. it was never even that big of a deal i couldve just dealt with it and bit my tongue but of course the one time i feel like communicating is the right thing it just ruins everything. i hurt my best friend so bad and i didnt even mean to and now theres nothing i can say or do to fix it. i thought i was finally doing things right but it all just went wrong anyway and now one of the people i care about the most is hurting because of me. the guilt is eating me alive ive been crying ever since it all went down and now i wish id never even said anything.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 21:19:11 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j6qxcs,i cant get over my ex,i cant get over the guy i was in love with 3 god damn years ago and it makes me sick. so i was never really in a relationship with this person we actually never even hang out together. we met in 2022 and we had a friendship that you wish on everyone but the friendship got stronger and so did our feelings. at first he started getting feelings at the time it was not appropriate because i was still in a relationship. i broke things off so i could be with him but when that happened he didnt have the same feelings anymore and everything went downhill. im not gonna explain everything that happened in those 6 months but i can say that nothing went back to how it was. because i was still in love with him when he basically ghosted me at the time i never got the closure i needed i think. and i begged him to let me stay in his live as friends and now that im hearing myself i sound so stupid. after everything that happened in those 6 months we kissed etc. for like 2 more times and that made it even worse to get over him. like i said we stayed friends and talk like 3 times a year new years birthdays and holidays. i even got a new amazing boyfriend whom ive been together with for almost 2 years and who i really love and could see myself marrying one day. but i still think about him the ex. last week he even responded on a story i posted on snapchat and we exchanged maybe 10 sentences. i wake up the next day and he deleted me from snap. i would like to think his new gf made him do it because it would honestly hurt more if he did it himself. so now 1 week later and everyday im thinking about it and everything that happened almost 3 fk years ago. so my question reddit users is why cant i get over him? why cant i get over the memories that we made? why not after everything this person has put me through? english is not my first language so im sorry for my grammar. side note 15 years ago he moved to another city so i havent seen him in 1 year. and i see him maybe once i year now. i was supposed to see him last week but he couldnt come,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 21:03:59 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j6qs0c,i miss the old internet prefacebook,i was born in the very early 90s so i got to experience the internet from like 2001 and on. i grew up as a teenager on the internet in the mid 20002010 and i fucking miss it. jumping on the home computer to go on the internet used to be like a little adventure. you never knew what youd see. sites like newgrounds were full of creative fun and dirty content that you had to look over your shoulder to make sure mom wasnt coming up the stairs. best of all people made creative content for funcommunityrespect not just for money. sure clickbait existed back then but not everything was a thinly veiled perverted attempt to extract money or data from you. best of all the internet didnt follow you around everywhere. when you left the computer you left the internet. i loved the lawlessness. i loved the freedom. i miss forums and while they still exist in some niches theyve been annihilated by facebook groups.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 20:57:18 UTC,63,8,0.99,,,0,0

1j6qkav,i stood up to my father who treats me like garbage.,hello everyone. i am writing this in hopes to get it off my chest no matter how familiar or boring the subject may be. i am a 24yo woman i am a student currently unemployed and i live with my boyfriend. i consider myself a normal person nothing out of the ordinary in my life or in my character. i am healthy i have hobbies i have friends and normal healthy relationships and nothing in my life is out of line. i am giving this info because the story concerns my fathers behaviour towards me basically since i was 11yo. he has always been the provider for our family my mom sister dad and i . the problem in my story is his character and his behaviour towards everyone in his life i mean family and close ones . since i was a little girl he has always used derogatory language with me and my mom. he has fits of rage every day and shouts at us and mostly her because i do not live there anymore. name calling of all sorts for no reason. i will give an example once i was going out for a walk and i took a bottle of water with me 1l small bottle nothing insane. he saw it and started screaming at me every offensive word you can think of. he said no person in his right mind takes water outside on a walk. another example he screamed at my mom and the didnt speak to her a whole week because he forgot his lunch on his way out. apparently she needs to be there every second and remind him to even blink. he is the same with my sister and his parents my grandparents. no one in my family has ever talked to him about this and they are enablers to his behaviour. for the years that i spent living with them when he would get home from work i would stay in my room and not even go to the bathroom for hours even if i needed to just because to get to the bathroom you have to go through the living room and that is where he watched tv and spent the evenings. over the years i developed severe anxiety low self esteem binge eating disorder and many more characteristics and conditions that make my life miserable. the binge eating disorder came because all my life he would call me fat and huge and enormously big i have always been 5055kg at 1.65cm height i work out at the gym and have been a runner for a few years so yeah i am slim and have even been very skinny for some time so this person with his insane behaviour has long ago lost my respect and fondness of him. although until now i have been silent. today at dinner i couldnt take it anymore. for months ive been having dreams of him screaming at me and while asleep i felt the hatred in my heart. so today he started to insult me again and i didnt stay silent this time. i told him that respect has to be earned and he doesnt have mine because of all the years of name calling and treating me like garbage. he was stunt and said that i dont have a father anymore. to be honest ive felt like that since i was 11. even though it hurt him he cant begin to imagine the pain ive been feeling for years. i cant stop crying because of the words i said but i know i had to say them at some point in my life to free myself and defend myself. i feel pity for him and nothing else. i am sorry that he is the way he is because it can only end badly for him. i am proud i defended myself for the first time but i will always be in pain because hes been brought up to be the person he is. he is incapable of change and i am sorry for him.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 20:47:15 UTC,7,5,1.0,,,0,0
1j6qas5,im so tired of preachers using funerals as opportunities to convert people.,basically title. my cousin lost his fight with cancer this week and the funeral was this morning. his side of the family is very religious and i tend to work best when religion and i give each other a wide berth. i understand that for religious people there is comfort in hearing scripture at a funeral and i am fine with some readings. unfortunately the pastor for my cousins funeral saw it as an opportunity to give a full fire and brimstone sermon and a similar thing happened at my grand fathers funeral last year. it was a full blown transphobic rant at my grandpas funeral. im tired of funerals in general and theres been too much death in my family the last few years so thats probably a contributing factor to my annoyance. anyway rant over just had to get that out.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 20:34:52 UTC,40,22,0.87,,,0,0
1j6q7k9,saying what if you were in their position hoping to get sympathy about someones bad situation is invalid,i hate when someone is describing someones bad situation and they say imagine if you were in their position as a way of getting sympathy. i wouldnt put myself in a bad situation in the first place. you see this with single moms a lot. a single mom will talk about how bad her life is and how shes works all the time and its never enough money. well she put her self in that situation. no one forced her to have kids. or you see this with people who work undesirable jobs. they chose that life in one way or another.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 20:30:45 UTC,0,8,0.21,,,0,0
1j6pyo0,i witnessed domestic violence and didnt do anything about it,i was walking home from school this was the 90s so we were all just walking around freely for miles and passed by the same neighborhoods i always passed. there was this one small house on the left side of the road and coming up on it i could hear splitting noises like someone was being hit but i think i couldnt believe it until i actually got close enough. there was this guy 20s maybe both of them standing over his wife or girlfriend on the front lawn she was lying down on her side and had her arm stretched out. then as i walked by slowly unable to stop for some reason he started beating and slapping her and grabbing her by the hair and yanking her towards the house. he also kicked her multiple times. i think he might have called her alicia. but the eerie thing was that she was surprisingly quiet about it not like crazy screaming but just like please stop! you would think shed be screaming and crying out for help or something. i remember that i was just walking in horror the guy didnt seem to notice me or if he did he didnt care. i couldnt stop and i couldnt stop looking at them. i think i was trying to figure out what street i was on but i had never thought to memorize the alley way streets so i didnt know. the whole scene moved in slow motion but i still remember the entire beating the sounds the sounds of grass scraping the shape of his hands. just broad daylight at 3pm on a weekday front lawn no one else on the street but them and me springtime. i ran home in tears and told my mom who just told me not to get involved. when i tried to tell her that i think he was going to kill her she asked me what street and address this happened because if we report it ill have to know all these things. i had no idea so again she told me to mind my own business. i was 10 or so when this happened and im in my 30s now. i still have the exact same fantasy memory of having gone back in time and instead of walking away and running away from the scene i get in between them and save her somehow. if not save but at least make such a fuss that someone calls the cops. its always the same thing that i dont care if i get hurt in the process i would have done the brave thing. instead of what i actually did... just run away in literal horror. i feel so haunted by this scene. i dont think ill ever forget it for the rest of my life honestly.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 20:19:25 UTC,10,10,0.92,,content warning violencedeath,0,0
1j6pwmy,my sister invited our brother to her wedding even though she knows how i feel about him,recently my sister got engaged and she asked me to be a part of her bridal party. initially i was very excited to have a role in her wedding kind of still am but now im feeling iffy because she invited our brother who i dont have a positive relationship with. for context im the youngest out of the three of us and we were raised by a single mother who worked a lot. because of this my sister took a lot of responsibility over us when our mother couldnt. shes like a second mother to me and my brother even though she shouldnt have been. my brother on the other hand was kind of a weirdo growing up. he dressed alternatively and had nerdy interests something that youngerme at the time thought was really cool and was all around awkward. i was maybe 8 and he was 14 when he started getting curious with his body and that eventually led to him sexually assaulting me. it didnt happen for long thank god but the experience left a disgusting stain on me. eventually i realized that what had happened to me was wrong and it wasnt until i was 13 that i finally had the chance and courage to talk to someone. i was removed from my home and placed in a childrens psych unit and my case was being handled by a social worker. of course they informed my mother who then told a few others my sister included. i didnt know this at the time but some of the adults around her pressured her into convincing me to recant my statement. so when she visited me she asked me to do just that. i was obviously so betrayed and angry she was my role model and the one person i relied on the most at the time. i cant recall the rest of our conversation i just remember leaving the visitation area and completely losing it in my room. but i was young impressional and ruminating a lot at this time so i did end up recanting my statement. my case worker didnt agree with my decision but respected it anyway. for the sake of procedure my case was still investigated but without the victims statement it fell through. it didnt erase anything that happened to me but it felt like it did with how everyone else around me went about their lives like nothing happened. it was jarring and fucked with my head and i slowly started believing that i made the whole thing up for attention. my memory wasnt the best and it couldve just been a messed up dream i had. i started feeling disgusted and i couldnt trust myself anymore and i began spiraling. fastward to when i was 17 i was hospitalized for almost taking my life. for some reason this was much more serious than before. i was finally put on medication and was put into a program for other atrisk teens. it was through group therapy i started thinking about getting closure for myself so after a lot of mental and emotional preparation i confronted my brother. at the last minute i decided to record the conversation without him knowing and i actually got a confession. i went to my social worker and after a few days he was removed from the house. after that i was both relieved and stressed by the events that came next. to be honest i didnt follow too closely with the court proceedings i couldnt bring myself to care what happened to him all i remember was being interviewed by svu and getting monthly check ups by social services. but the whole ordeal was mentally and emotionally draining for me and my family. my mom couldnt believe it at first and briefly experienced religious psychosis but no one took it harder than my sister. i guess she felt guilty because 1 such a serious thing happened between two of her siblings right under her nose and 2 she didnt have my back when i first came forward about it. i dont blame her or anyone really for not noticing what was happening. i cant bring myself to blame anyone no one wants to believe that someone you love is capable of something as horrible as sexual assault. a few years have passed since then and ive been working on improving my mental health. my sister was my rock throughout the process the most understanding of me and my circumstances and after a while i thought i had made peace with the whole situation until her wedding. my sisters decision to invite our brother after years of nocontact between the two of us kind of blindsided me. not because i didnt expect her to but because she didnt tell me. now heres the thing i would never ask my sister to choose between me or our brother. i understand that she loves the both of us despite what had happened so to ask her to do that wouldnt be fair. but i wouldve liked a headsup. i had to ask her myself if he was coming and im glad i did. the thought of walking into the venue and seeing him in the crowd without warning wouldve sent me into a panic. and because of this i started to rethink my relationship with her. shes done a lot for me and ill go as far as to say that she has a bigger impact on me than our mother does. i want to give her some grace for this but i still feel so uncomfortable with his presence. hes also still in good standing with our extended family who dont know of the situation so the possibility of them joking around and having fun with him without knowing what hes done doesnt sit right with me. i most likely wont do anything regarding my sisters wedding because i dont want to ruin her big day but itll probably change the way i see her. like i said i wont ask her to choose between me or him but that doesnt mean i cant. its a scary realization that my relationship with my sister can change i really dont want it to but i cant ignore how shes willing to look past what our brother has done to me when i havent. i want to start by having a proper conversation with her about this first though after the wedding. i want to fully understand her side of the story and her perspective before making this big decision. i honestly dont know what to expect or hope for but i feel like if i dont do something then all the improvement ive made will come undone and i dont think ill recover this time.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 20:16:48 UTC,282,94,0.97,,content warning sexual

1j6pk4i,i recently found out my abusive brother might have a baby,my f20 oldest brother ob m31 is an abusive misogynist. he genuinely thinks that women his girlfriend his wife his mom doesnt matter should be beaten andor be physically intimidated when he has any even the smallest disagreement. he was kicked out of the military for beating his wife he somehow got honorable discharge from what my mom says. my mom also has video evidence on ob practically dragging his girlfriends down the stairs in front of her children my brother only went after single moms with that said lets get into the main reason im scared for this child. i recently found out my ob is a child predator and that the reason ob was kicked out at 14 almost 15 wasnt because of no reason. it was because my mom walked in on us with our pants down in my closet when i was 4. 3 years later ob got my name tattooed on his arm. i dont really remember it that well because i had pushed the memory deep down in the back of my mind because i thought it was my fault. i remember thinking all i have to do is push it all the way back behind the wall into my subconscious because i heard thats how others got rid of the bad feelings or bad memories i think its because i heard that there was 2 sides of the brain. i remember thinking why didnt i just say no?. it wasnt until years later ob had moved back into our house when i noticed weird things ob would do like how i mentioned he only goes after single moms or moms who recently left an abusive relationship only for them to leave ob because i never wanted my children to be put back into that situation luckily the girlfriend he practically dragged down the stairs has a new boyfriend who said ill make sure he doesnt goes anywhere near my family again. i would notice things like how ob treated me like ob would his girlfriends or how ob would stare at my chest or at me in a weird way like a dog would a squirrel or almost like how they describe jaws eyes but i thought i was just being crazy. then ob offered my underaged friend alcohol if she got into his car and went on a drive with ob to nowhere is particular. after a couple of years ob was kicked out again for trying to beat my dad for telling ob to stop yelling at my mom about how ob crashed his car while drunk and the entire time the way ob was talking to her it sounded like he was trying to blame her or the mechanic who fixed his car my mom said the next day ob went back to the mechanic and yelled at him then ob got upset that the best mechanic who worked there wouldnt fix his car and told him to go somewhere else. and then as soon as she raised her voice above him to get him to stop screaming and yelling he immediately started the crocodile tears. the story ob told us was actually ridiculous ob apparently hit a boulder in the middle of the road and swerved ? off the road into a ditch. my parents visited the crash site of where the supposed boulder was and all they found were swerve marks to a ditch. as for the road it looked completely fine for a road that had a boulder land on it a couple hour prior we live in a part of america where the roads dont get that much maintenance and when we do its noticeable and definitely lasts longer than a day after a little while the whole p diddy thing came out and something about it made me snap and i kept thinking about predators and how they are disgusting creatures. at the time i had recently bought some shrooms bars from a local store. the more i thought of the p diddy situation the more the memories of my own molestation started coming back. i started getting angry a lot and eventually i told my mom. she said that when she found us she didnt think anything had happened yet and that ob was just about to do something. i asked her why she didnt call the police because ob would have still attempted to molested a 4 year old child. she said it was because of my dads crazy exwife. sometimes i wish i could go back in time and stop it. i was littarly just playing with my toys before ob came home from school and immediately ran to me like i was present under a christmas tree. i still remember the conversation we had. ob he said something along the lines of we should take off our pants or something about a game i wasnt really paying attention when he initially walked in because i was focused on my toys me but why? ob because i want to show you something. me starts to take off pants ob if you kiss mine ill kiss yours me senses something is off and starting to get scared but why? i dont want to ob its not scary see. does what you think he said he would i genuinely feel sick thinking about it then i geuss he heard my mom or he had locked the door. ob you need to get your pants on shes not supposed to see us then my mom walked in and stopped when she ws my still trying to button and zip up my pants mom .......... what.... what..the fuck.... then she started yelling at ob what the fuck were you doing to her then she grabbed him and pulled him out of the room i dont really remember much after that but i do remember the couple of times i would think about it and get a disgusting feeling or like shame before i had successfully pushed it down. now i dont know what to do its not exactly like i can go to the police and get justice when it was a long time ago and there is no actual proof the court would listen to. my family has cut him off though which is good because i was scared of what ob would do if ob moved in with my nana and papa theyre 80 and my aunts have mobility problems the only person who would be able to defend them is my uncle who isnt exactly the athletic type and is much older than ob edit i fixed the spelling and grammar mistakes,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 20:00:55 UTC,6,2,1.0,,content warning sexual assault,0,0
1j6p60o,i dont like talking anymore,i used to talk to myself a lot especially when i was a kid. if i wasnt talking that meant something was wrong but id usually go back to talking. something awful happened that was entirely my fault and since that point i dont speak much anymore. i dont want to. i only speak if i cant figure out how to stay silent. its been like this for almost two weeks now. i dont see any signs ill start talking like i used to again. as im writing this i havent spoken in nearly 24 hours. its actually harder to speak now. i was quiet to begin with but its gotten worse. to be completely honest i dont care about it all that much. people find others who talk to themselves to be weird or crazy anyways so honestly this is an improvement. i wonder if ill lose my voice completely and then i really cant talk anymore. that would be both interesting and scary. i wonder if thatll happen with my face too. i stopped looking at my reflection along with not talking. idk why i just did. i actually like it. everything feels like a first person game.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 19:43:01 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j6p5vd,i want to give away my dog and it kills me,hello. i just came to get this off my chest because i cant take it anymore. english is not my first language. three years ago i adopted a stray puppy. after having him at home for five days i realized he had parvovirus so i had to hospitalize him for ten days. it was a miracle that he survived and after that he had to stay home for two months without going outside as recommended by the vet. the first time i took him out i noticed he was terrified of absolutely everythingnoises cars other animals people but especially men. it took a lot of effort to get him comfortable going on walks. we took it slowly and after a year i managed to take him to the dog park. now my dog is three years old and for the past three months his condition has worsened. he only wants to go to the bathroom once a day around midnight when no one is on the street. i live in the city center which is always busy and noisy for various reasons i just cant afford to move to the country side. every day is a struggle. he prefers to go inside the house to avoid going outside. he trembles and cries. if visitors come over he hides and shakes the entire time. the only time he is happy is when its just me my partner and him at home. seeing him like this breaks my heart and on top of that no one wants to take care of himnot even paid services or dog daycare centers because of his condition. i took him to a specialist ethologist tried medications relaxants and behavioral exercises but nothing has improved. sometimes i think about giving him to someone with a huge field where he could run and be happy but at the same time i dont want to let him go. it feels wrongno one will take care of him like i do no one will love him like i do. what if he misses me? what if he feels abandoned? every day i suffer for him and blame myself for not being a better owner.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 19:42:50 UTC,9,9,0.84,,,0,0
1j6owam,mourning myself,me and the past a meeting with my old self i turned on my old device from 11 years ago and listened to my old voice recordings. i broke down crying. i miss myself. i used to be cheerful and innocent. now ive been depressed for so long. ive lived through terrible things. i keep picturing that girl from 11 years agothe one who used to sing in different languages record rap songs and create all kinds of things. it feels like i lost her. i cried as if i lost a loved one. as if that girl died and ill never see her again. i lost myself. i lost my teenage years. i lost my laughter. i lost my creativity. i lost me. i miss her. i used to love myself admire myself. i was confident. i was innocent. i was creative. and now? panic attacks anxiety problems responsibilities endless worries. i feel like ive been dead for a long time. like im just wandering among the living in some kind of dream. i feel disconnected from life like a lifeless soul drifting through a world that keeps moving. why do i feel like i died a long time ago and im just living these years backstage trying to figure out the cause of my death? why does my life now feel like an illusion while my past felt real? god im so tired of myself. why do i miss the past so much? why do i long for my old self? she was strong and kind despite her young age. the older i get the more scared i become. and the more i need her. she was wise creative confident. her soul was light and gentle like a breeze. everyone loved her. she was mischievous but even her mischief was innocent. despite being quiet at times she was still wellknown because she left a soft lasting impact. even if she caused a little trouble it was never harmfuljust the kind of mischief that made people laugh later. i admire her. i love her. i miss her the same way i mourn the people ive lost in my life. im grieving myself. because i died. im nothing more than a body without a soul.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 19:31:21 UTC,3,2,1.0,,,0,0

1j6ol0l,the work i did for cps still hauntsrevisits me 10 years later.,i worked for child protective services in a metropolitan area of the us for 12 years. i did both long term case management and later investigations that led to the removals of children. with about a decade of time and reflection ive come to realize the following i was a young woman with lots of privilege who did not understand the lives or needs of the people over whose lives i made decisions for. this now causes me great pain. turns out i was dissociating through most of it due to secondary trauma and moral injury. the ability to dissociate although we just saw it as toughing through back then was seen as showing that you were a great worker and could get shit done. i wanted to do good in the world and i wanted to help children. and i did. but i also caused harm because i had too many cases not enough supervision and no real selfawareness. it took years of therapy to understand and grieve the harm i had caused and the harm caused to me. i dont even remember the first few years of my childrens lives because i was so dissociated. i often have to look at a photos to remember events with them. i still get flashbacks of things i was exposed to and am swapped with pain. sometimes it all comes back. just this week i was contacted by a former colleague and a child who was on my caseload many years ago. the colleague reminded me of a child death case we worked on. it was particularly searing because we both had children that were about the same age as the child who died. she also reminded me about the death of another colleague through an aneurism and the suicide of a couple others. yes our work had a death count. the girl now an adult reached out to me to say she is doing well and to thank me for helping her find an adoptive home. its a mixed bag. and these memories reinforce in me the idea that nothing in life is guaranteed and im just trying to do the best i can each day. i screw up and i repair where i can. i put kindness and compassion into everything i do but that isnt always enough. i dont really have a purpose for this post. just wanted to get it off my chest.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 19:17:14 UTC,569,28,0.98,,,0,0

1j6oc5w,feeling confused and conflicted,feeling confused and conflicted im a 29 female never been married and no kids. ive been thinking a lot about my past relationships lately and i have to admit its been a tough journey. my last serious relationship ended in a painful breakup and its taken me a while to process my emotions. as i reflect on what went wrong i realize that i was blind to some major red flags. i ignored my intuition and stayed in the relationship longer than i should have. but despite the heartache lve learned so much about myself and what i want in a relationship. im taking the time to focus on myself my friendships and my community. i spend a lot of time getting to know god more. he has helped me through the years to achieve a forgiven heart and renewed my spirit of a fun filled life. being single increases my loneliness but only those who have gone through this same pain would understand how scary it is to give love another chance. id love to connect with serious minded people and hear about your experiences. have you ever gone through a tough breakup? how did you heal and move forward?,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 19:06:07 UTC,2,3,1.0,,,0,0

1j6nu3m,my former high school friend fucked her exs dad,my 23f and my friend group had a very eventful senior year. we had a friend charlie who had been dating this boy max since freshman year. we met during 10th grade and they had already been dating a year so she had already met his family and such. she would make these comments like maxs dad is so hot or max looks just like his dad and theyre both so attractive it was kinda funny at first then she said maxs dad said if we were the same age wed be dating and thats when we knew maxs dad was a creep but she kept dating the boy and we couldnt do anything. fast forward to senior year max decides he wants to date other people so they break up. charlie was distraught barely even speaking to us dragging her feet around school the usual teenage break up shit til eventually they get back together. and this is where things got interesting for us. covid hits were out of school and hanging out at charlies when she tells us she slept with one of maxs family members but wouldnt specify who. we thought it couldve been his younger brother whos 2 years younger than us she said it wasnt him we said his dad she claimed she wouldnt say. we didnt have to wait long tho max somehow finds out we still dont know how that she in fact fucked his father and all hell broke loose. his father denied and denied max and his brother stopped speaking to their father and charlie we never heard anything about his mom but i can only imagine she was drawing up divorce papers. oh and the reason she didnt wanna specify it was him? they had sex in january her 18th birthday was february we havent talked to charlie in years but before she stopped talking to us she made a comment in a text like my man is taking me on vacation and when we asked who her man was she just sent a smiling emoji and basically never talked to us again. recently we discovered through facebook that apparently charlie and maxs dad are still together max and his brother dont talk him he and his wife divorced and he hardly ever sees their youngest daughter whos maybe 8 now.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 18:43:49 UTC,1332,76,0.97,,,0,0

1j6n57z,its going to be two years since my dog died. as i sat crying i realised i havent had anything to say of depth for a while.,im not a good writer anymore. its strange i never used to think these two things were connected. now i see that ever since my pet died i havent been able to sit with my emotions anymore. i still smile still laugh still enjoy things but the grief has left something hollow inside me and something else too big to be named that keeps my words from making it past my throat. maybe people can tell. maybe im just that strange person who loved her dog more than most humans and who became a little less human when he went. he was funny mischievous sweet. awkward too. he wouldnt know what to do with the way ive been crying over him. he was always terrible with tears. he would sit with me so i wouldnt be alone but always at a distancewatching me or sometimes even turning his back. i used to get mad about it like arent most dogs supposed to be cuddly and affectionate? but its funny too because thats how i am when someone i love cries. i hover nearby silent unsure if my presence is enough. i wonder if he ever thought the same thing about me. people say dogs take after their owners and i take it as proof that he loved me the way i loved him. i tend to repeat this as gospel he got better for a while when i came back. we played we ran he jumped up on the bed with me to curl up he stole my sweets even though he couldnt even stand a week before and pretend it even slightly makes up for the knowledge of knowing i will never see him do these things again. is the pain of shattered hope worth the way that hope felt? sometimes yes. today no. maybe in some way i dont yet understand hes still sitting at a distance watching and loving me the way he always did just out of my reach.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 18:13:46 UTC,8,6,1.0,,,0,0
1j6mwnr,the phrase youre not owed sexcompanionship is being used as a shield from criticism for discriminatory dating preferences.,i was reading a post from an autistic man complaining about being constantly rejected by women because of his quirknessweirdness even though he claims to be a nonmisoginistic stand up guy. the replys? you guessed it! youre not owed sex you entitled incel! well no shit sherlock! of course he is not owed sex but wouldnt it also be appropriate to have a conversation about dating preferences and how theyre often based on various forms of discrimination like racism classism ableism and toxic masculinity? why isnt anyone advocating for people to question their dating preferences when so many of them are rooted in several forms of discrimination them themselves claim to be against? yes if after further reflection you still feel you cant let go of your preferences by all means chase them even if theyre not exactly based on positive traits because you really dont owe anyone your affection or your private parts. just dont use that excuse to not have to do some introspection about your preferences their roots and how thats affecting you and also keeping some great people from finding love.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 18:03:11 UTC,0,34,0.36,,,0,0
1j6mwea,i understand why people in the west operate on individualism tw sucide mention,i always hear a lot of critique about how the western world is too individualist. well i feel like i completely understand why now. im in canada for reference. i have been at my current job almost 3 years now. i have been on contract that entire time. ive been fighting to get permanent but no positive movement yet. anyway the last position i got was a 2 year contractwhich comes to an end this summer. i feel ive been a positive addition to the team. the team was short staffed is short staffed even now and i was able to help out with the work load. im a quick learner and pretty efficient and ive definitely shown that on our extremely busy days or days where extremely short staffed we often have people falling ill or someone is on vacation. with my contract end coming up i asked my boss if there was a future for me. i have also been looking for workwith no luckin preparation. well this week she told me the chances of me being kept on were slim to none. i cried at my lunch break. hell i had panic attacks and cried before all this. i have been trying to find work and its rejection after rejection or just not hearing back at all. even jobs im more than qualified for arent responding. what has really hurt and frustrated me is the apathy of those around me. friends coworkers i thought liked me even family to an extent could all care less. oh damn that sucks. anyway. and i 100 understand why. why would anyone even people who like me give two shits about me? they have their own partners families finances etc. to worry about. people dont give two shits what happens to anyone around them when they have their own lives. someone they know could go homeless and itd just be a damn how tragic! they were a nice person. anyway whats for dinner? ive been bullied at jobs to the point of being suicidal. people sawand looked the other way. dont want to involve themselves. ive complained to bossessupervisors about workplace bullies only to go ignored. ive been chastised for speaking up. damned if you do damned if you dont. no one caresthey can like you but theyre there to get their bag and go home. i see this a lot in canada with the housing crisis. people who own their homes have a fuck you i got mine attitude. they dont care about the rest of us especially younger folk who will never be able to afford even a modest apartment. they got their house they got their family fuck everyone else. the homeless are just an inconveniencenuisance to them. ive tried in my life to have a community mindset with helping others caring i always would send fitting job postings to unemployed friends who were looking to try and help out tried to be there for others. no more. never again. not a single person around me would give a fuck if i died tomorrow because understandably they have their own shit to worry about. only people i can see caring about me being gone are my mom and dad. i have fought my entire life to try and be better. grew up with abusive step parents. didnt grow up wealthy. pretty much everything i did after 18 was my ownrent schooling with help of loans which i am also paying off solo finding jobs figuring shit out etc. im done. my hope for finding work in time before my contract ends is extremely low. even with experience and schooling companies dont want to hire or they want to pay you minimum wage for skilled work. and if they cant get a canadian to go that low theyll find a tfw who will take below minimum wage story for another time. idk what will happen to me but i know that i will not care about anyone else again. im gonna worry about me only. good luck to everyone else.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 18:02:51 UTC,2,2,0.75,,,0,0

1j6lzc5,i think adults unaccompanied by children that judge at disney are ridiculous,i have two toddlers. we live in florida so we take them disney. initially we wanted to wait until they were old enough but it became hard to find places to go on vacation or long weekends that had facilities for children. today we were at one on the parks and at a slower ride intended for all ages toddler friendly when our youngest threw a tantrum 1.5m. it was close 30 minutes until nap time and hes been teething. we decided to come celebrate my eldests birthday 3m and especially since the recent passing of my father left him very sad and aggressive toward others at daycare he cried seeing photos of my dad and asking where he was. we apologized to the two women next to us as my youngest threw things on the ground near them. they started off saying that its ok. then they proceeded to let us know that they never came to the parks before a certain age and that my kids would be better just by the pool or something. keep in mind we are in the disney junior area. and that drowning is a common cause of death in young children and i know at least three families that have experienced that loss. i tried to keep it nice and then i finally said you know they usually do well with travel theyre just tired today. and said goodbye. was biting my tongue the whole time and wanted to remind them that this is a ride meant for younger children and not adults in their 20s60s the two women were mother and daughter. i never understand the idea children must be seen and not heard. at a childrens ride in a theme park that is centered and based on childrens cartoons and film. i dont care if adults show to the parks but its insane that adults want to also keep children acting like children from childrens spaces.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 17:21:54 UTC,0,17,0.41,,,0,0

1j6jf69,feeling like a secondtier friend and i dont know what to do about it.,okay so ive been feeling some type of way about this for a hot minute and i just need to rant. idk if im overthinking or if im actually onto something so here goes. i have these two friends right? theyve been besties since nursery and i joined them in 7th grade. and listen i never had an issue with thati knew their bond was stronger and that was fine. but recently its been feeling like im just... there. like im included but not really included yknow? one of them is dating this guy and their relationship has been a damn rollercoaster. long story short dude was dramatic as hell dumped her over some misunderstanding then ran around spreading shit that made her look bad. back then our whole group was like nah hes trash you deserve better. fast forward a few months and suddenly theyre treating him like hes some godtier boyfriend. now hes so sweet so caring such a gentleman. like girl be so for real. now im also dating someone and every time i bring him up i get the driest reactions possible. oh hes nice. thanks??? thats it??? meanwhile theyre out here writing a whole phd thesis about how amazing her man is even after he did her dirty?? the math is not mathing. and its not just that. even when i ask them basic questions they either leave me on seen or reply two days later with the most halfassed response ever. but somehow they have the time to be active af on instagram sending me reels??? calls? lmao those dont even exist anymore. and yeah theyve never been big on calling but even when they promise theyll call they never do. and before anyone says maybe theyre just busy with college?nah they have time for our other friends just not me. and yeah ive tried bringing it up before. the problem? theyll act normal for like a week and then go right back to the same cycle. atp i dont even see the point in saying anything anymore. oh and the cherry on top? i recently got a pink rose from my boyfriend and i was so happy because i genuinely prefer pink roses over red ones. i shared it with them and the reaction was so bland. like no hype no excitementjust a casual oh thats nice. i know if it were one of them the energy wouldve been completely different. idk am i tripping or does this sound off to anyone else? cuz its kinda giving youre an option not a priority energy and i dont know how to feel about that. your opinions are welcome and if you have any recommendations on how to handle this or just anything in general id love to hear them.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 15:24:20 UTC,2,0,0.75,,,0,0
1j6jbt5,striking realisation because of my situation,i20f have come to a really mind opening conclusion that whatever you do in your life and how much you want people to stay they kind of let you down. this is not me being sad and depressed but i think it is what it is. people have their right to do what they want . so i feel like if you get attached to someone it just bring you this discomfort when they try to leave. maybr its just people in my life that have habits of leaving be it friends or others. unless you are confident and know that you are self sufficient i think it will be like this the whole life.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 15:19:50 UTC,7,1,0.89,,,0,0

1j6iwr6,my life is never going to get betterneither am i.,psi apologize if some things dont make sense as english isnt my first language!! im not sure that anything will genuinely get better.i feel as if im a rotting corpse. im a 15 year old girlit may sound childish and dramatic saying this at such a young agebut let me give a backstory. ive had extreme trouble socialising my whole life. i was a very sensitive childpeople could barely speak to me or crack jokes with me without me starting to cry.regardlessi did have a few friends as a childbut it wasnt the best experience. i couldnt handle insults and staying with people for a longer period of timei much preferred to stay home and do my own thingso of course people found me weird. the fact that i wasnt born beautiful didnt make this any betterugly was peoples favourite insult to use on me. once i started schoolit became even worse.i still havent learned to accommodate to peoplebut i was academically giftedso people still came up to mebut mostly to help them with their workaside from that i was bullied and ive never managed to stand up for myself.i would simply sit through all of thati would say my prayers at night hoping it would eventually become better. eventually my mother said she will leave to a different city to find a better jobshe didnt pay much attention to me in the first placeit was mostly my grandma taking care of meso i though this was an opportunity to get closer to her and get a better school life so i begged her to take me as well and said i could continue school therebut god little did i know it was going to get much worse. i got bullied a thousand times worse at my new schooland at home there was nobody to comfort me this time.she got a boyfriendwho was and still is a horrible person.he sexuallyphysically and verbally abused me.she knew but couldnt care less as he had lots of moneyplus she was already neglectfulso what could have i expected from her. it was simply too much for me to handlei started skipping school every single chance i gotif i got sent forcefully by my mom once the teachers started sending her messagesi would simply wait for an opportunity to run away.it somehow never got taken to courtfor 4 years i was skipping as long as it was still possible to pass the year with such a big number of absences.ive developed a sh addiction as well.i would burncutscratch myselfwhatever option was available at the moment. i started causing a lot of trouble as welli wont go into detail on this onebut it was mostly to have some form of control over my abusers to make them feel as shitty as i didso to say.eventually they got tired of me and sent me to a psychiatrist which gave me some sertraline i was 13 around this time and the psychiatrist suggested to move to a new school. they refused to check out another school and just sent me back to my old town. now thats where i am.i got back on track and im at the top of my class once againbut of course i am still given cruel treatment from my peers. my other relatives are the only people who dont hate me. i am at an extreme form of social alienation.i have no friends.not even one in real life i spend all of my time onlinedrawing amp reading books or drinking. i am severely traumatisedi have severe ocdanorexiaarfid and im in such deep derealizationi also have a history of psychosis and i am unable to get treatment. ive also gotten told i fit the criteria for bpd but due to my age there isnt a possibility to get diagnosed.i also have a ton of health issues. and if im being honestat this point im not even sure if i truly wish to get better or to make friends.i hate people and they hate me. i dont speak much eitheri only speak once its necessaryi hate doing it anyway. i do love spending my time daydreaming thoughim a maladaptive daydreamer and i spend up to 10 hours just daydreaming.i love daydreaming that i am a beautiful and kind girl living an adventurous life with lots of meaningful connectionsbecause irl i feel hopelessi feel that i will be alone for the rest of my life.i have no dreams for the future and remembering the fact that i have school makes me wanna commit suicidebut i would never do this to my relatives or to my bestfriend.though the urge to try once again is strong i sometimes wonder if ive committed some terrible crimes in my past life and if this life is a punishment for that. lt3 i have no clue why i have always gotten bullied eitherbut my best guess is that unattractive girls are seen as a societal embarrassmentplus the fact that i dressed and looked too weird for them.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 14:59:27 UTC,5,0,0.86,,,0,0

1j6i1fv,my gf violated me last night,so my girlfriend 32 and i 30m have been together for almost a year now and everything is going really well. there have been ups and downs in our sex life in the past because of several health reasons but recently we both feel like our sex really took off. i was kind of inexperienced before i met her so there are a lot of firsts for me. a few weeks ago we started experimenting some more and talked about things wed wanna try and even watched some video footage of those things to get some ideas and stuff. i told her that id experimented with butt play on myself in the past and i would like to try that during sex not talking about pegging here. we ended up buying a whole bunch of toys and stuff for both of us including some buttplugs. last night we ended up really tipsy and horny so i suggested giving it a try. we did... and at first it was really nice and hot. we both enjoyed it and had some fun until all of a sudden i felt the plug pop out. we stopped and looked around everywhere but the plug was nowhere to be found. that was the moment we realized the moderately big plug even though it had a wide base got sucked up my butt and was in fact stuck there. i straight up fucking panicked and my gf said she could see the terror in my face. i instantly felt sick and started sweating felt like throwing up. so it was like do we go to the er or what do we do?! i preferred not becoming one of those embarrassing sex accident er stories... so we decided to try and get it out ourselves. i kneeled on my bathroom floor with my upper body leaning over my bathtub because i felt like ill throw up. and yeah... my girlfriend basically had to use half her hand trying to fish it out real deep up my butt. it hurt like shit and when it finally got out i was grossed out felt violated exhausted and traumatized. i ended up in fetal position in my bathroom with my girlfriend nearly crying for having to hurt me. my butt still hurts today and was bleeding a bit this morning and im severely traumatized. even though id love to keep trying this i dont know if ill ever be able to trust a plug again. my girlfriend did an amazing job being there for me and preventing me from going into a full panic attack so we kinda bonded over this even more. all in all a very traumatic but kind of funny story i wanted to share!,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 14:15:20 UTC,0,14,0.3,,positive,0,0

1j6gvv6,my girlfriend makes me feel crazy,this is a stupid throwaway vent i just need to get this off my chest. i dont expect anyone to see this i just need to talk. my 25m girlfriend 24f makes me feel like im crazy. any time i show a negative emotion its met with annoyance and frustration. or with a look of bewilderment like it came out of nowhere or there was no leadup. dont get me wrong. i love her and im certain she loves me. we have been through some incredibly hard times and supported each other through them all. but i cant help feeling like she doesnt care or want to consider how im feeling in a given situation. every time we argue be it something big like family or small like a movie she continuously hammers the fact that im getting defensive or that its not that deep. that im thinking too hard into things. i cant tell her shes wrong about something without her thinking im fully against her. shes hardly ever conceded a point unless i compromise with her that she is partly right. ive brought this up with her several times and theres never been any concession. any recognition of how what she says and how she says things might rub me the wrong way. she doesnt apologize or acknowledge what she says as pointed or hurtful. only discards it as not being what she meant. she tells me that i interpreted it wrong and that i misunderstood her. she outlines what she meant in great detail. and sometimes i can tell that its not the the truth. shell go as far as telling me how badly it makes her feel that i interpreted what she said negatively. i feel constantly contrary or like i cant do anything but agree. when shes angry or annoyed i need to act accordingly. i want to act accordingly. i want her to feel listened to i want to sympathize with her feelings. i dont pinpoint where she is mistaken because ultimately the nitpicky parts dont matter it matters how i made her feel. i dont ever want her to feel like something is in her head or not real or like her feelings are wrong and something to dismiss. if i brought this up with her again. she would try proving me wrong with things ive said that upset her. or tell me how much it hurts that i thought of her in this way. i dont know where im getting at with this. i love our relationship. i love what we have and i dont want anything major about the way we interact with each other to change. i dont want her to walk on eggshells around me for fear of upsetting me like im a child that cant handle an argument. i can i just cant handle it being onesided or with special rules i have to follow that she doesnt. i just want her to be kinder or at least fair. i guess idk.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 13:13:30 UTC,5,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j6gkb7,obsessed with my best friends pornstar girlfriend.,im still trying to wrap my head around the fact that my friend from high school is dating a pornstar. i mean ive known him for years and weve been through thick and thin together. but when i stumbled upon her videos my mind was blown. i couldnt believe what i was seeing. shes doing some extremely hardcore stuff im talking multiple giant cock gangbangs and her body is just... wow. she has a gigantic ass that seems to be the center of attention in almost every scene. at first i felt a mix of emotions shock curiosity and a little bit of jealousy i wont lie. ive always thought of my friend as a bit of a shy guy so its hard to imagine him with someone whos so... outgoing. but as i watched more of her videos i started to feel a twinge of concern. i mean this is a whole different world that im not familiar with and i worry about my friend getting hurt or caught up in something thats not good for him. but at the same time i have to admit that im also kind of fascinated. ive never seen anything like this before and its like my eyes are glued to the screen. i feel like im getting a glimpse into a secret world that most people dont know about and its both thrilling and terrifying. i dont know how to process all of this to be honest. part of me wants to talk to my friend about it to ask him if hes okay and if he knows what hes getting himself into. but another part of me is afraid of judgment of being seen as a hypocrite or a voyeur. i mean who am i to judge what hes doing or who hes dating? all i know is that my mind is reeling and i dont know how to reconcile my feelings about this. i guess all i can do is wait and see how things play out and hope that my friend knows what hes doing.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 12:54:39 UTC,0,142,0.48,,,0,0

1j6femf,i stole from my patients,i used to work in a bougie care home several years ago. this involved feeding elderly patients with dementia. well dementia can make feeding quite difficult and a lot of the patients dont eat much. we had everything from quiche steak to the best desserts. most of the time they would have a few spoons and be done. now i know where your mind is going with this smiling_face_with_tear. so i used to feed my patient and enjoy some of the food once they were done. i would take 2 spoons and feed them from one side. then i would eat from the other side. the dementia meant they couldnt really say anything. and i would sit in a position to make sure i was not in view. i would offer food multiple times even if they declined as well. so i felt i was giving them my best. i was barely 18 and im so ashamed every time i think about it. my hunger was stronger than my shame at the time. and the fact it was the same platelike what was i thinking loudly_crying_face but honestly the food was sensational i still think about that damn chef. its not an excuse and i still have regrets. i can never share this with anyone. this is truly off my chest.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 11:41:03 UTC,470,34,0.95,,,0,0

1j6d7ec,something is wrong with my mind,theres a level of thinking that just isnt happening. i dont understand things the way other people do and i dont even know where to start. people are taking in information that i just dont even perceive despite being in the same room and reading the same material. i cant articulate myself very well at all. its one thing to lack an attention span its another thing to be genuinely unable to comprehend logic and not even know i dont get it until other people point it out to me. people around me try to spare my feelings but i can see it in their faces that they know im at the absolute bottom of the class. im genuinely so dumb and i dont know whats going to happen to me. theres no point in having confidence if i am confidently wrong. i just feel like im at my maximum capacity for learning and i have no idea how to grow. i get someone has to be the worst. its unbelievably crushing that its me.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 08:58:09 UTC,2,2,1.0,,,0,0
1j6d566,im going crazy for a very stupid reason,my sister stole an earring of mine im sure. a long fringed earring with a rhinestone on the head that i could remove that i bought about three years ago. it was my absolute favorite basically the only one i wore and i wore it everywhere it was perfect for everything i didnt even need another one. i wore it to a party in december and i clearly remember taking it off inside the house and putting it in my jewelry box. but when i went to wear it again where was it? it doesnt make sense. i didnt lose that earring i put it where it should have been but someone took it didnt tell me and to this day has never given it back to me. i live with my mother two sisters and my grandfather and my aunt is the neighbor in the apartment across the hall and she and her daughter have complete access to my house. ive already gone to everyone calmly asked if they had taken it if they had borrowed it and forgotten to return it everyone said no. but heres the thing my older sister is a bitch. she comes into my room and takes my stuff. shes already finished my perfume makeup skincare hair products expensive stuff. she complains when i complain she takes absolutely no care with anything. my whole life has been like this with her and my whole life ive complained to my mother about it but my mother just told me to keep my stuff away from her. its kind of hard when we live in the same house but its okay. shes already taken some of my jewelry and broken it. when i was a kid she took three of my rings and returned them to me broken that same night but i was a kid and the rings had cost 30 reais in total. when i was 17 she took a pair of earrings that my aunt gave me for my 15th birthday big earrings with stones more expensive but besides everything else a gift the same thing happened they disappeared and one day rummaging through her room i found them broken she didnt even bother to show it to me. this one caused me problems but this woman had the nerve to tell me to my face im not going to buy another one theyre too expensive with the utmost disdain in the world and my mother did nothing. i kept up the conversation for a while telling her that she was an irresponsible idiot who had stolen my earrings but it was no use and at 17 years old what was i going to do? sue her for a pair of earrings? alone even more so because my mother wouldnt help me. brother this story about that earring that she broke has been cooking in me all these years and along with everything i went through with her in my childhood god i hate this woman. now the same thing happened. my earring disappeared and there was absolute silence. i know she has it i know she took it. but it was in december its already march. ive asked her on separate occasions if she took my earring and she said no. ive already gone to her room and turned everything upside down looking for those earrings and i couldnt find them i found other things of mine that i hadnt even noticed were not even with me anymore. i want to look in her bag but she wont let me shell get stressed and throw them to my mother who will be on her side like she always is. brother im going to go crazy because sometimes i stop and think about this piece of crap earring that i know she took. i know i didnt lose it i know where i put it if it had been my fault if i had left it at the party where i wore it if i had put it in my bag and it disappeared if it had fallen on the street i know i would have gotten over it by now but no it disappeared in my house in the place where it should be someone took it. the only person who has the nerve to steal it from me and act like the biggest sly person there is. practically every week i end up staging fights and fights with her demanding that she give me back the earrings that i know she stole but shell turn the story around and ill leave like a crazy person because ive already looked in her room and nothing. and i swear that for real if i found that piece of shit earring with her i would sue her now i would sue her. it costs a lot less than the earring she broke but i dont care. i just want my earring i just want that bitch to give me back whats mine because i know she has it.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 08:53:21 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0
1j6d4je,was i just a mistake to her? m27 amp f23,i m27 was in a relationship with f23 for 1 year. in the beginning everything was beautifulshe made me feel loved valued and important. we had deep conversations shared our dreams and supported each other through tough times. i did everything i could to make her happy. i even observed roza fasting for her during ramadan despite not being muslim myself. i thought we had something real something worth fighting for. but slowly things changed. she became distant cold and dismissive. conversations turned into arguments and it felt like i had to beg for her time and attention. she started blocking me randomly only to unblock me when she wanted to talk. it felt like a cycle of manipulationpush and pull. our last conversation was painful. she told me outright that she wouldnt have texted me if i hadnt agreed with her. and when i told her i didnt want to compete in arguments anymore she responded with text me over insta dm if i feel like it then blocking back. that hurt. it made me feel like i was nothing to her just an option she could pick up and discard at will. ive spent so much time wonderingwas i just a mistake to her? did she ever love me or was i just convenient at the time? now shes gone and im left with all these memories. i still hope one day she realizes my love and my value but deep down i dont know if she ever will.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 08:51:55 UTC,1,2,1.0,,,0,0

1j6cy64,i feel like my gf is a dead end.,i really hate to write this but truthfully i think my girlfriend is going to be a dead end for my personal growth and future. weve been together for 3 years now and she really helped me out of a dark place. after months of being together she moved in and slowly over time ive just became more and more disgusted by who she is and wants to be. shes lazy very very overweight and keeps moving towards this loser mindset. she never cleans the house and constantly makes messes. if i finally get her to clean its the laziest half assed clean up and she has an attitude the entire time she does it. shes made so many stains on our carpet left drinks and food out and leaves a mess in my car. shes been overweight our entire relationship and ive tried so many times to get her to lose weight and every time she throws a fit about it and makes it unbearable. ive pleaded to her about how i care about her health and i want her to live a long happy life and she just doesnt seem to care. she has horrible friends who cheat on their bfs were ex meth addicts and all are going to go no where in life. ive always wanted to be something big and keep improving myself over time to reach those dreams and goals i have and she doesnt. the only thing she wants is to be a mom thats it. no drive for a good job good career legacy just nothing besides the bare minimum. despite all of this i still love her. im frustrated with myself cause maybe i did something along the way to make her this way? im not sure but its heartbreaking and at this point im just waiting to get to a good place where i can afford my own house and live on my own. im sorry i failed you b.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 08:38:16 UTC,0,14,0.4,,,0,0

1j6crrw,i have a pregnancy fetish,i am a male in my late 20s and am writing this post because i wanted to get something off my chest to get honest feedback from people. good or bad. i have a pregnancy fetish. essentially i find a big pregnant belly extremely attractive and the thought of the womens breasts hips butt getting bigger very attractive. it is purely objectivevisual and i have had this ever since i was young. i have always felt very uncomfortable with having this fetish. pregnancy is normally thought of as an amazing beautiful thing which to most people means baby on the way. i also see it this way but separate to that i have this fetish as well. i worry that if someone hears pregnancy fetish that they will immediately think that this is some sicko thing for unborn babies or just not understand what the hell that kind of fetish is or what it means and immediately feel uncomfortable. dont get me wrong im not planning on openly telling people but as my peer group enters the having kids stage of life i am feeling weird about it. i know that society has changed quite a lot but fetishes are still very taboo and make a lot of people uncomfortable. sometimes i wish i didnt have the fetish just so i wouldnt have to deal with the mixed feeling. the only person who knows about it as an ex girlfriend of mine. i worry sometimes that she might tell people about it and i would feel very embarrassed and not know how to deal with it friends looking at me differently. i know this post might be a bit of an unusual one but any honest and realistic feedback would be appreciated.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 08:24:56 UTC,4,3,0.59,,,0,0

1j6cle7,my mother died 6 days ago,yall im struggling. theres so much and im not faultless. mother amp daddy divorced before my 5th birthday. mother let my older halfbrother live with his biodad once he turned 13. mother also was diagnosed as bipolar in the 1960s and was treated far too long on lithium. i get this logically but emotionally.i always lost out. my mother amp my aunther sister have always found a common ground. theyve had typical sister disagreements over the yearsbut have always been each others biggest advocates. point is my mother was not a bad person. around my 5th grade year i tuned into fashion. i wanted what i liked not her cutesy smocked dresses etc. listen i am now as southern as can bei have a ridiculous amount of monogrammed items and wouldwill happily support a smocked personalizedmonogrammed adult dress! theres no shame in my game. whatever i buy for my niece will have a matching auntieor mom part! when my older halfbrother was 12 he went to live with his father. after my older brothers death when i was 12 myself i was sent to my father and his wife and my younger halfbrothers. to this day we are all full siblings in each others eyes. my daddy raised my older brother and his final wife helped raise us. this stepmom loves me and adopted me. today on the anniversary of my husbands death i learned that my bio mother passed away 6 days ago. our last visit was very pleasant neither of us drug up the past. however i am struggling with the fact that the hospital where i used to work and still love did not notify me my aunt or the temporary power of attorney. ive been out of reach for a couple of years so a family friend stepped in as mpoa knowing my mothers wishes. my aunt amp i have consistently been listed in medical records as emergency contacts. no one from the hospital contacted my aunt me or the mpoa. my mothers body has been unclaimed in the hospital morgue for 6 days. 6 days!!! how am i supposed to feel? tldr my bio mom passed away 6 days ago in the hospital. they disregarded all emergency contacts listed and her temporary medical poa in my absence. her body has been unclaimed in the morgue for almost a week. they told my aunt on monday that she had been dischargedblatant lie. theres a lot to unpack but she was my mother. we had a lovely visit before i left town 3 weeks ago. im so furious that her body has been unclaimed in the hospital morgue. note i loved this healthcare system. i spent almost a decade of my career in their local hospital admin. when i was very very sick this staff literally saved my life. ive been so loyal until this circumstance,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 08:11:51 UTC,5,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j6c8nk,a man tried to get into my house today. i did everything wrong except lock the door,it was just my almost 2 year old son and me in the house. dogs were outside and i was at the kitchen table doing my makeup getting ready for work as i was supposed to leave in 2hrs. the doorbell rang and i ignored it for a couple minutes. its not uncommon for solicitors to try and sell shit. i slowly walked up to my front door peephole and looked out. there was a man standing with his back to the door blocking most of my view and then a second man was out at my curb back also facing my door kinda looking around. i started to get nervous and slowly turned the lock on the front doorknob so he wouldnt hear i was on the other side. important to note my moms transmission went out last week so shes borrowing my car. no cars in the driveway or in front on the street. but the tv was on playing a kid show for my toddler so he wouldnt miss my presence as much while getting ready. i watched him for a bit and decided hed probably leave soon and started walking away. thats when i heard my glass door open. i thought id hear him knock next but instead i got to watch as my front door knob started jiggling like someone was trying to get in. and then i froze. instead of getting my husbands gun to protect myself and my child i did nothing. i just froze. he fiddled with the door knob for a bit and then eventually walked away. i peeped out the kitchen window and watched as this dude met up with his buddy and then they started walking away. i texted my husband instead of calling the police. hes the one that did. he told me to call them because they wanted to ask me questions and so i did. then when i tried to call my phone said i had to connect to a wifi or network to make a call. my bill is paid every month on the 2nd and i was connected to wifi. just another thing that was going wrong. the police had to call me back and ask if i was ok to even talk to them. when the police did show up they said the guys were solicitors and its illegal in the city to do that. we even have 2 no soliciting signs taped to the glass door. she said her partner found them up the street and was kicking them out of the neighborhood. since there was no proof they tried to enter the house nothing could be done. the only thing they could do was drive up to the company and tell them that if they walk onto our property again they will have trespassing charges filed and the company will receive a citation. at the end of it all im extremely shaken. i didnt do anything right except lock the door. i didnt tell them to go away. i didnt call 911. i didnt get a weapon. i just locked the door and then watched as they tried to get in texted my husband and then did what i was told. i cried for a long time after. im still not doing great. if i hadnt locked that door i really dont know what couldve happened. if youve read this far thank you i just really needed to get this off my chest and out.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 07:46:11 UTC,504,57,0.95,,,0,0
1j6c7jl,closure with my ex,gtyes i once loved you and couldnt think of living without you but that changed long before you thought. one month after the wedding it started. but i really tried to work through it and honor our vows. but the last years before we opened our marriage and went enm i thought about your death more than once. i never thought about killing you but about you dying and freeing me from my vow. i resented you. and the last months i just plain hated you everyone saw how bad you treated me allthough i sacrified everything for you i could. only i didnt see it. then you found a new victim and toss me when i started speaking up. gtso no we will not stay friends. not now not in a year never. i do not want to ever see or hear you again. i am sorry for your new gf i warned her. i tried. she didnt listen you love bombed her like you did it with me in the beginning. she will come to her senses and hopefully get out without major mental and financial damage. gti now finally see how live can be with a loving and responsible partner. part of this conversation happened in a dream. i never had the chance for closure because i was always afraid he could do something and harm me legallyfinancially. so until the divorce was final and i got the money from our apartment i played it friendly and civil. i intended to have this conversation when this was all done but we went nc before that because he tried to fight my new partnernow husband. i do not see sense in telling him this now. but i might wanna keep it just in case he shows up again on my doorstep when his new gf dumps him.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 07:43:49 UTC,5,2,0.73,,,0,0

1j6bfcq,why i dont post pictures to social media and avoid socializing with others. because of the fear theyll get my age wrong and trigger my ocd and body dysmorphia,i am a 26 year old guy born in 1998. im going to sound crazy in this whole rant. when i was 18 in 20162017 i became curious how others were perceiving me. i thought i looked young and still had the teenage look. as someone born in 1998 it wasnt my turn to be 20 yet i was still a teenager. growing up people born in the early 90s and mid 90s seemed to look more mature than me and i thought it was obvious that i was younger. i began posting pictures of myself to yahoo answers and facebook guess my age challenges and asked people to guess. every picture i posted there was at least one person or a few people who guessed correctly that i was 18. that gave me validation yet i also heard 23 24 25 etc and that felt super weird at the time. i felt weirded out and uncomfortable because i just didnt understand howwhy i was being perceived as much older if there were people who were guessing my age correctly. i remember feeling upset even if i heard 20. i suffer from ocd too and numbers are very triggering for me. they were adding on years to my life and that just made me feel very restless and i felt absolutely disgusted. i was like omg im still a teenager and im being seen as old??do i have an abnormal appearance whats wrong with my development. but at the same time there were many people online who guessed correctly that i was 18. i remember one picture someone told me i looked like a teen and that she thought i was 1415 but another person thought i was 23. another picture 4 people thought i was 1519 yet another person thought i was 24. one picture someone guessed correctly i was 18 but another person said early 20s unless you have brilliant skincare regime. i also uploaded a picture of myself with glasses once and someone thought i was 17 or 18 yet another person said 2025. i was like 25!!?? and that haunted me for several years. i constantly kept having intrusive thoughts about these extreme perceptions and suffered so much. i even had to see a doctor and psychiatrist and took medication to try and stop the intrusive thoughts. i made a vow in september 2017 to stop posting. in real life many people thought i was a teen in school and asked me what grade i was in but at the same time some people thought i was past university age and doing my masters. it just felt super weird. this kept happening to me throughout university. people asking me what grade i was in being shocked that i was university and a few people who thought i was past university age. i will never forget september 2019. a guy born in 1992 told me that i looked younger than 21 to him and still looked like a teen but the day after that a lady thought that i was older than my then 29 year old sister 1990 and kept saying she looked really young like 22ish and i wasnt even 22 then like wtf. as mentioned earlier i suffer from ocd and constantly had intrusive thoughts that i was filthy and disgusting because years were being added onto my life and i wondered what i was going to look like when i was actually 2325. these numbers were disgusting in my mind. i also developed body dysmorphia and hated my appearance. i didnt mind being perceived as young but wondered what was it about my face that made me look old to others??? how could i look young and old at the same time? then when i was actually 2324 2 people asked me what grade i was in and a few days before i turned 25 in 2023 someone asked me if my school was closed for summer break. but then in january 2024 someone asked me if i was 25 and i was like omg have i looked 25 for the past decade?? am i living in some sort of time warp?? now im 26 and many people ask me if im a student of a postsecondary institute uber drivers restaurantcafe owners people helping me in stores etc thats a common perception many people have of me. but i have a sneaking suspicion that history is going to repeat itself in a new context and that a new trend will form that ive got to be 30 or 30 when im technically not even in my late 20s yet. this is why i dont post pictures online and avoid socializing with people. because im afraid history is going to repeat itself again and that ill suffer again. id much rather be alone than be around people who have the potential to make me uncomfortable in my own skin. i wasnt uncomfortable withy appearance until i became aware that some people have extreme perceptions of me. i also get really angry like why are most people so stupid and unable to read my face??? sometimes i just wish i could stay locked up in a tower like rapunzel away from the whole world so that no one can ever see my face again. im also pretending to be evil queen now as a coping mechanism. someone obsessed with her appearance constantly needing validation and being vindictive towards those who challenge her identity.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 06:49:26 UTC,2,9,0.63,,,0,0

1j6a28f,i found out why the mormons stopped coming to my house,i live in a multi family apartment complex with my lover who stays at home most of the day when im at work. at one point our door was getting knocked on twice sometimes three times a day multiple times a week. i hold no hostility towards mormons but it is kind of annoying being interrupted while cooking or working at 8pm. it was often enough that i noticed when it no longer happened. we are very obviously a gay couple so i figured at some point or another they put that together and stopped coming. i was wrong. turns out my lover who is lovingly and in their own words built like a brick shithouse answered the door freshouttheshower wet and in one of my silk robes at some point in the middle of the day and they have avoided the building since. i still see them in the neighborhood but never on our floor. my lover just confessed this during couples game night and i just started crying laughing. its been months. they never told me because they were sure they had stretched my robe out in the shoulders and didnt want to upset me. i personally think they look great in tight clothes but i can understand why seeing a big burly ginger man in a barely closed ill fitting silk robe could get us put on a religious shit list. maybe its just a coincidence and what lucky guys either way. they never wear anything like that when im home. but regardless its so silly.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 05:20:16 UTC,11477,229,0.97,,,0,0
1j69ulf,i finally made a move on my best friend and it went terribly,we have been coworkers for almost 10 years and best friends for over 5 years. ill keep it vague because she uses reddit regularly. annie fake name and i are both in our 30s both single we talk constantly we are either texting through the day or voice noting each other while we are driving. everyone at work thinks we are a couple and are constantly asking if something is going on unfortunately nothing ever has. ive been in love with her since i first met her. shes just so beautiful and smart and funny theres nothing i dont love about her. shes a great mom too and ive been partially filling a void in her sons life of a male role model. anyway on to the incident. we were out for dinner after work. i had asked her out knowing i was going to finally confess my feelings but she didnt know that was my intention we get dinner regularly enough. while eating we were gossiping about work and about a new project we are starting. itll be us two and a guy called craig m 50s. craig has asked me out multiple times to the point its definitely an ongoing joke. he knows im interested in women only and we have a great working relationship. annie makes a comment about us having some late nights working coming up and i better watch out for craigs advances i joke that i guess everyone just wants to kiss me she says not everyone. ok not a great start. i say well speaking of kissing and she cuts me off and just says please dont. i just said ok. we both got fairly quiet. finished our dinner with some small talk and work chat. went our separate ways and havent spoken since. its been 2 days. im just so sad and lonely without her. i miss her son. i want to talk to her so much but i know i cant keep this situation going on or ill lose my sanity. im going to look for a new job. maybe actually start dating women. in time i hope i can be a real friend to her. i feel bereaved. if anyone has been through this type of situation and has any advice please let me know.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 05:07:19 UTC,1,8,0.6,,,0,0
1j69hfw,my friend is boring,i love him a lot. genuinely. we went to high school together and have been friends even since were both 24. he is such a sweet and well intentioned soul. he helped me through hard times in my life and i try to always be there for him as well. but he is just genuinely so boring. having an in depth conversation with him is impossible. i dont know why. he doesnt have any opinions on anything or plans about life either other than wanting to move out. he just kind of exists he has some hobbies like soccer or watching movies but he cant really have in depth conversations about those either. even when he is telling me about them he just says that x and y happened. our conversations are mostly just him telling me what he ate that day how his day at work was like and what his parents said to him and he wants us to talk every day. we do have hobbies together like roller skating and eating out but is this really enough to keep a friendship afloat? i sure dont feel like it is now that i have a job and responsibilities. in depth conversations are so important to me and talking to him feels grating at times i know that he tries his best but hes just like this and i dont think that theres a clear solution,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 04:45:43 UTC,3,3,1.0,,,0,0

1j68ybh,my solo day experience pure freedom amp joy!,yesterday my parents went out to attend a family function leaving me alone at home. the first time my dad left me alone at night i felt a little scared. after all for a girl spending the night alone in a big house isnt always easy. but this time it was completely differenti felt calm confident and absolutely at peace. what surprised me the most was that my parents didnt call me even once to check whether i had eaten or done my work. not because they forgot but because they know i am responsible enough to handle everything. being the eldest daughter of the house i have always been expected to take care of things on my own. with 200 in hand from my dad i first treated myself to chhole bhature. later i managed to earn 1000 by sending some rice so now i had even more freedom to enjoy! for lunch i had paneer curry with rice and at night i went full feast modepizza and pasta while watching tenali rama on tv. no one to disturb no distractionsjust me my food and my favorite show! after that i enjoyed gulab jamun and ended the night with a cold thums up making the day feel even better. the best part? this time i didnt feel scared at all. sleeping alone which once felt a little uneasy now felt completely normal. what i realized was something even bigger. every night when my family is around i feel lonely. but when they werent there i understood that i dont actually need anyone to feel complete. if someone doesnt want to be with me i can still live happily on my own. as the eldest daughter i have often been ignored because of my younger brother. but now ive finally understoodthere is nothing wrong with being alone. this morning i woke up spent some time soaking in the warm sunlight on the terrace and now im making myself a cup of tea. after this ill do some housework and before my parents return ill prepare a meal for them. honestly this experience made me realize that being alone doesnt mean being lonely. its peaceful freeing and fun! no unnecessary stress no chaosjust me my time and pure happiness.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 04:14:10 UTC,4,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j68vbh,the wrong guy,hey all i feel silly to be in this spot making this post but i just needed to get this off my chest. i 23 m started talking to walter 49 m fake name a few months ago. he found me on an app based around a certain fandom which name ill be leaving off where we ended up connecting. i knew he was older and i know better. but hes so charming. and i just feel so silly because i can see the red flags but fuck is he so easy to talk to and he makes me so happy. walter is not well he told me he has bpd. hes had to do two stays in mental hospital in the times ive known him. well today we were talking everything was normal. and then randomly he texted me that he took a bunch of pills and that he was sitting outside of a hospital and i just started panicking. i mean what the hell. i feel like i should state i too am mentally ill. i just have started making improvements to my quality of life and i thought walter was as well. weve been bonding over growing as individuals. trying to keep each other up. yknow. so i was really worried to see this turn today. he said he was on the phone with the hotline. i asked him if i needed to call for help. i pleaded with him. i sent him audio messages because he tells me how cute i am. i pleaded. and he just said how cute i was and asked me to say please like that when we meet. he kept telling me how much hes going to miss me and sending me virtual hugs and just complimenting me. i know. i know better. i know whats going on. i dont know why im still letting myself fall for him. hes just so smooth. he makes me feel safe. i feel like he understands me. he listens to me. i just. is there. and i dont have many people there for me. and i know thats not a reason but just. here is where i am in life. i didnt think i would find myself in this position but i havent heard from him in 2 hours. he said he thinks he likes me. he brought back up when he asked me out but i turned him down then. hes just a weird little guy that i think im starting to like. it feels good to say that. i cant really explain this to people my friends my age. my best friend knows about him but not that i like him or flirt with him back. i just dont know if theyd understand. i know whats happening and honestly im okay with it right now. i probably deserve this happening to me. because i put someone else through this before. ive been the suicidal guy making someone plead for me. i am not proud of that guy i was. and i am making these changes to my life and trying so hard to be better. but maybe before i get better i should go through what i did someone first. maybe it wont be bad. maybe im worried over nothing. but he is truly sweet. maybe it doesnt always have to turn bad.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 04:09:22 UTC,2,0,1.0,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0
1j68tj9,my mom is abusing me and im tired of it,im 14 years old and have told two of my friends briefly about this but i feel like ill annoy them if i speak about it more. i just want to get this off my chest and put my experience somewhere in hopes itll make me feel better. im also posting this here because i dont want anyone to try and intervene itll just make everything worse. content warning for violence as well but suicide is mentioned first so i used that flair sorry. my mom is an okay mom most of the time but shes very quick to anger and has total freakouts over small things that always result in herself threatening to kill herself or saying shes going to kill herself. i have a little brother who is 13 and my mom is 45 with a history of suicidal thoughts and one attempt before we were born which she told us about. whenever we get into huge fights she usually takes my stuff and threatens to destroyburn it she never does she never lets me talk and always screams over me and then of course she threatens to kill herself and says its because of me and my brother and she says we ruined her life. i can understand why she resents us to an extent my brother and i are rape babies and we look like our dad. on the topic of him hes an abusive rapist who wasis addicted to drugs and who hasnt been in our lives since i was 3. he has gone off the radar for a few years and nobody knows where he is. my mom keeps threatening to send us back to him and has shown us her text in him multiple times telling him shes done with us and that he needs to come get us. he never has obviously. the last few times weve gotten in fights i never even yelled once and just keep talking calmly because i heard that helps calm angry people down it doesnt work she just keeps yelling and theres even been a few times when i do raise my voice that she literally covers her ears and says lalalala like a toddler until i stop talking. after she threatens this she usually leaves the house and says shes never coming back and says we can live with our grandmother. she says either that shes gonna drive off a cliff into a brick wall etc etc or that shell just straight up abandon us and start a new life somewhere. then shell come back some time later and act like nothing happened very rarely shell apologize but if i ever try and bring up what shes done again when shes calm shell just get enraged again. ive tried talking to her about it through text only once when she was out of the house sending her a lengthy few paragraphs about my concerns but she responded back basically just shaming me and when she came home she was angry and she said she showed the text to all of her friends which are mostly my friends parents and she said they dont like me anymore and i wont be able to hang out with any of my friends anymore. i started avoiding all of my friends and eventually began online school because of this and now my mom claims all my friends and their parents miss me and they dont understand why i dont talk to them anymore. i dont know what to believe anymore. when she isnt in these weird freak out modes shes an okay mom but she snaps at random stuff before flipping like a switch and being happy again. just yesterday she was yelling and slamming around her computer because she couldnt upload her photos to facebook shes a photographer. a few people had just been over to fix our dryer about an hour earlier which has been broken for months so mid yelling at her computer she just got up and went to go text out the new dryer and then when it worked she was all smiles and apologized for yelling. she also frequently tells me and my brother that were the only thing keeping her alive and that she would probably kill herself without us and shes told us multiple times that she doesnt own a gun because shes afraid that when we grow up and move out shell kill herself because she has no one to rely on anymore. this scares me and i want to move away for college when im grown i planned on leaving this household as soon as possible but i dont really want to anymore because she keeps saying things like that. she says stuff like that and says she loves me and my brother but then says the exact opposite when she gets really angry and says she wants to die because of us and she blames everything shes mad at on us stressing her out. shes also gotten physical with me and my brother multiple times like digging her nails into the back of my neck and holding my face into a pillow because i wouldnt give her my phone because she said she was gonna break it chokeholding me and dragging me out of me room before locking me out of my room and tearing it apart because i hid my art tablet from her and more. shes done stuff with my brother too and im ashamed to admit this but i dont know what because whenever shes mad at him i just hide in my room so i wont get punished for helping him. he does the same when she does that stuff with me. i only know she hurts him because i can hear it. i dont want to call the police im scared and i dont want to live with my grandma or in a foster home or anywhere else and i dont want to be separated from my brother and pets. she actually encourages me to call the police on her and says shed rather go to jail than live with us. i just want to explain to her how her her actions hurt me and my brother and i want to get her to stop. theres been periods of times where everything has been fine for a while and my family is just a normal happy family and i cry sometimes thinking about how thats what my family could be like if my mom wasnt the way she was. i know im doing it to myself at this point by not calling the police but im just scared and keep hoping things will change. right now is one of those times where everythings fine my mom is currently talking to my brother offering to clean off the couch and sit and braid his hair while they watch the movie together. were all acting like nothings wrong. i just wish my family could be this way all the time.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 04:06:28 UTC,1,13,0.57,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0
1j68o9l,feeling like dogshit,. . . next week marks a year since i was admitted to the psych ward for overdosing. i tried texting the hotline but impulse took on faster than they could respond unfortunately. my partner doesnt love me like they used to and i dont blame them. i put them through the horror of watching their significant others life slip and be forced to carry the burden. despite the ordeal told me they dont want to hear me suggest breaking up anymore. they dont want to hear me suggest that they feel obligated to stick with me. i dont tell them my feelings or worries anymore. i try to just smile and be happy keep everything behind closed doors again. at this point were roommates that share a bed. wouldnt it be better if we split and stayed friends? it saves everyone the headache. i want to articulate my thoughts but theyre caught in my throat my fear. ive been more open to some choice friends about my suicidality that this is a frequent occurrence. they want me to share my thoughts and know that theyre with me but how can i? how can i put another person through the burden that is my heart when i dont value it myself? i grew up being told i look like every other person. that i am not unique. i am never enough since another person can do it better faster. everyone will mourn but it will come to pass they can find a replacement. and with hope ill be forgotten. sorry if this is messy. i dont feel like im fully present right now because when worse comes to worse ill wake up and bottle this all up again.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 03:58:13 UTC,1,0,1.0,,content warning suicideself harm,0,0
1j68jjz,just another confused and lost person.,i usually dont post about this kinda stuff online or really talk about it out loud with anyone to be honest its often just a page on a random notebook where i braindump anything and everything that crosses my mind at the moment when i feel like its too much to handle. today is different. i decided to expose it exactly because i never did. been trying different stuff to see if something changes in hope that any change could chain more and eventually things get better. ive always felt sort of an inadequacy around life if that makes sense a feeling that i never really belong anywhere or am passionate about anything. im currently 30 years old and so far ive been navigating passively. i wonder if there is such a thing as not really fit to being alive. dont get me wrong this isnt a cry for help and im not planning on hurting myself in any way also im not trying to throw a pity party im coming from a place of trying to figure this out logically. like i said im currently 30. turned 30 this year. i still live with my parents am unemployed but am currently studying computer science at an university. never really been into a relationship but i do have some good friends and a loving familt for the most part. still there is something wrong with me. i look around sometimes and hear shared experiences from other people about romantic adventures or success on their jobs and i feel like i want that. its not jealousy mind you its more of a self questioning as to where have i been if not doing all that stuff? my current situation is my fault and i understand its not good and even then i dont have the strength or willpower or whatever you may call it to change it. its like part of me wants to experience the world and... i guess a good way to explain it is i want to want to do stuff but i dont know what or how to start. starting things is another problem of mine. i know what needs to be done and even so starting things is so difficult that its insane. normally that could be ruled out as being lazy or procastination but frankly ive putting things off for 30 years the problem has to be something else right? currently i know that i should be sitting down to work on programming projects to create portfolios and help me get employes but doing so is... hard. not as in programming is hard its not that. im also not scared of making mistakes i embrace them as an opportunity of learning. its a mix of not knowing where or how to start and perhaps a disbelief that it is going somewhere? i even thought at some point this might be related to me playing too much games or watching too many shows but even if i cut all that off i still wont do what i need. ill spend time laying in bed overthinking planning too much for stuff i never have the guts to get done. i guess you could call me a leech but i dont feel like its the case. i dont take pride nor plan on taking advantage of my dads kindness forever but i just feel... lost? its always been hard for me to set goals to achieve because i feel like i dont really have anything. i can feel content with so little and thats maybe the reason why i never try and get more. i dont consider myself ambitious having fancy stuff or being famous or helping people... none of that stuff really pushes me forward. and those are the common stuff that people want so how can i move forward without a good reason to? there are things im interested in yeah. like learning languages. but also some stuff id love to try and have no money for right now like woodworking maybe music and theater. i still feel like a kid frozen in time watching it go by and desperately trying to grow up but failing miserably. and although i umderstand there is no point in thinking too hard about my past mistakes that led here im scared that im forever trapped in this loop of not being able to move on. i want to escape but am not sure what i should do. therapy would help i feel but ill only be able to afford it when i manage to get a job. im hoping ill manage to get my first internship this year and maybe talking to someone would help me figure things out. sure i have friends but i dont feel like i have a safe space to be vulnerable with them or anyone else in my family. i always thought back then that i would have this figured out by now. sometimes i think all its needed is a small change that gets other things in motion so lately ive been trying to do that. doing things differently trying to experimenting new stuff. i recently created a routine to try and force myself to do stuff it hasnt helped much so far because even if i write things down i end up forgetting to look at the list or just cant bring myself to do it but on good days i actually get a small amount of stuff done. im the kind of person who tries to understand and look for a purpose on everything and this here is kind pointless. this post went nowhere and is not going anywhere. kinda like my life so far. its funny to think that. but thats why i decided to do it. im not sure things will work out and despite hearing positive encouragement from my friends still cant see much of a future for me but ill keep doing what i can and trying my best even if its not the most optimal for a normal human being. if you actually managed to read this far my apologies for this mess. i wrote as the thougts came no organization or anything. i hope someday i understand myself and determine my purpose.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 03:50:28 UTC,4,0,0.83,,,0,0

1j682gi,i like love but dont want to love,to be honest i just wanted to write down how i been feeling since i broke up with my ex more than a year ago. i 18f like and enjoy loving people and i love loving things have you heard under pressure by david bowie and queen? basically it represents my vision of love. and honestly i really hate how people now forget that love its the thing that moves the world love for power money for people etc. so i honestly really want to love someone and feel a unique connection even if it last just a week i want to feel something real sometimes. but then i think about life specifically in my country where i can only focus on having a decent career a d get money to pay the future bills. i really like being single as i have to give explanations to no one when i go out or stuff like that but sometimes feeling someones body close to yours not in a sexual way its all you need. sorry if it makes no sense english aint my first language downcast_face_with_sweat and this is mostly a venting post. im not sad nor want comfort as i dont think i need it yet i just wanted to express it.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 03:23:44 UTC,2,0,1.0,,,0,0
1j67ypz,i hate my husband,well i dont hate hate him. i still respect my husband. he provides a lot roof over me and our sons head food on the table water to drink.. yeah what am i complaining for right? i should always be grateful that im in this position which i am. its just there are things that still bothers me that ruins my mood sucking the soul out of me little by little draining my life day by day inch by inch. idk if im just a whiny wife but here are some things that messes w my head everyday 1 he never puts his coffee mugs in the sink after he used them theres always hundreds of them outside where he smokes i told him a million times to put it in the sink after he finish using it i dont mind washing it just put it in the fucking sink but noopee still compiling outside the house. til this day i let it be there are still 45 mugs outside the house not gonna touch it ever unless he brings it in. this is so sad for me cus he knows i got a bad eczema on my hands so everytime i wash buttloads of dishes i have to wear gloves wash the gloves dry the gloves also wash my hands bc rubber gloves makes me itchy a bit etcetc my main point is its hell and back on earth for me to do dishes and hes not considerate of that. we once had a big fight bc when were at our inlaws his fam he fucking washed his mug??? huh? since when the fuck do u do that? so you care what your family says about you instead of caring about your eczema hands wife? yea fuck you. 2 he rarely takes care of our son. i literally do everything. he only takes care of him if i told him to. sometimes when i shower i have to actually ask him can you watch him for a bit he has this ugly smug face and said k like um wtf? youre supposed to b excited?? hes your son??? you will b rarely seeing him cus you work offshore???? get this infront of his family he acts so fatherly playing with him taking care of his diapers etc while me if were actually home im doing all the fucking stuff not him. he literally does shit if i tell him to. hes never considerate of how tired i am 247. 90 of the time if i dont wanna see his smug face if i have to shower and no one is watching our son i had to put our son in his crib and let him watch ms rachel on ipad eventho it hurts me doing that cus im limiting his screen time. and what was my husband doing that time? playing league of legends and hell be like sorry im in game i cant quit well fuck you. and also get this when i found out that im pregnant and i wanted to abort it cus i know im not ready he was the one who strongly insisted to keep it cus he said he cant wait to be a dad. well step the fuck up bro 3 idk if im wrong or just exaggerating but he prioritizes his family over me and my son. if there was a fire he would save his 4 brothers and 5 sisters instead of his wife and son. he would go to the ends of the earth for them once he had to deliver something car oil at 6am for his sister n her husband 6am??? mf usually wakes up at 2pm ffs. 4 he has this obsession w fixing up old cars he would spend loads of money on it and w literally his blood sweat tears and his time. yo i dont mind mf got a hobby i got a hobby too thats great for him but wht abt when i need to shower???? do i have to go outside to ask you to watch over our son again with your ugly smug face again?? to sum up he has 2 obsession league of legends and his car. none of which you can bother him at all. my hobby is just gym. just gym. for 1 hour. at which i can only work out when my son takes his afternoon nap! i just want him to evenly schedule his hobby.. not to the point he doesnt have time for his son or me. do u think he listens? nah. everytime i told him this hell be like this is the only time i can do this while im working at sea i cant do this stuff im like hello? cars and games are forever?? your wife and son could leave you or die anytime? wtf is his mindset mahn istg hes still acts like a teenager. i literally feel like i have 2 sons as of this time. 5 his dirty clothes and socks. need i say more? i feel like almost every wife experienced this. 6 he spills his coffee and chocolate milk every where in the kitchen but never wipes it. i once saw the mf vacuums his familys kitchen bc there was a spilled rice grains. basically hes really sloppy. there are more but thats the top of my head. idk what i should do. everytime i tell him whats been bothering me we always have a huge fight and it always ends with ok i promise i wont do it again but he still does and its and endless cycle. i cant leave him bc i literally have no money to raise my son alone and my mom is getting old so i have to take care of her too. so til now im just tolerating everything but it drains my energy so much but at the same time i put on a happy smile on my face for my son i dont ever want my son to see depressed or angry. mind you he used to b very sweet and thoughtful at the beginning of our dating life and marriage life. i thought he was the most amazing guy. i know he loves me and my son but i dont think he loves me enough to change his ugly habits.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 03:18:02 UTC,0,24,0.5,,,0,0

1j67wme,im terrified to go wedding dress shopping,im marking this as positive because im so excited but also terrified. im on mobile so forgive any weird formatting. im 23 almost 24. im getting married march of 2026. im scared of change and getting married and moving out of my parents house terrifies me. dress shopping makes it so real. on top of that i want the tradition of him not seeing the dress. because im working on weight loss and in the middle of a masters degree i have limited time to do everything i need to do so im starting early. i remember our first date. we met online and the first time he seen me he took a step back in awe of me. i cant wait to see that on my wedding day. but that means i have to hide this dress from him for so long. how do i not show my best friend my wedding dress.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 03:14:45 UTC,1,1,0.67,,positive,0,0
1j67rm0,i overheard my boyfriends brother talking to his mistress about leaving his pregnant wife,ive been in a bit of a rut and when i finally decided to leave the damn house i went to my boyfriends little family gathering his mom was hosting. ill skip to the damn point. i was having drinks with my boyfriend and we both overheard a conversation between his brother and some woman on the phone. his brother was in the bathroom and his wife was talking to other family. so being the nosy assholes we are we listened. turns out his brother has been having an affair on his pregnant wife. we heard the woman tell him that she wanted him to divorce his wife for her but to wait until after his wife gives birth which is in a few months. apparently she doesnt want him to stress his wife out into a miscarriage. and that she still wants him to be in the childs life and shes be an amazing step mother. whats worse is he agreed though i dont know if hed actually go through with it or not. what. the. fuck. is. wrong. with. people. she said she had morals on the call. bullshit! if she had any damn morals she wouldnt be sleeping with a married man especially with a pregnant wife! my boyfriend and i dont know wether to tell his wife or not. we dont really want to risk stress her out but idk. we are stumped. we never thought hed be that kind of sick bastard. it makes me feel sick just thinking about it. what the hell are we supposed to do? edit just to make things a bit more clear shes high risk from what im aware of. shes 6 months so far. i dont know much about pregnancy or how stress can affect the fetus but i know she wants that kid. shes been trying for years to get pregnant and had a miscarriage in the past.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 03:07:03 UTC,448,131,0.98,,,0,0
1j67lmd,feeling like i dont belong in my own culture,growing up in a small town in england i always felt like an outsider even in my own family. i loved them but i never truly felt like i belonged. when i moved to new zealand at 16 i hoped things would change but i found it even harder to make friends and felt even more misunderstood. that sense of not fitting in just followed me. over time i started wishing i had been born into a different culturenot because i think life wouldve been better but because something just never clicked with my own. ive always found my culture awkward and uninteresting but when i met my first south american friend something felt right. the more people i connected with from chile peru brazil and colombia the more i felt at home. i know south america is incredibly diverse and i dont mean to generalize but i cant ignore the feeling. maybe belonging isnt about where youre born but where you feel understood.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 02:58:09 UTC,0,2,0.5,,,0,0
1j67irz,i feel like i cant find love.,i m21 am in my last semester of undergrad. so far in college career ive been on 0 dates had 0 sex and i also havent had my first kiss yet. anytime a friend would ask how i was doing with girls i would say that i didnt have time because i was taking 18 hours every semester. partially that was true. depending on classes it could be a particularly timeintensive thing. though i would try to get involved on campus whenever i could. i guess long story short all my friends have had this stuff fall into their laps. i dont know why i havent been so lucky. im worried that im past the point where having no experience is fine and now its leaning into sad territory. i think im decently attractive and funny so i dont know what my issue is. i am going to grad school very far from my whole support system and where im in undergrad. im afraid the work load there will put me in a similar position to not be able to do anything. i dont know i guess im just throwing this out there.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-08 02:53:54 UTC,1,2,1.0,,,0,0
1j61gx2,i need advice,to start off im 27f with a 22m boyfriend. weve been together for almost 3 years and we met due to working together. i still cringe at our 5 year age gap. i have a friend that is 30f and i dont know if i am a complete ahole for wanting to cut ties with her or maybe i already accidentally did. the last time i saw her i ended up staying for a weekend which was fun at first and we tried to drink but we both fell asleep too fast which her boyfriend got mad about. i did not like this boyfriend 36m due to him constantly sleeping with his ex and being so obvious about it but shed be in this denial or whatever and cry to me constantly about it. he was also somewhat a neglectful parent to his daughter from what my friend would tell me. so anyways the next day came and i agreed to stay an extra day to watch her two daughters and figured id be getting paid because we discussed it prior. well i didnt and during this i ended up getting bed bug bites on my neck hands and ankle area. pretty much where my skin was exposed. since leaving there i still feel like i have bugs on my skin and im honestly afraid to ever go back. i dont know why i pick and choose when to be confrontational because i just let left and didnt say anything. i dont know whether to say anything at all. weve talked about bedbugs before and shes said shes gotten rid of them so i dont know what to say. fast forward a few days and she tells me her and her boyfriend 36m broke up and shes back together with an ex 32m. this ex 32m was sleeping with a 17 year old girl and my friend 30f let both of them move into her home with her two children before they both just dipped and apparently had left the place trashed and thats when the bedbugs originally came about around this time too. oh and that man32m knew her children for a few months and was having them call him daddy. i felt so uncomfortable witnessing all of this and then seeing what she allows herself and her children to be put through willingly. for months i was telling her xyz was not right and shed be defending herself and him 36m until they broke up. at that point is when she is like oh i could never be with someone who does xyz and completely shitting on this man talking about everything she defended and excused when she put up with it for months and would have continued to put up with it if he 36m didnt have his baby momma over again to stay the night after she had been begging him to stop for months doing that for months. so im just over it? im like why are you actively choosing to put yourself through these things? i dont like to sugar coat things because why the hell should i act like neglecting a child is okay just to be a girls girl? their relationship wasnt abusive or anything like that a lot of accusations of cheating coming from both amp issues starting a few days after they began dating which is never a good sign but neither were afraid of each other it wasnt like that and she will put up with almost anything to keep a guy around and thats my issue. i used to think she was a good mom but i dont think shes that great anymore. i used to praise her when she would say she wouldnt let strangers around her kids and doesnt let anyone else watch her kids until i realized shes letting men she just met meet her kids inside her home and be around them unsupervised. i used to think she was a good mom until i realized she raises her daughters through sugar and electronics and doesnt really watch even though around her children. all of these realizations have come to me now after she broke up with her long term boyfriend of 2 years34m and have gone through 45 relationships in a year and i dont think shes the person i thought she was and i feel awful but i dont want to be around someone like that. so she has her new boyfriend ex boyfriend 32m currently living with her again and i sent her a message a couple days ago saying i think that hes a pedophile and i dont want to be around him to which shes never responded but has sent other things. i know that once her and her current boyfriend 32m break up or start having issues she will be wanting my pity party but i cant do it anymore. i feel like i have no empathy for her anymore. if we had more to talk about than her and her relationships i feel like it wouldnt be such an issue but she has no subsidence to her at all if it is not about a man. any advice on what you would do in my situation? its not my life so i dont know why im so bothered.,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-07 21:57:32 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0
