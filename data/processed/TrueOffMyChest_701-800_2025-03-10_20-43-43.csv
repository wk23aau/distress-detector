1j4irfk,No one subs to a YouTube channel because the video asks them to,I cant think of any channel I subbed because the creator constantly reminded me to or complains that only 5 of their views come from subscribers I think it does more harm than good and you can hear it coming from a mile away in every video,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 00:32:55 UTC,62,40,0.72,,,0,0
1j4ipqp,Its a real story I have sleep paralysis and it getsnsfw,Im not sure where to post this but I really need advice thats why I made an account just fot this because Im starting to question my sanity I recently started living alone in my first apartment Im extremely careful I always lock the doors and windows at night and I dont have any pets I used to have occasional bouts of sleep paralysis during a stressful phase but they were relatively harmless dark figures just staring at me hearing weird noises etc But since Ive lived here its different Now I wake up several times a week in the middle of the night completely paralyzed I can only move my eyes hear and feel And every time I see this big dark shadowy figure in my room But it doesnt just stand in the corner It slowly comes towards me It pulls my blanket away then my pants and then it starts touching me in a way that feels far too real It starts touching me with its mouth It licks me sucks me as if it is completely obsessed with my vagina And the most disturbing thing is I feel EVERYTHING Every detail Much more intensely than any real human contact I have ever had It brings me to orgasm over and over until the sensations are so overwhelming that I pass out And when I wake up in the morning my blanket is actually at the foot of the bed or on the floor my pants exactly where it threw them For the ones who wants to imagine it the figure is black shadowy with glowing white eyes but sometimes they look red and it is very large It has a somewhat human shape but also somehow not There is a dark aura around it like black smoke The hands are very large and the fingers are extremely long The only thing I remember is that in one of my earlier sleep paralyses years ago I saw these hands or very similar looking hands trying to grab me But I was able to free myself from the paralysis in time bec my sister suddenly came in my room and turned the lights on Its mouth is not visible but when it begins with the act I can make out the outline of the mouth and it has a very long tongue You can then imagine where the tongue goes It doesnt say anything or even talk to me I know it might feel like a particularly realistic sleep paralysis but how can things be moving in my room Im scared It happens almost every night and although it doesnt hurt the thought that it might do more at some point scares me What if its not just a hallucination And before anyone asks No Im not desperate or lonely Im single right now but Im happy with it I dont miss anyone feel untouched or crave closeness Ive had relationships in the past but right now Im enjoying my own life so I understand even less why this is happening But my biggest concern is that deep down Im starting to enjoy it There are moments when I catch myself thinking Dont stop Keep going And that terrifies me even more I have a disturbing theory What if it isnt just a sleep paralysis I know its not a dream bec Im fully awake Im just unable to move or make a sound What if it is some kind of entity or demon that possessed me I know how crazy this sounds but if you were in my shoes would you really rule it out I feel like I cant talk to anyone about this Its so humiliating and the worst part is what if it keeps coming to me every night until the day I die bec I dont do anything about it Im desperate and conflicted because as terrifying as it is it also feels good And Im starting to crave it I dont think a real man could ever satisfy me again like this Ive tried to relax before sleep and I dont have any stress in life at the moment but it still visits me almost every night And like i said Im extremely embarrassed to talk to other people in real life because Ive started to enjoy it and I dont have any money for fancy therapies What if this continues for years I feel everything and when I wake up in the morning my intimate area feels a bit numb and tingly as if someone had been fiddling with it so its not fake its really happening to me I almost always pass out from all the orgasms Being satisfied so intensely every night can be dangerous right Idk Have any of you ever experienced something like this Am I just crazy or is something going on here that I cant explain,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 00:30:48 UTC,39,89,0.63,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j4ido9,I hate women approaching me,I 19M hate women approaching me Throughout my life I was considered to be ugly I was told by multiple people and girls would treat me like dirt and constantly remind me Im ugly throughout my life Over the past 2 years I made a decision after being insulted brutally on a friend app called Wizz more like a dating app I was really skinny and hence I decided to eat more and bulk up to gain some muscle mass as well as starting skincare and hopping on minoxidil for better hair quality for my facial hair scalp hair and eyebrows too along with multiple other changes Anyway these 2 years increased my looks considerably to the point where I almost looked like a different human being During this however my self esteem was still incredibly low For the past few months I noticed a girl that was constantly staring at me and I first thought oh she must think Im ugly hence shes staring Later on she started laughing with her friend group while looking at me so I thought wow she must think Im extremely ugly This was not new to me More recently she added me over Snapchat which she got from a friend of mine as Ive found out recently and she had a little conversation with me Ill call her J J sent a snap of herself and told me she had seen me around and that she really liked me This however triggered me and I remembered the treatment I had received up until now especially the treatment on Wizz In that moment I snapped and insulted the mole on her cheek as well as her forehead and told her Id have to be blind or in a coma for her to ever have a chance with me This was quite recent More recently Ive had a female cashier give me a discount on some shopping I was doing to make a milk cake because Im handsome It honestly disgusted me and I genuinely just left the shop without any of the ingredients It hasnt been long since Ive become apparently attractive and Im getting a whole lot more attention from girls and I hate it Fuck these girls They treated me like shit for all these years when I was ugly and now they think they have a chance when Im attractive Makes me want to punch them all in the face I notice a lot of little changes in my daily interactions even with my family Its revolting,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 00:14:36 UTC,0,86,0.21,,,0,0
1j4i8vx,I got the sadness,Im 35F and Ill be a first time mom pretty soon Throughout this entire pregnancy the ones I considered close to me have been treating me really like shit The dad opted out so that he can continue to date or whatever the fuck he wants to do This included him making me find somewhere else to live so he can really lean into his bachelor lifestyle My family has not been a source of emotional support which is all I need because Im financially in a good place and always helped them His family makes excuses for him so Ive stopped reaching out they are clearly on his side which is fine Ill have to give birth alone but Im grateful for my unborn and excited to start a new chapter Once my baby is born Im just going to ghost everyone for about four months I dont even feel the need to tell anyone when she is born or anything It makes me sad af but feels necessary I literally have no one to confide in so I just had to get these thoughts off me Thanks for reading sparkling_heart,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-06 00:08:19 UTC,3,6,0.72,,,0,0
1j4i0nn,I want to help people my entire life but the issue is I feel like I am the touch of death,For complete transparency I wrote this out first on wordpad can post the original if requested but since my grammar and wording is never great learning disability I ran it thru a AI grammar editor The message and feelings are still mine as I reread it to be 100 sure Just thought you all should no Im writing this because its been weighing on my mind for a long time It keeps happening and I cant shake the feeling that Im the common factor For as long as I can remember Ive wanted to make a difference in someones life In high school I dreamed of becoming a teacher to help kids At one point I even considered becoming a doctor or a nurse to be there for people in their worst moments But over the years those dreams fadedbecause every time Ive tried to help things have ended the same way It seems like whenever someone needs emergency medical care and I step in to help they dont make it The Moments That Haunt Me One of the first times this happened I was around 1820 years old I was walking home from Walmart when I heard a crash Looking over I saw a motorcycle had been tboned by a car and the driver was on the ground Without thinking I ran toward him weaving through traffic I took his hand and spoke to him trying to keep him calm while others applied pressure to his wounds He handed me his phone and asked me to call a family member to let them know he was going to the hospital I did exactly that then gave the phone back to him Soon after paramedics arrived and took him away Later I read that he had died from his injuries At the time I didnt think much of it beyond the tragedy of the accident A few years later I was at home when my stepfather suddenly jumped up and said Call an ambulance We did and while waiting I ran upstairs to grab him a shirt as asked I helped him put it on talking to him reassuring him that everything would be okay The paramedics arrived and took him away Shortly after he went into heart failure and died Then a few years after that I was living in an apartment building One day I glanced out the window out of boredom and saw my neighbors unloading groceries Out of nowhere the wife collapsed and her husband barely caught her in time I didnt hesitateI bolted out of my apartment without even locking the door ran down the hallway hit the elevator button and after a few seconds of waiting said Fuck it and took the stairs I got to them as fast as I could Her husband was on the phone with paramedics while I held her trying to comfort her as he gathered her meds and health cards The building superintendent came out just standing there saying Shes going to be okay Just being completely useless It took the paramedics over 30 minutes to arrive The moment I stepped back to let them work they had to use a defibrillator there heart had stopped She didnt make it The Fear That Lingers These are just a few of the moments that have left me feeling this way I may add more as I remember them But because of them I feel like I cant help peoplebecause when I do it only seems to end badly I honestly have never had someone survive going to the hospital after I help Its been about three years since I last experienced something like this and I hope I never do again But Im scared that if it happens again Ill freeze up That fear eats at methe fear that I wont be able to help that Ill hesitate that Ill fail someone when they need me most Im shaking as I write this scared of being judged of being called a coward But I needed to get this off my chest because its been haunting me for far too long I am shaking trying to hit the post button,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 23:57:50 UTC,6,2,1.0,,,0,0
1j4hyop,Im a rent man and I think I have a crush on my client,Warning slightly sexually explicit Probably NSFW I dont really know how to say any of this but I know I need to write it somewhere Ill probably delete this at some point after Im 27M and Im a rent man Another term for what I do is male escort But I live in a small sleepy town and we just dont call ourselves escorts I decided to get into this because I needed some money to help me finish my degree Im also in good shape so I thought it would be an easy side hustle I didnt dont have a partner and I havent been interested in dating Business is generally very slow When I first started I only had 1 client who I would visit every week After that she moved away and I had two more clients that I would see periodically It was always a very clinical and mechanical experience Get in do what needs to be done get out Things were quiet for about a year and a half I wasnt really providing services anymore But a few months ago I got a message on my profile from a lady who was interested in my services She was just reaching out asking how it works We spoke for a bit and we decided to meet up My services are customisable and she selected a variation of the boyfriend experience I went to her house and I was Surprised She had a really nice place In a rich neighbourhood Im sure this might not be out of the ordinary for other male escorts but my previous clients werent situated in rich neighbourhoods I didnt grow up rich She was very welcoming She was a few years older than me She seemed to have a successful career We sat in the living room and just talked She told me that shes had sex for her whole adult life and shes enjoyed it for the most part But shes had some kind of sexual awakening recently and shes looking for someone to explore this with She said she doesnt even care if we didnt have sex that night She wanted to talk to make sure that we would be a good fit for what she had in mind and if I was okay with it That was also a first for me My previous clients didnt really care what I was okay with Anyway Lots has happened since then I see her maybe once every two weeks And its always an incredible experience I cant explain it Sometimes we have sex Sometimes we dont Sometimes we eat pizza and watch movies sometimes we drink and have sex Its so passionate Sometimes its primal Sometimes its lazy and intense Its not the mechanical sex that Im used to She truly turns me on She likes it when Im satisfied Sometimes we just talk and nothing else Ive opened up to her about my life She pays me every time Ive even started insisting that she doesnt need to But she believes in me and my future and wants to support me in finishing my degree The problem is I no longer see this as a professional relationship I really like her And she seems to really care about me as a person We know so much about each other but I feel so weird to say that were friends She pays me for my time so are we really friends And sometimes I let my mind wander What if we were more Shes quite an incredible woman And weve had many deep conversations Shes been through a lot One of the topics that came up was her previous relationships Because I was wondering why she would approach a service instead of exploring this with perhaps a romantic partner And I guess long story short she was in a relationship with a man who absolutely destroyed her She no longer trusts people enough to share her life with She wants to be alone Forever But she desperately wants to explore her sexual side I guess thats where I come in By the way I know who this man is Its a small town Fck you for what you did You had such a great woman Whats wrong with you I havent heard from her in a while And I desperately want to reach out to her Im trying not to lose myself in this situation I keep telling myself shes just my client and nothing more This is just me doing my job But I know that I feel a certain way Unfortunately I dont think shell ever see me as anything more,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 23:53:55 UTC,1131,76,0.94,,,0,0

1j4guer,Im a bad friend and its affecting people I care about,Recently I fell out with a friend of mine who Ive known for a little over a year Its most likely my fault given that I A have talked to them about it already B Am somewhat aware that I probably sucked at some point in time that I dont entirely remember It started around 34 months ago when all my friends made plans to hangout together out of town a few dont show up because of curfew although they didnt make any real attempt to meet with any of us or let us know where they were until leaving to go home They argued they told us about curfew beforehand we mentioned how we deliberately shifted the schedule up by a few hours to accommodate that they then said we didnt even agree on a meeting place we did they apologize and swear it wont happen again After this I was upset for quite a while with one of them whom I was closer to and gave them the cold shoulder for a while We dont talk for ages since I dont speak much with others in lessons and they kept wandering off with my other friend Meanwhile another one of my friends who organised the hangout trip is slowly losing patience with friend A and B because they keep ditching her when leaving to buy lunch which also kinda ticks me off because Its getting hard not to see a pattern forming Distance grows I dont do much about it since I attributed it to something else entirely and wanted to give them space this is around 2 months back We still dont talk properly They ghost me starting from around a month ago and dont talk to me in person or respond to my texts Eventually I ask to meet up and talk about it and they agree When asking them they say the reason why is that I dont really talk to them kept moving away whenever they sat near compared their skills to another persons even though theyre the same grade made snide comments people whore friends with me arent nice to them etc I dont remember a ton of this and while some of it is probably coincidence moving away from them theres a solid chance that some of it IS stuff Ive done I can be pretty horrible sometimes especially when Im not doing so well mentally and Im so angry with myself that I crashed a friendship with someone I cared about over crap communication and my own assholery I wish I could say that I atleast know where I went wrong but I cant since I dont remember the whole bloody thing happening Another of my friends has distanced themselves from my current group to join another group with this person and I cant tell whether they actually want to remain friends with me or if its just because they cant bring themselves to stop talking with me entirely Theres also the chance that their negative impression of me is creating a negative impression of everyone associated with me AND that Im 90 sure their new friends keep talking shit about me since they all go quiet whenever I get too close although there could be any random thing theyre talking about To top this all off Im not even sure if my own friends enjoy my presence and I feel myself drifting from them although this part is probably in my head and a reflection of current circumstances TLDR I hate myself my friend hates me their new friends hate me I cant tell if another friend hates me and my current friends might hate me Its been a long week Im sick And tired,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 23:02:01 UTC,1,0,0.67,,,0,0

1j4d2y1,I went to a fancy beach resturant soaking wet alone for my birthday a couple weeks ago,Yup you read the title So my birthday was a little while ago it was my 20th and honestly I was pretty damn depressed for it Didnt have a lot of friends to celebrate with and was basically alone and it feltstill feels really weird not being a kid anymore I decided to treat myself to a beach day both to go romp around and also cause I needed some driftwood for an aquarium I was setting up I have no car though so had to take the bus to get up which had a very inconvenient schedule So I got to the beach found some sticks and got so distracted that I unfortunately missed the bus pick up Now there was another bus coming in a couple hours and I could always call a ride too if needed So I decided that now that I was here for at least a couple hours I might as well do some more exploring This particular beach stretched for 3 miles north up to another beach where on the other side there was a small resturant I was pretty hungry at this point so thought itd be fun to walk up there and catch bus later that evening at that spot instead So I cruised up the beach and got some really great views of the clouds and sinking sun along the way I eventually got to the cutoff to where the other beach started however while the map only portrayed a small stream separating them by now the ride had come in and that tiny stream was basically a river After scouring the area for a bridge or easier way across I stupidly chose to wade through a shallower point which worked and I made it to the other side of the beach soggy but triumphant I had no change of clothes in my pack So after drying off a tiny bit I walked up to the resturant and when I got inside I realized this wasnt just some little beach shack it was a full on fancy ass resturant My belly was roaring though so I decided to give it a try I asked for outdoor seating for obvious reasons and was really surprised to see them setting the table with fancy cloths and a bunch of different forks and silverware and shit I ordered crabcakes and some jumbo shrimp which were the cheapest things there but combined still cost a whopping 70 They eventually bring out two tiny barely palm sized pencilthin crab patties and 5 individual finger length shrimp both elaborately decorated in the middle of these giant white plates For the cost of it all I was half convinced Id be able to keep the plates too I kept getting odd looks from the other diners who were almost all either in pairs or groups I was the only lone person there Not to mention still pretty soggy dressed like a casual vagabond and with my backpack as my only companion in the opposite chair Yeah I stuck out like a giddamned giraffe in a horse ranch Eventually I finished up and caught the bus back home where I promptly went to sleep Happy 20th birthday bud theres 70 bucks you aint getting back and an experience youll cherish for all the wrong reasons,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 20:30:14 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j4fr1m,Update I started washing and putting away my roommates favorite mug whenever she uses it When she caught me I lied about why,Good morning yall A couple days ago I made a post at 3 in the morning to confess to doing my roommates dishes because I secretly love to watch her do a happy dance when she sees her favorite mug is clean for her to use again That post changed our lives and Im only being a little dramatic by saying that I gotta say thanks to everyone who upvoted and commented on my original post Im still shook at just how many people read about me and my mug happy best friend The amount of people saying my post made them smile or reminded them of their own friendships or significant others has kept me smiling for days Im kind of into making people happy if that wasnt already obvious so the fact that so many people had even a moment of positivity because of me has been awesome When I made that original post it was because I just wanted to tell someone about the mug dancing but I knew Gwen wouldnt like it if I told anyone we knew so I came to reddit to shout to the void and oh boy did the void shout back There were so many comments asking if I really thought we were just friends and Ill be honest when I made that post we absolutely were just friends We had never talked about being more than friends and I was happy being friends because we have an amazing friendship I hadnt really thought about there being a possibility for more because dating was always something I planned to do when I had my life together or when I had more money I never let myself consider what I was missing out on by waiting for the right time Her finding my post opened up the chance for Gwen and I to talk about things that we hadnt before and over breakfast that morning we found where we stood with each other and what we thought things could look like moving forward depending on what we both agreed was the best course We didnt make any solid plans or decisions and didnt want to rush into something that would ruin the good we already had going for us but Ill admit I was hoping for a specific outcome There was one comment on that first post that had really caught my attention To paraphrase they told me to think about how I would feel if someone else got to see Gwen do her happy mug dance instead of me and it hit me so hard I didnt mind the idea of someone else seeing her so happy I just dont know if anyone she dates would notice what I did and decide to do what I did What if they didnt care or didnt think it was that important or any of the other things I do to make her laugh or smile I really didnt like the thought of not being there to make sure she has that extra reason to smile in the morning Gwen wants me to admit that Im a sappy moron because I teared up writing this Im a sensitive man in touch with my emotions and you know you love it so shut it you squinting_face_with_tongue To all the people saying its possible for platonic relationships to be like ours you are absolutely correct Our friend group is very open with physical and verbal affection and we help each other all time with big and small things We all say I love you to each other its just normal communication for us as a group not just between Gwen and I Honestly if I hadnt made my original post Im not sure when or if we would have gotten to the point we are now Maybe we would have continued as we were and that would have been just as happy of an outcome just a different one like a choose your own adventure with multiple options for a good resolution Which brings me to the actual update Gwen and I agreed we want to try dating We arent putting a new label on our relationship yet but our first date is next week Im making it all a surprise Gwen helped write this post and will be reading the comments so I cant give any details but its going to be the best first date she has ever been on or Ill eat my candy corn patterned socks I think she might be the one for me and Im going to take every chance I can to make sure she thinks the same about me Yall are the best and we love you Do something kind for your loved ones for us and everyone can and should find something to happy dance about it makes life more fun Love Gwen and Peter pink_heartspider_web,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 22:17:28 UTC,5947,370,0.98,,Positive,0,0

1j4f39s,Is my relationship doomed,I 25M have been with my gf 26F for 3 months now and I dont know if Im overthinking this and self sabotaging my relationship or if there are larger issues As I mentioned in another post weve disagreed about washing rice before and someone gave me some solid advice about how to talk to her about it I felt we had a positive and productive conversation but it all started because she got mad that I washed the rice for a certain dish Shes also recently got upset with me over a project she asked me to tackle just assembling a lamp we bought at the store I made the mistake of trying to screw in a screw that had a defect and got stuck She wasnt screaming or anything but she was upset that I tried to use it anyway I got it out and replaced it and the lamp turned out well She has childhood trauma to do with strict parents who would severely punish her if she didnt do things the exact way they wanted and so I think she gets stressed when something isnt going to plan I feel like an idiot when these sort of things happen Theyre such simple mistakes easily avoided and yet I make them Shes also been stressed with her kitten that still needs to get spayed shes been in heat alot and she yells at the cat when she wont be quiet I think this isnt right and have tried gently mentioning that her cat is just doing what cats do and she needs to try and ignore her I made a larger mistake the other day when I asked to try her THC vape She said that beginners should always be in a safe place and try to relax I asked in jest do I feel safe here And she asked the same I thought about it a bit and promptly got distracted by other thoughts I have ADHD and sometimes this sort of thing happens Im still ashamed of it because when I realized I trailed off and said I do feel safe here She made a a comment stating That took a long time for you to figure out I didnt respond I knew I got distracted and I started silently panicking thinking I do feel safe here but nothing I say now will convince her I wouldnt have tried the THC if I didnt I wouldnt leave my knife at home if I didnt I wouldnt be with her if I didnt but I gave some lame excuse about thinking too deeply about it and tried to laugh it off I feel like an idiot She makes me happy Shes important to me Im worried that her trauma will drive us apart I dont know what to do to work through this,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:51:13 UTC,0,3,0.33,,,0,0
1j4f34n,I only now realize that I was badly bullied in school,I graduated last year and am now atending a university The diffrence is astonishing I realized that the behavior I had to endure was way more off the charts than I thought I am transgender ftm and autistic In my old class was another autistic kid whose autism presented diffrently from mine Funny enough I was always excluded and people didnt like me for being weird and missing out on social clues But when I got diagnosed and received accommodations that was me getting favors and faking autism for attention I know of some rumors that were spread about me but I have no clue how or who started those Apperently I was a lesbian never was and some were convinced that I would get mad and loud when I get missgenderd I dont know why anyone believed that since I did get missgendered quite often and literally only corrected the people with a hey sorry it is actually him or sth One kid in particular seemed to have it out for and said some homphobic stuff though he only did it when I wasnt present others snithed or he thought I wouldnt hear him He actually once ran up to me while carrying a knife A joke surrrreeee My class loved jokes They would act as if they were jerking off in the back of the room or say something rather loudly etc when I held presentations I always went to the teachers and asked for help No one ever helped me Some wanted to but had to catch them in the act which wasnt that easy and the other teachers didnt seem to care enough Though every adult always reassured me that I would be fine and nothing would happen to me I wasnt the easiest kid to be around since I literally learned how to be nice in 10th grade and sucked a great deal before and during that learning But I was always willing to reflect and talk about my misstakes I am now in a much better place Everyone respects me and I feel comfortable learning again Though I am starting to feel angry that this extreme behaviuor was ever permitted and given space at that school I love some of my teachers they were the kindest people I ever met and helped me greatly Others not so much Bullying really sucks and I needed to get this off my chest,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:51:03 UTC,0,0,0.5,,,0,0
1j4f0wx,Im crushing on this girl and its only deepening,I 25M got this gorgeous girls number at a bar last Saturday she and I had this amazing and absolutely fluid conversation before I invited her and her friend to join my table where my friends sat It was extremely enjoyable and she and I were flirting backandforth mind you Ive hardly flirted with anyone since my ex cheated on me sometime ago Before she and her friend left for another bar I asked for her number but I quickly told her If youre not comfortable with it you really dont have to I just think youre cute and witty and Id love to talk to you more She replies with and this made my smile like an idiot Im not uncomfortable at all I was waiting for you to ask Got her number wish her a great rest of her night and we separate to our respective friend groups Then I text her the following afternoon and since then weve had these fantastic flirty and personal conversations Heres the issue She doesnt text back too often Let me preface this by saying I know people get busy or preoccupied or even forget to text others back but Im talking hours on hours without a response from her When she does she immediately reciprocates my energy and the conversation returns to being wonderful This isnt an attempt of mine to gripe all things considered I just find myself feeling like a high school with a crush again she genuinely makes me grin like a fool and fills my stomach with butterflies More than anything I want to talk to her Of course I busy myself while she isnt responding and try not to think too hard on it while Im occupying myself but I really pray she texts back soon Im tempted to ask her to FaceTime if shes cool with it because of how greatly I want to keep talking to her,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:48:27 UTC,8,12,0.9,,,0,0
1j4eq01,Rant for my Anger Stage of Grief,I still wish he would come back dont get me wrong That hasnt disappeared just yet and I suspect it wont for a little bit I started doing dance classes again and my first couple of classes were hard I hadnt danced in awhile and the emotions were still heavy In fact I went home and bawled in my roommates arms because I was just hit with memories of my favorite routine of chatting with you after class and looking forward to being with you online when I got home But the drive was hard and not quiet since I had a comfort song blasting and me just yelling into the car how much I loved you and what an idiot you are to walk away I had another class just yesterday and I felt incredibly good doing it since it was a familiar choreo I smiled I was proud of myself I laughed with my friends And when I got out I felt angry I was angry because I disliked how you made me feel hurt unseen invalidated and frightened during our breakup Angry that you decided to give up Im not going to try to convince you to stay so okay Ill go Especially since youd do that explosive reaction again with the justification being you had no choice to in order to be heard Ya know my counselor said thats what people who do the abuse in abusive relationships say If only she didnt do trigger then I wouldnt of hitscreamedthrowetc her I know youre not abusive though I know youre flawed and that response is something you can work on if you recognize it to be I wanted to do that with you I wanted to work me On us But no you gave up and walked away And although I know we had good times I now notice a lot more things in our relationship that werent that great Things I wish a partner would do for me The slow roll into complacency How I feel fooled being charmed by you That I tell you how I feel when Im in some mood is not your responsibility to fix and to please let me figure out how to make myself feel better and Ill tell you But no you make yourself take responsibility anyways and feel bad about yourself and frustrated at me when you cant solve it right away What the hell Dont you listen And I tell you my love language is words of affirmation and I barely hear any compliments from you I dont remember the last time you called me beautiful or cute I dont ever remember you telling me you appreciate me unless I ASK or do it first by giving you all my words of praise If youre proud of me or happy Im yours I said those things to you all the time The random I Love Yous because I feel it in that moment Things I brought up Id like to do but it gets overlooked and forgotten and then you get mad at me when I try to remind you and more angry when Im sad you dont remember And how I see you were also not telling me things that made you irritated and let build up but fault me for being the only one who does it I also told you Im scared youd talk to me like you talk to your parents You gave me that wtf face like youd never And yet there you were screaming at me assaulting me with words trying to blame me and all your what about you arguments Also how we agreed to disagree early on in a convo before our fight that giving someone the same energy they give you is a choice and can be potentially hazardous in a relationship Especially during an argument Communication is important but whats the point when you assume your partner is intentionally attacking you when its anything but I shouldve known better I shouldve known when I saw those signs Youre so frustrating How did I deal with all that And you know whats more frustrating ITS ALL SOLVABLE They were things we could work on Things we could put out onto the table talk about our grievances and set out a plan to address them I think at one time I said maybe we should see a Couples counselor to better understand each other but that was swept aside I know I can be frustrating too I know it do things that make you mad But no one deserves to be treated the way you treat me during arguments You once brought out something in me that made me hate myself in an argument All because it was so heightened and just not healthy because I was trying to match your energy I hated it I dont like being so angry Id say things I regret and would hate myself for later along with the fact Im sure it hurts you Why would you want that dynamic Why are you okay with that Its unhealthy How did it feel when I said I felt hurt attacked and frustrated like you but didnt want to scream or escalate things so I cried instead You probably thought I was pathetic And so fine Go find someone else who can match your energy without feeling shitty about themselves and about hurting you Find someone who argues the same way you do and see how disrespectful exhausting and hurtful it is Because thats not what I want,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:35:59 UTC,1,0,0.67,,,0,0

1j4egl8,My brother passed away 5 years ago today at the age of 18 this is that story,Im not sure if this is the right sub but i need an outlet to post this anonymously when i was 14 my brother passed away suddenly he was born with HLHS Hypoplastic left heart syndrome which is a rare congenital heart defect in which the left side of the heart is severely underdeveloped He had many surgeries as a child which i wont get in to but the important thing to note is that from the ages of 718 he was physically fine sure he sweat a lot and slept more the most teens but nothing extreme in February 2020 he got sick his livers started failing he would faint randomly and when they got it checked out it turn out he was in heart failure however he started taking new meds and was seemingly improving one night at the beginning of March he and my sister had a baking contest and both made desserts we tasted them and ranked them his chocolate mousse won by a landslide i had the grand idea of putting whipped cream on the back of my hand and hitting it into the air and the trying to catch it in my mouth me and my siblings all tried it and my brother laughed so hard his face turned blue it was a night filled of laughter and jokes thats the last time i saw himalive the next morning both of my parents went out to work which was unusual because my mother works from home and was my brothers primary caregiver i stayed home from school for a reason i cant remember now at around 10am my father called me to check on my brother who wasnt answering his phone and to make sure he takes his meds while still on the phone with my dad i go to my brothers room when i walk the smell hits me like a ton of bricks but my father was rushing me so I tiptoe over to his bed and i see him with his eyes rolled back and mouth slightly agape i tried to shake him but his skin was cold and thats what i noticed his arms were a deep shade bluish purple i told my dad to call the EMTs because my brother was not waking up i remember drinking water unlocking the door and waiting in the living room emts burst through the door professional looking people running in and out of our small apartment and then the rush slowed down i wasnt informed on much and i was nervous to interfere now there are more professional people running in and out with my small apartment although now some were patiently waiting for my father to arrive and since my mum wasnt answering her phone oblivious to her only sons passing all i could do is wait i remember feeling awkward and unsure of what to do with all these personnel in my home so i just kept offering everyone water and snacks but they would just look at me with sad eyes and politely decline I was only 14 so there were some issues of them telling me things but after about an hour while My Father was on his way a kind man with a thick southern drawl sat me down he informed me that my brother had passed away by the looks of it he had already been gone for quite some time I responded with an understanding nod i didnt cry I remember when My Father came home hearing the news and holding back tears I let the professionals do the talking while I sat in my room my Father joined me and I held his hands while the police questioned us Ill never forget the whale of agony my sister let out when she got home and heard the news the rest of the day is a blur his funeral was the next day and rained and hailed so hard my shoes were soaked through to my socks I had a complicated relationship with my brother but at the very least Im glad that he died at home in the comfort of his own bed and not in a hospital bed hooked up to machines and wires he hated the hospital its so incredibly hard and painful especially since five years ago was a different world He passed away right before Covid lockdown started happening it feels like i knew him a lifetime ago sometimes I forget his face and struggle remember what he looks like and it scares me because its only been five years and statistically speaking I have around 70 more years to go every family event is painful all days of celebration and holidays are surrounded with this dark cloud that feeling that theres someone that isnt here that should be here I hope this post is coherent im after a long day at work feel free to ask anything in the comment if anything needs clarification,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:25:42 UTC,10,2,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCEDEATH,0,0

1j4e57g,Hooked up with moms friend,tldr My moms friend helped me through a tough time and get into college We got really close and weve been hooking up since No one knows She worked with my mom They grew close over the years and became even closer the summer before I left for college because my parents were going through a nasty divorce She threw me a birthday party when my parents were too busy fighting in court to remember She made a big effort to be there for my mom and by proxy she was also there for me We grew close because she would bring over dinner and eat with me drive me places pick me up and bring me home and even helped me with school My mom picked up another job to help pay for the divorce lawyer so she was gone a lot She helped me prepare for my college interviews wrote me references and connected me with people she knew Most nights shed feed me dinner clean up and make sure I was home instead of out partying then lock up our house and sometimes sleep there on the couch or my moms bed until my mom got home I always was attracted to her since she was younger than my mom but still had that fit work out milf type of look I would check her out often and even use her as the focal point of my masturbation It got to the point where I snuck into her laundry basket a few times to check out her used lingerie We grew closer and talked about sex It started from her giving me advice on navigating the dating world and a girls perspective I felt comfortable with her helping me figure out these social situations since she is young and attractive I just figured she understood I complained about girls friends anxiety She was a great listener and I would love receiving comforting hugs from her I would always get aroused from talking with her about things One night when we hugged she felt my hard arousal accidentally press up against her but nothing happened My fantasy was just that a fantasy until I went to college My parents were still dragging the divorce out so she graciously helped me shop pack and even dropped me off It was only 45 mins away from home I wanted to go further away but Im just lucky to even get into college with all the stress Her texts were often and short so it wasnt unusual for us to be casual with each other One night I got really drunk and texted her pretty late thinking she wouldnt get it until later in the morning I mentioned how I thought about her during random hook ups or masturbation Well to my surprise she replied and we engaged in a little back and forth This happened a few times over the course of my first semester and I did try to push the flirting boundaries when we talked about intimate things It usually started with reminders for me to practice safe sex and then lead to talking about sex in general I could tell she was really careful about being intimate with me A few times it slipped into flirty territory There was a blizzard as everyone was leaving for winter break I could have taken the train but I texted her that I didnt have a ride home because I wanted to spend time with her It was late and the storm was pretty bad by the time she dropped me off She insisted that shed come in and make me dinner At some point a bottle of wine was consumed She mentioned that my mom was working until 10pm that night so she stayed up with me to watch a movie We ended up talking about all the things that happened that semester and I admitted to her her my lack of confidence with girls I joked that if only I could get some practice in real life instead of watching porn I could find the clit Well one thing led to another and we spent a lot of break together Since coming back to school shes been driving here and getting a hotel for us once a week Im afraid that I wont like girls my age anymore after this and that shes making it so fun and easy that Im not making an effort to meet girls my age Not really sure what to do but needed to get this off my chest Its just nice having someone to have sex with so easily instead of putting in effort to flirt play games go out drinking and risking being with a random girl,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:13:00 UTC,0,2,0.33,,,0,0
1j4e234,I 30M have the biggest crush on my coworker 35F and I cant stand it,Ive worked with this woman for about 4 years Weve traveled together on business several times Ive always been a pretty shy guy but am especially cautious when socializing with women I work with I try to be myself but not act in a manner such that they could feel uncomfortable basically Im afraid of flirting because I want to be a good human being and also keep my job When Im with this woman its pretty chill We chat about our travels and places we want to go She occasionally tells me very personal things one time she randomly told me she had an IUD after we were just sitting in silence for a few seconds Anyway I think shes great Shes very smart and successful We both make 140k at basically the same job She owns her own house but Im not quite there yet Shes funny cute and very fashionable The little things like the way she paints her nails neat like a professional does them for her on the daily and wears her hair are so unique and attractive Sometimes things feel fantasy like when were traveling together We might both reach for the temperature controls in the car at the same time because the AC is too cold and touch hands We say the same things at the same time and have the same thoughts when a random event happens in front of us Sometimes she would say interesting things like if it was appropriate Id invite you to stay at my house because the office is far for me and close to her Or if I talked about moving shed get excited and joke that I could be her neighbor I always wondered if she was attracted to me but she shows mixed signals Shes a very smart woman so its possible she thinks the same way I do and doesnt want to jeopardize her career Shes had boyfriends on and off and Im not even sure what her current status is I feel like in an alternate reality we would be the perfect couple But in this reality well just be coworkers who live a couple hours apart Its frustrating Ive never been sexually active before because Im waiting for someone who electrifies me as much as she does to truly desire me and to be in the right situation for it Thats hard to find TLDR just a dumb man crushing on a coworker Update I dont think I can ask her out Messaged her at work today to ask how things have been and the conversation felt one sided I cant deal with the humiliation embarrassment and fear of her getting freaked out by me doing so,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 21:09:36 UTC,170,157,0.9,,,0,0

1j4cb0j,FINAL UPDATE I went on a date with my exhusband last night,Update from this post My 35M exhusband 36M and I recently reconnected I wont go over the details of why we split or our reconciliation since Im sure the average redditor can click buttons and most likely read He was the one taking me out and promised that it would in his words knock my socks off to make up for his neglect of me He sure as hell delivered A little backstory weve been together since we were 15 and 16 respectively and have never moved out of our hometown This year would have been our 20th anniversary of getting together not marriage We were dating secretly for about five years before our parents caught us one day during summer break The fallout from finding out their son was gay actually made his parents split His dad wanted to send him away to conversion therapy Hes seen his father maybe once per year on average and every time hes incredibly cold towards me Would never refer to me as his soninlaw only my husbands pal I wonder why Anyway not what youre here to read Ill get on with the lore He picked me up from the house and wouldnt tell me where we were going but told me to dress warmly He ended up taking me to the place where we met a run down ice skating rink in our town He used to do hockey and I spent some time trying to learn figure skating until people started beating me up for it Both sports would practice at the same time and I remember barely being able to keep my eyes off him We went skating I tried to pull off a few of the moves I remembered he only had to catch me from falling on my ass once or twice and I wont complain about an attractive man that I love hooking his arm around my waist and we spent an hour or so there until our feet hurt At one point I said that my face was getting cold so he skated around in front of me and placed his gloved hands on my cheeks to warm me up I just about burned a hole in the ice from how hard I was blushing I swear to God He wasnt done then We left and went to dinner specifically the restaurant where we had our first date Its a cheap holeinthewall place seeing as we were poor teenagers when we first met We chatted and ate food that probably took 5 years off our lives he was an incorrigible flirt and even held my hand underneath the table like he did all those years ago I know I said I never stopped loving him and I stand by that but I think I somehow fell in love with him a thousand times over again during that meal At the end of dinner he asked if I had energy for one more simple thing to which I agreed He took me a while out of town to a dark sky zone park specifically the one where he proposed to me ten years ago He set out a blanket to sit on and another to cuddle under and we went stargazing all bundled up together You never know how much you miss the sound of someones heartbeat until you havent heard it for so long We shared a bottle of sparkling grape juice in plastic champagne flutes and dumb giggly kisses It felt so similar yet so different He told me in a moment of quiet that he loved me and oh God It took everything I had not to cry I barely hesitated before asking if he wanted to change venues He seemed surprised but eagerly accepted I ended up at his place as some of you may have seen from my edit on my second post yesterday I wanted to take it slower than this but it was so hard to I was so starved of affection and hadnt been intimate with anyone for just about six years Im gonna keep what happened at his between us but all Ill say is that his medication was no issue and all of you should be jealous I woke up in his bed this morning reached over for him and pulled him close just like I used to do I havent been this happy in a long time We had a sleepy discussion and decided to get back together but were not using the term boyfriends It just feels weird after all this time So hes my partner or my lover Hes mine Thank you reddit Wouldnt have done it without a little push from the internet Lets see where all this goes,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 19:58:59 UTC,108,20,0.99,,,0,0
1j4bxql,The only thing I will ever regret,Hello everyone I 20m miss my 19f exgf so much When we first met eachother 2 years ago everything was perfect We were in love and having good times no matter what We were long distance about an hour and 30 minutes from each other and we hated it but it never mattered The more days that went by the more in love we were At the time I was struggling with really bad paranoia and I quit my job and ran away to go live with her I left my family and most importantly my grandmother behind I wanted to show her everything I wanted was with her and her only but I think that was one of the worst decisions we made during our relationship We were only together for 23 months at the time and I stayed with her brother while she lived with her mom and step dad We started spending every second together and it was just getting even better but we started getting aggravated with eachother more I eventually got a job 12 months after moving in with her brother Then things started to pick up again probably because of the motivation of going to work and getting money to spend on her She never cared about the money I did its the only way I knew how to prove my love Her mom and step dad were both alcoholics and abused eachother quite often and they really werent a fan of me for some reason They got in a fight one night and started treating my ex wrong so I stepped in and pulled her out of that situation before she got hurt and I took her to taco bell at 3am After that we started fighting a whole lot more because money was getting tight and it was the only thing that made me feel stable I wasnt comfortable living with her brother at all and was starting to wish I never moved in We started getting more and more distant until the day she got me a cat A beautiful baby and I named her Honey She was the sweetest thing ever and it brought me and my ex closer than ever Then I got kicked out of her brothers for unknown reasons I just had to be out by the weekend so I called up my family for some help and me and my ex moved into a camper with some of my distant relatives We were still arguing and growing more distant but we worked out some of the problems but it just wasnt enough We ended up moving back in with our families separately and only seeing eachother on the weekends but going from living with eachother for over a year and then all of a sudden splitting apart again brought some issues My trust issues got very very bad and I started with my outbursts and starting arguments for no reason We both did and we would blame eachother for everything I broke up with her and got back with her multiple times I started running from our problems and coming back expecting it to be the way it was when we first got together but it never turned out that way I started focusing on myself and what I could do to be better for her I tried so many things and so many ways but I could never find a way that worked and made us both happy I wanted it to work out so much but she got fed up with me and blocked me on everything I broke her heart so many times and lied to her because I didnt wanna admit I was wrong I miss her so god damn much and wish I could go back in time to fix things I want to hold her one more time I want to give her all the affection she deserves I wish I payed a little bit more attention to her and put myself to the side for once My only regret so far in life I wish I treated you a little bit better Peyton If by any chance you find this and read it just know Im still trying my best and not giving up just for the chance I get to love you like I should have Honey was the best thing we ever had and youre the only other person that I share those memories with You have her kitten and I miss getting to see her Youre my fucking soulmate Peyton and I will never love anyone else like I love you If my life ends with you not by my side then it was all a waste My life will have no meaning,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 19:43:50 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j4b2z1,Im Leaving for College Soon But Its breaking me apart,This also gon be long i cant help it i am literally crying as i typed this TLDR Im leaving for college soon and while Im excited Im struggling with the thought of leaving my mom behind Weve always been close since my dad works overseas but lately Ive been unintentionally pulling away getting irritable and saying things I regret I thought distancing myself would make leaving easier but it only hurts more Seeing how much my mom will miss memade me realize I dont want to leave things on a sour note I keep having vivid dreams about my departure and the guilt of how Ive treated her is overwhelming I want to fix things before I go but I dont know how Im moving away for college in a few months and as excited as I am for this new chapter I cant stop thinking about how much Im going to miss my mom Shes been my biggest source of comfort my whole life and since my dad works overseas weve always had a strong bond But now that Im getting closer to leaving I feel this huge mix of emotions that I dont know how to deal with Lately Ive noticed myself pulling away a littlenot intentionally but I think its my way of trying to make leaving easier Instead its just making me feel worse Ive been more irritable and I hate that Ive raised my voice at times when I never used to I always used to listen to her life stories even if I had heard them countless times her rants too whenever she shouted for reasons I wasnt even wrong But now I am talking back to her get angry on her and say awful things when she tells her stories I say they are boring and please shut up I dont know why I am doing this I still want to listen to her rants and yapping but I am not able to I am going into that angry zone and I have done many mistakes I havent even apologized properly and that weighs on me Its like Im watching myself act this way but cant stop I know this is all part of growing up but the thought of leaving her behind even temporarily is really hard I dont have many close friends so my mom has always been the one I could talk to But over time I started keeping things to myself thinking I shouldnt burden her with my problems I used to be able to just rest my head in her lap and cry when things got hardwhen I got bullied when I felt alonebut I havent done that in years It makes me sad because I feel like Ive lost that connection a bit and I dont want to leave things this way And now when I probably need it the most I feel like I cant show her the weak side of me that I have long pretended to have erased The other day something happened that really got to me My mom was taking a nap and before sleeping she had asked me to grab some groceries While she was resting my little sister was joking around and said He left for college and my mom suddenly started crying in sleep She thought I had already gone I was still at home but seeing that broke me I rushed to get the groceries but I was tearing up the whole time It made me realize just how hard this is going to befor both of us and precisely the reason I was trying to distance myself from her that she doesnt grieve much but no now I feel that she will cry more that I left and our relation were sour and not mended I genuinely want to say sorry right now but I am stuck and I am going crazy At night I keep having vivid dreams about the day I leave and they feel so real I do have genetic hyperphantasia from my mom that too that I wake up feeling broken Every time its like Im reliving the moment before it even happens I know mom must be having those dreams too It makes me feel so helpless because no matter what I do that day is still coming I was going to leave this January but postponed it to August because in January we were close to ripping each other off that level of arguments But now things are settling down but still it isnt back to what it was last year I know I have to go and I know my mom wants the best for me She always encourages me and Im so grateful for everything shes doneraising me taking care of me making sure I dont feel alone I do feel but I pretend I dont to not hurt her I do have suicidal thoughts sometimes but I hold back that it will all fall into place soon however indefinite the soon is I just want to spend these last few months showing her how much she means to me and making good memories before I leave I just want to do the right thing but I feel so lost I thought distancing myself would help but it only hurts more Idk how to leave without hurting my mom How do I say goodbye without breaking her heart All of these are constantly revolving in my mind and Im going crazy I still have a few months but I dont know how Ill manage I want to mend things But I am thrown into my guilt For those whove gone through something similar how did you make the transition easier How did you make sure your mom knew how much you appreciated her before you left I dont want to take this time for granted and Id love to hear any advice on how to make these last few months meaningful for both of us I know now that pushing my mom away wont make leaving any easierif anything itll only make it worse I tried to make her love me less so she wouldnt hurt when I leave but all I did was create more pain for both of us I dont want her to remember our last months together with regret I just want to fix things before its too late And lastly Just to clarify this is about my bond with my mom as a parent nothing else Were Asianif I ever even thought otherwise shed personally set me straight with a slipper and more ultimate weapons My dad works overseas but is always present calling daily morning and night and supporting her even more than I do listening to her rants and all I love my mom because shes always been there for me and Ive supported her in return She doesnt rely on me for happinessI rely on her I know I have to leave one day but I just want to make things right before I go,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 19:09:23 UTC,1,0,1.0,,,0,0

1j4an82,I loved her but I was never enough,One night at a bar I met her She was different Beautiful poetic full of life in a way I hadnt seen before She looked at me like I mattered and for the first time in a long time I felt seen We worked in the same company but had never noticed each other before that night From that moment on my life revolved around her We werent officially together but we acted like we were Shed come over almost every night wed talk for hours fall asleep in each others arms It felt real It felt worth fighting for But she kept saying she wasnt ready for a relationship I told myself to be patient to wait until she healed from her past But months passed and nothing changed Every time I tried to define what we were she pulled away And yet she always came back She had a drinking problem I picked her up from bars when she was too wasted to get home I held her hair back when she was sick tucked her into bed made sure she was okay I cleaned up the messes she madeliterally and figuratively And still I wasnt enough She had a kid and I got along with her so well I ignored the fact that she still lived with her exhusband in the same apartment One night after yet another drunken call she told me she had kissed another guy A few months later she admitted she had slept with her ex And yet I stayed Not because I had no selfrespect but because I loved her Because I convinced myself that maybe love was enough But it wasnt I convinced myself we werent dating I guess she convinced me too The night she finally agreed to date me it wasnt out of loveit was out of guilt Because I cried in front of her Because I was breaking Because she saw what she was doing to me It wasnt the kind of love I wanted It wasnt real And yet I held on for months hoping things would change They didnt I should have left the first time she hurt me I should have walked away when she made it clear I was just convenient But I didnt And it cost me more than I ever imagined I dont know why Im writing this Maybe just to get it out of my system Maybe because deep down I still love her Or maybe I just need someone to tell me that it wasnt my fault,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 18:52:30 UTC,2,1,1.0,,,0,0

1j4a10l,In an instant I saw two lives change forever in two completely different ways,I have been trying to process and work through what I saw yesterday but it has been really hard The event itself was a lot but now Im dealing with the whys which make me feel guilty since what happened has nothing to do with me I was just a witness I tried writing through it but it hasnt been enough so Im trying again thinking that if I get it in front of others I can start to live past it Yesterday evening I was sitting on this big rock while I was waiting for the bus A little ways down the road there was a taxi van He was either backing out or adjusting his Uturn but obviously reversing and not moving super fast From where I was sitting I didnt see how fast the bike courier was going when he hit the front side of the van And the biker immediately went under the front wheel of the van and I could hear him and his bicycle crunch under the tire The position the biker was on the ground was how he stayed for the whole 20 minutes that he was out there He never moved So Im almost positive he died during the collision or if there was some way he survived he could have been fully paralyzed But there werent many people to see the accident head on like I did A man in his Jeep came out and a few security from the booth around my stop is near a campus came out to help They checked for signs of life and directed traffic around him and had someone call 911 Police came and did much of the same The fire department came and started doing CPR but they didnt take off the mans helmet The ambulance came and I didnt see any defibrillator or adrenaline unless they did those things in the back once they loaded him on the gurney and took the man away But even after they put him in the ambulance it didnt leave or take off There wasnt a rush It felt like I was out there for two hours but it all happened in about 20 minutes And its hard to think about the collision and how if the biker hasnt passed away Im sure the injuries will last a lifetime And I think about the taxi driver who just sat in the van with his head down and how he will most likely lose almost everything because of an accident I dont know why I had to see it but I did and I dont know what to do with it if anything at all,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 18:28:08 UTC,6,2,0.88,,CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCEDEATH,0,0

1j49dv1,I think my perception of a healthy relationship is whats sabotaging them,Most of my perception comes from observing from my parents relationship They love each other a lot and spend pretty much all of their time together However there are times when my mom feels a bit smothered by my dad and this has led to arguments in the past but I would say that overall she enjoys spending most of her time with him Ive even tried inviting her to different events but she would often turn me down to spend time with my dad I feel like this has led me to create an unrealistic expectation that my partner and I should be spending a lot of our time together A few of my partners have told me that they felt smothered or that I was never satisfied with them Was it a matter of different needs or was I truly doingexpecting too much Or is it a little bit of both People say a relationship is supposed to feel easy or natural in the beginning but its never felt that way for me I have to be doing something wrongwhether its not communicating well enough expecting too much from my partner or not setting firm enough boundaries for myself or maybe all of the above,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 18:02:26 UTC,1,4,1.0,,,0,0
1j499mz,Im finally free of him,I 22F broke up with my boyfriend 20M of 6 months on new years of 2024 I broke up with him for a plethora of reasons including him accusing me of stealing 500 him accusing me of cheating him proposing how he treated me him telling me he was going to commit suicide and it was my fault and much more For the record I didnt do any of the things he accused me of Well it didnt end at the breakup This specific individual is in the military and most of our relationship was long distance He sent me death threats after the initial break up which I did contact the police and his commanding officer about I told him to leave me alone and blocked him However for the year of 2024 he had his friends that live where I live follow me and threaten any guy I was seeing into breaking up with me he constantly messaged me on different numbers saying words coated in honey to try to get me back and he even showed up to my house when he was on leave One of the many reasons I broke up with him was that he was home for Christmas of 2023 and refused to see me and I got really upset because I still loved him at that time I have now learned through therapy that it wasnt love I was just caught in the web Well Christmas of 2024 came around and he was back on leave and he had his mom message me telling me that he was going to commit suicide if I didnt show up I told her to leave me alone and it was of course an empty threat maybe even a test He left after that and apparently according to his mom he was deployed Well I got a text on my birthday February 4th saying that he still loved me and yada yada which went ignored and then I got a call from his military base Apparently he had went missing in action and I was his beneficiary I havent heard anything from him since but I feel free finally I have a date this week and Im going to see if anyone threatens my date into ending it with me I kinda feel bad that I was so harsh but I also think it was survival I think that if I was any less harsh it wouldve been a lifetime of pain for me,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 17:58:07 UTC,5,5,0.73,,CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCEDEATH,0,0

this from happening again the cameras went up all over the shop Absolutely no blind spots crystal clear HD camers we know this because our boss has a TV screen above his desk now where he can watch all the cameras He can have up to 8 of the camera feeds on his screen at one time and it has the ability to cycle though all of the feeds switching feeds every few minutes The problem came about a week ago when a coworker of mine came up to me and told me there was only one feed on the screen Me at my machine I have never been written up or even talked to about problems with my work so I was very thrown off by this When I had the opportunity where I could think of a reason to go into his office to see for myself when I walked in his office sure enough I saw my empty station on the screen I pretended not to notice and just asked a question about a part I was working on that could be a reasonable question and went back to my work like nothing was wrong Over the next week or so I tried to put it out of my mind but I couldnt get past it and more coworkers approached me and said they saw me on the screen So late last week I went to HR and asked if I was in trouble for anything The HR guy looked surprised and asked me what I was referring to and I told him how closely Im being watched and it seems to be just me singled out He said he would look into it and get back to me but as far as he knew there was nothing wrong About an hour later I get called into the managers office with HR screens are back to normal showing 8 different work areas Im happy for a second until I am asked why Im spreading misinformation I ask what theyre talking about and I proceed to be gaslighted for the next 5 or so minutes about how the cameras have always been this way and Im seeking attention I say multiple coworkers have mentioned to me about seeing it and we can bring them in to ask They threaten to write me up if I keep bringing up this blatant lie and that Im slandering the manager to my fellow coworkers I contact a lawyer cause at this point Im like fuck it Im going to quit this job anyway might as well raise a little hell but then part of me decides its just not worth it and with everything Ive been through lately its just not worth it I decided to contact my ex who Ive been broken up with for a year and fill him in We were together for 5 years and hes the love of my life about a year ago he was offered his dream job across the country and asked me to go with him My mother was dying of cancer at the time and I was the only one she had left to take care of her He planned on turning down the job to stay with ne but I told him Id never forgive myself if he passed on his dream job for me About 6 months ago my mother passed and idk why I didnt contact him but it kinda felt like my whole world fell apart so I just accepted this was my life now When I told him what was going on he said why dont you come move in with me I didnt know it but he hadnt dated anyone since we broke up and neither had i because he had always planned on us reuniting after my mother passed and when she did he didnt want to rush me cause he wanted to wait until I was ready I wasnt ready at all until he asked me that question but without hesitation I said yes I put in an application that day at a CNC shop near where he lives and that was yesterday So thats where this post was going to end on am I over reacting for picking up and moving across the country And then the phone rang Apparently the place I was hiring was impressed with my years of experience and theyre a newer shop so I actually have more experience running a brake then most of their employees They offered my about a 25 raise of what Im currently making and I accepted on the spot They asked when I could start and I said next week Immediately called my boss and told him hes a fucking creep and that I quit HR has been calling me nonstop begging for me to reconsider but that ship has sailed Ex bf or possibly just bf again said hes excited for me to move in but will be setting me up in a separate bedroom at first just so we can take things slow and figure things out which I think is very smart of him and Im glad cause I think we need that time too My current landlady is an absolute sweetheart and knows how rough this year has been for me so shes letting me break my lease with no penalties and she already has someone lined up to take my apartment I asked if they wanted to buy some of my furniture since Im only taking what I can fit in my truck and they offered me a thousand buck for my living room set and all my drawers and dressers Not having to worry about all that I can fir the rest of my stuff in my truck easily and Im starting my cross country trek tonight Fuck creeps and if

1j45av7,Coworker shared with me that her niece is being molested and no one is doing anything about it,This happened two years ago and I still cry when I think about this I had a coworker at one point who had very thin boundaries she would consistently causally trauma dump at work without regard to how it affected others and mostly coped with her trauma through drinking Im fairly certain she was drinking at work but never saw her take swigs Just saw her acting intoxicated and smelling like alcohol I grew up with an alcoholic parent so her behavior was fairly uncomfortable for me to be around meaning I did not get close to her even though she shared many very private things with me I almost wish I had invested in her more just so I would know more about her family maybe I would have had enough information to intervene if I had befriended her One day her niece came in to work with her This little girl was probably about 5 When she walked in the door she had her hands cupped around the sides of her face so she could only see the ground in front of her She made no eye contact and would not verbally respond to anyone including her aunt This was the angriest child I have ever seen She glared at everyone held her hands in fists for almost the entire time she was there stayed completely silent and kept her back to the wall for the majority of the time she was in the shop Ive been through a lot of trauma therapy and it was very obvious to me that this child was hypervigilant if not in fight or flight After the child was picked up by another family member I stepped outside for a smoke My coworker the aunt of the child was already outside smoking I sat down next to her and she casually said to me my niece told her friend that someone licked her hooha It was like cold water had been dumped over my head as she told me more about it I felt so sick for so many reasons A FIVE YEAR OLD told their friend that someone licked their private parts that friend told her mom who told my coworkers nieces parents And no one was doing anything actionable No therapy no intervention no questions Just shrugs and hope thats not actually happening After my shift I called child services and went to the police station by my work I tried everything I could to get a report filed a welfare check done literally anything Because I didnt have the name of the childs parents the police AND child services told me I didnt have enough information to complete a report I called so many times with different ideas of how I could make a legitimate report but I simply didnt have enough information I think about this multiple times a week sometimes every day for the entire day I myself am someone who survived CSA I have complex trauma and I know what its like to be a child in a setting where no adults are protecting you even when they know whats going on Our boss commit suicide that same week so everything at that work place became even more chaotic very quickly I left because I could not cope with the instability Part of me wishes I had stayed just to garner more information but that work place was so toxic that I started to experience suicidal ideation I had to leave for my safety Now that Im farther removed from the experience I feel like I could have pulled myself up by my bootstraps and stayed long enough to get more info for the sake of this little girl Im not sure why Im sharing this Yesterday this popped up in my head for the millionth time and I had such a strong reaction to the memory that I vomited I will never be able to get the image of that little childs angry face out of my head I dont think Ill ever forget her and I will always wonder if there is something I could have done to help,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 15:14:05 UTC,9,6,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j42ewg,It feels like I was SAd even though it probably wasnt sa,The whole thing happened over 10 years ago and I had actually repressed the situation pretty well until my ex messaged me again recently Now I think about it every day and have panic attacks because of it Back then we werent together yet but he knew that I was in love with him One evening we were at his best friends place and the two of them were smoking a bong They wanted me to smoke as well I asked what it was and they said weed Being stupid I took a hit but whatever it was it definitely wasnt weed At first I got extremely dizzy then I couldnt move anymore and I started panicking inside because I couldnt speak or even breathe After about 10 minutes his best friend told him to check if I was still breathing which he did When he confirmed that I was still breathing the other guy left the room to go to sleep Thats when my ex started undressing me and then had sex with me It must have lasted for several hours and towards the end I was somewhat conscious again and could have said something But I didntI just couldnt At some point he stopped and I went home I had never felt as horrible lying in my own bed as I did after that night Afterward I desperately wanted to be with himprobably because I thought it would somehow undo what had happened About a year later we actually got together But maybe Im overinterpreting the situation After all he knew I loved him so maybe he thought I wanted it too Ill probably talk to my therapist about it but Im afraid Im making it into something bigger than it actually was Besides it was my fault too I dont know I just wanted to get it off my chest,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 12:55:19 UTC,0,4,0.25,,CONTENT WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT,0,0

1j428ri,My dad passed away two days ago due to alcohol abuse,I posted on here about four months agoyou can go read my other post before this one if you want My dad had Cirrhosis of the liver due to years of alcohol abuse He was diagnosed with it back in September of 2024 and has been in and out of the hospital since then It started off with his liver failing and slowly went to his kidneys starting to fail His feet legs and stomach were pretty much always full of fluid that he was constantly needing to go get drained and he was always in pain He went into to hospice about a week ago and one of his last wishes were to be at home so my grandparents had the hospital bed and all the equipment set up at there house Once he was at home In hospice he went down hill really fast He was confused most of the time and the rest of the time he was sleeping I got a call from my grandfather around 830am on Monday that I needed to get over there as fast as I can because they didnt think he wasnt going to make it much longer I got over there around 1030am and honest to god wasnt prepared for how horrible he looked He went down hill so fast His oxygen levels were at 30 and his heart rate was 45bpm My grandma cranked up his oxygen and was able to get it back up to 94 His eyes were open but you could tell he really wasnt seeing anything He could hear us but couldnt talk he could hardly breatheevery breath he took was a gasp and then nothing for a second and then a gasp again All the immediate family was there talking to him to let him know that we were there and that we loved him It got to the point where we couldnt even get a BP reading on him and his finger monitor for his O2 and HR werent getting readings as well He passed away about four hours after I got there on Monday March 3rd at 202pm Him taking his last breath will forever be stuck in my head Thank you to whoever decided to read this I just really needed somewhere to write down what happened It still doesnt feel real,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 12:45:46 UTC,83,22,1.0,,CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCEDEATH,0,0

1j41czf,My boyfriend 26 M was cheating on me 19 F I feel Im actually losing my grip on reality,For the context our love felt more beautiful than anything Id read in books or seen in movies deeper and more real in a way thats hard to explain Part of it was because we both had real trauma growing up which made us so similar We bonded so purely and beautifully expressing our truest selves to each other It was more than I ever couldve dreamed of Even our first kiss after nearly a year of waiting was unlike anything else the world didnt just feel like it stopped it did We trembled overwhelmed and he cried like babies as he kissed me tears streaming down his face Thats how strong our connection was I never wanted long distance so he promised hed move to my city but he never did mentioning financial reasons Still he visited every few months and we always looked forward to those moments He even deactivated his socials on his own though I never had any problem or concern with them Of course not everything was perfect His one toxic trait whenever things didnt go his way or we argued hed start disrespecting and insulting me It was a dealbreaker but I still tried to be understanding He had no real human connections all his life He never even got to talk much to his family because of it being dysfunctional no close friends zero experience in relationships I told myself he just cant do any better or could be because BPD runs in his family or maybe because of the traumatic environment he grew up in But now for the last four months things were rough We even broke up for a few days ironically after our first intimate experience I felt insecure or anxious afterward he was my first boyfriend and I have a bit of sexual trauma too but he misunderstood it assuming I didnt like it or didnt want it again After that he changed became indifferent stopped reassuring me and didnt seem to care about the relationship at all or even if we break up It reinforced my fear that he didnt feel the same anymore trapping us in a cycle of blame and misunderstandings I had spent so many nights crying during that time He eventually felt sorry and we fixed things but I had already noticed a red flag he seemed to care about physical intimacy more than anything and shut down when he thought he wouldnt get it So then I started noticing more During this rough phase he reactivated his accounts made new ones and never mentioned even after we patched up and tried to hide them when asked It also started needling me for the first time that why had he never added me on his instagram and its been so long were together and I once saw a text from a coworker that felt off I couldnt ignore it all anymore So I decided to have a sudden intense conversation with him hoping his reactions would reveal the truth Then his reactions did reveal A lot Not just cheating or anything but about his whole identity I started asking he was so confident with his grand words and said that I can have his passwords and his phone because he knew Id never do that I dont believe in invading privacy in a relationship He kept manipulating me into believing there was nothing and I almost fell for it he was that good But then we stumbled upon the conversation with his coworker He initially refused to let me see it then tried to manipulate the situation When I finally read it I noticed he had tampered with it The last text had originally been 12 weeks ago but now it showed 17 weeks ago And then the part that made my heart sink them talking about how fun it would be when he will move to Germany and how she would be waiting for him That explains why he was so obsessed with moving to Germany for his remote job just to connect and work together with all his coworkers there Those texts were from months ago right after he started that job Now five months in i believe they must have something concrete going on Its pretty clear from the way he provided no further clarifications when I saw that and refused to show anything else they converse usually on discord which he didnt even show But what struck me even more than the cheating was seeing in real time how good he is at manipulation My friends warned me but I never believed it He seemed too purehearted But that day I saw it how effortlessly he lies Ive never seen anyone lie that efficiently Even when I was trying to ask he turned down all of my questions with so great replies that I started feeling like What am I even thinking He was even at that time making a grand gift for my birthday It included multiple handmade beautiful gifts including a giant scrapbook different boxes each with 50 different kinds of letters and tapes in it for different situations and a painting which he painted himself He was even better with words the things he said and the way he made me feel Its driving me insane How can someone be that person and be cheating at the same time For an example he kept repeating that he wanted to move here to strengthen our relationship that I was his life dream that after being with me he needed nothing else from life But now hes moving for her instead Its giving me a complete identity crisis If hes really this good at manipulation like I saw yesterday then none of his words were real His entire personality was fake He was standing there so willing so confident about giving me passwords or proving his loyalty But the moment I actually asked he changed completely He stalled started arguing and gaslighting clearly anything to buy time He tried deleting chats right in front of me thinking I wouldnt notice thinking he could gaslight me again Maybe he was too frantic to cover his tracks this time but it was so obvious This time he was maybe too much in a panic to realise how evident his manipulation is or to control what Im thinking And I know the coworker thing is just the one thing I happened to catch The way he deleted other chats before giving me a bit of an access it all proves there was so much more happening in those months Until now This has traumatized me to the point where I feel like nothing is real Like Ill wake up and everything around me will be gone like everything is in my head I know this is just the trauma speaking and hopefully Ill be okay soon But it has shaken me to my core If this is true then everythinghewas a lie How can someone be so convincing so manipulative For the first time in my life Ive seen deception on this scale and its terrifying In a nutshell I observed so big of a contradiction between what he is portraying so confidently and the real truth And now I dont know who he is,TrueOffMyChest,2025-03-05 11:54:22 UTC,0,48,0.5,,,0,0
